Gabbard rose to prominence for his successful effort to pass a 1998 amendment to the Constitution of Hawaii to give the state legislature \\"the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples\\" under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Gabbard, who was born in American Samoa, is the first person of Samoan descent to serve in the Hawaii Senate. Early life and education Gabbard was born on January 15, 1948, in Fagatogo, American Samoa, one of eight children of Aknesis Agnes (Yandall) and Benjamin Harrison Gabbard, Jr, a Samoan of American ancestry. Mike Gabbard is of Samoan and European descent from both his maternal and paternal ancestry. He was a U.S. citizen from birth because of his father's U.S. citizenship. Gabbard lived in Hawaii as a child and graduated from Choctawhatchee High School in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He studied at San Francisco State College and obtained a degree in English from Sonoma State College in 1971. He earned a master's degree in community college administration from Oregon State University. Early career In the 1970s and early 1980s, Gabbard was a guidance counselor and later Assistant Dean of Instruction at American Samoa Community College. He also worked as a head tennis pro at the Kuilima Hyatt Resort on the North Shore of O'ahu in the late 1970s. From 1983 to 1987, Gabbard worked as headmaster and teacher at Ponomauloa School in Wahiawa, Hawaii.https://www.mikegabbard.com/content/mikes-biographical-information From 1988 to 1992, Gabbard and his wife owned The Natural Deli, a vegetarian health food restaurant in Moiliili, Hawaii. Gabbard closed the restaurant following picketing by activists after Gabbard said on his self-funded radio show, \\"Let's Talk Straight Hawaii,\\" on K-108, that \\"If [two applicants] were both the same, then I would take the one that is not homosexual.\\" In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Gabbard and his wife worked for state Senator Rick Reed. In the early 1990s, Gabbard and his wife were listed as teachers for the Science of Identity Foundation. Gabbard and his wife later started Hawaiian Toffee Treasures, a candy company in Honolulu. Activism =LGBT rights opposition= Between 1991 and 1996, Gabbard founded the organization Stop Promoting Homosexuality Hawaii (renamed Stop Promoting Homosexuality International), Stop Promoting Homosexuality America, and the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values. Gabbard became well known for his advocacy for Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998). This amendment, approved by voters 69.2‚Äì28.6%, gave the state legislature \\"the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples\\" under the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) signed by Bill Clinton in 1996. =Other activism work= Shortly after 9/11, Gabbard founded Stand Up For America (SUFA), a non-profit educational organization. In 2007, Gabbard co-founded the non-profit Aloha Parenting Project (APP) with his wife Carol. Political career Gabbard was elected to the Honolulu City Council in a nonpartisan race in 2002. In 2004, he ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Second Congressional District of Hawaii in the United States House of Representatives, losing to state Representative Ed Case. On March 21, 2006, Gabbard announced his plans to run for the Hawaii State Senate in West Oahu's District 19, a seat then held by 14-year incumbent Senator Brian Kanno, who decided not to run for reelection. On November 7, 2006, Gabbard defeated retired Honolulu police captain George Yamamoto by a 56% to 44% margin to represent the district in the Hawaii State Senate. Gabbard was sworn in on January 17, 2007. Gabbard, who was born in American Samoa, became the first person of Samoan descent to serve in the Hawaii Senate. On August 30, 2007, Gabbard switched from the Republican Party of Hawaii to the Democratic Party of Hawaii. His stated reason for doing so was that he believed that he could be more effective to his constituents as part of the majority party in the State Senate, where Democrats have long had a supermajority. On November 2, 2010, Gabbard was re-elected for a second term to the Hawaii State Senate after defeating Republican Aaron Bonar by a 74% to 26% margin. He was the Chair of the Energy & Environment Committee from 2009 to 2015, culminating with his leadership on the passage of a first-in-the- nation law to require Hawaii utilities to get 100% of their electricity from clean, renewable energy sources by 2045. On November 6, 2012, Gabbard defeated Republican candidate Dean Capelouto, 72% to 28%, to represent the newly reapportioned Hawaii State Senate District 20. During the 2016 election cycle, Gabbard was unopposed and was re-elected to the Hawaii State Senate for a four-year term on November 8, 2016. Political positions Gabbard opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions. He believes marriage should only be between a man and a woman.https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/tulsi- gabbards-father-i-never-realized-how-much-trauma-i-put-her-through In 2016, while serving as the Chair of the Water, Land, and Agriculture Committee Gabbard authored a bill banning sales of parts and products of endangered species.

He is currently the Chair of the Agriculture and Environment Committee. Personal life Mike and his wife Carol Porter were married on December 27, 1968 in East Grand Rapids, Michigan. Porter elected and served from 2000-2004 on the Hawaii State Board of Education. A socially conservative Catholic, Gabbard serves as a lector at St. Jude Catholic Church in Makakilo, Hawaii.

They most frequently occur in the small intestine, particularly the ileum, but can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. They may be cystic or tubular in conformation. The condition of having duplication cysts has been called intestinal duplication. Symptoms and signs Symptoms depend on the location of the duplication. Duplications occurring high in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. esophageal) may cause difficulty breathing due to compression of the airway. Lower gastrointestinal duplications (e.g. duodenum, colon) can be associated with abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, a palpable mass, vomiting, or may cause bowel obstruction. Smaller lesions can act as a so- called \\"lead point\\" for intussusception. Diagnosis Treatment Duplications are usually removed surgically, even if they are found incidentally (i.e. not causing symptoms or encountered on routine studies for other reasons), as there is a high incidence of complications resulting from untreated cases. Cysts are often technically easier to remove than tubular malformations since tubular structures usually share a blood supply with the associated gut.

It is synonymous with the main campus of University College Dublin. Belfield is close to Donnybrook, Ballsbridge, Clonskeagh, Goatstown and Stillorgan and takes its name from Belfield House and Demesne, one of eight properties bought to form the main campus of University College Dublin. It is adjacent to the R138 road. History Belfield was one of the original sites suggested as a possible location for Dublin Airport before Collinstown was chosen. Nowadays, Belfield is synonymous with University College Dublin, being the location of that institution's main 132-hectare campus. University College Dublin (UCD) dates back to its foundation at 86 St. Stephen's Green in 1851 as the Catholic University of Ireland founded by John Henry Newman who was its first rector. In 1934, UCD bought Belfield House and from 1949 to 1958 purchased a group of adjoining properties to form a potential campus estate. In 1960, the Government recommended that the College move from the city centre to Belfield. The first buildings to be completed on the new campus were those of the Faculty of Science in 1964. The other faculties moved to Belfield on a phased basis as their new buildings were completed, although as of 2007, parts of a few remain in Dublin city centre. Additionally, the Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business is based on the remainder of the Carysfort (former School of Education) campus in Blackrock. Amenities The site also includes Belfield office park, with a large, international Hewlett-Packard call centre, and a sports ground, The Belfield Bowl, at which the UCD soccer and rugby teams both play in the top divisions of their respective leagues. The area is served by the college's numerous media outlets including newspapers, the College Tribune and the University Observer, radio station Belfield FM and television station the College Television Network. Business There are several 'office parks' located in Belfield, including Belfield Office Park, Beech Hill Office Park, Clonskeagh Drive. Some of the companies located here include Hewlett-Packard (until 2008 most call centre activities were based in HP's Belfield Office Park), Ericsson,Jobs at Ericsson Ireland visited November 15, 2009 Smurfit Kappa (head office), and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The compound bancorp (banc/bank + corp[oration]) is often used to refer to these companies as well.  United States  In the United States, a bank holding company, as provided by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ( et seq.), is broadly defined as \\"any company that has control over a bank\\". All bank holding companies in the US are required to register with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. =Regulation= The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, under Regulation Y () has responsibility for regulating and supervising bank holding company activities, such as establishing capital standards, approving mergers and acquisitions and inspecting the operations of such companies. This authority applies even though a bank owned by a holding company may be under the primary supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. =Bank holding company status= Becoming a bank holding company makes it easier for the firm to raise capital than as a traditional bank. The holding company can assume debt of shareholders on a tax free basis, borrow money, acquire other banks and non- bank entities more easily, and issue stock with greater regulatory ease. It also has a greater legal authority to conduct share repurchases of its own stock. The downside includes responding to additional regulatory authorities, especially if there are more than 2,000 shareholders (note: prior to the Jobs Act or Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, the shareholder number was 300), at which point the bank holding company is forced to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are also added expenses of operating with an extra layer of administration. =2008 credit crisis= As a result of the global financial crisis of 2008, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) successfully converted to bank holding companies in order to gain access to liquidity and funding.

The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI Darjeeling) was established in Darjeeling, India on 4 November 1954 to encourage mountaineering as an organized sport in India. The first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953 by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary sparked a keen interest in establishing mountaineering as a well-respected endeavour for people in the region. With the impetus provided by the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, HMI was established in Darjeeling. Narendra Dhar Jayal, the pioneer of Indian Mountaineering, was the founding principal of the institute. Tenzing Norgay was the first director of field training for HMI. The buildings for the Institute were designed by the architect Joseph Allen Stein, then teaching at the Bengal Engineering College near Calcutta. It was the first building in a career in India that lasted half a century. HMI regularly conducts Adventure, Basic and Advanced Mountaineering courses. These are very comprehensive courses. They are also highly subsidised to encourage mountaineering as a sport.

Life Holden was born in the village of Hurlet near Glasgow. He was largely self-educated: his formal education was often disrupted. He was apprenticed for a short period as a draw boy for two hand weavers, but attended grammar schools run by the 'Old Radical' John Fraser. He became a pupil teacher and then sought to become a Wesleyan Minister, before teaching at schools in Slaithwaite and Leeds. In 1829 Holden obtained a post at the Castle Academy in Reading, Berkshire. It was here that he developed a version of the Lucifer match, but his invention was superseded by John Walker of Stockton-on-Tees in 1827, who did not patent the invention. The following year Holden returned to Scotland to set up a night school in Glasgow, but after a brief period of teaching he moved in 1830 to become a bookkeeper at Townsends' worsted factory in Cullingworth near Bingley. Transferring to the technical side and becoming a manager, he spent his time at seeking to improve the process of combing wool. Holden left Townsends in 1846 to set up a factory making Paisley Shawl middles at Pit Lane in Bradford. When the business failed two years later he formed a partnership with Samuel Lister. They worked together to develop the square motion wool-combing machine, which was patented by Lister in 1848, although Holden had drafted the patent. The origins of the machine became the subject of a lifelong dispute between the two men. Holden comb Combing machine at Bradford Industrial Museum In 1848, trading as Lister & Holden, Isaac Holden set up a factory at St Denis near Paris, where over the next few years he perfected the square motion machine. He then set up factories in France, at Croix near Lille and at Reims, run by his nephews Isaac Holden Crothers and Jonathon Holden. In 1857 he bought out Lister and the firm was renamed Isaac Holden et Fils. In 1860 he and his sons, Angus and Edward, set up an experimental factory at Penny Oaks in Bradford and then in 1864 they opened the massive Alston Works at Bradford. By the 1870s Holden's factories in England and France had become the largest wool combers in the world. He celebrated his success by building a large Italianate mansion at Oakworth near Keighley in Yorkshire. As a leading Wesleyan, Holden's philanthropy was largely concentrated on building Wesleyan chapels. He pledged ¬£5000 to build 50 chapels in London. In 1865 Holden was elected to serve as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Knaresborough from 1865 to 1868, and later for the Northern West Riding of Yorkshire from 1882 to 1885 and for Keighley from 1885 to 1895. In his political life he campaigned for electoral reform, church disestablishment and Irish Home Rule. In 1893, at the age of 86, he was created a Baronet, of Oakworth House in the County of York. Holden died in August 1897, aged 90, and was buried in Undercliffe Cemetery, Bradford. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Angus Holden. His daughter Margaret had married Alfred Illingworth who succeeded him as MP for Knaresborough. In 1908 his son was raised to the peerage as Baron Holden. Oakworth House burned down in 1907Houses by Kate Lycett accessed 28 Mar 2016 and in 1927 its grounds were given by the family to the people of Oakworth as a public park. It is called Holden Park.

Although often confused with the doctrine of direct effect, direct applicability refers to the fact that regulations require no implementing legislation within individual member states - they take effect as soon as they are published by the European Commission. This confusion is perhaps explained by reference to the treaty provision governing regulations which provides that they, and only they, have direct applicability within the member states. The early jurisprudence of the ECJ suggested that 'direct effect' was a consequence of direct applicability as it was thought that the drafters of the original treaty intended regulations, and only regulations, to be directly effective. However, the expansion of the doctrine of direct effect to include directives and other measures served to create a distinction between direct applicability and direct effect.

The group is dedicated to historically informed performance.  Founding and program  Collegium Vocale Gent was founded in 1970 by a group of friends studying at the University of Ghent, on Philippe Herreweghe‚Äôs initiative. They were one of the first vocal ensembles to use new ideas about baroque performance practice. Their authentic, text-oriented and rhetorical approach gave the ensemble the transparent sound with which it would acquire world fame and perform at major concert venues and music festivals of Europe, Israel, the United States, Russia, South America, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.  Repertoire  Collegium Vocale Gent in May 2011 Collegium Vocale Gent has grown organically into an ensemble whose wide repertoire encompasses a range of different stylistic periods. German Baroque music, particularly J. S. Bach‚Äôs vocal works, quickly became a speciality of the group. The group performs this music with a small ensemble in which the singers take both the chorus and solo parts. Collegium Vocale has specialized more and more in the Romantic, modern and contemporary oratorio repertoires. To this end, Collegium Vocale Gent enjoyed the support of the European Union‚Äôs Cultural Programme since 2011. The result is a shared symphonic choir recruiting singers from all of Europe, in which experienced singers perform alongside young talent. Moreover, Collegium Vocale Gent fulfils an important educational position.  Collaboration  Besides using its own baroque orchestra, Collegium Vocale Gent has worked with several historically informed instrumental ensembles, including the Orchestre des Champs Elys√©es, Freiburger Barockorchester and Akademie f√ºr Alte Musik Berlin. It also works with prominent symphony orchestras such as deFilharmonie (Royal Flemish Philharmonic), the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Budapest Festival Orchestra and Amsterdam‚Äôs Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The ensemble has worked with Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Sigiswald Kuijken, Ren√© Jacobs, Paul Van Nevel, Iv√°n Fischer, Marcus Creed, Kaspars Putnins, Yannick N√©zet- S√©guin and other leading conductors. The vocalists of Collegium Vocale Gent are trained by Christoph Siebert who has also conducted performances at international festivals. Collegium Vocale Gent enjoys the financial support of the Flemish Community, the Province of East Flanders and the city of Ghent. From 2011-2013 the ensemble has been Ambassador of the European Union.

Recruited from the Katholische Jugend (Catholic Youth), later from journeymen and teacher organisations, it formed an opposition to both to the nationalist Heimwehr forces and the Social Democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund. The Christian Social politician Kurt Schuschnigg was its \\"Reichsf√ºhrer\\". Founded in Innsbruck, Tyrol, the Ostm√§rkische Sturmscharen spread over the entire Austrian territory when the association's headquarters were relocated to Vienna in 1933. The organisation then comprised about 15,000 members according to their own figures, though it never became very popular. Nevertheless, in Lower Austria they incorporated the local Heimwehr and received massive support from the Austrian Bauernbund (Farmers' League) organisation. The Bauernbund chairman Leopold Figl, post-war Chancellor of Austria, acted as Lower Austrian \\"Landesf√ºhrer\\". On the eve of the Austrian Civil War, the M√§rkische Sturmscharen increasingly adopted a Catholic clerical fascist and antisemite stance. Martial sports and military training became fundamental, and the association began to deploy paramilitary task force formations. Engelbert Dollfuss, Austrian chancellor since 1932, attempted to strengthen them as a counterweight to the radical Heimwehr forces. Sturmscharen troopers also participated in the violent suppression of the Schutzbund revolt in February 1934. After the Austrofascist Federal State of Austria was established in 1934, Schuschnigg became chancellor upon Dollfuss' assassination during the Nazi July Putsch and the Austrian right- wing paramilitary forces were gradually absorbed by the Fatherland Front (Vaterl√§ndische Front, VF) unity party. On 11 April 1936, the Ostm√§rkische Sturmscharen declared themselves a cultural organisation, hence the final merger of all defence forces into the VF by decree of Chancellor Schuschnigg in October was for them merely a formality. After the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, some former members of the Sturmscharen engaged in resistance to Nazism.

First coming to attention in the 1970s during the underground comix movement with Barefootz, he was the founding editor of Gay Comix in 1980, created the gay- themed strip Wendel during the 1980s, and reached a more mainstream audience in 1995 when an imprint of DC Comics published his graphic novel Stuck Rubber Baby. Early life Cruse was born on May 2, 1944 raised in Springville, Alabama,Comics Buyer's Guide #1485; May 3, 2002; Page 29 the son of a preacher and a homemaker. His earliest published cartoons were in The Baptist Student when he was in high school. His work later appeared in Fooey and Sick. He attended high school at Indian Springs School in (what is now) Indian Springs, Alabama, and college at Birmingham-Southern College, where he studied drama. Cruse worked for about a decade in television. In 1977, Cruse moved to New York City, where he met Eddie Sedarbaum, his life partner, in April 1979. They married after moving to North Adams, Massachusetts.Howard Cruse, \\"Stuff About Me\\", Howard Cruse website Career Cruse's cartooning first attracted nationwide attention in the 1970s, when he contributed to underground comix publications. His best-known character from this period was Barefootz, the title character of a surreal series about a good-natured, well-dressed young man with large bare feet. Although dismissed by many underground fans as overly \\"cutesy\\", others found it a refreshing change of pace from \\"edgier\\" comix. Cruse depicts himself in the story \\"Death\\", from Eclipse Magazine issue 1, May 1981, displaying both his \\"cutesy\\" style (the Barefootz cover) and the mid-range cartoony style typical of most of his work before Stuck Rubber Baby. Cruse had been open about his homosexuality throughout the 1970s, but aside from having a gay supporting character (Headrack) in Barefootz, did not acknowledge it in his work. This changed in 1979, when publisher Denis Kitchen asked him to edit Gay Comix, a new anthology featuring comix by openly gay and lesbian cartoonists. For much of the 1980s, he created Wendel, a strip (1‚Äì2 pages per episode) about an irrepressible and idealistic gay man, his lover Ollie, and a cast of diverse urban characters. It was published in the gay newsmagazine The Advocate, which allowed Cruse substantial freedom in terms of language and nudity, and to address content such as AIDS, gay rights demonstrations, gay-bashing, closeted celebrities, and same-gender relationships, with a combination of humor and anger. Two collections of these strips have been published, as well as an all-in-one volume. Cruse spent the first half of the 1990s creating Stuck Rubber Baby, a 210-page graphic novel commissioned by editor Mark Nevelow for his DC Comics imprint Piranha Press but eventually published by DC's Paradox Press. It is the story of Toland Polk, a young man growing up in the American South in the 1960s, and his growing awareness of both his own homosexuality and the racial injustice of American society. The book features Cruse's most detailed and realistic comics art and his most serious and complex storytelling. It received numerous awards and nominations. Cruse briefly wrote a column in a comic book review magazine, Comics Scene, under the rhyming masthead \\"Loose Cruse\\". Cruse contributed to the queer comics anthology series Juicy Mother, edited by Jennifer Camper, which first appeared in 2005 and then in 2007. In August 2009, Howard Cruse self-published From Headrack to Claude, a collection of all his gay-themed strips accompanied by commentaries on his career and life, including the never-reprinted 1976 Barefootz story where the character Headrack came out, and some unpublished stories. On March 17, 2010, an original one-off titled Lubejob penned by Cruse was published in Nib-Lit Comics journal. In 2011, Cruse's The Complete Wendel was republished by Rizzoli's Universe Books imprint. Cruse was chosen as a keynote speaker, alongside Alison Bechdel, for the inaugural Queers & Comics conference in 2015. Howard Cruse died on November 26, 2019 from lymphoma in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Shortly before, it had been announced that a 25th anniversary edition of Stuck Rubber Baby was scheduled for publication from First Second Books. Publications * Cruse, Howard.

He served as the seventh President of Portugal between October 5, 1923 and December 11, 1925. Personal life Manuel Teixeira Gomes was born in Vila Nova de Portim√£o, son of Jos√© L√≠bano Gomes (from Mort√°gua), and wife Maria da Gl√≥ria Teixeira, born in Lagoa, Ferragudo. A wealthy landowner, his father was also an important dried fruit trader, a much travelled man, who had been educated in France and witnessed the 1848 revolution, had republican leanings and had been Belgian Consul in the Algarve. Teixeira Gomes attended the Col√©gio de S√£o Lu√≠s Gonzaga, Portim√£o, and the Coimbra seminary. At the age of 16 he enrolled at the University of Coimbra to study medicine, but he abandoned studies one year later and moved to Lisbon, where he established closed ties with local intellectual circles (namely Fialho de Almeida and Jo√£o de Deus). After completing military service, he went to Porto (1881), where he became friendly with Sampaio Bruno, Bas√≠lio Teles, Ant√≥nio Soares dos Reis and others. Together with Joaquim Coimbra and Queir√≥s Veloso he founded Gil Vicente, a theatrical newspaper. He also wrote for Primeiro de Janeiro and Folha Nova. In 1891 his father and other partners had set up a company called \\"Sindicato de Exportadores de Figos do Algarve\\" (Algarve Fig Exporters Union), which lasted three years. Manuel was told to find markets in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. He travelled extensively, toured Europe and lingered in Italy. He extended his cultural horizon by wandering through North Africa and Asia Minor. The company was closed but father and son continued the business on their own. Soon their success meant that they had to enlarge their market to new areas that were familiar to them, North Africa and the Middle East, but meant that Manuel had to travel nine months of the year, returning to Portugal only during the fig picking season. After 1895 he established new contacts with the literary circles of Lisbon. Through Fialho de Almeida he met Marcelino Mesquita, Gomes Leal and others. Alfredo Mesquita, Lu√≠s Os√≥rio and Ant√≥nio Nobre encouraged him to publish his first book, O Invent√°rio de Junho, which came out in 1899. Due to his father's deteriorating health and advanced age, he spent longer periods in Portim√£o. During this time, he published Cartas sem Moral Nenhuma and Agosto Azul, in 1904, Sabrina Freire in 1905, Desenhos e Anedotas de Jo√£o de Deus in 1907 and Gente Singular in 1909. After he resigned his presidency on December 11, 1925, on the pretext of poor health, he went into voluntary exile on December 17, 1925, travelling to Oran, Algeria, and never returned to Portugal. In 1931 he moved to Bougie, where he lived the rest of his life, always opposing the authoritarian Estado Novo regime. He had two natural daughters by Belmira das Neves (August 5, 1886 ‚Äì January 26, 1967), daughter of fisherman Jo√£o de Deus and wife Quit√©ria das Dores, named Ana Rosa, who was born in Portim√£o and married Jos√© Calapez, also born in Portim√£o, and Maria Manuela, who was born on September 7, 1910 and married Jos√© Pearce de Azevedo (born and died Portim√£o). He intended to marry her but his parents did not allow him to do so. Politics A devout republican, he collaborated with the daily newspaper A Lucta, edited by Brito Camacho. Following the implantation of the republic he was invited to be Portuguese Minister in London. In April 1911 he travelled to England and presented his credentials to King George V on October 11, serving as plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom (1911‚Äì1918, 1919‚Äì1923). Gomes managed to ingratiate himself thoroughly with the British Foreign Office, acting as the principal negotiator for all matters relating to Portugal. He gave particular attention to problems concerning the Anglo-German negotiations on the division of the Portuguese colonies. At the formal request of Great Britain, he cooperated with the Portuguese governments regarding the Portuguese participation on the war. Teixeira Gomes returned to Portugal in January 1918 and was put under house arrest during the dictatorship of Sid√≥nio Pais. He returned to diplomacy after the fall of Sidonist regime and became minister to Spain (1919) and then again to the United Kingdom (1919‚Äì1923). He was a member of the Portuguese Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference (1919‚Äì1920) and an unsuccessful candidate of the Democratic Party (Partido Democr√°tico) at the presidential elections of August 6, 1919 won by Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida. He was a delegate to the League of Nations, serving as Vice-President of the General Assembly (September 6, 1922 ‚Äì September 30, 1922) and was elected in- absentia President of the Republic (August 6, 1923), arriving at the port of Lisbon on October 3, 1923. During his term Teixeira Gomes made unsuccessful attempts to combat terrorism and suppressed at least four major revolts (1924‚Äì1925) organized by radicals and the military. He was constantly harassed by the Nationalist Party and, unable to manage political crises, he resigned on December 11, 1925 on the pretext of poor health. He went into voluntary exile on December 17, 1925 and died in Bougie in 1941.

History The hotel was built by the Upper Egypt Hotels Co, an enterprise founded in 1905 by Cairo hoteliers Charles Baehler and George Nungovich in collaboration with Thomas Cook & Son (Egypt). It was inaugurated on Saturday 19 January 1907, with a picnic at the Valley of the Kings followed by dinner at the hotel and speeches. The architect was Leon Stienon, the Italian construction company G.GAROZZO & Figli Costruzioni in Cemento Armato, Sistema SIACCI brevettato. During World War I the hotel was temporarily closed to paying guests and employed as a hospice for convalescing soldiers. A regular guest at the hotel from 1907 on was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, better known simply as Lord Carnarvon. Carnarvon was the patron of Egyptologist Howard Carter, who in 1922 discovered the intact tomb of Tutankhamun. After the discovery was announced the Winter Palace played host to the international press corps and foreign visitors there to follow the story. Carter used the hotel's noticeboard to deliver occasional news and information on the discovery. In 1975 the complex was expanded with the construction of the New Winter Palace. The addition, classified as a 3-star hotel, was joined by corridors to the original. It was demolished in 2008. In 1996, the Pavillon, a 4-star annex with 116 rooms, was built in the rear garden of the Winter Palace, close to the swimming pool. The Pavillon shares many amenities with the Winter Palace, including the gardens, pools, tennis courts, terraces and restaurants. The hotel is owned by the Egyptian General Company for Tourism & Hotels (\\"EGOTH\\") of Egypt and managed by Accor, a French Hotel company, where it is part of the prime division Sofitel. The Hotel is featured on the exclusive Palace Hotels of the World. The Winter Palace has 5 restaurants. The 1886 Restaurant, which serves French cuisine, is named after the date the hotel inaccurately advertises that it was founded. It and the la Corniche Restaurant (international cuisine) are both located in the historic Palace wing. The Bougainvilliers (international cuisine) is in the Pavilion wing, while the Palmetto (Italian cuisine and snacks) and the El Tarboush (Egyptian cuisine) are in the garden close to the swimming pool. Notable residents * George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, a collector of Egyptian antiquities who financed archaeologist and Egyptologist Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922, stayed many times at the Winter Palace. * Albert I (1875‚Äì1934), King of the Belgians and his wife Elisabeth (1876‚Äì1965), Duchess in Bavaria, Queen of the Belgians, stayed many times at the Winter Palace. *Agatha Christie wrote Death on the Nile while staying at the hotel * Violaine Vanoyeke wrote many books while staying at the hotel . She always stays at the winter palace when she works in Luxor.  In popular culture  In 2004, it was used for the adaptation of Death on the Nile.http://investigatingpoirot.blogspot.com/2013/08/episode-by-episode-death- on-nile.html  See also  * PS Sudan References External links *Sofitel Winter Palace Luxor Hotel official website *Pavillon Winter Luxor Hotel official website *Grand Hotels of Egypt Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1907 Category:Hotels established in 1907 Category:Hotels in Egypt Category:Sofitel Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide Category:1907 establishments in Egypt Category:Luxor ","title":"Sofitel Winter Palace Hotel"},{"id":"918193","text":"Figl is a surname.

History and profile The Baghdad Bulletin was first published on 9 June 2003. It was one of an estimated seventy newspapers that were launched in Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein after the US- led invasion of Iraq. The founders were Ralph Hassall, a British journalist, David Enders, an American journalist, and Shadi Alkasim, a Jordanian journalist, and Sebastian Woods-Walker and Mark Gordon-James, both British journalists. David Enders was also the editor. Printed in Baghdad and distributed throughout Iraq, the magazine reported on a variety of issues affecting life during the rebuilding of the country. The Bulletin had the stated purpose of \\"questioning and debating the process and progress of Iraq's redevelopment\\" post-Saddam It strove to overcome an information blackout in Iraq suffered by an increasingly large community of aid workers, journalists, American and British officials, as well as Iraqi English speakers. The magazine had a full-time reporting pool of Iraqis and Westerners, many of whom were young Oxbridge graduates who had previously written for Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Reuters, and the Evening Standard. The publication believed that \\"the presence of a free press offering a forum for all sides is an inalienable human right.\\" It aimed to remain non-partisan and provided a forum for an eclectic range of guest writers to debate issues related to the redevelopment of the country. The format was a mix of news and features, with the first edition focusing on issues such as the gun amnesty, the true extent of crime, and the dilapidated state of Baghdad's electricity supply. Printing of Baghdad Bulletin was indefinitely halted on 15 September 2003 due to financial and security concerns. The magazine published a total of seven editions and its claimed circulation was 10,000 copies. It was mostly delivered free.

Halls The mummy of the 21st Dynasty High Priest of Amun, Masaharta, formerly housed at the Egyptian Museum The museum, located in the former visitor center,http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/nile-valley/luxor/sights/museums- galleries/mummification-museum covers an area of 2035 m¬≤ and contains the following elements: *Hall of artifacts *Lecture hall *Video room *Cafeteria The hall of artifacts is divided into two parts, the first one is ascended corridor through which the visitor could have a look on ten tablets were drawn from the papyri of Ani and Hu-nefer that displayed in the British Museum in London. Most of these tablets throw lights on the funeral journey from death to burial. The second part of the museum began from the end of the corridor and the visitor could see more than sixty pieces, which are displayed in 19 well-advanced cases.

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) is a division of Johns Hopkins University based in Washington, D.C., United States, with campuses in Bologna, Italy, and Nanjing, China. It is consistently ranked one of the top graduate schools for international relations in the world. The institution is devoted to the study of international affairs, economics, diplomacy, and policy research and education. Among the political scientists and economists affiliated with the school are former World Bank Chief Economist Anne Krueger and military historian and former Counselor of the United States Department of State Eliot Cohen. Its students are selected from a large pool of applicants from all parts of the world. The SAIS Washington D.C. campus is located on Massachusetts Avenue NW's Embassy Row, just off Dupont Circle and across from the Brookings Institution and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and next to the Center for Global Development and the Peterson Institute. The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.  History  The Nitze School of Advanced International Studies was established in 1943 by Paul H. Nitze and Christian Herter who were seeking new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the post-World War II world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist. Originally founded as a standalone graduate school, it became a part of The Johns Hopkins University in 1950. The founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where American foreign policy is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.Gutner, Tammi L. The Story of SAIS. Washington, D.C.: School of Advanced International Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1987. In 1955, the school created the Bologna Center in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher- education system. By 1963, Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to its present location on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center was created in Nanjing, China, expanding the school's global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the Newseum building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW and will remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/newseum-to-move-as-johns- hopkins-announces-building-purchase/692/ The school is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.  Organization and academic programs  Campus building on Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. Johns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in Bologna, Italy; and about 160 full-time students in Nanjing, China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries. Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the Bologna Center and the only full-time international relations graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the Hopkins‚ÄìNanjing Center, which teaches courses in both Chinese and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and Nanjing University.See Norton Wheeler, Role of American NGOs in China's Modernization: Invited Influence (Routledge, 2014) online review, on the history of the Nanjing Center The school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of master of arts for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a doctor of philosophy program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year master of arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master's degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its master of arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-degrees/master-arts-ma and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student's regional or functional concentration and international economics. The oral examination and international economics requirements of the master of arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school's education.  Reputation  A study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in Foreign Policy magazine as \\"Inside the Ivory Tower\\" rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University‚ÄìSAIS as the best terminal master's program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master's program at SAIS ranking second globally after the Georgetown School of Foreign Service. Since 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the \\"final four\\" in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as Georgetown University Law Center and the University of Virginia School of Law. SAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University's Thunderbird School of Global Management. Two different SAIS teams won first place in both 2007 and 2008. A joint team from SAIS and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania received second place in the first \\"Global Challenge\\" competition, a first-of-its-kind competition that challenged teams of MBA and other graduate students to develop a public‚Äìprivate venture to support development and the tourism industry in Asia. The competition was organized in 2010 by the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business and the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Annual themes  From 2005‚Äì2012, Johns Hopkins SAIS dedicated a substantive theme for each academic year in order to encourage its students, faculty, academic programs, policy centers, and alumni to examine the role of the particular theme within international affairs. These specific themes provided opportunities for the school to review scholarship and exchange views through special lectures, conferences, and guest speakers. The school hosted public events during the following themes of Energy (2005‚Äì06), China (2006‚Äì07), Elections and Foreign Policy (2007‚Äì08), Year of Water (2008‚Äì09), Religion (2009‚Äì10), Demography (2010‚Äì11), and Agriculture (2011‚Äì12) and enhanced its fundraising with high-profile public events such as the lecture delivered by then‚Äìvice president of BP, Nick Butler, during the Year of Energy in 2005.  Child Protection Project  In June 2009, The Protection Project at SAIS partnered with the Koons Family Institute of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC), creating the Child Protection Project, to draft a model law focusing on the issues of child protection; in particular: \\"neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation\\". The primary objectives of the Child Protection Project are to \\"research existing child protection laws in the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN); convene a series of regional expert working group meetings to establish a common definition for 'child protection'; create a database of national legislation and case law on child protection issues from around the world; and draft, publish, and globally disseminate model child protection legislation\\".Katai de Mello Dantas (August 1, 2011) \\"Protecting Children from Exploitation: Discussions on Creating a Model Law and a Parliamentary Guide\\" , Peace & Collaborative Development Network The drafting process included six expert group meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the U.S. The final version of the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013. It was presented to the members of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child during its 62nd Session in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2013. It was also presented before the 129th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva in October 2013.\\"Panel Discussion (Standing Committee on Democracy and Human Rights) (Geneva, 7‚Äì9 October 2013); The Role of Parliaments in Protecting the Rights of Children, in Particular Unaccompanied Migrant Children, and in Preventing their Exploitation in Situations of War and Conflict\\", Inter-Parliamentary Union\\"129th IPU Assembly; Overview of Main Events and Decisions (Geneva, 7‚Äì9 October 2013)\\", Inter-Parliamentary Union Accompanying the Child Protection Model Law, ICMEC and The Protection Project published a companion \\"100 Best Practices in Child Protection\\" guide in 2013.

It ran from 1984 to 2006. Origin The magazine was first published in 1984 by Debi Sundahl and Myrna Elana, with the contributions of Susie Bright, Nan Kinney, Leon Mostovoy, Honey Lee Cottrell, Dawn Lewis, Happy Hyder, Tee Corinne, Jewelle Gomez, Judith Stein, Joan Nestle, Patrick Califia,Patrick Califia, \\"Raising Cane\\", Out, August 1999, Vol. 8, No. 2, p. 32 Morgan Gwenwald, Katie Niles, Noreen Scully, Sarita Johnson, and many others. Susie Bright became editor-in-chief for the next six years. Later editors included Diane Anderson- Minshall, Shar Rednour, Tristan Taormino, and Diana Cage. On Our Backs defined the look and politics of lesbian culture for the 80s, as well as playing a definitive role in the feminist sex wars of the period, taking the side of sex-positive feminism. The title of the magazine was a satirical reference to off our backs, a long-running feminist newspaper that published the work of many anti-pornography feminists during the 1980s, and which the founders of On Our Backs considered prudish about sexuality.Martha Cornog, Timothy Perper, \\"For sex education, see librarian: a guide to issues and resources\\", Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , p.97 off our backs regarded the new magazine as \\"pseudo-feminist\\" and threatened legal action over the logo OOB.Josh Sides, \\"Erotic City: Sexual Revolutions and the Making of Modern San Francisco\\", Oxford University Press US, 2009, , p.219 Operations In 1985, Sundahl and Kinney spun off the first in a series of precedent-making lesbian erotic videos, called Fatale Video. Distribution of the magazine in Australia began in 1986.Jill Julius Matthews, \\"Sex in public: Australian sexual cultures\\", Allen & Unwin, 1997, , pp.121-122 By the late 1980s, Fatale Media was the largest producer of lesbian pornography in the world. In 1994, the magazine experienced financial problems, and filed for bankruptcy in May 1996. After being bought out by a new publisher, Melissa Murphy (who released only one issue) , it was acquired by HAF Enterprises (publisher of Girlfriends). The original creators moved on to other projects . Publishing In 1996, a photography book based on the pioneering work of On Our Back's artists called Nothing but the Girl was published by Cassell Press, edited by Susie Bright and Jill Posener . End of publication and availability online H.A.F.'s publication of On Our Backs and its sister publication, Girlfriends, both ceased publication in March 2006 after being bought out by the publishers of Velvetpark Magazine.

The later song \\"Comrade Napoleon\\" praises Napoleon and fails to represent freedom at all. This change is used to show the corruption of the principles of the animals' rebellion by Animal Farm's leader Napoleon. Both The Internationale and \\"Beasts of England\\" reflected the principles of Marxism and Animalism, respectively. Their replacement by different anthems reflects how these ideologies were arguably distorted by Stalin and Napoleon and thus had to be replaced and suppressed. The development corresponds to the historical events of 1943, when Joseph Stalin had The Internationale, previously the anthem of the Soviet Union, replaced with a new, more patriotic national anthem. However, while \\"Beasts of England\\" was outlawed in the novel, The Internationale was not banned by the Soviet Union at any time and remained as the anthem of the Communist Party. \\"Beasts of England\\" Flag of Animal Farm. \\"Beasts of England\\", the original anthem of the Animal Farm corresponds to the famous socialist anthem, The Internationale, but also alludes to Shelley's Men of England. In the book, the pig Old Major explains his dream of an animal-controlled society three nights before his death. The song's tune is described in the novel as sounding like a combination of \\"La Cucaracha\\" and \\"Oh My Darling Clementine\\". Alternate melodies: \\"Ode to Joy\\" or \\"Joyful, Joyful, we adore Thee\\" or \\"Come Thou Fount of every Blessing\\" or \\"Ebenezer\\", or \\"Anthem of the Soviet Republics\\". :Beasts of England, Beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and clime, Hearken to my joyful tidings Of the Golden future time. :Soon or late the day is coming, Tyrant Man shall be o'erthrown, And the fruitful fields of England Shall be trod by beasts alone. :Rings shall vanish from our noses, And the harness from our back, Bit and spur shall rust forever, Cruel whips no more shall crack. :Riches more than mind can picture, Wheat and barley, oats and hay, Clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels Shall be ours upon that day. :Bright will shine the fields of England, Purer shall its waters be, Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes On the day that sets us free. :For that day we all must labour, Though we die before it break; Cows and horses, geese and turkeys, All must toil for freedom's sake. :Beasts of England, Beasts of Ireland, Beasts of every land and clime, Hearken well, and spread my tidings Of the Golden future time.Orwell, Animal Farm, pp. 9‚Äì10. The animals sing \\"Beasts of England\\" frequently after the rebellion, especially after meetings. At one point when Clover the horse questions the direction of Animal Farm, she sings \\"Beasts of England\\" which causes the other animals to join in. After \\"Beasts of England\\" has been used to express criticism of the direction of Animal Farm, Napoleon tries to supplant the song, arguing that such an anthem is antiquated and no longer needed after the rebellion has been completed. The anthem is first replaced by the short \\"Animal Farm!\\" and later by \\"Comrade Napoleon\\", while \\"Beasts of England\\" is eventually outlawed. The phasing out of \\"Beasts of England\\" as the anthem of Animal Farm corresponds to the Soviet Union's 1944 replacement of The Internationale with the National Anthem of the Soviet Union. However, while \\"Beasts of England\\" was banned in Animal Farm, \\"The Internationale\\" was not in the Soviet Union at any time and remained the anthem of the Communist Party. Suzanne Gulbin compares the role of \\"Beasts of England\\" to that of the conch in William Golding's Lord of the Flies: it serves to create enthusiasm and unity, and its banning represents the loss of hope for a better life. Florence and William Boos read the fact that the animals continue to sing \\"Beasts of England\\" after it is banned as a testimony to the power of the memory of Old Major. \\"Animal Farm!\\" \\"Animal Farm!\\" is the anthem first replacing \\"Beasts of England\\" after Squealer manages to convince the other animals that the original anthem is not required. Its purpose is to inspire loyalty to the farm, and also to the new leadership. Minimus the poet composes a short, new anthem which starts: :Animal Farm, Animal Farm, :Never through me shall thou come to harm! But it is noted that it does not inspire the animals as much as \\"Beasts of England.\\" Paul Kirschner writes that the switch from \\"Beasts of England\\" to \\"Animal Farm!\\" is a parody of the transition from Lenin's proletarian internationalism to Stalin's \\"Socialism in One Country\\". The song itself is most likely a reference to the State Anthem of the Soviet Union. \\"Comrade Napoleon\\" Flag used in Napoleon's \\"Spontaneous Demonstrations\\". As Napoleon became more powerful, he replaced \\"Beasts of England!\\" with another anthem, again written by Minimus. The anthem praised and glorified Napoleon, attributing many of the successes on the farm to him, even though he had little or no role in them. The poem marked the general happy feeling towards the rule of Napoleon at the time in the book and was painted on the wall of the big barn opposite the Seven Commandments. It was capped by a portrait of Napoleon drawn by Squealer in white paint. :Friend of the fatherless! Fountain of happiness! Lord of the swill-bucket! Oh, how my soul is on Fire when I gaze at thy Calm and commanding eye, Like the sun in the sky, Comrade Napoleon! :Thou art the giver of All that thy creatures love, Full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon; Every beast great or small Sleeps at peace in his stall, Thou watchest over all, Comrade Napoleon! :Had I a sucking-pig, Ere he had grown as big Even as a pint bottle or a rolling-pin, He should have learned to be Faithful and true to thee, Yes, his first squeak should be \\"Comrade Napoleon!\\" 1999 film adaptation Film version of the flag of Animal Farm. In the 1999 film adaptation, \\"Beasts of England\\" is retitled \\"Beasts of the World\\" and given different lyrics: :Beasts of the world we shall unite :Rise up and ready for the fight :Soon or late the day will be :When Man's defeated and we are free :Soon or late the day will be :When Man's defeated and we are free :Though our lives be lives full of misery :Our limbs be tired and worn :Our dreams will not be broken :And our hearts will not be torn :Our dreams will not be broken :And our hearts will not be torn There is a reprise of the song but the second verse is changed, but it's a bit difficult to understand: :Though our lives be lives full of misery :The war has been won in the fields :We'll sing the song of justice :So stained the freedom's shield :We'll sing the song of justice :So stained the freedom's shield \\"Comrade Napoleon\\" is replaced by a song titled \\"Glorious Leader Napoleon\\", put to the tune of the Russian song \\"V Put\\": :Beloved leader Napoleon, fearless faithful guardian! Proud and strong, protect us from the wrong, you will defend us with your lofty trotter. :Our pigs, our pigs, our pigs: there is no beast that‚Äôs braver! They will not ever waver! They face the fight, for right with might. :Glorious, great and triumphant, gallant hero resilient! Proud and strong, protect us from the wrong, you will defend us with your lofty trotter Our pigs, our pigs, our pigs. In the same film, a new song was written for Napoleon by a \\"grateful duck\\", called \\"Napoleon, Mighty Leader\\". :Praise to him, the font of all our wisdom :Long to live, the ruler of our farm :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us : :Shout, shout, shout out loud :Snout, snout, pink and proud : :Friend on high, you guide us with your smile :Teach us how to be as kind as you :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us : :Shout, shout, shout out loud :Snout, snout, pink and proud : :Perfect pig, you bless us with your beauty :Hallowed hog, how wondrous is your glow :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us :Napoleon, mighty leader :Mighty leader watching over us : :Shout, shout, shout out loud :Snout, snout, pink and proud :Four legs good, two legs better.

The Economist. By Charlemagne. June 21, 2014. Downloaded Sep. 17, 2017. Sweden's previous neutrality policy had originated largely as a result of Sweden's involvement in the Napoleonic Wars during which over a third of the country's territory was lost, including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia. Resentment towards the old king precipitated a coup d'√©tat and the new regime formulated a new foreign policy which became known as The Policy of 1812. Since the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct armed conflict. However, Sweden's military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world. The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished. Sweden is still today a neutral and non-aligned country in regard to foreign and security policy. However, it maintains strong links to NATO. Nevertheless, the Swedish neutrality during World War II has been much debated and challenged later. Despite the British naval blockade of Nazi Germany and the official proposed intentions from the Swedish government to maintain political neutrality, Sweden exported iron ore to supply Nazi Germany's war industry via the Norwegian port of Narvik. Nazi Germany's war industry's dependence on Swedish iron ore shipments was the primary reason for Great Britain and their allies to launch their Operation Wilfred and the Norwegian Campaign in early April 1940. By early June 1940 the Norwegian Campaign stood as a failure for the allies, and by securing access to Norwegian ports by force, Nazi Germany could obtain the Swedish iron ore supply it needed for war production despite the British naval blockade. Sweden also supplied the Nazi German war industry with steel and machined parts throughout the war and provided transportation of armed German reinforcement troops, the 163rd Infantry Division/Division Engelbrecht commanded by General Erwin Engelbrecht, and military equipment through Swedish territory by train from Norway to the eastern front in Finland.  The Policy of 1812  A rally of support for the Scandinavian movement. The new foreign policy, often called The Policy of 1812, was directed by Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, the elected crown prince. The policy of 1812 was in sharp contrast to Sweden's previous foreign policy, during which Sweden had been involved in many conflicts, especially with its arch enemy, Russia. However, in 1812, with Napoleon starting a campaign against Russia and Emperor Alexander, the Emperor was in need of allies, and so met with the Swedish king in √Öbo. At the meeting it was agreed that Sweden would accept that Finland was part of Russia in exchange for the Tsar's help in pressuring Denmark to cede Norway to Sweden. Swedish troops led by Bernadotte took part in the Napoleonic Wars in 1813 and 1814, fighting against France (they had a small role at the Battle of Leipzig) and Denmark. Sweden forced Denmark to hand over Norway by the Treaty of Kiel. This was recognised by the Allied powers at the Congress of Vienna. Since this time Sweden has not taken part in armed warfare (with the exception of peacekeeping). Schleswig Question During the First War of Schleswig, from 1848 to 1851, Swedish troops were located in Jutland as support for Denmark against Prussian-supported rebels; the Swedish regular troops, however, never experienced any combat. Hundreds of Norwegian and Swedish volunteers joined and fought in the Danish army. After 40 years of successful trust-building with Russia, Sweden took no serious policy risks in the Crimean War, despite the possibility of a revision of the harsh peace of 1809. Although Sweden concluded an alliance with Britain and France, (November 25, 1855), the country did not engage in warfare. At the Second war of Schleswig, the Riksdag of the Estates refused to fulfill King Charles XV's promises of military support; and Sweden observed a strict neutrality, which would prove to be advantageous. Prussia would soon forge and dominate Imperial Germany, an unmatchable foe for Sweden--whose relative strength had diminished strikingly since its zenith during the Thirty Years' War.  World War I  Prussia's dominance had made the following forty years peaceful in the Baltic region, and by the outbreak of World War I, neutrality seemed a natural state to many Swedes. Although feelings of cultural and scientific kinship with the German Empire were strong in Sweden, mercantile and personal ties with Britain and France were strong as well. Opinion was split between Conservatives, with sympathies for Germany, and Liberals, with more mixed sympathies. Organized but politically less influential were the Social Democrats, antimilitarists and opposed to the war. The neutralist stance was reinforced when Denmark and Norway remained neutral. Voices for neutrality dominated the public debate, but Queen Victoria and some conservatives were strong advocates for entrance in the war on the German side, and the government's policy had a clear pro-German bias. In 1916, the pro-German policy was abandoned, having resulted in famine, rebellious opinions, and no tangible advantages. Once again, the conviction that strict neutrality was most suitable for Sweden dominated Swedish society. A new, less German-minded Conservative cabinet was appointed, and to calm the social unrest, democratic reforms were promptly initiated that cemented Sweden's neutralist policy and would soon lead to the political hegemony of Social Democrats lasting up to the 21st century. √Öland Islands The politician who stood as the biggest thorn in the side of the government was the Swedish Foreign Minister, Rickard Sandler (1932‚Äì1936 and 1936‚Äì1939). Sandler strongly opposed the government's policy of strict neutrality, feeling it necessary that the government relax its stringent policy. Sandler expressed a desire to defend the √Öland Islands from either German or Soviet control, by mining the area around the islands in conjunction with the Finnish government. The location of the √Öland Islands in the Baltic Sea. The √Öland Islands are of extreme strategic importance in the Baltic. Lying at the base of the Gulf of Bothnia, the √Öland Islands are situated alongside all the sea traffic lanes that come in and out of the Gulf, and are within range of Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states to the east. Prior to 1809, the √Öland Islands were part of Sweden, who was forced to give them up, along with the mainland area of Finland, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809, to Russia. Out of the ceded areas, including the √Öland islands, Russia formed the Grand Duchy of Finland. With the Treaty of Paris of April 18, 1856, at the conclusion of the Crimean War, Russia was required to stop the construction of any new fortifications on the islands, which Russia obeyed, despite unsuccessfully attempting to change the status of the islands in 1908. In 1914, however, the Russian government turned the islands into a submarine base for the use of British and Russian submarines during the First World War. In December 1917, the Finnish government proclaimed that Finland was a sovereign state and a dispute over whether the islands belonged to Sweden or Finland ensued. In 1921, again despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the islands' population was Swedish--and that they expressed a desire of being incorporated into Sweden--the League of Nations decided that the √Öland Islands should remain a part of Finland. Despite Sweden's grievances over failing to gain control of the islands in 1921, all difficulties between Sweden and Finland were resolved by the mid-1930s. The fear of the √Öland islands falling under German or Soviet influence was very real, and that is why Sandler proposed defending the status of the islands. However, the Swedish government opposed Sandler's proposal, in that it was felt that this would set a precedent for further moves--moves that might provoke an invasion from either Germany, the Soviet Union or both. When a new coalition was formed to represent Sweden's policy of neutrality, in light of the Winter War, Sandler was dropped from the new lineup of ministers. It was initially believed that the Swedish government had dropped Sandler due to his outspoken comments on the government's policies, and the German press' allegations that Sandler was pro-British; however, in reality it was Sandler who requested permission to retire from the Swedish cabinet, because the government did not represent Sandler's anti- neutral views. Armed neutrality The 1930s marked a new period when Sweden's long-standing policy of neutrality was severely tested on numerous occasions, most of which came from a strongly rejuvenated nationalistic Germany. Since the founding of the League of Nations in 1919 and up to the year 1935, Sweden had been a strong supporter of the League and most of Sweden's energy on the international stage had been put into its preservation. As the collective security system of the League of Nations started to crack with the Abyssinia crisis, and the approach of World War II, Sweden could look back on 120 years of successful neutralist politics ‚Äì with one singular exception: the backup force on Jutland during the First war of Schleswig. Sweden now pursued a policy of forging a block of neutralist countries in Northern Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Baltic States were all members of this club of neutral states. Of them, only Sweden would be fortunate enough to remain unattacked during World War II. Opposition to this new policy of armed neutrality was weak in that all major parties, such as the Conservatives, Agrarians and Liberal People's Party, supported the government's position. On a regular basis, beginning in 1936, the Swedish government requested increases in its defense budget to strengthen its military preparedness as the international situation continued to worsen. The actual military budget from 1936 to 1939 increased many times over. In 1936, military spending was $37,000,000; 1937, $50,000,000; 1938, $58,575,000; and in 1939 it was at $322,325,000. After the war began, military spending peaked in 1942 at $527,575,000 in one year alone. With the increased need of an expanded military, Swedish industry was required to not only supply the increased demand for domestic products, exacerbated by the German blockade of the North Sea, but also had to meet an increased demand in military armaments for the Swedish government. Before the war, production of armaments did not exceed more than tens of millions of Swedish kronor, but during the war, production exceeded the cost of one billion Swedish kronor ($240,000,000). =Significance of the neutrality policy= The fate of the Swedish nation largely rested upon the outcomes of distant battles and the policies of distant governments‚Äîevents outside the control of Swedish politicians and diplomats. Had certain battles or policies during the war been different, Sweden's ability to attain a successful policy of neutrality might very well not have succeeded. The British invasion of Norway and Germany's counter- attack on, and occupation of both Norway and Denmark, coupled with the fact that Finland was battling the Soviets, made Sweden's position extremely tenuous, in that countries on both sides of the European conflict were poised on Sweden's borders and could potentially strike at any moment. Germany had considered a Swedish invasion, and with Germany occupying both Norway and Denmark, Germany's ability to attack Sweden was a significant concern. Sweden was forced to act upon the whims and orders of a belligerent Germany. Had the war continued for a longer period of time, Germany or the Allies might have had no choice but to invade Sweden in order to thwart enemy advances. If Germany had been able to sustain its successes on the battlefield beyond 1943, and been capable of bringing the war to an end favorable to its own terms, Sweden would have had no choice but to join the new order of Europe, a new order under the domination of Nazi Germany. Germany would not have allowed a country to exist on the sidelines in the new order of Europe, and Sweden would have had to abandon its long-cherished policy of neutrality. However, German domination of Europe did not succeed and Sweden was left on its own. Sweden's ability to maintain its policy of neutrality until the war's end was due in large part to luck, since events out of its control played the largest part in the fate of Sweden's policy of neutrality. Sweden was able to move along with the events occurring all around its borders. Prime Minister Hansson and the government were able to maneuver the country effectively through the course of the war, avoiding the devastating losses and destruction that said war might have brought upon Sweden. One beneficial consequence of Sweden's neutrality was that Sweden was able to act as a refuge to people from occupied lands. Approximately 70 000 Finnish children were evacuated and placed with families in Sweden. There were also refugees from the Baltic nations and the other Scandinavian countries. Nearly all of Denmark's Jewish population was able to escape to Sweden on fishing boats in a coordinated effort by the Danish people and the Swedes who gave them shelter on the other side. Also, Sweden's neutral stance allowed Swedish diplomats access to Germany, allowing for espionage which benefited the Swedish intelligence as well as the Allies. Most notable among these were Raoul Wallenberg and Count Folke Bernadotte, who saved over 100,000 European Jews from the concentration camps. Also, Sweden's King Gustav V attempted to negotiate with Hitler for a more humane treatment of the Jews. Scandinavian defence union A Scandinavian defence union that would have included Sweden, Norway and Denmark was considered among the three countries after World War II. They would remain separate sovereign countries but act as a single block in foreign policy and security issues. The proposed union was discussed by a joint Scandinavian committee during the winter of 1948‚Äì1949, but in the end the Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and preparations for a western alliance that would result in the North Atlantic Treaty superseded the Scandinavian negotiations. When it became known that the western alliance's own pressing needs would prevent them from supplying the Scandinavian countries with armaments, Norway, wanting access to those arms, decided that it would be more advantageous to be a member of NATO and resigned from the talks. Denmark was still willing to enter into an alliance with Sweden, but the Swedes saw few advantages in this and the proposal failed. Norway and Denmark subsequently became signatory parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and members of NATO, while Sweden remained neutral. The Cold War Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality after WWII, despite substantial cooperation with the West. During the early Cold War, this policy was maintained even though Sweden's leaders understood that neutrality would probably fail in a third world war. The aim of the policy was to avoid the violent initial nuclear exchange between the superpowers. This was the rationale behind Sweden's policy of neutrality until the late 1960s with the advent of second strike capability and nuclear parity. Initially after the end of World War II, Sweden quietly pursued an aggressive independent nuclear weapons program involving plutonium production and nuclear secrets acquisition from all nuclear powers, until the 1960s, when it was abandoned as cost- prohibitive. During the Cold War Sweden appeared to maintain a dual approach to thermonuclear weapons. Publicly, the strict neutrality policy was forcefully maintained, but unofficially strong ties were purportedly kept with the U.S. Sweden, for instance, cooperated extensively with U.S. intelligence: \\"Though officially neutral, Sweden in fact built very close ties to both NATO and the US security establishment in the late 1940s and early 1950s and was deeply involved in cold war spying operations.\\" It was hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and nuclear weapons to strike at Soviet staging areas in the occupied Baltic states in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality policy, fewer and fewer Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. Later research has shown that every publicly available war-game training, included the scenario that Sweden was under attack from the Soviets, would rely on NATO forces for defence.Holmstr√∂m, Den Dolda Alliansen The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent.Livl√∂s livlina till v√§st Framsyn 2004, NR. 1 (The Swedish Defense Research Agency‚Äôs bi-monthly publication) In the early 1960s U.S. nuclear submarines armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made this a good area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines had to be very close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, the same year that the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. This guarantee was kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help in the development of the Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.Hemliga atomub√•tar gav Sverige s√§kerhetsgaranti Framsyn 2005, NR. 1 (The Swedish Defence Research Agency‚Äôs bi-monthly publication)  Today  After the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, Sweden dropped its official policy of military neutrality, but continued to behave as a neutral and non-aligned country. In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union (but declined Eurozone membership) and has since the mid-1990s continued to reduce its armed forces and became involved in more international missions in countries like Bosnia and Afghanistan. The continued reduction of its own national defence and the question of whether the country really could defend itself against an aggressor has led to some criticism. In 2009 Sweden agreed to enter into mutual self-defence treaties with the EU, and with other Nordic countries, thus ending a nearly 200 year long period of official military neutrality. As a result of a 2010 U.S. diplomatic cables leak, it was learned that the United States government had described Sweden's \\"official security policy\\" as \\"non-participation in military alliances during peacetime and neutrality during wartime.\\" However, Sweden does contribute to various NATO and EU battlegroups and is involved in international organizations.Cable 07STOCKHOLM506, \\"Sweden: Scenesetter for Prime Minister,\\" May 4, 2007. The United States has also stated: \\"Its active participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace and its role in leading the European Union's 1,500 troops-strong Nordic Battle group give the lie to the official policy. Sweden has opted out of buying two C-17s and has subsequently joined and made the second-highest contribution to the NATO-sponsored Strategic Airlift Capability. This will, in the long run, support of the Nordic Battle group and other strategic lift requirements. Sweden also plays an important role in Darfur, where former Swedish Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson is the UN Special Envoy and Sweden supports democratization and humanitarian relief. Within the EU, Sweden often takes positions that coincide with our own on issues as diverse as the DOHA round, EU enlargement and Turkey, Swift banking data privacy, and the EU's relationship with Cuba.\\" From March‚ÄìOctober 2011, Sweden was a participant in the NATO-led international contingent in the War in Libya. In May 2016, a survey showed for the first time that more Swedes favored NATO membership than opposed it. All of the political parties that are part of the right-of-centre coalition favor full NATO membership. = Global surveillance disclosure = As a result of Edward Snowden's disclosures, the notion of Swedish neutrality in international politics has been called into question. In an alleged internal document dating from the year 2006, the U.S. National Security Agency acknowledged that its \\"relationship\\" with Sweden is \\"protected at the Top Secret level because of that nation‚Äôs political neutrality.\\" Specific details of Sweden's cooperation with members of the UKUSA Agreement include how: * The National Defence Radio Establishment of Sweden (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore, an analytical database of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). * Sweden updated the NSA on changes in domestic Swedish legislation that provided the legal framework for information sharing between the FRA and the Swedish Security Service. * Since January 2013, a counterterrorism analyst of the NSA has been stationed in the Swedish capital of Stockholm Several years before the Riksdag passed a controversial bill proposing a change in legislation of the FRA, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the NSA and the FRA signed an agreement in 2004 that allows the FRA to directly collaborate with the NSA without having to consult the GCHQ. As part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, regarding collaboration and intelligence sharing.

He is shown as the farm's most dedicated and loyal laborer. Boxer serves as an allegory for the Russian working-class who helped to oust Tsar Nicholas and establish the Soviet Union, but were eventually betrayed by the Bolsheviks. He is described as \\"faithful and strong\\"; and he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder. David Low used a cart horse as a symbol for the T.U.C. in cartoons for many years before Orwell began to write Animal Farm. Boxer can only remember four letters of the alphabet at a time, but sees the importance of education and aspires to learn the rest of the alphabet during his retirement (which never happens). Boxer is a loyal supporter of Napoleon, and he listens to everything the self-appointed ruler of the farm says and assumes, sometimes with doubt, that everything Napoleon tells the farm animals is true, hence \\"Napoleon is always right.\\" Boxer's strength plays a huge part in keeping Animal Farm together prior to his death: the rest of the animals trusted in it to keep their spirits high during the long and hard laborious winters. Boxer was the only close friend of Benjamin, the cynical donkey. Boxer fights in the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill. Though he dislikes humans, he kicks a stable boy during a fight. Boxer believes that he has killed the boy which Boxer hates himself for doing, thinking that he went too far (shortly afterward, it revealed the boy was only stunned, and soon fled to freedom). When Boxer defends Snowball's reputation from Squealer's revisionism, the pigs designate him as a target for the Great Purge. During Old Major's speech, which inspired the principles of Animalism, a specific reference is made to how Boxer would be turned into glue under Farmer Jones' rule, thus implying that it would not happen to him under Animalism. \\"You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will send you to the knacker, he will cut your throat and boil you down for the fox-hounds.\\"Chapter I p. 9, Signet Classics edition Real life model Boxer is based on a coal miner named Alexey Stakhanov who was famous for working over his quota. The Joseph Stalin Regime built a cult of personality around him that rewarded workers who showed a similar heroic dedication to production and efficiency, he supported Joseph Stalin. Also was very loyal to its kind Films In the 1954 film adaptation of Animal Farm, Boxer is voiced by Maurice Denham. In the 1999 film adaptation, he is voiced by Paul Scofield.

This is a partial list of characters in the Ender's Game series. Wiggin family *Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is the protagonist of the Ender quintet and a constant presence in the Bean quartet. Brought into the International Fleet's Battle School for his immense potential as a commander of soldiers, he is eventually tricked into prosecuting the war against the Formics, resulting in the almost-complete destruction of that race, and spends a good part of the remainder of his life attempting to find absolution for his unknowing act of xenocide by becoming a Speaker for the Dead. *' is Ender's elder brother. A sociopath, he takes sadistic pleasure in manipulating and brutalizing other children, especially Ender whom Peter loves bullying by looking into his eye, and is rejected from Battle School because he is too violent. In Ender's Game, he helps end a global war (with Valentine's reluctant assistance). In later books, he becomes Hegemon of the free world due to his prescient and charismatic leadership, and founds the Free People of Earth, the Enderverse's first world government. * Wiggin is Ender's elder sister, being the middle child of the Wiggin family. Rejected from Battle School for her overwhelming compassion, she serves as the intermediary between Ender and Peter during the former's childhood. Later she helps Peter on his rise to power by becoming \\"Demosthenes\\", an essayist whose rabble-rousing demagoguery is contrasted strongly against Peter's statesmanlike essays as \\"Locke\\". After the end of the Formic War, she leaves with Ender on an odyssey through time and space, turning Demosthenes into a historian whose essays are considered the definitive word on whatever subject they address. After marrying on the planet Trondheim, she eventually uproots her family to follow Ender to Lusitania, where she helps to defuse the onrushing Lusitania Fleet and the impending shadow of xenocide. *' and ' are Ender's parents. While Ender's Game portrays them as being dull and oblivious, despite the genius children they raised, both characters are fleshed out in later works and revealed to be more intelligent than even their children imagined. John Paul is Catholic and Theresa Mormon. Furthermore, Colonel Graff revealed that Ender's father was baptized with the surname Wieczorek, hinting at his Polish roots, and was born the seventh of nine children, a serious offense in the Enderverse's overpopulation sanctions, both of which he has cast himself away from. Battle School students =Ender's jeesh= Ender's jeesh (an Arabic word meaning 'army') is a collection of his closest friends at Battle School, particularly those who serve under him in Dragon Army in Battle School before serving as team leads under his command during the Third Invasion, ending with the destruction of the Formic homeworld. As chronicled in the Bean Quartet, many of them move into positions of international significance during the chaotic years after the end of the Formic War, particularly due to the machinations of Achilles de Flandres. *' (pronounced ah-lie) is a Muslim of North African descent. In Battle School, he was an exceptional student, adroit in the battle room, and was one of the first children to befriend Ender, with the word \\"salaam\\" and a kiss on the cheek.Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 69. They became the best of friends. He also helped lead the special training sessions Ender conducted, and later became one of the most trusted members of Ender's jeesh during the Third Invasion due to his innate talent. After his return to Earth, he is eventually elected Caliph of a unified Muslim world. *' is a student of Greek and Igbo descent from the streets of Rotterdam. Though the smallest and youngest member of the jeesh, he is also the smartest and most fair-minded person. Ender initially notes that he is isolating Bean as Ender himself was once isolated, in order to force Bean to flourish. Though nothing more than a supporting character in Ender's Game, Bean (real name Julian Delphiki II) is the lead character of the parallel storyline book series known as the \\"Bean Quartet\\" or \\"Shadow Quartet\\", revealing his role as the behind-the-scenes facilitator of most of the main events of that time period (the victory against the Formics, the uniting of Earth under Peter Wiggin, so on); being \\"behind the scenes\\" is a central theme in these works. * Meeker is a Battle School student of Dutch descent. He is portrayed as one of those who refuses to play the teacher's game. He says that he was offered command of an army twice, but refused to play. He was paranoid of the game, convinced that the teachers were the enemy and that the Bugger War was fake so that all children with ability for command were in the hands of the International Fleet; however, he loved the game, so he stayed as a toon leader. * Carby is an Australian veteran who commands Rabbit Army. In the original short story version of Ender's Game, Ender held a low opinion of him: in the novel, when Bean was transferred into Rabbit Army, Ender says, \\"How can they put you under an idiot like Carby!\\", but in the expanded novel Ender's reply is, \\"Carby's a good man; I hope he recognizes you for what you're worth.\\" Carby's Rabbit Army were the first to battle Ender's Dragon Army and were beaten badly. When Carby told the other commanders of Ender's new tactics, they didn't believe him, so Carby told Ender \\"to beat the snot out of them\\" in battle, as a personal favor. His honest and sympathetic behavior made Ender \\"mentally [add] him to his private list of people who also qualified as human beings\\". He is transferred to Command School and serves under Ender during the Third Invasion, one of the few Jeesh members who was never in an army with Ender during Battle School. *' is a British student. He is a veteran soldier who leads \\"C\\" Toon in Dragon Army. He got his nickname due to his temperament, as he couldn't stand to work under commanders that he considered to be stupid. He wrecked rooms and once sent a message to every kid in the school about how bad his commander was. *' is the leader of \\"E\\" toon in Dragon Army. He is described by Bean as being among the most worshipful of Ender. Along with the other toon leaders, he is part of Ender's \\"jeesh\\", the group that works under Ender in fighting the Formics. *' is a Filipino veteran soldier who leads \\"A\\" Toon in Dragon Army. He is portrayed initially as being contemptuous of Ender's five-toon formation, but later accepts it as wise, after arguing the concept with Bean. He was acting blatantly insubordinate and saying that it was a real \\"loser strategy\\", and when Bean stood up for Ender, who was at the time a very young commander, he got mad and almost hurt Bean, but finally he had to accept that Bean was smarter than him and that it was a good strategy. *' (nicknamed Hot Soup') was a veteran soldier from China who leads \\"D\\" Toon in Dragon Army. Eventually, he was shipped to Command School to become a member of Ender's jeesh, and was one of the commanders that served under him during the end of the Formic War. After the war Han Tzu returned to China before being kidnapped by Achilles. He later returned and became involved in military planning. *' is an Armenian student who is the only female in the jeesh. During the Earth's invasion of the Bugger worlds, Ender relies on her heavily, often giving her complicated and critical assignments; she is the first student to burn out, falling asleep during a battle. She is a major character later on in the Shadow Series. She and Bean travel around the world, to stay alive, and eventually get married. Together they have children (nine embryos, one implanted in Petra and the other eight were stolen by Achilles; all but one are recovered by the end of Shadow of the Giant) and facilitate the downfall of Achilles. *' is a Japanese student who is part of Ender's group of launchies. He is introduced as the kid who has a big butt that wriggles when he walks and is constantly mocked by Bernard and his gang. Ender steps in and sends a number of messages under pseudonyms (such as \\"Cover your butt. Bernard is watching. - God\\") to break Bernard's control over the room. He becomes Ender's first friend in Battle School.Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 53. He later guides Bean and tells him why the students love Ender. *' was born in Belarus under the New Warsaw Pact. He is known as being a solid student who was always passed up in favor of more ambitious students in the various Battle School armies. Vlad is one of the 40 students chosen to serve in Dragon Army under the command of Ender, where he is made leader of \\"B\\" Toon. Vlad is one of the eleven students that were chosen to be in Ender's jeesh, helping command the warships of the International Fleet against the Formics in the Third Invasion. =Other Battle School students= * de Flandres is the main villain of the Bean quartet. Like Bean, he grew up in Rotterdam, an orphan on the streets; like Peter, he displays sociopathic tendencies, particularly by murdering anyone who has ever seen or made him helpless. During the years after the Formic War, he takes steps to begin unifying the world under his rule, causing a series of costly wars between India, China, Russia, a united Islam, and large parts of Europe and southeast Asia. *' is a Battle School grad from Thailand who becomes Bean's friend during the wars caused by Achilles. He was known as \\"Surly\\" due to his pugilistic disposition, but during his time with Bean develops into a mature and capable commander. *' is a Battle School grad from India who is instrumental in rousting Achilles from his power base in India. As the conflicts increase, she returns to rural India to devise and encourage civil disobedience there, where she begins to cultivate a divine image. *' is a minor character who is primarily notable due to his involvement in one of the more unusual battles in the \\"Battle Room\\". In the Battle School's first numerically handicapped battle, Ender Wiggin, commander of Dragon Army, was required to face both Bee's Griffin Army, as well as Talo Momoe's Tiger Army. *' is part of Ender's launch group and treats the precocious Ender with great contempt (mostly because Ender had broken Bernard's arm on the shuttle to the Battle School). Bernard is also seen as a ringleader and the main antagonist in the first few chapters of the book, and he takes great delight in picking on Ender and Shen, a young boy who is also in the launchy group. However, his stranglehold on the clique falls apart when Ender and Alai become friends in the battle room, and after Ender manages to hack into the computer system and posts a message saying \\"Cover your butts, Bernard is watching\\", signed \\"God\\". Later Ender also writes another note, seemingly by Bernard, saying \\"I love your butt, let me kiss it. -Bernard.\\" Bernard is one of the six students who accompanies Bonzo Madrid when he fights Ender in the bathroom. * Delphiki is a major character of the book Ender's Shadow and a side character in Shadow of the Hegemon by Orson Scott Card. Nikolai is one of twenty-four fertilized eggs produced by Greek natives Elena Delphiki and Julian Delphiki, Sr. A defect in one of Elena's fallopian tube and an ectopic pregnancy in the other made it impossible for her to conceive. In their hopes for a child, Elena had several eggs taken out, and Julian's sperm was harvested to produce numerous fertilized eggs. The healthiest were cloned, and then the twenty-four healthiest of those were chosen. One was implanted, producing Nikolai. *' is an antagonistic supporting character, serving to bring out Ender's brutal nature while at Battle School. Bonzo, whose real name is Bonito de Madrid, is described as a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage from the town of Cartagena. As commander of Salamander Army, the autocratic Bonzo suddenly has Ender Wiggin thrust upon him when Ender is promoted from his launch group. He is accidentally killed in a confrontation with Ender, bringing six students with him to attack Ender in a bathroom. In the 2013 film adaptation, he survives with a career ending head injury. *\\"Mick\\" is a student who \\"looked to be twelve or thirteen\\" and says that he is \\"\`half-iced bugger- fodder'\\".Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 41-42. He steals Ender's pudding and encourages Ender to make friends. *Talo Momoe is the commander of one of the numerous armies at Battle School. He is paired up with William Bee's army in a battle against Ender's undefeated Dragon Army. Momoe favors a very direct approach, and argues with Bee that, because they outnumber Ender, they should do a frontal assault. Bee's disagreement leads to a prolonged war of words. After Ender comes out with a formation, Momoe orders his army to rebound and assault the army directly.Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 217-218. * de Nose, although his first name is Rosen, is the commander of Rat Army when Ender is transferred there. Rose de Nose is also the only Jewish commander at the time in Battle School, which he uses as a crutch of sorts, as military legend has it that Jewish commanders never lose. Rose de Nose treats Ender with considerably more decency than does Bonzo Madrid, the commander of Ender's first army, Salamander Army. He is also much more lax about rules; the Rat Army barracks are messy when compared to the discipline and order of Salamander. Rose attempts to impose rules on Ender, but Dink Meeker tells Ender not to listen. As a result, Rose sends Ender out on what is, in essence, a suicide run at the beginning of Ender's first battle with Rat Army so that he will get immediately frozen. Instead, due to his unique \\"legs first\\" strategy, he is able to disable or freeze many of the enemies' soldiers to give Rat Army a sizable advantage. Rose gives up picking on Ender, and leaves him to do things his own way. By the time Ender and his group of companions rise to prominence, Rose de Nose has already graduated from Battle School. *' is a recurring commander that Ender twice faces at Battle School. In their first known battle, Ender was still a soldier in Bonzo's Salamander Army and Slattery was the new commander of the lowly Leopard Army. What everyone expected to be an easy battle turned into an upset by Slattery. Ender, who had been given orders by Bonzo to stay in the corridor until four minutes after everyone had gone through and then stay in the corner of the battle room, begins to observe Slattery's strategies and is impressed. Despite being young, Slattery is sharp and has new ideas; he always keeping his army moving against the stolid Salamanders who are unable to adapt to the situation. Eventually Leopard annihilates the entire Salamander Army, not including Ender. When Slattery is about to send his remaining men to open the gates, Ender ambushes them and takes out enough men to end the game in a draw. Despite helping Salamander Army achieve a tie, Bonzo is furious at Ender for disobeying his orders and would later cause more troubles for Ender. *' (Zechariah Morgan) is an American boy, mentioned only in the novella, A War of Gifts'. Zeck is a member of Rat army, but due to his orthodox Christian upbringing, is a pacifist and refuses to fire in the Battleroom. Throughout the novella, he comes into conflict with Dink and Ender, ruining Dink's latest rebellion, but at the end, he is accepted as a person and treated as such. His future after Battle School's closing is unknown. *Pinual is a minor character mentioned briefly when Ender encounters the Giant's Drink puzzle in the \\"Mind Game\\", a fantasy game meant to evaluate the students personality for the benefit of the Battle School teachers and commanders. Major Anderson mentions that Ender seems like Pinual because he keeps returning to the Giant's Drink, to which Hyrum Graff replies that \\"Everybody looks like Pinual at one time or another. But he's the only one who killed himself.\\"Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 54. When Ender returns to Earth after Bonzo Madrid's death, Major Imbu mentions that Pinual is the only student in the history of the Battle School to have committed suicide.Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game, Rev. mass market ed., NY: Tor, 1994, p. 226 *Wu is the only girl in Dragon Army. She is given the nickname \\"Woo-hoo\\" during her time in battle school. Because of her name, she is most likely of Asian origin. She is one of the few soldiers that Bean managed to nab for the Dragon Army roster. Wu is a brilliant soldier both academically and physically, but always refuses to become a Toon Leader. When a commander asks her to, she puts in a transfer request and refuses to fight until it is granted. International Fleet personnel *' is the principal of Battle School, and personally supervised much of Ender's training. After the war he is put on trial for his controversial actions there, but is given a position within the Hegemony as Minister of Colonization, responsible for sending humanity out to colonize the now-deserted worlds formerly held by the Formics. *' is the half-MƒÅori captain who singlehandedly stopped the Second Invasion by realizing that the Buggers are a hive mind. Due to his inability to pass on his knowledge, he was forced to spend fifty years at relativistic speeds (eight years for Rackham) so that he could train the next commander Ender Wiggin. After the end of the war, he joins Graff's crusade to keep the human race from destroying itself. *Major Anderson was Graff's second-in-command at Battle School, generally seen in the epistolary conversations from Ender's Game attempting to moderate his superior's unorthodox training of Ender. His passion is the Battle Room; after the war's end, he accepts the post of commissioner for an American football league, and does not appear in the latter three books of either the Ender or Bean quartets. In the film, Major Gwen Anderson is a psychologist who looks after the Battle School students, and is portrayed by The Helps lead actress Viola Davis. *' is the ranking Admiral at Eros, the International Fleet's headquarters, during the final stages of the Formic War; he was not Polemarch during that time, and has assumed that post by the time Achilles de Flandres begins his power plays. Other Ender's Game characters *' is the physical embodiment of the central consciousness of the Formics. * Victor Delgado: A mechanic born on the free mining ship El Cavador, that mined asteroids in the Kuiper Belt. When the Formic's scout ship was discovered and deemed as a real threat, he was sent on a quick ship to Luna to report the news. On Luna, he was promptly arrested, but freed by Imala. After, he and Imala began teaming up with Lem Jukes to infiltrate the Formic ship and were successful in doing so. They were able to replicate the infiltration mission with a team of MOPs and were successful in destroying the Formic scout ship. *Jane is artificial sentience thought to exist within the ansible network by which planets communicate instantly across galactic distances and instant communication is made possible through the hundred worlds. * Stilson is a bully in Ender's Game. In the very first chapter of the book, he and three friends gang up on Ender, who decides to win, not just this fight, but all fights that might happen in the near future. Ender's counterattacks are so effective that Stilson, unbeknownst to Ender, suffers enough injuries to later die in hospital.  Characters introduced in Speaker for the Dead  Characters from the planet Lusitania as introduced in the book Speaker for the Dead = Figueira family = * Pipo (PEE-po fee-GAY-ra; born Jo√£o Figueira Alvarez; died 1948) is the first xenologer of Lusitania. He is one of the few people on the planet who treats Novinha as a real person, and becomes her beloved father-figure during her teenage years. He is the first human killed by the piggies, and his death prompts Novinha to call for a speaker for the dead. * Concei√ß√£o Figueira, is Pipo's wife and the archivist of Lusitania. * Libo (LEE-bo; Liberdade Gra√ßas a Deus Figueira de Medici; 1931-1965) is Pipo's son and the xenologer after his death. Libo is Novinha's first love. Unfortunately, like his father he is vivisected by the pequeninos. His apprentice, Miro, calls for a speaking of his death, which Ender performs. Libo is the father of Novinha's children. * Bruxinha (Portuguese for \\"little witch\\"; born Cleopatra Figueira) is wife of Libo. *Pipinho (Jo√£o) is Libo's sibling. *Maria (d. 1936) was Libo's sibling who died of the Descolada. *Bimba (Aben√ßoada) is Libo's sibling. *Patinha (Isolde) is Libo's sibling. *R√£ (Tom√£s) is Libo's sibling. * Ouanda Quenhatta Figueira Mucumbi (b. 1951), is Libo and Bruxinha's eldest child and a xenologer, who falls in love with Miro. * China Figueira is Ouanda's sibling. * Prega Figueira is Ouanda's sibling. * Zinha Figueira is Ouanda's sibling. = OS Venerados family = * Gusto (Vladimir Tiago Gussman; d. 1936) was Cida's husband, Novinha's father, and a xenobiologist of Lusitania. He helped cure the Descolada virus before succumbing to it. Known, with his wife Cida, as Os Venerados after being beatified by the Pope. * Cida (Ekaterina Maria Aparecida do Norte von Hesse- Gussman; d 1936) was Gusto's wife, Novinha's mother, and a xenobiologist of Lusitania. She helped the Descolada virus before succumbing to it themselves. Known, with her husband, as Os Venerados after being beatified by the Pope. * Novinha (no-VEEN-ya; born Ivanova Santa Catarina von Hesse; b. 1931) is the daughter of Lusitania's xenobiologists. Orphaned, Novinha became distant and formal until finding a scientific sanctuary with Pipo and Libo. Though she and Libo are in love, she refuses to marry and give him legal access to her xenobiology files, which she believes caused Pipo's death. She instead marries the abusive Marc√£o. Her pain, sorrow, and isolation draws Ender Wiggin to Lusitania, and the two eventually marry. Despite this, Novinha never loses her fragility and fear of losing those dearest to her. * Marc√£o (mar-COWNG; born Marcos Maria Ribeira; aka \\"Big Marcos\\"; d. 1970), is Novinha's late husband. He is known for his fearsome stature, surly temper, and habit of beating his wife, traits which earned him the epithet \\"c√£o\\", dog; he dies a few weeks before Ender arrives at Lusitania, of a congenital disease which caused his glands to turn to fatty tissues. Among other things, this rendered him sterile, and it is revealed during Ender's speaking of his death that none of Novinha's children are actually his, but rather Libo's; the two agreed to this form of cuckoldry before getting married. * Mingo (d. 1936) was Novinha's sibling who died of the Descolada. * Amado (d. 1936) was Novinha's sibling who died of the Descolada. * Guti (d. 1936) was Novinha's sibling who died of the Descolada. * Miro (MIE-roe; Marcos Vladimir Ribeira von Hesse; b. 1951) is Novinha's eldest child. He follows Libo into xenology and falls in love with Ouanda, Libo's firstborn daughter by his (actual) wife. In response to this and other factors, he attempts to cross the nerve-stimulating fence separating the piggies from the human compound, suffering brain damage and becoming crippled. He is sent out into space to greet Valentine Wiggin and her family, and later becomes a key player in the events leading up to the almost-second Xenocide. * Ela (Eh-la; Ekaterina Elanora Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1952) is Novinha's second child. Like all the females in her line, she becomes a xenobiologist, and is one of the first members of the Ribeira family to warm to Ender. Later in life, she is instrumental in the destruction of the descolada virus, and its replacement with a far-more-benign variant, the recolada. * Quim (KEENG; Estev√£o Rei Ribeira von Hesse; b.1955) is Novinha's third child. He is extremely pious and at first resists Andrew Wiggin on grounds of his atheistic avocation, but later warms to the Speaker, partially for his reputation as a crusader. He later becomes the first Christian evangelist to the pequeninos and holds great respect among them, but is martyred by a particularly heretical forest who believe that the descolada is the Holy Ghost and it is the pequeninos' duty to judge all humans with it. * Olhado (ol-YAH-doe; Lauro Suleim√£o Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1958) is Novinha's fourth child. He is also called \\"the guy with the eyes\\", because a freak laser accident blinded him in his youth, requiring the implant of metal replacements. He has reduced binocular vision and depth perception but can plug a computer jack directly into one eye, to upload visual recordings. Due to the resulting ostracism, he becomes a keen observer of human nature and interaction. Later in life he becomes a brickmaker (or at least a manager of them) because, to him, family is a far more important calling than the sciences that took his relatives; nonetheless he has revolutionary ways of looking at physics and metaphysics, and is crucial in the development of faster-than-light travel (via a modified hyperspace mechanic related to philotic theory). Like Ela, he quickly warms to Ender; as he relates to Valentine in Xenocide, his greatest secret is that, while alone with Ender, they call each other \\"Father\\" and \\"Son\\". * Quara (KWA-rah; Lembran√ßa das Milagres de Jesus Ribeira von Hesse, 1963) is Novinha's fifth child. Throughout her life she exhibits stubbornness and contrariness, generally doing whatever the people who love her don't want her to do. She also becomes a xenobiologist, and assists Ela in \\"truncating\\" the descolada, despite discovering that the virus is quite possibly sentient and is certainly able to communicate with other individuals of its species. * Grego (GRE-goe; Ger√£o Gregorio Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1964) is Novinha's sixth child, only six years old when Ender arrives. As a child he showed a disturbing capacity for destruction, modeled on his father's habit of domestic violence, a temper which does not subside during later years. After Quim's death, he attempts to whip a mob into a frenzy to attack the responsible forest, only to have them jump on the nearest one to hand Human and Rooter's forest after being chewed out by Valentine, Grego tries to end the massacre with as little bloodshed as possible, eventually placing himself between the surviving piggies and his own riot. He later collaborates with Olhado on faster-than-light travel. = Other colonists = * Bosquinha (Faria Lima Maria do Bosque) is governor of Lusitania and mayor of the colony Milagre. * Peregrino (Arm√£o Cebola) is the Bishop of the Catholic church of Lusitania. * Dom Crist√£o (Amai a Tudomundo Para Que Deus Vos Ame, Portuguese for Ye Must Love Everyone So That God Will Love You) is the abbott the Filhos de Mente de Cristo, Children of the Mind of Christ. * Dona Crist√£ (Detestai o Pecado e Fazei o Direito, Portuguese for Hate Sin and Do the Right) is the principal monk of the order of the Children of the Mind of Christ. =Pequeninos= The Pequeninos (Portuguese for \\"Little Ones\\"), also known as Lusitanian Aborigines or piggies, are an alien species in the category ramen, or sentient non-human. They are forest-dwelling and technologically primitive, but incredibly intelligent species able to learn languages extremely quickly. They are given the nickname \\"piggy\\" by the colonists of the planet Lusitania where part of the series is set due to their pig-like appearance. *': One of the first pequeninos introduced in the series, Rooter was the most inquisitive of the piggies and had a strong relationship with Libo before he was abruptly brought into his third life as a father-tree. *Mandachuva: The first crisis in human-pequenino relations occurred with the death of the first xenologer, Pipo Figueira, at the hands of the pequeninos. When Pipo discovered that the Descolada virus, which had nearly destroyed the human population of Lusitania, was a part of the pequeninos' normal physiology, he went to share that information with the pequeninos. The pequenino Mandachuva brought that news back to the wives, along with the implication that the humans were not all-powerful and godlike, and that in some respects pequeninos were even more powerful than humans. It was a revelation to be rewarded, but when Pipo was asked to bring Mandachuva to the \\"third life\\", Pipo, not understanding the nature of pequenino transformation, thought he was being asked to kill Mandachuva. He refused, preferring to lose his own life in the process. On their side Mandachuva, and the pequeninos in general, thought that they were rewarding Pipo, bringing him on to his third life, not understanding that no such thing existed for humans. *Leaf-eater: Seventeen years later after the incident of Pipo and Mandachuva, the new xenologer and Pipo's son, Libo Figueira, suffered a similar fate. The piggy Leaf-eater had convinced the wives to let many more little mothers conceive than normal, and then convinced Libo to help them out with the famine that they were sure to face. It was an enormous risk because if Libo refused to help that whole generation of pequeninos would have starved, but the humans did in fact step in and provide assistance. After the first amaranth harvest, Libo was, like Pipo before him, asked to bring Leaf-eater to the third life, and, like his father, refused, thinking that he was saving Leaf-eater's life. Leaf-eater killed Libo, thinking on his part that he was helping Libo achieve his third life even though humans did not have a third life. *Human: One of the sons of Rooter. Human was offered a chance to be brought into the third life as a fathertree, but only if Ender performed the ritual. Like Pipo and Libo before him, Ender showed extreme distaste at the concept, but he managed to do so with a full understanding of the consequences of his actions. Soon after, Ender wrote a biography called \\"Life of Human\\" in memory of his friend. The name \\"Human\\" was given to him by the Pequeninos \\"because he was very smart\\". *Star-looker: One of the wives. She represented the pequeninos in their treaty with the humans. She is also called \\"Shouter\\" by the brothers behind her back because of her loud voice. *': A pequenino that died and entered the \\"third life\\" as a tree. He convinced a tribe of Pequeninos that the Descolada virus was a form of the Holy Ghost of Christ and that it should be spread to all humans on the Hundred Worlds. The tribe kidnapped and tortured Father Estev√£o, Ender's stepson, by exposing him to the virus for several days without medication. This event triggered a massacre of the pequeninos by the humans of Lusitania. *Planter: A pequenino featured prominently in Xenocide. When it was revealed to him that the descolada was manipulating pequenino behavior, he became almost suicidal, insisting that he be deprived of the descolada until death to prove that the pequenino's sentience was not caused by the descolada. Although he never entered the third life as a fathertree, he was awarded the honor of retaining his name after being planted, something which no other brothertree was given. *Glass: Similar to Planter, Glass was the subject of a descolada deprivation test. However, Glass's experiment was the testing of Ela's new recolada virus. He successfully made the transition into the third life as fathertree. *Fire- quencher: The pequenino representative who travels to the planet of the descoladores with Miro, Val, and the others in Children of the Mind. *Arrow: A pequenino mentioned in Speaker for the Dead. His name shows how humans affected pequenino culture.  Characters introduced in Xenocide  Several of the key characters in the Xenocide novel are from the planet of Path. They include: *' is a \\"godspoken\\" man from the planet of Path, and a reluctant follower of his religion. His treaty ended a burgeoning rebellion within the Hundred Worlds some three thousand years after Ender's Xenocide. Since then he has been retained as an advisor to Starways Congress. *' was the wife of Han Fei-tzu. She was named after an ancient revolutionary leader and was a loving godspoken follower of her religion. She died of a brittle bone disease when Qing-jao was four years old. *' is the daughter of Han Fei-tzu and Han Jiang- qing, also godspoken like her parents. When confronted with evidence that the godspoken affliction is not a sign of deitic favor but rather a genetic modification, giving her and all other godspoken both genius-level intelligence and obsessive-compulsive disorder, she is unable to cope with the truth and clings to her old traditions, becoming a tragic character. Her name means \\"Gloriously Bright\\". *' is Qing-jao's \\"secret maid\\", an ambitious and extremely bright commoner whom Qing-jao takes under her wing. She met Qing-Jao after she encountered her working in the rice paddy field after bribing her guard with sex. She is named after the Queen Mother of the West, a powerful figure in Chinese mythology. When the godspoken genes are studied in hopes of retaining the genius-level intellect but removing the OCD, it is discovered that Wang-mu has naturally mutated into such a condition, and her genes are treated as a model of what the revision is intended to do, making her rather outrageous name somewhat less ironic. Later, she accompanies the reborn Peter Wiggin on his quest to stop the destruction of Lusitania, and eventually marries him.  Characters from Ender in Exile  = Shakespeare planet = *Alessandra Toscano *Sel Menach *Vitaly Denisovitch Kolmogorov *Ix Tolo *Po *Abra is the boy who Ender was with at the end of Ender's Game, when Ender discovered the cocooned Hive Queen at the End of the World the buggers built for him. In Ender in Exile, Abra is revealed to be a bright boy of eleven years old who can fix nearly any machine. Abra is not really accepted by the children of his age because he is seen as someone who is at the level of an adult, while the adults mostly see him as a child. *Quincy Morgan = Ganges planet = * Randall Firth: Originally named Achilles Flanders II, Firth is the missing ninth child of Bean and Petra. Randall was born prematurely and appears to have Anton's Key turned. His mother, Nichelle Firth, also known as Randi believes Achilles is a hero assassinated by foul enemies. Nichelle allows Achilles to implant an embryo, believing that she would be carrying Achilles' child. To avoid persecution by Peter Wiggin, Randi determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her child and return him to Earth later to become the new Achilles. Nichelle ends up as a part of the colony Ganges led by Virlomi. Randall, called \\"Achilles\\" by Nichelle, is raised to see Peter the Hegemon and Julian Delphiki (otherwise known as Bean) as monsters, and to believe that Achilles was a true hero. Randall was one of the first to read \\"The Hive Queen\\" and treat it like a holy book, and thus he was also the first to paint Ender in a negative light, as Ender \\"The Xenocide\\". When Ender encounters Randall on Ganges, Randall plots to provoke Ender so that Ender will strike out and kill Randall. He thinks if this can be done, the universe will realize that Ender was a dangerous criminal. However, Ender does not strike out and instead tells Randall about his true mother and father: Petra Arkanian and Julian Delphiki. Randall is so enraged by this that he proceeds to brutally beat Ender, but Ender does not retaliate at all. Just before he delivers the final blow, Randall realizes that what Ender has told him is true, and he takes Ender to a doctor immediately. Randall then decides to rename himself Arkanian Delphiki, after his true parents. *Virlomi  Characters introduced in the Ender's Shadow / Bean Quartet series  * Anton is a scientist of European descent who discovers two genetic modifications which will allow the human brain unlimited growth, at the cost of unlimited physical growth. This discovery, Anton's Key, is named in his honor. However, research into human genetic engineering was outlawed by the international community, and when the nature of his work was discovered, he was subjected to classical conditioning to make it difficult for him to continue or even discuss his research. * ' is an unethical scientist of European descent, and the brother of Bean's father. He illegally modified 23 human embryos, \\"turning\\" Anton's Key within them; only one, Bean himself, was ever grown to maturity. Volescu was later discovered and had to destroy all his \\"research,\\" but Bean escaped him by, at the age of 9 months, hiding himself in the tank of a toilet. Volescu was later imprisoned for his crimes. * ' is an orphan girl from the streets of Rotterdam, the leader of a \\"crew\\" of fellow orphans who eventually take in Bean--and Achilles. Poke gave Bean his name, which he was originally unfond of, but later recognizes himself as Bean and ignores Colonel Graff, who tells Bean his true identity as Julian Delphiki. In Rotterdam, Bean, on some instinct, tells Poke to kill Achilles when she has the chance; she refuses, and Achilles later kills her, after kissing her, by stabbing her in the eye and then throwing her in the Rhine. Bean witnessed the kiss in the dark and, after leaving the scene, came to the realization that Poke was unsafe. He rushes back to find Poke already dead; Bean then blames himself for Poke's death. When Bean tells the story of Poke to Ender's jeesh on the journey to Eros, he decides to trust Petra, saying to her, \\"You cried for Poke, and that makes us friends.\\" *Sergeant is the second in command of Poke's crew, and later Achilles' family. He finds out Achilles killed Poke, but keeps this a secret for his, and everyone else's, protection. * ' is a Catholic nun who works as a recruiter for Battle School. Like Poke, she takes in both Bean and Achilles; however, her battery of psychological tests manage to identify Achilles for who he truly is. Later, when he escapes from a mental institution in Belgium and begins his reign of terror, she and Bean go undercover to oppose him, eventually linking up with Peter Wiggin. She, like Poke, meets her death at Achilles' hands; Bean is never able to forgive himself for these deaths. *Ullysses is a bully in Rotterdam. To help his family receive food from a soup kitchen, Achilles makes a point of beating up Ullysses. When he is released from a hospital he gloats about getting even with him. Ullysses is later killed by Achilles. *Andrew 'Ender' Delphiki is Bean and Petra's son who travels in the relativistic spaceship with Bean and his two siblings. He is one of four children in which Anton's Key is turned. He is determined to find a cure for Anton's Key. When he and his siblings find a new world to settle in, he devises and administers a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact but saving them from the giantism half of Anton's Key. *Rymus Ojman is the chairman of the cabinet of Starways Congress around the year 1970 S.C.. *Jakt is Valentine Wiggin's husband. He is originally from Trondheim, where he was one of the most respected lords of a fishing fleet on the planet. He chooses to depart from Trondheim with Valentine while in his sixties. *Syfte is Jakt and Valentine's daughter. She departs her homeworld of Trondheim with her parents and newlywed husband Lars. *Ro is Jakt and Valentine's child. *Varsam is Jakt and Valentine's child. *Plikt is a young student of Ender's from Trondheim. After his departure, she independently figures out that the man she knows as Andrew Wiggin is the original Speaker for the Dead as well as Ender Wiggin the Xenocide. She becomes a long-time friend and tutor of Valentine's family. She departs Trondheim with them.

It was one of the first ccTLDs to be marketed to the Internet at large as an alternative to the gTLDs .com, .net, and .org. Playing on the phonetic similarity between nu and new in English, and the fact that means \\"now\\" in several European languages, it was promoted as a new TLD with an abundance of good domain names available. The .nu domain is now controlled by the Internet Foundation in Sweden amid opposition from the government of Niue. Administration The government of Niue was recognized as the holder of legal rights to administer the .nu domain until 2003, when it signed the rights away to the IUSN Foundation, a Massachusetts-based non-profit organization created for the purpose of funding free unlimited internet access and wifi in Niue through revenue from the domain name. The administration and technical operation of the domain were transferred to The Internet Foundation in Sweden (IIS) in September 2013. The IIS said that 66.7 percent of \\"active\\" .nu domains at the time were registered to Swedish users. As of 2020, the IUSN Foundation states on its website that it still provides free internet access to Niue through a partnership with IIS, which funds IUSN's entire budget with a portion of the revenues from the .nu domain. In November 2018, the government of Niue initiated a lawsuit against the IIS in the Stockholm District Court to obtain control over the domain. It stated that the Foundation had \\"taken over Niue's .nu domain without consent in 2013\\", resulting in a significant loss of revenue for the country. Niue's government stated that the .nu domain was a \\"national asset of Niue\\" and had been taken over \\"unfairly\\", estimating that it had earned between $27 million and $37 million for the IIS.\\"Niue launches legal action in Sweden over domain name\\", Radio New Zealand, 10 December 2018 A later estimate by Niue's legal team stated that the country had missed out on a total of during the combined time that the domain had been administered by IUSN and the IIS. The IIS responded by saying that \\"It was and is essential for the Swedish internet infrastructure that .nu works in a stable and secure way\\", and that it had \\"done the necessary investigations before deciding to become the registry in 2013, involving several leading legal specialists and a direct contact with the relevant governmental institutions\\". On April 23, 2020, it was reported the Stockholm District Court had dismissed the complaint, stating that Niue \\"lacked the legal capacity to be a complainant\\" and ordering its government to pay in legal costs to the Swedish Internet Foundation. Usage of .nu The .nu domain is particularly popular in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium, as is the word for \\"now\\" in Swedish, Danish and Dutch ‚Äì an example of a domain hack. Although in Norwegian is an archaic word for \\"now\\", with being used instead, .nu was initially more popular than .no, with 43,000 .nu addresses being registered in Norway in 1999 compared to 30,000 .no ones.. Partially owing to restrictive domain rules for the ccTLD assigned to Sweden, .se, .nu was used for creative marketing of websites such as www.tv.nu to show what is currently showing on TV, and in the Netherlands for websites like waarbenjij.nu, Dutch for whereareyou.now. Internationalised domains In March 2000, .NU Domain Ltd became the first TLD to offer registration of Internationalized domain names, supporting the full Unicode character set. Unlike other TLDs, no browser plugin or punycode capable browser was required on the client side for use of these names, as .NU Domain's web servers converted and redirected any web queries issued in a variety of international character encodings. However, in March 2010, .NU Domain announced at ICANN that they had recently disabled their general wildcard domain name resolution technology, and thus were implementing IDNs only by the now standard punycode implementation, and were reducing the accepted set of IDN characters for .NU Domain names to a subset of the ISO-8859-1 western European characters. Domain revocation policy .NU domain names are revoked without refund for displaying images of child pornography, being involved with phishing, spamming, email theft, search engine abuse, or any unlawful purpose. In February 2012, library.nu, a site listing links to scanned books, a substantial number of which are claimed to be pirated copyrighted material, went offline after a coalition of the world's largest book publishers obtained an injunction against the site. A few days later the site also had its domain name revoked by domain registrar Nunames. The domain revocation was recorded in screenshots taken at the time. Pricing Domain names can be as short as one character. A premium of ‚Ç¨500/yr applies to name registrations of one character in length, ‚Ç¨250 for domain names of two-character length, and ‚Ç¨30 per year for domain names of any other length, although alternate registrars have two-letter domain names available for the price of normal length names. In June, 2008, .NU Domain began permitting registration of all-numeric domain names.

She won a bronze medal in the women's individual event at the 2004 Summer Olympics, becoming the first British woman to win an Olympic archery medal in ninety-six years. Williamson achieved two medals at the World Archery Championships and represented England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, winning two silver medals. Williamson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2012. She announced her retirement from archery in 2014. Early and personal life Alison Williamson was born on 3 November 1971 in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. She was introduced to archery at the age of seven by her parents, who both practised the sport recreationally. As of 2012, both her parents remained active in the sport, her father holding the position of president of the British archery's governing body, Archery GB, and her mother working as a coach. At the age of ten Williamson won a silver medal at the 1981 Wenlock Olympian Games and at fourteen she qualified for her first international tournament. To garner publicity ahead of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Williamson posed nude as part of a series of photographs showcased in the National Portrait Gallery. In 2003 she received funding from the National Lottery for the first time, allowing her to divide archery practice with part-time work as a primary school teacher. The grants allowed her to become a full-time athlete in 2006. In May 2012 she participated in the Olympic torch relay, acting as a torchbearer as it passed through the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock on the twelfth day of the route. The following month Williamson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to archery in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Williamson married husband Will Conaghan in 2013. She is a member of the Long Mynd Archers club based in Shropshire. She is a graduate of Arizona State University and in 2000 listed Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey as her favourite sportsperson. Career =Olympic career= ;1992, 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics Williamson made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, finishing the women's individual event in eighth place. Four years later at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, she ended the individual competition in tenth position. Williamson entered her third Olympic Games in 2000 with expectations that she would be a contender for a medal. She was however eliminated in the last sixteen of the women's individual event by the eventual gold medalist Yun Mi-jin of South Korea, who posted a new Olympic record score of 173 for an eighteen-arrow match to beat Williamson's own tournament best by nine points. Williamson had considered herself fortunate to have progressed as one of the last sixteen archers. ;2004 Summer Olympics The 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens marked the fourth time Williamson had contested an Olympic archery event. After advancing through the opening elimination rounds Williamson won a controversial quarter-final against China's He Ying, who shot her ninth arrow outside of the imposed time limit and had her tenth arrow's score voided as a penalty. Williamson was later defeated in the semi-finals by South Korea's Park Sung-hyun, and faced fellow losing semi-finalist Yuan Shu Chi of Chinese Taipei in the bronze medal match. After eleven arrows the pair were tied on points, but Williamson outshot Yuan on the twelfth and final arrow to win by a single point and claim her maiden Olympic medal. Her achievement marked the first Olympic archery medal won by Great Britain since 1992 and the first for a British woman since Sybil Newall in 1908. ;2008 Summer Olympics Williamson was announced to the British Olympic team for her fifth Olympics in June 2008. She was joined by Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess in the women's individual and women's team events, the three having won gold medal at the 2008 Archery World Cup stage in the Dominican Republic earlier that year. In Beijing the three were successful in reaching the semi- finals of the women's team competition before a loss to China relegated them to the bronze medal match against France. Amid difficult weather conditions which postponed the match for 50 minutes, Williamson and her teammates performed below expectations and France emerged as the winners by two points over twenty-four arrows. Williamson was later eliminated from the women's individual event in a surprise defeat to Khatuna Lorig of the United States, who in their twelve-arrow encounter shot a score just two points shy of the Olympic record. Speaking to the BBC after her defeats, Williamson admitted she was contemplating retiring from the sport. She however decided to continue to pursue a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London, saying four years later that she felt \\"a real determination to take part because it was a home games.\\" ;2012 Summer Olympics After having what the BBC called a \\"mixed\\" year in 2011, Williamson stated her goal going into 2012 was to qualify for the upcoming Summer Olympics held in London and expressed a particular desire to win gold medal in the women's team event. In June 2012 Williamson was again successful in being selected for the British Olympic team, equalling the British record set by fencer Bill Hoskyns and athlete Tessa Sanderson in competing in six consecutive Summer Olympic Games. Williamson did not have a strong showing in London. She finished the preliminary ranking round for the women's individual event in forty-seventh place, a position the Evening Standard described as \\"disappointing\\", before being eliminated by Mongolia's Bishindee Urantungalag in the opening elimination round. Her participation in the women's team event also ended at the first stage after she and her teammates Naomi Folkard and Amy Oliver were defeated by Russia. After her defeat to Urantungalag, Williamson said she was undecided about whether to challenge for selection to a seventh Olympic Games in 2016. =Other competitions= Williamson (left) during the medal ceremony for the women's individual recurve event at the 2010 Commonwealth Games ;World Archery Championships Williamson has won two medals at the World Archery Championships. In 1999 she finished with a silver medal, later calling it her \\"worst sporting moment\\" in an interview with The Daily Telegraph in 2004 after shooting below her expectations. In 2007 she and teammates Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess secured bronze medal in the women's team recurve tournament, defeating Italy in the third-place match. By reaching the semi-finals they guaranteed a full berth of three female archers for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. ;2010 Commonwealth Games Williamson won two silver medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, reaching the final of both the women's individual and women's team recurve events. Despite the controversy over the conduct of the Indian crowd during the final of the team event, in which the spectators were criticised for distracting Williamson's teammate Amy Oliver while she shot her final arrow of the match, Williamson acknowledged that the opposing Indian team were \\"worthy winners\\" of the gold medal, saying \\"if you'd offered us silver on the plane on the way over here we possibly would have taken it\\". Her second silver medal came in the final of the individual competition, with India's Deepika Kumari comfortably defeating Williamson by six set points to zero. =Retirement= Following the 2012 Summer Olympics, Williamson said she no longer had the same motivation that had driven her to compete at previous Olympic Games, although victory at the national championships shortly afterwards forestalled an immediate retirement.

McMillan was credited with having introduced the interior world of Black women professionals in their thirties who are successful, alone, available, and unhappy. In 1995, the novel was adapted into a film of the same title, directed by Forest Whitaker and starring Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon. In 1998, another of McMillan's novels, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, was adapted into a film starring Angela Bassett and Taye Diggs. McMillan's novel Disappearing Acts was subsequently produced as a direct-to-cable feature, starring Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Lathan and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. In 2014, Lifetime brought McMillan's A Day Late and a Dollar Short to television audiences, starring Whoopi Goldberg and an ensemble cast featuring Ving Rhames, Tichina Arnold, Mekhi Phifer, Anika Noni Rose, and Kimberly Elise. McMillan also wrote The Interruption of Everything and Getting to Happy, the sequel to Waiting to Exhale.

Based on both the 1962 novel and film versions of Lilies of the Field, it tells the story of a group of German nuns, headed by a determined, dauntless Mother Superior, who manage to get an African American itinerant handyman/jack-of-all-trades named Homer Smith to build a chapel for the New Mexico community in which they live, despite not having money to pay him. Background Styne composed his score with Ethel Merman in mind, but director Joshua Logan cast Shirley Booth instead. Sammy Davis, Jr.'s salary demands put him out of the running, and the role of Homer went to Al Freeman, Jr., whom Logan later described as \\"difficult\\" and \\"antagonistic.\\" Production The musical premiered on Broadway on March 29, 1970 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 25 performances and 31 previews. The musical was the last for Booth, over 70 years old at the time of the premiere, but she garnered unanimous critical raves from the critics. Raymond Bordner wrote: \\"Miss Booth is simply marvelous all the way, and it is a real treat to see her again on Broadway\\".

She is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, winning in the women's team event at the 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2005 she became the women's individual recurve champion at the World Archery Championships and achieved the world number one spot for female recurve archers in the World Archery Rankings. In 2016 the World Archery Federation named her as the ninth best Olympic archer in the history of the Games. Career =Olympic Games= ;2004 Summer Olympics Lee made her Olympic debut aged nineteen at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, joining the defending Olympic champion Yun Mi-jin and the 2001 World Champion Park Sung-hyun on the South Korean women's team. In the preliminary ranking round, which determined the seedings for the elimination rounds of the individual and team events, Lee, Park, and Yun broke the world record for the combined team score over 216 arrows, their total of 2,030 points from a maximum of 2,160 eclipsing the previous best set by the South Korean team at the 2000 Olympics. The score was nevertheless not classified as a new Olympic record because the ranking round took place prior to the opening ceremony. Lee's personal 72-arrow score additionally earned her the second seed for the women's individual event. In the first round of elimination, she faced 63rd-ranked Lamia Bahnasawy of Egypt. Lee defeated Bahnasawy 164‚Äì127 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 34th-ranked Greek archer Elpida Romantzi, defeating her 166‚Äì146. Lee then defeated 15th-ranked Margarita Galinovskaya of Russia 165‚Äì163, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Lee faced Wu Hui Ju of Chinese Taipei, narrowly defeating the 10th-ranked archer 104‚Äì103 in the 12-arrow match. Lee advanced to the semifinals, where she defeated Yuan Shu Chi, also of Chinese Taipei, 104‚Äì98. This moved Lee to the gold medal match, pitting her against fellow Korean Park Sung-hyun. In the final 12-arrow match, Lee lost by two points to the 1st-ranked Park, finishing with a silver medal in women's individual archery while Park won the gold medal. Lee was also a member of the team that won the gold medal for Korea in the women's team archery competition. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, she and her Korean teammates, Park Sung-Hyun Yun Mi-Jun won the team gold medal. ;2012 Summer Olympics Lee took part in her second Olympics at the 2012 London Games as part of the South Korean women's archery team alongside Choi Hyeon-ju and Ki Bo-bae. South Korea were the heavy favourites to win the women's team event, and the trio comfortably defeated Denmark, Japan and China to win South Korea's seventh successive Olympic gold medal in the discipline. =World Championships= Lee joined Park Sung-hyun and Lee Tuk-young on the women's recurve squad for the 2005 Championships in Madrid, where the South Korean team won gold medal in all four recurve competitions for the first time since 1997. Lee herself won two gold medals, the first coming in the women's team event when she, Park, and Lee Tuk-young defeated Ukraine by a margin of fourteen points. She achieved her second gold medal in the women's individual event, where she advanced to the final after defeating Park in their semi-final encounter, an outcome described by the Korea JoongAng Daily as retribution for the loss Park had inflicted upon her at the 2004 Olympics. Lee defeated Lee Tuk-young in the final by two points, commenting afterwards that the calm weather helped her post a strong points total.

From a 1901 collected edition of Wilde's work An Ideal Husband is an 1895 stage play by Oscar Wilde that revolves around blackmail and political corruption, and touches on the themes of public and private honour. The action is set in London, in \\"the present\\", and takes place over the course of twenty-four hours. \\"Sooner or later,\\" Wilde notes, \\"we shall all have to pay for what we do.\\" But he adds that, \\"No one should be entirely judged by their past.\\" Together with The Importance of Being Earnest, it is often considered Wilde's dramatic masterpiece. After Earnest, it is his most popularly produced play.An Ideal Husband Background In the summer of 1893, Oscar Wilde began writing An Ideal Husband; he completed it later that winter. His work began at Goring- on-Thames, after which he named the character Lord Goring, and concluded writing at St James's Place. He initially sent the completed play to the Garrick Theatre, where the manager rejected it, but it was soon accepted by the Haymarket Theatre, where Lewis Waller had temporarily taken control. Waller was an excellent actor and cast himself as Sir Robert Chiltern. The play gave the Haymarket the success it desperately needed. After opening on 3 January 1895, the play continued for 124 performances. In April of that year, Wilde was arrested for \\"gross indecency\\" and his name was publicly removed from the play. On , the same day as Wilde's arrest, the play moved to the Criterion Theatre where it ran from . The play was published in 1899, although Wilde was not listed as its author. This published version differs slightly from the performed play, as Wilde added many passages and cut others. Prominent additions included written stage directions and character descriptions. Wilde was a leader in the effort to make plays accessible to the reading public. Characters *The Earl of Caversham, K.G. *Lord Goring, his son (his forename is Arthur) *Sir Robert Chiltern, Bart., Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs *Vicomte de Nanjac, attach√© at the French embassy in London *Mr. Montford, secretary to Sir Robert Chiltern *Mason, butler to Sir Robert Chiltern *Phipps, butler to Lord Goring *James, footman to Sir Robert Chiltern *Harold, footman to Lord Goring *Lady Chiltern, wife of Sir Robert Chiltern (her forename is Gertrude) *Lady Markby, a friend of the Chilterns and of Mrs. Cheveley *The Countess of Basildon, a friend of the Chilterns *Mrs. Marchmont, a friend of the Chilterns *Miss Mabel Chiltern, Sir Robert Chiltern's sister *Mrs. Cheveley, a blackmailer and Lady Chiltern's former schoolmate (her forename is Laura) Plot =Act I= The play opens during a dinner party at the home of Sir Robert Chiltern in London's fashionable Grosvenor Square. Sir Robert, an esteemed member of the House of Commons, and his wife, Lady Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor and close friend to the Chilterns, Mabel Chiltern, and other genteel guests. During the party, Mrs. Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern from their school days, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina. Apparently, Mrs. Cheveley's late mentor and lover, Baron Arnheim, induced the young Sir Robert to sell him a Cabinet secret - which enabled Arnheim to buy shares in the Suez Canal Company three days before the British government announced its purchase of the company. Arnheim's payoff was the basis of Sir Robert's fortune, and Mrs. Cheveley has Robert's letter to Arnheim as proof of his crime. Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her demands. When Mrs. Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert's change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern, unaware of both her husband's past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise to Mrs. Chevely. For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her having an \\"ideal husband\\"‚Äîthat is, a model spouse in both private and public life whom she can worship; thus, Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions. Sir Robert complies with the lady's wishes and apparently seals his doom. Also toward the end of Act I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Lord Goring gave someone many years ago. Goring takes the brooch and asks that Mabel inform him if anyone comes to retrieve it. =Act II= In the second act, which also takes place at Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife. He also reveals that he and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly engaged. After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel. He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving. Once Goring leaves, Mrs. Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening. Incensed at Sir Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room. Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him. =Act III= In the third act, set in Lord Goring's home, Goring receives a pink letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help, a letter that might be read as a compromising love note. Just as Goring receives this note, however, his father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his son will marry. A visit from Sir Robert, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows. Meanwhile, Mrs. Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognised by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring's drawing room. While she waits, she finds Lady Chiltern's letter. Ultimately, Sir Robert discovers Mrs. Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former lovers, angrily storms out of the house. When she and Lord Goring confront each other, Mrs. Cheveley makes a proposal. Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she offers to exchange Sir Robert's letter for her old beau's hand in marriage. Lord Goring declines, accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns' marriage. He then springs his trap. Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer, he binds it to Cheveley's wrist with a hidden lock. Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession. Apparently Mrs. Cheveley stole it from his cousin, Mary Berkshire, years ago. To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff. After Goring obtains and burns the letter, however, Mrs. Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern's note from his desk. Vengefully she plans to send it to Sir Robert misconstrued as a love letter addressed to Goring. Mrs. Cheveley exits the house in triumph. =Act IV= The final act, which returns to Grosvenor Square, resolves the many plot complications sketched above with a decidedly happy ending. Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel. Lord Caversham informs his son that Sir Robert has denounced the Argentine canal scheme before the House. Lady Chiltern then appears, and Lord Goring informs her that Sir Robert's letter has been destroyed but that Mrs. Cheveley has stolen her note and plans to use it to destroy her marriage. At that moment, Sir Robert enters while reading Lady Chiltern's letter, but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee, he assumes it is meant for him, and reads it as a letter of forgiveness. The two reconcile. Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Sir Robert's decision to renounce his career in politics, but Lord Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign. When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister's hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with Mrs. Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter. Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed. Themes Many of the themes of An Ideal Husband were influenced by the situation Oscar Wilde found himself in during the early 1890s. Stressing the need to be forgiven for past sins, and the irrationality of ruining lives of great value to society because of people's hypocritical reactions to those sins, Wilde may have been speaking to his own situation, and his own fears regarding his affair (still secret). Shaw Festival Study Guide: An Ideal Husband Other themes include the position of women in society. In a climactic moment Gertrude Chiltern \\"learns her lesson\\" and repeats Lord Goring's advice \\"A man's life is of more value than a woman's.\\" Often criticised by contemporary theatre analysers as overt sexism, the idea being expressed in the monologue is that women, despite serving as the source of morality in Victorian era marriages, should be less judgmental of their husbands' mistakes because of complexities surrounding the balance that husbands of that era had to keep between their domestic and their worldly obligations.Ken Bullock. \\"Wilde's Humorous An Ideal Husband Staged by Cal Shakes\\". Berkeley Daily Planet, 17 July 2008. \\"An Ideal Husband Pitlochry review\\", The Guardian, 13 September 2010. Further, the script plays against both sides of feminism and sexism as, for example, Lord Caversham, exclaims near the end that Mabel displays \\"a good deal of common sense\\" after concluding earlier that \\"Common sense is the privilege of our sex.\\" A third theme expresses anti-upper class sentiments. Lady Basildon, and Lady Markby are consistently portrayed as absurdly two-faced, saying one thing one moment, then turning around to say the exact opposite (to great comic effect) to someone else. The overall portrayal of the upper class in England displays an attitude of hypocrisy and strict observance of arbitrary rules. Reception The play proved extremely popular in its original run, lasting over a hundred performances. Critics also lauded Wilde's balance of a multitude of theatrical elements within the play. George Bernard Shaw praised the play, saying \\"Mr. Wilde is to me our only thorough Playwright. He plays with everything; with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre.\\" Yet a week after the opening of the play at the Haymarket Theatre, Oscar Wilde in an interview in Sketch, had dismissed the role of the public and its perceptions in judging the success of his play. Selected production history An Ideal Husband was originally produced by Lewis Waller, premiering on 3 January 1895 at the Haymarket Theatre. The run lasted 124 performances.

Bernstein's website cr.yp.to, London web development company Potato p.ota.to, and uploading services such as uloz.to (which means \\"save it\\" in Czech and Slovak). \\"T.O.\\" (tee-oh) is also a common nickname for Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and is used as a city domain as exemplified by popular Toronto sites Budtender.to (Cannabis Dispensary Reviews) and Jobs.to (Job Bank Toronto). This domain is also used for the city of Torino (Turin), Italy, and also as a domain hack in Slavic languages (to meaning it). As the .to domains are purchased, all normal DNS operations are possible and registered sites are not required to display ads on behalf of the registrar. Some domains are free, like .edu.to, but only to real Tongan educational institutions. At this moment businesses registered in Tonga can also get free domains.

Park made her international archery debut in 2001, winning the women's recurve title at that year's World Archery Championships. Her Olympic debut came at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she won gold medals in both the women's individual and women's team events. She won two further medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics, achieving her third Olympic gold in the women's team event before earning the silver medal as the runner-up in the women's individual event. During her career Park achieved success in a variety of international competitions. She was the first South Korean archer to achieve gold medals at the Olympics, the World Championships, the Asian Games, and the Asian Championships. She is the only recurve archer to post at least 1,400 points in a 144-arrow round, and was from 2004 to 2015 the world record holder for the women's 72-arrow round. In 2016 the World Archery Federation named her as the greatest Olympic archer of the 21st century and the third greatest archer of all time. Early and personal life Park was born on 1 January 1983 in Incheon. She married fellow archer and Olympic gold medalist Park Kyung-mo in December 2008, disclosing their intention to wed following the 2008 Summer Olympics to avoid disrupting the national team during the Olympic competitions. As of the 2008 Summer Olympics Park lived in Gunsan in western South Korea. She has three daughters. Career =Olympic career= 2004 Summer Olympics Park began the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a new women's world record for the preliminary 72-arrow ranking round, scoring 682 points (from a maximum of 720) to surpass the previous best of 679 set by Italy's Natalia Valeeva three months earlier. With teammates Lee Sung-jin and Yun Mi-jin she also set a new world record for the women's team event over 216 arrows, the three scoring a combined total of 2,030 points from a maximum of 2,160. Because the ranking round took place prior to the opening ceremony, neither score was classified as a new Olympic record. Park and Lee both advanced to the final of the women's individual competition, where Park defeated her teammate by a score of 110-108 over twelve arrows to take the gold medal, South Korea's sixth in the event. Park won her second gold two days later when she, Lee, and Yun outscored China by a single point in the final of the women's team event to achieve their nation's fifth consecutive gold medal in the discipline. As the designated final shooter in the team, Park was responsible for scoring the ten points on the last arrow required to win the match. 2008 Summer Olympics The Olympic Green Archery Field in Beijing, where Park was defeated by Zhang Juanjuan in the women's individual final at the 2008 Olympics Heading into the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Park was favoured to defend her Olympic titles. She and her teammate Yun Ok-hee were named as the favourites to take the women's individual gold medal, and the South Korean team were highly tipped to retain their women's team title for a sixth consecutive Olympic Games. Park began by scoring 673 points in the ranking round for the women's individual event, concluding the round in first place and equalling the existing Olympic record set by Ukraine's Lina Herasymenko at the 1996 Summer Olympics. With a combined tally of 2,004 points, Park, Yun, and Joo Hyun-jung also achieved a new Olympic record for the women's team event. The trio went on to defeat Italy, France, and China in succession to take a sixth successive Olympic title in the women's team competition. Park was also successful in progressing to her second Olympic women's individual final. Her opponent was China's Zhang Juanjuan, who had finished the ranking round in twenty-seventh position and had earlier eliminated Park's teammates Yun and Joo en route to the gold medal match. The match marked the third time the pair had met in an Olympic final after contesting the last two finals of the women's team event. In a close match Zhang defeated Park one point, becoming the first archer from outside South Korea to win the women's individual title in twenty-four years and breaking what was then the sixth- longest Olympic winning streak. In a press conference following the match Park expressed disappointment about failing to maintain South Korea's winning record, but spoke of her silver medal result giving her the motivation and drive to seek further gold medals. She also felt that her loss would lighten the pressure placed on Korean archers to see victory as the only acceptable result in future competitions. Speaking about her defeat in 2016, Park reflected that she \\"was maybe too greedy about getting the gold medal. I ended up not being careful enough with my actions.\\" =World Championships= Park contested every edition of the biennial World Archery Championships from 2001 to 2007, winning a medal in each of her four appearances. She became the women's recurve world champion at the age of eighteen in 2001, and with teammates Yun Mi-jin and Lee Hyun-jung dominated the women's individual event at the 2003 Championships in New York City. Having finished the ranking round in the top three positions, Park, Yun, and Lee all advanced to the medal matches, where Park lost to Yun in the final to finish with the silver medal as runner-up. Park was joined by Lee Sung-jin and Lee Tuk-young for the 2005 Championships in Madrid. The South Korean team was dominant once more, winning the gold medal in all four recurve competitions for the first time since 1997. Park, Lee, and Lee retained the women's team title with victory over Ukraine, though a semi-final loss to Lee Sung-jin eliminated Park from gold medal contention in women's individual event. Park later defeated Natalia Valeeva of Italy to win the bronze medal. The 2007 Championships in Leipzig saw Park contribute to South Korea's third consecutive women's team title with Lee Tuk- young and Choi Eun-young. =Asian Games= Park competed at the 2002 Asian Games, where she won a gold medal in the team event. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha Park achieved two gold medals. Her first came in the women's individual event, where she defeated compatriot Yun Ok-hee in the final to claim her first individual title at the Games. Park's second gold medal was won in the women's team event where she, Yun, and Yun Mi-jin defeated China to win a third consecutive title for South Korea, setting a new Asian Games record for a 24-arrow match in the process. Afterwards Park said she felt greater satisfaction in winning the team event and expressed joy that the tournament was over in light of the pressure placed upon the South Korean team. Records At the 2004 Summer Olympics Park set a new world record for the women's 72-arrow round with 682 points from a maximum of 720. Her score would remain unbroken for almost eleven years before her compatriot Ki Bo-bae scored 686 points during the Summer Universiade in July 2015. At the 2008 Olympics Park scored an Olympic-record 115 points from a possible 120 for the 12-arrow match, a tally matched hours later by Zhang Juanjuan, her eventual opponent in the gold medal match. As of 2016 Park remains the only recurve archer to score more than 1,400 points in a 144-arrow FITA round, recording a total of 1,405 points in 2004.

Depending on the court, a plaintiff would purchase a writ in Chancery (or file a bill) which would set in motion a series of events eventually leading to a trial in one of the medieval common law courts. Each writ entailed a different set of procedures and remedies which together amounted to the \\"form of action\\". The forms of action were abolished during the 19th century, but they have left an indelible mark on the law. In the early Middle Ages, the focus was on the procedure that was employed to bring one's claim to the royal courts of King's Bench or Common Pleas: it was the form of one's action, not its substance, which occupied legal discussion. This restrictive approach is one of the reasons which attracted litigants to petition the King directly, which eventually led to the development of a separate court known as the Court of Chancery, from which the body of law known as equity derives. Modern English law, as in most other legal systems, now looks to substance rather than to form: a claimant need only demonstrate that he or she has a valid cause of action. Forms of action The substantive law lay buried beneath the various actions: medieval practitioners and judges thought procedurally, not substantively.See generally Sir John Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History (4th ed); S. F. C. Milsom, Historical Foundations of the Common Law (2nd ed). Rights and duties which we would consider to be part of the law of property, tort, contract or unjust enrichment were not conceptualised as such. In the early medieval period, justice was administered at a local level. Following the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, a system of royal central justice gradually took shape. The principal royal courts were King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer. These royal courts were initially only interested in matters relating to the feudal system: that is, to land law. Accordingly, many of the earliest writs dealt with real property. For example: * Writ of right * assize of novel disseisin * assize of mort d'ancestor * Writ of entry sur disseisin in the per and cui * Writ of besaiel * Writ of quare impedit * Ejectment Over time, the royal courts began to take notice of other cases. These early writs were in the praecipe form: they commanded that the defendant perform a certain act or else appear and explain why he had not done so. Examples include the writs of covenant, debt and account. Such writs demanded something as of right.See Sir John Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History (4th ed) The royal courts were initially only concerned with complaints of wrong if the wrong involved a forcible breach of the King's Peace. Such wrongs were enforced by a writ of trespass vi et armis contra pacem regis. During the 14th century the royal courts gradually allowed actions which did not involve breaches of the King's Peace. Instead, the plaintiff would set out his 'special case' in an extra clause, specifying the damage sustained which justified the bringing of an action. This was known as a trespass on the case. From the trespass on the case developed many other forms of action. Apart from the actions which dealt with real property, other significant forms of action include: * Action of covenant * Action of debt sur obligation (\\"Debt on an obligation\\") * Action of debt sur contract (\\"Debt on a contract\\") * Action of detinue * Action of account * Trespass vi et armis contra pacem regis (\\"Trespass with force and arms against the King's peace\\") * Trespass sur la case (\\"Trespass on the case\\" or \\"action on the case\\") ** Conversion ** Nuisance ** Negligence ** Deceit ** Action on the case for words (Defamation, Slander) ** Assumpsit *** Special assumpsit *** Indebitatus assumpsit **** Action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use **** Action for money paid to the defendant's use **** Quantum meruit **** Quantum valebant Many actions developed from the action on the case during the later history of the common law. The three most significant of these were:See generally, Sir John Baker, An Introduction to Legal History (4th ed); David Ibbetson, Historical Introduction to the Law of Obligations (2nd ed). * The action of assumpsit, the rapid expansion of which is traced to Slade's Case (1602). The medieval law of contract developed in a fractured way through the old actions of covenant, debt and account. In the 1500s litigants began to use the action on the case to enforce contractual agreements (with the exception of contracts under seal, for which debt sur obligation was required), a shift vindicated in Slade's Case. The modern law of contract then gradually began to take shape. * The action of indebitatus assumpsit. Following the recognition in Slade's Case (1602) that assumpsit could be brought in lieu of debt sur contract, a form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit took shape. This action developed several sub-forms known as the common money counts. These actions were initially used to enforce what we would call contractual liability, but they rested on the court implying that a defendant had promised to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff. This promise initially reflected reality, but came to be used fictitiously. Thus where A mistakenly paid money to B, the law would imply a promise by B that B would repay the money: A could then bring an action for money had and received and recover the mistaken payment. The defendant's obligation was not consensually undertaken, but imposed by law. From such actions came the law of quasi- contract. This area of law is now known as the law of unjust enrichment. * The action on the case for negligence, the rapid expansion of which is traced to Donoghue v Stevenson [1932]. The tort of negligence lies at the heart of the modern law of tort, which also includes obligations enforced via the old actions of trespass (to the person, to goods, and to land), actions on the case, conversion, deceit, and defamation. England One of the reasons for the crystallisation of particular forms of action in English common law is the fact that actions in the royal courts were commenced by use of a writ purchased in Chancery. Initially, the clerks of the Chancery were permitted to devise new writs to deal with new situations. This freedom was drastically curtailed by the Provisions of Oxford. By the 14th century, the common law had begun to show some of its defects. First, different forms of action would result in different procedures, meaning that one's chance of success was strongly dependent upon the form of action which was used. The forms were mandatory: if the wrong form was used, a case would be dismissed with prejudice. Secondly, the common law had strict rules of evidence. For example, a deed was conclusive proof of a defendant's liability to pay. If a plaintiff brought a writ of debt sur obligation against the defendant, but the defendant had already paid the debt, the defendant would still be held liable to pay unless he could produce a deed of acquittance. Problems such as these prompted litigants to turn to the Court of Chancery, which had begun to develop judicial functions in the early 14th century. =Abolition of the forms= Because the forms of action remained largely static from the 13th century, English lawyers and judges formulated a number of legal fictions in order to fit new types of cases within the existing forms. For example, in a writ of debt sur contract, the defendant could generally elect between having a jury trial or wager of law. The latter was a particularly undesired option for a plaintiff because the defendant could hire oath-helpers. This and other restrictions (for example, that the sum the plaintiff sued for had to be a fixed rather than an unliquidated sum) made debt sur contract undesirable for enforcing oral contracts. In the 16th century, litigants began to bring an action on the case instead: an action of assumpsit. The plaintiff would allege that, because the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had undertook (assumpsit) to pay the money. The Court of King's Bench gradually accepted that the subsequent promise did not need not be proven: the defendant's alleged promise to pay the antecedent debt would be supplied by law. This view was vindicated in Slade's Case (1602). The forms themselves remained unchallenged. The Court of Chancery eventually ceased to be the answer to the restrictive approach at common law. By the 16th century the intervention of the Chancellor was increasingly said to depend on principles, rather than on some unbounded discretion. Chancery developed a stronger system of precedent and, in the words of Professor Sir John Baker, \\"hardened into law\\".See Sir John Baker, An Introduction to English Legal History (4th ed) During the 19th century, Parliament passed several laws to simplify legal procedure, and the old forms of action were gradually swept away: * For personal forms of action, the Uniformity of Process Act 1832 (2 Will. IV, c.39) imposed a single uniform process. The older forms of writ were abolished and a new form of writ was to be used, although the writ had to state the form of action that was being used. * The next year, most real and mixed actions were abolished, by the Real Property Limitation Act 1833 (3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 27, sec 36). * There then followed the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76), which dropped the requirement that any particular form of action should be mentioned within a writ. * Finally, with the passage of the Judicature Act 1873, the last vestiges of the forms of action were removed. The flexible bill procedure of Chancery was adopted by the common law courts. It was now only necessary to state the facts sufficient to give rise to one's cause of action. = The substantive law = With the abolition of the forms of action, it became necessary (and for the first time truly possible) to perceive the substantive law beneath the various actions. In terms of the private law of obligations, the following points can be noted. * Contract. The various writs by which agreements could be enforced became part of a modern law of contract, explicable in terms of consensually assumed obligation. But traces of the old forms of action remain. For example, it is not necessary to show that a claimant has provided consideration where she sues on a deed. This is because consideration was never a requirement in the action of debt sur obligation. * Tort. The various writs which involved complaint of a civil wrong and a demand for a remedy came together in a law of tort. * Unjust enrichment. At first, common law restitutionary obligations were appended to the law of contract and said to form a law of quasi-contract. Motivated by the writing of scholars from Oxford and Cambridge the courts gradually accepted that such obligations were of another kind, underpinned by the concept of unjust enrichment.See generally, Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, The Law of Restitution (1st ed, 1966); Peter Birks, An Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1985); Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Andrew Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011). In Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1991] the House of Lords explicitly recognised the independent existence of the law of unjust enrichment. South Australia The Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 and 16 Vic., c. 76) was enacted prior to the promulgation of the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 and while it was repealed in England, continued to apply by paramount force in South Australia. The Supreme Court Act 1935 grants to the Supreme Court of South Australia the like jurisdiction exercised by both the common law and equity courts of England prior to the enactment of the Judiciary Acts which included the initiation of a personal jurisdiction over a person in a case by virtue of the issue of a writ of summons. The judges of the Court were given power to regulate the procedure of the Court within jurisdiction and preserved the Rules of Court extant at 1935 in cases not otherwise provided for. The writ of summons is the common originating process, but takes a form approved under the present rules. United States The forms of action survived much longer in the United States. New York was the first to abolish them, by enacting a Code of Civil Procedure in 1850 at the suggestion of David Dudley Field II. Twenty-three other states eventually followed. Section 307 of the California Code of Civil Procedure is a typical example of how the forms of action were abolished in those states: \\"There is in this State but one form of civil actions for the enforcement or protection of private rights and the redress or prevention of private wrongs.\\" However, the forms of action persisted in the federal courts until 1938, when the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were promulgated pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act. Rule 2, at that time, stated: \\"There shall be one form of action to be known as 'civil action.'\\" Since 35 U.S. states now use versions of the FRCP in their state courts and the remaining 15 states are all \\"code pleading\\" states, so the forms of action are now obsolete in the United States.

They were horsemen, foot brigades and partially armed, creating chaos and delivering intelligence about the enemy positions to benefit the army they accompanied. The earliest mention of them is found during Aurangzeb's campaign in the Deccan, but their role expanded with the Maratha armed campaign against the Mughal empire. They were highly effective against the enemies given their rapid and chaotic thrust into enemy territories, but also caused serious abuses against allies such as the Pindari raid on Sringeri Sharada Peetham in 1791. After several cases of abuse where the Pindaris plundered the territories of Maratha allies, the Maratha rulers such as Shivaji issued extensive regulations upon the Pindari contingent seeking to carefully limit their predatory actions. The majority of Pindari leaders were Muslims, but they recruited from all classes according to Encyclopaedia Britannica. To fight them, competing groups of Pindaris formed from Hindu ascetics-turned- warriors. According to David Lorenzen, after the collapse of the Mughal empire upon Aurangzeb's death, Nawabs and Hindu kingdoms entered into open conflicts and warring factions. Local landowners organized their own private armies, while the monks and ascetics of temples and monasteries transitioned into mercenary soldiers to protect their interests. The Pindaris were dispersed throughout central India, the Deccan and regions that are now parts of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. By 1795, instead of being associated with a war effort, the armed Pindari militia groups sought easy wealth for their leaders and themselves. There were an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Pindari militia around 1800-1815 CE who looted villages, captured people as slaves for sale, and challenged the authority of local Muslim sultanates, Hindu kingdoms, and the British colonies. The period of 1795 to 1804 came to be called the \\"Gardi-ka-wakt\\" (\\"period of unrest\\") in north-central India. Lord Hastings of the colonial British era led a coalition of regional armies in early 19th- century to end the Pindari militia through military action and offering employment with regular salaries to the Pindaris in exchange for abandoning their freebooting, plundering habits. Etymology The term Pindar may derive from pinda, an intoxicating drink. It is a Marathi name that possibly connotes a \\"bundle of grass\\" or \\"who takes\\". They are also referred to as Bidaris in some historic texts. Appearance The Pindaris of the Indian subcontinent adorned a Turban, these individuals were generally \\"half-naked\\" wearing only a girdle; they were armed with archaic models of the deadly Talwar, they also wore archaic footwear. They were militantly associated with any established political communal principality or state. Pindaris were often involved in proxy wars and carried out atrocities while they would extort wealth from their targeted areas. History =Muslim sultanates and Mughal Empire era= According to Tapan Raychaudhuri, Irfan Habib et al., the Mughal army \\"always had in its train the \\"Bidari\\" pronounced in Arabic), the privileged and recognized thieves who first plundered the enemy territory and everything they could find\\". The Deccan sultanates and Aurangzeb's campaign in central India deployed them against Hindu kingdoms such as Golconda, and in Bengal. The unpaid cavalry got compensated for their services by \\"burning and looting everywhere\\". The Hindu Marathas, in their war against the Mughals, evolved this concept to \\"its logical extreme\\", state Raychaudhuri and Habib, by expanding the Pindaris brigade, encouraging them not only to loot the Muslim territories but gather and deliver food to their regular army. The Maratha army never carried provisions, and gathered their resources and provisions from the enemy territory as they invaded and conquered more regions of the collapsing Mughal state. The Italian traveler Niccolao Manucci, in his memoir about the Mughal Empire, wrote about Bederia (Pidari), stating that \\"these are the first to invade the enemy's territory, where they plunder everything they find.\\" According to the Indologist and South Asia historian Richard Eaton, plunder of frontier regions was a part of the strategy that contributed wealth and propelled the Sultanate systems in the Indian subcontinent. The Ghaznavid sultans, states Eaton, \\"plundered north Indian cities from bases in Afghanistan in 10th- and 11th-century\\". This strategy continued in the campaigns of the Delhi Sultanate, such as those of Khalji sultans who plundered the populations beyond the Vindhyas in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. This pattern, states Eaton, created a \\"self-perpetuating cycle: cash minted from raided temple wealth could be used to recruit yet more slaves from beyond India, who could, in turn, be used for mounting further military expeditions undertaken for still more plunder\\". Babur similarly benefited from plundering raids into Hind, followed by withdrawal to Kabul, gaining financial resources. The plunder and wars ultimately overthrew the Delhi Sultanate and founded the Mughal Empire. Plunder, along with taxes and tribute payments contributed to growing imperial revenues for the Mughal rulers, states John Richards. Beyond the direct raids by the Mughals, plunder of villagers and urban areas along with temples were a significant source of wealth accumulation by the local governors and Deccan sultanates. Every victory of the Mughals between 1561 and 1687, states Richards, generated a \\"large amounts of plundered treasure from the hoards of defeated rulers\\". The Bidaris of the Aurangzeb's army and the Pindaris of the Maratha army extended this tradition of violence and plunder in their pursuit of the political and ideological wars. Shivaji, and later his successors in the name of his dynasty, included the Pindaris in their war strategy. Deploying the Pindaris, they plundered the Mughal and Sultanate territories surrounding the Maratha empire and used the plundered wealth to sustain the Maratha army. They also plundered the ships loaded with goods and treasure leaving Mughal ports for the Arabian sea and those departing with passengers heading for Hajj to Mecca. The devastation and disruption by the Pindaris not only strengthened the Marathas, the Pindaris helped weaken and frustrate the Muslim sultans in preserving a stable kingdom they could rule or rely on for revenues. The Maratha strategy also embarrassed Aurangzeb and his court. The same Pindari- assisted strategy help the Marathas block and reverse the Mughal era gains in south India as far as Gingee and Trichurapalli. Pindaris loyal to Siraj-ud- Daulah carry out the Black Hole of Calcutta incident, 20 June 1756. =Maratha era= Marathas adopted the Bidaris militia of the earlier era. Their Pindaris were not from any particular religion or caste.; Most of the Pindari leaders who plundered for the Mughals and the Marathas were Muslims. The famed Pindari leaders in the historic literature include Namdar Khan, Dost Mohammad, Wasil Mohammad, Chitu Khan, Khajeh Bush, Fazil Khan, Amir Khan and others. Similarly, Hindu leaders of Pindaris included the Gowaris, Alande, Ghyatalak, Kshirsagar, Ranshing and Thorat. Hindu ascetics and monks were another pool that volunteered as militia to save their temples and villages from the Muslim invaders but also disrupted enemy supply lines and provided reconnaissance to the Marathas. According to Randolf Cooper, the Pindaris who served the Marathas were a volunteer militia that included men and their wives, along with enthusiastic followers that sometimes swelled to some 50,000 people at the frontline of a war. They moved swiftly and performed the following duties: destabilize enemy's standing army and state apparatus by creating chaos; isolate enemy armed units by harassing them, provoke and waste enemy resources; break or confuse the logistical and communication lines of the enemy; gather intelligence about the size and armament of the enemy; raid enemy food and fodder to supply resources for the Marathas and deplete the same for the enemy. The Pindaris of the Marathas did not attack the enemy infantry, rather operated by picketing the civilians, outposts, trade routes and the territorial sidelines. Once the confusion had set in among the enemy ranks, the trained and armed contingents of the Marathas attacked the enemy army. The Marathas, in some cases, collected palpatti ‚Äì a form of tax ‚Äì from the hordes of their Pindari plunderers to participate with them during their invasions. The Pindaris were a major resource for the Marathas, but they also created abuse where the Pindaris raided and plundered the allies. Shivaji introduced extensive regulations to check and manage the targeted predatory actions of the Pindaries. During the Third Battle of Panipat, Vishwasrao was in command of thousands of Pindari units. Pindari War (1817-18) After the arrival of the British East India Company among the chaos of a collapsed Mughal Empire and warring kingdoms, the Pindaris emerged as centers of violence and power. By late 18th-century, the Maratha empire had fragmented, the British colonial era had arrived and the Pindaris had transformed from being involved in regional wars to looting for the sake of their own and their leaders' wealth. They conducted raids for plunder to enrich themselves, or to whichever state was willing to hire them. Sometimes they worked for both sides in a conflict, causing heavy damages to the civilian populations of both sides. They advanced through central India, Gujarat and Malwa, with protection from rulers from Gwalior and Indore. With the plundered wealth, they had also acquired cannons and more deadly military equipment to challenge local troops and law enforcement personnel. The Amir Khan-linked Pindaris, for example, brought 200 canons to seize and loot Jaipur. According to Edward Thompson, the Pindaris led by Amir Khan and those led by Muhammad Khan had become nearly independent mobile satellite confederacy that launched annual loot and plunder campaigns, after the monsoon harvest season, on rural and urban settlements. Along with cash, produce and family wealth, these Pindari leaders took people as slaves for sale. They attacked regions under British control, the Hindu rajas, and the Muslim sultans. Ultimately, the British and the general population became so frustrated that they formed a coalition to end the Pindari habits. In early 19th-century, this precipitated the Pindari War. Lord Hastings, with the approval of the Court of Directors of the East India Company, decided to eliminate the Pindaris. In cooperation with armies from Gujarat, the Deccan and Bengal, some 120,000 troops surrounded the Malwa region and Gwalior to force the surrender and outlawing of Pindaris. In addition to the military action, the British coalition also offered regular employment to some of the Pindari militia by converting them into a separate contingent of its forces. A minority were given jobs as police and offered pensions or Nawab position along with land to their leaders such as Namdar Khan and Amir Khan. A few such as Saiyid Ahmad of Rai Bareilly, states Thomas Hardy, shifted to the Islamic Jihadi movement, while small bands took to sporadic crimes of harassing tradespeople and farmers through kidnapping and blackmail after the end of the Pindari war.

The joke is a prank whereby the punch line has no relation to the body of the joke; but participants in the prank pretend otherwise. The effect is to either trick someone into laughing along as if they \\"get it\\" or to ridicule them for not understanding. The joke became popular in New York in the 1950s. The punch line is known for its use as a basic sociological and psychological experiment, specifically relating to mob mentality and the pressure to conform. The basic setup is similar to the Asch conformity experiments, in which people showed a proclivity to agree with a group despite their own judgments. Execution of the prank This prank usually requires a teller and two listeners, one of whom is an accomplice who already knows the joke and secretly plays along with the teller. The joke teller says something like, \\"The elephant and the hippopotamus were taking a bath. And the elephant said to the hippo, 'Please pass the soap.' The hippo replied, 'No soap, radio.'\\" The accomplice laughs at the punchline, while the second listener is left puzzled. In some cases, the second listener will pretend to understand the joke and laugh along with the others to avoid appearing foolish. The purpose of the prank is to elicit one of two responses from the victim: * False understanding ‚Äì when the victim acts as if the joke is humorous, when in fact the victim does not understand the joke at all. * Negative understanding ‚Äì when the victim expresses confusion about what the joke means and feels left out (e.g., \\"I don't get it\\"). The conspirators are now prepared to mock the victim for the victim's \\"inability to get it\\". Sometimes, if the second listener does not respond right away, there is an \\"explanation\\" of the joke to the second listener, which involves the teller and the first listener emphasizing words or elongating pauses, but providing no further information, e.g. \\"Don't you get it? No soooap... radio!\\" Other examples of the joke: * A woman goes into her bathroom and is shocked to find an elephant in her bathtub. She asks the elephant, \\"What are you doing in my bathtub?\\" The elephant responds, \\"No soap, radio!\\" * Two polar bears are sitting in a bathtub. The first one says, \\"Pass the soap.\\" The second one says, \\"No soap, radio!\\" * A foreign man is flying in an airplane. He points out of the window at the unfamiliar countryside below and exclaims, \\"No soap... radio?\\" Origin The phrase \\"no soap\\" possibly originated around 1860 when it was first recorded, meaning \\"I haven't any money\\" or \\"I will not lend you money\\". Its contemporary connotation is \\"not a chance\\" or \\"nothing doing\\". However, the phrase itself was being employed in an absurd and humorous context as early as the 1750s, when it appeared in a well-known piece of literary nonsense by English dramatist and actor Samuel Foote in order to test the memory of a rival: \\"So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming up the street, pops its head into the shop. 'What! No soap?' So he died, and she very imprudently married the barber.\\"The Great Panjandrum Comedy As a practical joke the trick is an example of anti-humor or surreal comedy. The scenario resulting from false understanding is a demonstration of groupthink and peer pressure ‚Äì the desire to conform to one's peers ‚Äì despite the fact that the entire joke has no hidden meaning, nothing to \\"get\\" and no punchline. Popular culture The joke has become widely known and entered popular culture in other forms, including a shower radio named \\"No Soap-Radio!\\" It has been used as the name for rock bands, as well as a short-lived TV sketch comedy show (No Soap, Radio) starring Steve Guttenberg that aired on ABC in the spring of 1982. No Soap Radio was also the name of a radio commercial production company in New York City formed in 1970, later renamed No Soap Productions. In the episode of The Simpsons, \\"Homer the Heretic\\", a radio is seen hanging in the shower with a label on it showing the brand of radio to be \\"No Soap-Radio.\\" In ‚ÄúPie-o-my‚Äù, the fifth episode of the fourth season of ‚ÄúThe Sopranos‚Äù, the name of the band playing at The Crazy Horse is No Soap Radio.

A seventh genus, sometimes accepted in the past (Notobuxus), has been shown by genetic studies to be included within Buxus (Balthazar et al., 2000). The family is recognised by most taxonomists, and is commonly known as the box family. However, its placement and circumscription has varied; some taxonomists treated Styloceras in its own family Stylocerataceae, Didymeles in its own family Didymelaceae, Haptanthus in Haptanthaceae (now all included in Buxaceae)), and formerly Simmondsia was included, which is not related and now usually placed in its own family Simmondsiaceae. The APG II system of 2003 recognises the family, but in a new circumscription in that it includes the genus Didymeles (two species of evergreen trees from Madagascar). However, APG II does allow the option of segregating this genus as family Didymelaceae, as an optional segregate. This represents a slight change from the APG system of 1998, which firmly recognised both families as separate. In both APG and APG II, the family Buxaceae is unplaced as to order and left among the basal lineages of the eudicots. The AP website suggests instating the order Buxales for this family and the family Didymelaceae.

It contained a single pusher engine, pilot, and forward gunner. The remaining engines were tractor mounted at the front of each fuselage. At least one variation of the central nacelle seated the crew in a two-seat tandem format with the forward position for a gunner/pilot and the rear position for the pilot. Others used a forward gunner with side-by-side pilot positions to the rear of the gunner. Two rear gunners were positioned, one in each boom behind the center wing. An engineer or second pilot could also be accommodated there. Armament consisted of four (but up to eight) Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns in front ring mounts and two boom ring mounts. Bombs were suspended in a bomb bay, which was a long and narrow container fixed to a lower wing. Photographs show at least four different arrangements with regard to the bombing nacelle. * 1. No nacelle - presumably not a combat configuration. * 2. A tall, narrow nacelle that housed approximately 12 internal bombs vertically and another 18‚Äì20 strapped to the outside. * 3.

A few Ca.41s were powered by Isotta Fraschini engines instead. These were referred to internally by Caproni as the Caproni 750 hp. A total of 41 were built. * Caproni Ca.42 - powered by Liberty V-12 engines and known internally as the Caproni 1,200 hp. 12 built. * Caproni Ca.43 - single example of a floatplane variant. * Caproni Ca.48 - Airliners converted from Ca.42s after World War I; the Ca.48 first flew in 1919. The double-deck passenger cabin mounted between the booms seated a total of 23 passengers who entered via the nose nacelle; 16 of them sat in the lower cabin on long benches alongside its walls with large windows providing them with good views, and the other seven passengers sat on an upper deck, as did the pilots. The Ca.48 was powered by three Liberty L-12 engines. Although it is unlikely that the Ca.48 ever entered airline service, a Ca.48 did visit the First Aviation Exhibition Amsterdam of August‚ÄìSeptember 1919, where it was very popular with visitors, among whom was Prince Hendrick (1876‚Äì1934), Prince Consort of the Netherlands (1901‚Äì1934).\\"The Italian Aircraft on the ELTA of 1919\\", europeanairlines.no * Caproni Ca.51 - single example of a considerably enlarged design with biplane tail and tail barbette.

Production figures differ in publications. The most likely number is 38 of all Ca.4 variants (other quoted figures are: 38 of Ca.40 and Ca.41 and 6 Ca.42 or 32 Ca.42 and 21 of other variants). Numerous publications incorrectly refer to all variants as the Ca.42. Operational history Ca.4s were tested by the Italian Air Force in 1917 and began operations in 1918. They were used for attacking targets in Austria-Hungary. In April 1918, six Ca.42s were issued to the British RNAS (No. 227 Sqn) but were never used operationally and were returned to Italy after the war.Munson, Kenneth. Bombers 1914‚Äì1919. London: Blandford, 1968. At least three CA.42s were sent to the United States for evaluation. After the war, the Ca. 4 was replaced in Italy by the Ca.36. Despite its unstable and fragile appearance, the Ca.4 was well designed. Its size, without regard to its height, was not any larger than that of other foreign heavy bombers. With Liberty engines, it had a fast speed, similar to other heavy bombers, while its bombload had one of the largest capacities of that era, surpassed only by that of the Imperial German: Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI. If it had been flown with other engines, its performance would have suffered. On 2 August 1919, after its wings apparently collapsed in mid-flight at an altitude of 3,000 feet (912 meters), a Ca.48 airliner crashed at Verona, Italy, during a flight from Venice to Taliedo, Milan.Flight, 7 August 1919, p. 1053. All on board died. It was Italy's first commercial aviation disaster and one of the earliest heavier-than-air airliner disasters.

A *-representation œÄ of A on a Hilbert space H is irreducible if, and only if, there is no closed subspace K different from H and {0} which is invariant under all operators œÄ(x) with x ‚àà A. We implicitly assume that irreducible representation means non-null irreducible representation, thus excluding trivial (i.e. identically 0) representations on one-dimensional spaces. As explained below, the spectrum √Ç is also naturally a topological space; this is similar to the notion of the spectrum of a ring. One of the most important applications of this concept is to provide a notion of dual object for any locally compact group. This dual object is suitable for formulating a Fourier transform and a Plancherel theorem for unimodular separable locally compact groups of type I and a decomposition theorem for arbitrary representations of separable locally compact groups of type I. The resulting duality theory for locally compact groups is however much weaker than the Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality theory for compact topological groups or Pontryagin duality for locally compact abelian groups, both of which are complete invariants. That the dual is not a complete invariant is easily seen as the dual of any finite-dimensional full matrix algebra Mn(C) consists of a single point.  Primitive spectrum  The topology of √Ç can be defined in several equivalent ways. We first define it in terms of the primitive spectrum . The primitive spectrum of A is the set of primitive ideals Prim(A) of A, where a primitive ideal is the kernel of an irreducible *-representation. The set of primitive ideals is a topological space with the hull-kernel topology (or Jacobson topology). This is defined as follows: If X is a set of primitive ideals, its hull-kernel closure is : \\\\overline{X} = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\rho \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Prim}(A): \\\\rho \\\\supseteq \\\\bigcap_{\\\\pi \\\\in X} \\\\pi \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. Hull-kernel closure is easily shown to be an idempotent operation, that is : \\\\overline{\\\\overline{X}} = \\\\overline{X}, and it can be shown to satisfy the Kuratowski closure axioms. As a consequence, it can be shown that there is a unique topology œÑ on Prim(A) such that the closure of a set X with respect to œÑ is identical to the hull-kernel closure of X. Since unitarily equivalent representations have the same kernel, the map œÄ ‚Ü¶ ker(œÄ) factors through a surjective map : \\\\operatorname{k}: \\\\hat{A} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Prim}(A). We use the map k to define the topology on √Ç as follows: Definition. The open sets of √Ç are inverse images k‚àí1(U) of open subsets U of Prim(A). This is indeed a topology. The hull-kernel topology is an analogue for non-commutative rings of the Zariski topology for commutative rings. The topology on √Ç induced from the hull-kernel topology has other characterizations in terms of states of A.  Examples  = Commutative C*-algebras = singletons. See details at the image description page. The spectrum of a commutative C*-algebra A coincides with the Gelfand dual of A (not to be confused with the dual A' of the Banach space A). In particular, suppose X is a compact Hausdorff space. Then there is a natural homeomorphism : \\\\operatorname{I}: X \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Prim}( \\\\operatorname{C}(X)). This mapping is defined by : \\\\operatorname{I}(x) = \\\\\\\\{f \\\\in \\\\operatorname{C}(X): f(x) = 0 \\\\\\\\}. I(x) is a closed maximal ideal in C(X) so is in fact primitive. For details of the proof, see the Dixmier reference. For a commutative C*-algebra, : \\\\hat{A} \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Prim}(A). = The C*-algebra of bounded operators = Let H be a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. L(H) has two norm-closed *-ideals: I0 = {0} and the ideal K = K(H) of compact operators. Thus as a set, Prim(L(H)) = {I0, K}. Now * {K} is a closed subset of Prim(L(H)). * The closure of {I0} is Prim(L(H)). Thus Prim(L(H)) is a non-Hausdorff space. The spectrum of L(H) on the other hand is much larger. There are many inequivalent irreducible representations with kernel K(H) or with kernel {0}. = Finite-dimensional C*-algebras = Suppose A is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. It is known A is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of full matrix algebras: : A \\\\cong \\\\bigoplus_{e \\\\in \\\\operatorname{min}(A)} Ae, where min(A) are the minimal central projections of A. The spectrum of A is canonically isomorphic to min(A) with the discrete topology. For finite-dimensional C*-algebras, we also have the isomorphism : \\\\hat{A} \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Prim}(A).  Other characterizations of the spectrum  The hull-kernel topology is easy to describe abstractly, but in practice for C*-algebras associated to locally compact topological groups, other characterizations of the topology on the spectrum in terms of positive definite functions are desirable. In fact, the topology on √Ç is intimately connected with the concept of weak containment of representations as is shown by the following: :Theorem. Let S be a subset of √Ç. Then the following are equivalent for an irreducible representation œÄ; :# The equivalence class of œÄ in √Ç is in the closure of S :# Every state associated to œÄ, that is one of the form ::: f_\\\\xi(x) = \\\\langle \\\\xi \\\\mid \\\\pi(x) \\\\xi \\\\rangle ::with Œæ = 1, is the weak limit of states associated to representations in S. The second condition means exactly that œÄ is weakly contained in S. The GNS construction is a recipe for associating states of a C*-algebra A to representations of A. By one of the basic theorems associated to the GNS construction, a state f is pure if and only if the associated representation œÄf is irreducible. Moreover, the mapping Œ∫ : PureState(A) ‚Üí √Ç defined by f ‚Ü¶ œÄf is a surjective map. From the previous theorem one can easily prove the following; :Theorem The mapping :: \\\\kappa: \\\\operatorname{PureState}(A) \\\\to \\\\hat{A} :given by the GNS construction is continuous and open. = The space Irrn(A) = There is yet another characterization of the topology on √Ç which arises by considering the space of representations as a topological space with an appropriate pointwise convergence topology. More precisely, let n be a cardinal number and let Hn be the canonical Hilbert space of dimension n. Irrn(A) is the space of irreducible *-representations of A on Hn with the point-weak topology. In terms of convergence of nets, this topology is defined by œÄi ‚Üí œÄ; if and only if :\\\\langle \\\\pi_i(x) \\\\xi \\\\mid \\\\eta \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\langle \\\\pi(x) \\\\xi \\\\mid \\\\eta \\\\rangle \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\xi, \\\\eta \\\\in H_n \\\\ x \\\\in A. It turns out that this topology on Irrn(A) is the same as the point-strong topology, i.e. œÄi ‚Üí œÄ if and only if : \\\\pi_i(x) \\\\xi \\\\to \\\\pi(x) \\\\xi \\\\quad \\\\mbox{ normwise } \\\\forall \\\\xi \\\\in H_n \\\\ x \\\\in A. :Theorem. Let √Çn be the subset of √Ç consisting of equivalence classes of representations whose underlying Hilbert space has dimension n. The canonical map Irrn(A) ‚Üí √Çn is continuous and open. In particular, √Çn can be regarded as the quotient topological space of Irrn(A) under unitary equivalence. Remark. The piecing together of the various √Çn can be quite complicated.  Mackey‚ÄìBorel structure  √Ç is a topological space and thus can also be regarded as a Borel space. A famous conjecture of G. Mackey proposed that a separable locally compact group is of type I if and only if the Borel space is standard, i.e. is isomorphic (in the category of Borel spaces) to the underlying Borel space of a complete separable metric space. Mackey called Borel spaces with this property smooth. This conjecture was proved by James Glimm for separable C*-algebras in the 1961 paper listed in the references below. Definition. A non-degenerate *-representation œÄ of a separable C*-algebra A is a factor representation if and only if the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by œÄ(A) is one-dimensional. A C*-algebra A is of type I if and only if any separable factor representation of A is a finite or countable multiple of an irreducible one. Examples of separable locally compact groups G such that C*(G) is of type I are connected (real) nilpotent Lie groups and connected real semi-simple Lie groups. Thus the Heisenberg groups are all of type I. Compact and abelian groups are also of type I. :Theorem. If A is separable, √Ç is smooth if and only if A is of type I. The result implies a far-reaching generalization of the structure of representations of separable type I C*-algebras and correspondingly of separable locally compact groups of type I.  Algebraic primitive spectra  Since a C*-algebra A is a ring, we can also consider the set of primitive ideals of A, where A is regarded algebraically. For a ring an ideal is primitive if and only if it is the annihilator of a simple module. It turns out that for a C*-algebra A, an ideal is algebraically primitive if and only if it is primitive in the sense defined above. :Theorem. Let A be a C*-algebra. Any algebraically irreducible representation of A on a complex vector space is algebraically equivalent to a topologically irreducible *-representation on a Hilbert space. Topologically irreducible *-representations on a Hilbert space are algebraically isomorphic if and only if they are unitarily equivalent. This is the Corollary of Theorem 2.9.5 of the Dixmier reference. If G is a locally compact group, the topology on dual space of the group C*-algebra C*(G) of G is called the Fell topology, named after J. M. G. Fell.  References  * J.

Background Birger was the son of King Magnus III of Sweden and Hedwig of Holstein. He was hailed king of Sweden when he was four years old. This was done by his father in order to secure the succession. In 1275, King Magnus had led a rebellion against his elder brother, King Valdemar, and ousted him from the throne. Before his death, King Magnus ordered his kinsman, Torgils Knutsson, the Constable of the Realm, to be the guardian of his son Birger. In 1302, Birger was crowned at S√∂derk√∂ping after marrying Martha of Denmark, the daughter of King Eric V of Denmark.Margrethe, Dronning af Sverige, ‚àí1341(Dansk biografisk Lexikon) Reign Birger was only ten years old when his father died, at which time Torgils Knutsson was the most influential statesman in Sweden. In 1293, Torgils Knutsson led the Swedes to a victory which won a part of western Karelia. This expedition has traditionally been dubbed as the Third Swedish Crusade. When Torgils Knutsson returned from leading the crusade in Finland, a feud had developed between the brothers. Torgils Knutsson supported King Birger. Birger came of age when there was a conflict within the Church of Sweden over interpretation of the Privileges of 1280, which had been the cost of the support of the Church for his father's usurpation. The king's brothers Erik Magnusson, Duke of S√∂dermanland and Valdemar Magnusson, Duke of Finland took advantage of this conflict. Duke Eric tried to establish an independent kingdom around Bohusl√§n, which he had received as part of his marriage to the Norwegian princess Ingeborg, and Halland at the boundary between Sweden, Norway and Denmark. A civil war broke out, but by 1306 emotions had cooled to the point where the dukes acknowledged the son of Birger, Magnus Birgersson, as the successor to the throne. Torkel Knutsson, who was Duke Valdemar's father-in-law, was executed in 1306 as a token of reconciliation between King Birger and his brothers. The same year, in an event known as the H√•tuna games (H√•tunaleken), Birger was taken captive by his brothers on the H√•tuna royal estate in Uppland and taken as prisoner to Nyk√∂ping Castle (Nyk√∂pingshus).Konung Birger Magnusson och hans br√∂der (Ber√§ttelser ur svenska historien) Detail of Birger's and Martha's gravestone at Ringsted In 1308, Eric and Valdemar were forced by the Danish king to release King Birger, but they did so under humiliating conditions. When King Birger was free, he sought aid in Denmark, and the strife began anew. Birger remained king in name, but had to give up the Royal Domain, exchanging it for eastern Uppland, N√§rke, his brother Erik's former Duchy S√∂dermanland, √ñsterg√∂tland, Gotland and the Castle of Viborg. In 1312, Duke Eric married Ingeborg of Norway, daughter of King Haakon V of Norway in a double wedding in Oslo. At the same time, Eric's brother Duke Valdemar married Ingeborg Eriksdottir of Norway, the daughter of King Eric II of Norway.Ingebj√∏rg H√•konsdatter ‚Äì utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Duke Erik also held Bohusl√§n from Norway as well as northern Halland and was creating a separate kingdom centered on G√∂ta √§lv. In 1317 however, Birger captured his brothers during the Nyk√∂ping Banquet (Nyk√∂pings g√§stabud), which led to their death. According to Eric's Chronicle (Erikskr√∂nikan), the dukes were starved to death in a cellar of Nyk√∂ping Castle. Birger was ousted by his brothers' supporters in 1318 and eventually went into exile under his brother-in-law King Eric VI of Denmark, taking the Royal Archives with him. His 18-year-old son Magnus had arrived that year with Danish troops to save Birger but an army under Canute Porse defeated them at S√∂derk√∂ping, practically putting an end to the conflict. Birger first fled to Gotland and left Magnus to defend the important Stegeborg Castle. Magnus was captured there only to be executed in Stockholm in 1320,Ulf Sundberg in Medeltidens svenska krig Stockholm 1999 pp. 122-123 with a younger brother Eric having died the year before and ex-king Birger dying in Denmark the year after.

Life Uys Krige was born in Bontebokskloof (near Swellendam) in the Cape Province and educated at the University of Stellenbosch. From 1931 to 1935 Krige lived in France and Spain as a tutor to the daughters of Roy and Mary Campbell and acquired fluency in French and Spanish. Whilst in France he played rugby for a team in Toulon, was a swimming coach on the C√¥te d'Azur, wrote poems and penned freelance articles for the Afrikaans press.Cope, Jack, The Adversary Within, Dissident Writers in Afrikaans, David Philip, Cape Town 1982 He returned to South Africa in 1935 and began a writing career as a reporter for the Rand Daily Mail.Uys Krige, 1910‚Äì1987 at stellenboschwriters.com Unlike the Campbells, who supported the Nationalists, at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War Krige campaigned passionately for the Republican side.Nasson, Bill, South Africa at War 1939-1945, Jacana Media, Auckland Park 2012, p.17 He wrote the Hymn of the Fascist Bombers in 1937, which elicited vehement condemnations from both extreme Afrikaner nationalists and from the Catholic Church in South Africa, which opposed the Republican side due to the anti-Catholic religious persecution being perpetrated by the Republican forces (see Red Terror (Spain). During World War II, Krige was a war correspondent with the South African Army during the North African Campaign. Captured at the Battle of Tobruk in 1941, he was sent to a POW camp in Fascist Italy from which he escaped two years later. He returned to South Africa after learning to speak fluent Italian.Uys Krige monograph at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online After the ultra-nationalist and White Supremacist National Party took power over South Africa in 1948, Krige actively campaigned against the efforts of the new government to disenfranchise Coloured voters. Krige is counted among the so-called Dertigers (\\"writers of the thirties\\"). He co-edited The Penguin Book of South African Verse (1968) with Jack Cope.Loader, Catharina Bitter-sweet entrapment: A bird‚Äôs eye view of some prominent themes in South African literature at University of Vienna In his later life, Krige served as a mentor to fellow Afrikaner poet Ingrid Jonker and played a major role in her transformation from the dutiful daughter of a ruling-party MP into a vocal critic of the ruling National Party and its policies of both literary censorship and apartheid. When Jonker committed suicide by drowning in 1965, Krige spoke at her secular funeral. Uys Krige died near Hermanus in the Cape Province in 1987, aged 77. Afrikaans translations According to Jack Cope, Krige's linguistic and literary talent combined with his passion for modern French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese literature made him the principal translator from Romance languages into Afrikaans during the 20th century. Krige has therefore had a considerable influence on all subsequent Afrikaans literature. Uys Krige translated many of the works of William Shakespeare from Elizabethan English into Afrikaans. He also translated works by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Lope de Vega and Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez from Spanish, works by Baudelaire, Fran√ßois Villon, Jacques Pr√©vert, Arthur Rimbaud, and Paul √âluard from French, and the poems of Salvatore Quasimodo and Giuseppe Ungaretti from Italian. His encounter with Latin American poetry while stationed in Cairo during World War II also led him to translate the poetry of Jacinto Fombona- Pachano, Jose Ramon Heredia, Vicente Huidobro, Jorge Carrera Andrade, Nicolas Guillen, Cesar Vallejo, Jorge de Lima and Manuel Bandeira into Afrikaans from both Spanish and Portuguese. Legacy In 1994, Uys Krige's granddaughter, Lida Orffer was murdered with her family at their home in Stellenbosch. The murderer was found to be a Black South African drifter whom the Orffer family had given his first real job. The murder of the Orffer family, which came within weeks of the free elections that toppled the ruling National Party and ended apartheid, horrified the town of Stellenbosch and made many local residents question whether Nelson Mandela's promise of a \\"rainbow nation\\" was truly possible.A small town in South Africa The Independent, 31 March 1995.

It includes the largest known species of mosquito, at up to in length and in wingspan. It is among the many kinds of mosquito that do not consume blood. The adults subsist on carbohydrate-rich materials, such as honeydew, or saps and juices from damaged plants, refuse, fruit, and nectar. Their larvae prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes and similar nektonic prey, making Toxorhynchites beneficial to humans. In this respect, they contrast with blood-sucking species of mosquitoes. Toxorhynchites larvae live on a protein- and fat-rich diet of aquatic animals such as mosquito larvae. They have no need to risk their lives sucking blood in adulthood, having already accumulated the necessary materials for oogenesis and vitellogenesis. Most species occur in forests. The larvae of one jungle variety, Toxorhynchites splendens, consume larvae of other mosquito species occurring in tree crevices, particularly Aedes aegypti. Unlike Toxorhynchites mosquitoes, detritus feeder mosquito female larvae rely on blood meals to produce eggs more plentifully than a diet of nectar would permit. And even though blood sucking is a risky strategy that entails more casualties, and they could in principle subsist on nectar and the like as their males generally do, the risk is outweighed on average by the increase in the number and size of yolk-rich eggs that such protein-rich food permit. Eggs are either white or yellow in color, found on water surfaces, and generally have an incubation period of 40-60 hours depending on the temperature. The older the female mosquito, the less likely the eggs will be healthy https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Larissa_Collins/publication/216675054_The_biology_of_Toxorhynchites_mosquitoes_and_their_potential_as_biocontrol_agents/links/0c960521635713fa59000000/The- biology-of-Toxorhynchites-mosquitoes-and-their-potential-as-biocontrol- agents.pdf. Environmental scientists have suggested that Toxorhynchites mosquitoes be introduced to areas outside their natural range in order to fight dengue fever. This has been practiced historically, but errors have been made.

Joining them as a journalist was the young Mark Twain. His satiric account of this pioneering tour group, The Innocents Abroad, was Twain's best- selling work throughout his lifetime. In 1875, a history of rumored extramarital affairs by Beecher and his condemnation from the pulpit of Victoria Woodhull's advocacy of free love among other factors culminated in the \\"Beecher-Tilton Scandal Case\\". The highly publicized two-and-a-half-year- long case resulted in the disfellowshiping of aggrieved husband and church member Theodore Tilton, legal and church exoneration of the pastor, and condemnation of him by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others including his younger half-sister Isabella Beecher Hooker. Beecher died suddenly in 1887.

He is best remembered for his role in the 1885 Sir Charles Dilke divorce trial and for his tenure as Home Secretary from 1886 to 1892. Background and education The member of an old Herefordshire family, Matthews was born in Ceylon, where his father, Henry Matthews (1789‚Äì1828), was a puisne judge of the Supreme Court. His grandfather John Matthews had represented Herefordshire in Parliament in the early years of the 19th century. His mother was Emma (d. 1861), daughter of William Blount. Matthews was educated at the University of Paris, graduating in 1844, before going on to study at the University of London, from which he graduated successively BA and LLB.thepeerage.com Henry Matthews, 1st and lst Viscount Llandaff Legal career Matthews was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, in 1850 and practised on the Oxford circuit before becoming secretary to the Earl Marshal in 1864, a position he held for five years. He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1868. At the bar, Matthews made a good name for himself, being especially noted for examination of witnesses. Most famous was his 1885 cross examination of Sir Charles Dilke in a sensational divorce case, which essentially destroyed Dilke's political career and launched that of Matthews. Political career In 1868 Matthews was elected Member of Parliament for Dungarvan. He described himself as an 'Independent Liberal and Conservative'. He was a Roman Catholic and supported the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and was vaguely sympathetic to the Home Rule movement, but this could not prevent his defeat by a Home Rule candidate in the 1874 General Election. He then revised his views on politics and revived his political career as a Conservative in Britain, but in the circumstances of the struggle over Gladstone's Home Rule Bill, his previous position meant that he was distrusted by strong Unionists. He returned to Parliament as Conservative member for Birmingham East in 1886, and was immediately appointed as Home Secretary in Lord Salisbury's second government. Queen Victoria reportedly demanded his inclusion after his performance in the Sir Charles Dilke divorce trial, which she approved of. He was sworn of the Privy Council at the same time. Matthews' tenure of the office was notable more for its administrative success than for political achievement. He was thought 'too clever' and his aloof and 'somewhat foreign' manner made it difficult for him to command the House of Commons. In 1887, he gave a seemingly flippant response in the House to a genuine question about the mistaken arrest of Miss Cass, who was accused of prostitution, which resulted in the government's defeat on the issue. Despite his personal opposition to capital punishment Matthews was criticised for allowing Israel Lipski to hang. He was Home Secretary throughout the Whitechapel Murders of 1888 to 1891, some of which are attributed to Jack the Ripper. Matthews continued as Home Secretary until the Liberals returned to power in 1892. When the Conservatives took power again in 1895, Victoria was again keen for him to take office but opposition within the Conservative Party prevented it. Instead he was ennobled as Viscount Llandaff of Hereford in the County of Hereford. He was closely associated with the campaign which resulted in the building of Westminster Cathedral. Personal life Matthews inherited property from several relatives, which left him financially independent. Indeed, upon his death his estate was valued at almost ¬£260,000. He died unmarried in 1913 at the age of 87 at his London home and was buried at Clehonger, Herefordshire, near Belmont Abbey. The viscountcy died with him.

The play cycle was directed by Christopher Morahan and produced by Michael Bakewell and first shown in the Theatre 625 series on BBC 2 Episodes The four episodes were individually subtitled Anytime You're Ready I'll Sparkle, No Skill or Special Knowledge is Required, Gladly, My Cross-Eyed Bear and The Innocent Must Suffer. They were respectively the stories of the daughter, Terry; the father, Ted; the son, Alan and the mother, Sarah. Her viewpoint is recounted after her suicide. The role of the daughter Terry provided a major early role for Judi Dench in one of her first starring roles on television. The other leads were played by Maurice Denham, Margery Mason and Michael Bryant. According to Hopkins, he was seven months late delivering the scripts and, when he was commissioned by the BBC, all he had in his head was the final line of the final play: \\"Somebody hold me.\\" Reception and awards Frequently hailed by critics as one of the most important and affecting television dramas of the 1960s, in a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to determine the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, it was placed seventy-eighth. The Observer TV critic George Melly called it \\"the first authentic masterpiece written directly for television\\" and claimed that \\"on the evidence of this work alone, the medium can be considered to have come of age.\\" Dench won the 1967 British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for her performance. Broadcast Originally transmitted on BBC2 as part of the Theatre 625 anthology strand, the four instalments were shown weekly from 2 October to 23 October 1966. The first three plays ran 96 minutes and the final play 102 minutes. It was repeated as part of BBC2's twenty-fifth anniversary celebrations in 1989, allegedly because writer Alan Bleasdale refused to allow his 1982 drama Boys from the Blackstuff to be re-shown unless Talking to a Stranger also featured as part of the celebratory season. It was screened again by the BBC in 2003, this time on the digital channel BBC Four. International adaptations Talking to a Stranger was remade thrice, once for Canadian television in 1971 and twice for Belgian television. The version for the Belgian Flemish television, Praten tegen een vreemde, was adapted by Pieter De Prins and directed by Lode Hendrickx (1969). Paul Roland was the director of Comme des √©trangers for the Belgian French television. =Canadian adaptation= The Canadian version, produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was adapted by Doris Gauntlett and starred Budd Knapp (the father), Douglas Rain (Alan), Martha Henry (Terry) and Norma Renault (the mother). This was produced by Eric Till as four hour-long episodes and broadcast on Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. (Eastern) from 24 November to 15 December 1971. The episodes of the Canadian adaptation were structured as follows: # Terry faces pregnancy while estranged from her husband # Terry's mother commits suicide, as seen through the viewpoint of her husband # The family faces the aftermath of the suicide, under the viewpoint of Terry's brother Alan # The final episode recounts the first, under the viewpoint of the mother Video releases The original production is included in The Judi Dench Collection boxset which has been issued in both Region 1 and Region 2 DVD versions.

History =Founding= Founded by Crowe in 1827, Hanover College experienced a turbulent early period. It has become an established institution of liberal arts education. In 2002, the college celebrated its 175th anniversary. left In the early 19th century, missionaries went to Hanover as part of the Second Great Awakening. Crowe served as pastor of the Hanover Presbyterian Church. He opened the Hanover Academy on January 1, 1827, in a small log cabin near his home. Two years later, the state of Indiana granted the Academy a charter. On November 9, 1829, the Academy's Board of Trustees accepted the Presbyterian Synod of Indiana's proposal to adopt the school, provided a theological department was established. A two-story brick building was constructed to house both the Academy and the new Indiana Seminary. The state of Indiana issued the Academy a new charter, creating Hanover College effective January 1, 1833. Under this charter, the college's board of trustees is independent of ecclesiastical control, but it has formally adopted the standards for Presbyterian colleges for Hanover. The association continues to this day. In the 1830s, the College Edifice (now serving as the Hanover Presbyterian Church) was the center of a bustling, campus. In 1834, 119 students attended Hanover Preparatory School (formerly Hanover Academy) and 101 students attended Hanover College, rapid growth from the six students of only seven years earlier. In 1843 the college's president and its trustees accepted a proposal from Madison city leaders to move Hanover College. The trustees dissolved the Hanover charter and established Madison University five miles east. But Crowe purchased the college property and established the Hanover Classical and Mathematical School. Four months after Madison University was founded, its president had resigned and its students began to return to Crowe's school. By May 1844, all of Madison's students and faculty had made the trip. Hanover College was officially restored when Indiana's legislature granted the college a new charter on Christmas Day. Crowe, who served as college faculty for more than 30 years and refused to have his name considered for the presidency, is described as \\"twice the founder of Hanover College.\\" In 1849 the board of trustees voted to purchase a farm one-half mile east of Hanover's campus. This land, overlooking the Ohio River, serves as the campus's centerpiece today. By the mid-1850s, Classic Hall was constructed on a bluff known as the Point, and College classes were moved to that location. \\"Old Classic\\" would be Hanover's signature building for more than 90 years. The Civil War, especially the Confederate maneuvers known as Morgan's Raid, came close to campus; faculty and students were alerted that the troops might try to burn Classic Hall. In 1870, Presbyterian Church officials proposed that Hanover College be merged with Wabash College, with Hanover becoming a women's school. The Hanover Board of Trustees rejected that proposal, as well as one from businessmen in 1873 that would have moved the college to Indianapolis and renamed it Johnson University. =20th century= During Hanover College's first 50 years of operations, it had nine presidents, none of whom served for longer than nine years; five served three years or less. But after that, conditions stabilized. Daniel Fisher led Hanover from 1879 until his retirement in 1907. This stability of leadership ushered in a new era of growth. Fisher oversaw the construction of five buildings, including Thomas A. Hendricks Library (now Hendricks Hall). Named for Thomas Hendricks, an alumnus and former U.S. vice president, it is now used for classes and is known as Hendricks Hall, the oldest classroom building on Hanover's campus.left Albert G. Parker Jr. was inaugurated as Hanover's 12th president November 27, 1929, less than one month after the stock market crash that precipitated the Great Depression. The economic hard times cut investment revenues and operational expenses had to be closely monitored. But this challenge provided the college with one of its greatest rewards. On December 7, 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II. In just two years, Hanover's enrollment plummeted to 164 students, including only 20 men. In the early morning of December 19, 1941 a huge fire destroyed most of Classic Hall. By 1946, the postwar enrollment at Hanover had more than rebounded. It had ballooned to 679 students, and the first great construction period of the college's history was under way. In 1947, Hanover began to admit women through its coordinate college, Long College for Women. Until the 1960s, all women who graduated from Hanover had their degree officially conferred by Long instead of Hanover. Long College operated until the two colleges fully merged in 1978, making Hanover officially co-ed. Parker had announced that he would retire as Hanover's president as of September 1, 1958, but died in March of that year. John E. Horner was named as an interim president and ended up serving 29 years. Hanover students say that Parker's ghost still haunts Parker auditorium. Under Horner's 29-year leadership, Hanover enjoyed unprecedented growth in its academic program, financial standing, and student enrollment. Soon after his arrival, he encouraged faculty members to reform their curriculum. Eventually Hanover divided its academic year into two 14-week terms, in which students took three classes, and a five-week Spring Term, in which students took one course of specialized, intensive study. With some modifications, it still serves as Hanover's curricular model today. By the mid-1960s, the campus expanded to more than 500 acres (2 km¬≤) of land, enrollment topped 1,000 students, and Hanover's assets approached $15 million. In the late afternoon of April 3, 1974, a tornado roared through campus with devastating results. This tornado was part of the 1974 Super Outbreak of tornadoes that struck 13 states and one Canadian province that day. No one was killed or seriously injured, but 32 of the college's 33 buildings were damaged, including two that were completely destroyed and six that sustained major structural damage. One of the completely destroyed buildings was a residence hall which had previously, back in 1890, served as the first fraternity house in the entire Sigma Chi Fraternity. Hundreds of trees were down, completely blocking every campus road. All utilities were knocked out and communication with those off campus was nearly impossible. Government officials estimated the damage at $10 million. Some wondered if Hanover College could survive. The Hanoverians, led by Horner, sprang into action. Winter Term ended one week early and students were dismissed, but many stayed to help faculty, staff and others clear the debris. The Board of Trustees met April 5 in emergency session and vowed to lead the efforts in rebuilding and improving Hanover College. They vowed to do so without any federal disaster assistance, continuing Hanover's tradition of financial independence. Within a week, roads were made passable and major services restored. Contributions poured in to cover Hanover's $1 million in uninsurable losses; they raised this amount in three months. When Spring Term opened April 22, the college had full enrollment 19 days after the tornado. An editorial in The Indianapolis Star described the effort as \\"a private miracle.\\" By spring 1975, replanting efforts completed Hanover's recovery. When Horner retired in 1987, Hanover's endowment was more than $40 million. Russell Nichols was inaugurated as Hanover's 14th president on September 26, 1987. He initiated actions to improve the Hanover experience for students both inside and outside the classroom. The number of full-time faculty was increased over a five-year period from 72 to 94, lowering the student-teacher ratio and allowing for more independent research and study. Six new academic majors were added. In terms of amenities, students enjoyed a direct-dial telephone in each dorm room, ending years of having a campus operator direct all calls. More significantly, academic scholarships were increased for incoming and returning students. In 1995 the $11 million Horner Health and Recreation Center was opened; it was named for the president emeritus and his wife. =21st century= In 2000 a $23 million Science Center was dedicated, which now houses all of the college's five natural sciences in the same facility. In May 2006, Nichols announced his plans to retire at the conclusion of the 2007 academic year. His accomplishments include the revision of the curriculum which expanded study abroad offerings. Additionally, he oversaw implementation of the Center for Business Preparation, an innovation program designed to link liberal arts education with business. In 2004, Hanover was awarded $11.4 million to start the Rivers Institute, a multi-disciplinary center to study all aspects of rivers throughout the world. In the fall of 2007, Sue DeWine, former provost at Marietta College in Ohio, succeeded Nichols as president of Hanover College as the 15th president of Hanover College. DeWine was succeeded by Lake Lambert in 2015. =Presidents= George C. Heckman, the college's ninth president #James Blythe, 1832‚Äì1836 #Duncan McAuley March ‚Äì July 1838 #Erasmus D.

The land features several climbing paths and cliffs, as well as the only view of the Ohio from which three bends in the river can be seen. The campus is characterized by the Georgian style architecture. The quad is crowned by the Parker Auditorium, named for the former Hanover College president, Albert Parker. In the 1940s the college turned down plans to rebuild the Sigma Chi fraternity house as designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, because it did not match the Georgian Architecture. Much of the campus was heavily damaged in the April 3, 1974 tornado Super Outbreak, including several buildings that were destroyed. Damage to 32 of the 33 buildings totaled over $10 million. The campus lost hundreds of mature trees. After 19 days, the campus reopened, with roads and most buildings made usable. In 2008, Hanover was ravaged by the after effects of Hurricane Ike. Although most facilities stayed intact, both electricity and water were lost, and the campus was evacuated for a week. Hanover College Business Scholars Program Founded in 2005, the Business Scholars Program at Hanover College is an experiential business education program that lets students practice business skills and apply knowledge taught by faculty with extensive industry experience. It is modeled after MBA and other top business programs nationwide. Students admitted to the Program are called \\"Business Scholars\\". Admission into the Business Scholars Program at Hanover is competitive. In 2009, the Program admitted 48 new Business Scholars, a record number, and continues to grow. Each Business Scholar combines a Hanover major in their area of interest with practical preparation in business and management. More than 19 majors are represented in the Program. In addition to traditional coursework, Business Scholars complete a project-based internship, analyze business cases, participate in a consulting project for a real business, meet with numerous executives and not-for-profit leaders and participate in a variety of workshops, including resume writing, networking, interviewing, personal finance, and creative problem solving. The Business Scholar Program is currently led by John C. Riddick, Jr., a 1987 graduate of Hanover College, who holds an MBA from the University of Louisville as well. Riddick has more than 20 years of experience in C-level sales and expertise in both the IT and medical industries. The position was previously held by Gerald R. Johnson, Jr., a 1969 graduate of the college, who retired in 2017. He died in January 2019. Before to joining the Program, Johnson served as chairman of the board, chief executive officer (CEO), and director of Mercantile Bank Corporation.

Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court invalidating the use of the First Amendment as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a grand jury. The case was argued February 23, 1972 and decided June 29 of the same year.. The reporters lost their case by a vote of 5-4. This case is cited for the rule that in federal courts, a reporter may not generally avoid testifying in a criminal grand jury, and it remains the only case in which the U.S. Supreme Court has considered the use of reporters' privilege.  Facts  Paul Branzburg of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal, in the course of his reporting duties, witnessed people manufacturing and using hashish. He wrote two articles concerning drug use in Kentucky. The first featured unidentified hands holding hashish, while the second included marijuana users as sources. These sources requested not to be identified. Both of the articles were brought to attention of law- enforcement personnel. Branzburg was subpoenaed before a grand jury for both of the articles. He was ordered to name his sources. Earl Caldwell, a reporter for The New York Times, conducted extensive interviews with the leaders of The Black Panthers, and Paul Pappas, a Massachusetts television reporter, who also reported on The Black Panthers, spending several hours in their headquarters were similarly subpoenaed around the same time as was Paul Branzburg. All three reporters were called to testify before separate grand juries about illegal actions they might have witnessed. They refused, citing a privilege under the Press Clause, and were held in contempt.  Decision  In a fiercely-split decision, the Court ruled 5-4 against the existence of reportorial privilege in the Press Clause of the First Amendment. Writing for the majority, Justice Byron White declared that the petitioners were asking the Court \\"to grant newsmen a testimonial privilege that other citizens do not enjoy. This we decline to do.\\" White acknowledged the argument that refusing to recognize such a privilege would undermine the ability of the press to gather news, but wrote that \\"from the beginning of the country the press has operated without constitutional protection for press informants, and the press has flourished.\\" He did not overlook the importance of a free press, however, and he established a test, citing Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Comm., for deciding whether a reporter can be compelled to testify before a grand jury. For such a subpoena to have merit, the government must \\"convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.\\" Complicating matters was Justice Lewis F. Powell's concurrence. While he sided with the majority, Powell emphasized the \\"limited nature\\" of the decision when he stated: > The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the > striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation > of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. > The balance of these vital constitutional and societal interests on a case- > by-case basis accords with the tried and traditional way of adjudicating > such questions. A few days after oral argument, and before writing his concurrence, Powell prepared handwritten notes of the court's private conference to decide the disposition of the appeal. He stated in those notes: > I will make clear in an opinion... that there is a privilege analogous to an > evidentiary one, which courts should recognize and apply on case by case to > protect confidential information.... My vote turned on my conclusion... that > we should not establish a constitutional privilege. (emphasis in original > notes)Branzburg v. Hayes - Journalists - Supreme Court - Confidential > Sources - New York Times Subsequent history Powell's opinion has been interpreted by several lower courts as an indication that reportorial privilege exists but was simply not warranted in the specific case of Branzburg. In Zerilli v. Smith the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded that the reporter's privilege existed and that its application depended on two factors: (1) that the information sought was crucial to a litigant's case and (2) that the information could not be acquired from any other source. However, in 2003 in McKevitt v. Pallasch, Judge Posner reaffirmed the majority's opinion in Branzburg in a case concerning a refusal to stay an order, in a terrorism case in Ireland, to subpoena recordings of a key witness possessed by a group of journalists. Posner used the case-by-case balancing test envisioned by Justice Powell, writing: > The federal interest in cooperating in the criminal proceedings of friendly > foreign nations is obvious; and it is likewise obvious that newsgathering > and reporting activities of the press are inhibited when a reporter cannot > assure a confidential source of confidentiality. Yet that was Branzburg and > it is evident from the result in that case that the interest of the press in > maintaining the confidentiality of sources is not absolute. There is no > conceivable interest in confidentiality in the present case. In July 2004, Branzburg was cited as precedent by United States District Court Chief Judge Thomas Hogan in a memorandum opinion denying a motion to quash two grand jury subpoenas issued to reporters. NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert and Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper challenged the subpoenas issued in connection with the leak of the identity of former CIA operative Valerie Plame, citing their First Amendment rights as reason not to reveal their confidential sources. In the opinion, Hogan wrote: > Because this Court holds that the U.S. Supreme Court unequivocally rejected > any reporter‚Äôs privilege rooted in the First Amendment or common law in the > context of a grand jury acting in good faith, this Court denies the motions > to quash. Civil cases, as opposed to criminal cases, have been held not to come under the Branzburg test.Carey v. Hume, 492 F.2d 631, 636 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. dismissed, . In 2007, the New York Times published Justice Powell's notes of the court's private conference on a form that looks like a scorecard. The Times purports that Justice Powell wrote the following: > I will make clear in an opinion - unless the court's opinion is clear - that > there is a privilege analogous to an evidentiary one, which courts should > recognize and apply on case by case to protect confidential information. My > vote turned on my conclusion - after hearing arguments of counsel and re- > reading principal briefs - that we should not establish a constitutional > privilege.

Biography Born in southwest London, Hopkins was educated at Raynes Park County Grammar School, did National Service in the Army from 1950-1951. He read English Literature at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and joined BBC Television as a studio manager on graduation. Hopkins began his writing career in radio, writing episodes of the BBC serial Mrs Dale's Diary for eighteen months. An attempt to become a trainee television director at the commercial television franchise holder Granada Television was unsuccessful. The company did accept his first play, Break Up (1958), about the end of the marriage of a young couple, although it was only shown in the Granada region. He established himself as a writer beginning when his then father-in-law Nigel Balchin asked him to try to adapt his novels for television, Adaptations of both The Small Back Room (for Sunday Night Theatre) and Mine Own Executioner were broadcast in April and August 1959 respectively. Hopkins then adapted Margery Allingham's novels about the private detective Albert Campion into Campion featuring two six-part serials, Dancers in Mourning (1959) and Death of a Ghost (1960). Hopkins followed with a series based on Rosamund Lehmann's The Weather in the Streets (1961). He wrote his own thriller series, A Chance of Thunder in 1961. Hopkins wrote over fifty episodes of the BBC police drama Z-Cars, remaining with the series for 2, serving as the series' script editor for a time. One episode featured Judi Dench in the role of a delinquent. This character inspired Hopkins to write what is probably his best remembered work for the small screen, the four-part play sequence Talking to a Stranger (1966) directed by Christopher Morahan, with whom he had developed a rapport while working with him on Z-Cars. Starring Dench, and Michael Bryant, as the adult children of characters played by Maurice Denham, and Margery Mason, Talking to a Stranger was transmitted as part of BBC2's Theatre 625 anthology series. The plays told the story of one bleak weekend from the viewpoints of the four individuals. It won the British Directors' Guild Writers' Award and an Emmy in 1968 after the sequence was shown on American television. Critic George Melly described in The Observer as \\"[t]he first authentic masterpiece written directly for television\\". Two Wednesday Plays from this period by Hopkins were Fable from January 1965 and Horror of Darkness broadcast the following March. The former imagines an inverted South African apartheid in Britain (which was postponed by the BBC in case it affected a by-election), while the latter is a rare exploration of homosexuality in the 1960s. Hour of Darkness featured Glenda Jackson and Nicol Williamson in the lead roles. Hopkins made his feature film debut with the screenplay he co-wrote with director Roy Ward Baker Two Left Feet (1963), a lightweight comedy-drama with Michael Crawford. He received co-screenwriter credit with Richard Maibaum for the fourth James Bond film James Bond movie Thunderball (1965). He co-wrote the screenplay for Leslie Thomas' boys-in-uniform comedy The Virgin Soldiers (1969) and worked on the screenplay for the film adaptation of Man of La Mancha (1972), although he was removed from this project by United Artists when the studio discovered his draft omitted most of the songs from the musical. His screenplay for Murder by Decree (1979) places Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper. The film was directed by Bob Clark and featured Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as Watson. Hopkins wrote his first stage play, This Story of Yours, in 1968. Though it had poor reviews when it was staged at the Royal Court. One audience member who was impressed by the play was Sean Connery who chose it as a personal film project which became The Offence (1973). Connery not only produced the film under a deal with United Artists when he returned to the role of James Bond role, but also acted in the film version, directed by Sidney Lumet. Hopkins' plays for the stage included Next of Kin, which was produced at London's National Theatre in 1974 with Harold Pinter directing.Next of Kin by John Hopkins, The National Theatre, 1974 at haroldpinter.orgOtis L. Guernsey, The Best plays of 1973‚Äì1974 (Dodd, Mead, 1974), p. 108. His play, Find Your Way Home (1970) was produced in London and then on Broadway where it won a \\"Best Actor\\" Tony Award for Michael Moriarty. Hopkins adapted Dostoevsky's The Gambler (1973) for television, it starred Edith Evans and Philip Madoc, and he wrote the two-part television screenplay, Divorce His; Divorce Hers (1973), which starred Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. His later television work also includes the Play for Today A Story to Frighten the Children (1976), and the serial adaptation of John le Carr√©'s novel Smiley's People (1982), starring Alec Guinness, both for the BBC; and the Cold War espionage thriller Codename: Kyril (1988) for ITV. Hopkins' six- play cycle, Fathers and Families (1977), again directed by Christopher Morahan, was unsuccessful. Hopkins died at his home in Woodland Hills, California, United States, in July 1998, following an accident in which he slipped, hit his head and fell unconscious into his swimming pool, where he drowned. Private life In 1954, Hopkins married Prudence Anne Balchin, a daughter of author Nigel Balchin. They divorced in 1969. In 1969, he married the American actress Shirley Knight; the couple had one daughter, Sophie. His stepdaughter from his marriage to Knight is actress Kaitlin Hopkins, whom he raised.

He was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1882 and 1889 when he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States, an office that was upgraded to that of Ambassador to the United States in 1893. Elevated to the peerage as Baron Pauncefote in 1899, he died in office in 1902. Origins Descended in the male line from the prominent Smith family of bankers, who established Smith's Bank in Nottingham in 1658, he was born in Munich, Bavaria, the son of Robert \\"Pauncefote\\" (born \\"Robert Smith\\") by his wife Emma Smith, a daughter of the painter John Raphael Smith (no apparent relation to the Smith bankers). His father (who in 1809 assumed the surname of \\"Pauncefote\\" in lieu of his patronymic) was the grandson of John Smith (born 1716), next younger brother of Sir George Smith, 1st Baronet (1714-1769) of Stoke Hall, East Stoke in Nottinghamshire (whose first wife Mary Howe was a co-heiress of the Pauncefote family of Preston, 'Preston', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 12, ed. A.R.J. Jurica (Woodbridge, 2010), pp. 301-317 near Dymock, in Gloucestershire), and elder brother of Abel Smith II (1717‚Äì1788), ancestor of the Barons Carrington and the Barons Bicester.thepeerage.com Julian Pauncefote, 1st and last Baron Pauncefote Legal career Julian Pauncefote as Attorney-General of Hong Kong He was educated at Paris, Geneva, and Marlborough College. Intending to join the British Indian Army, he obtained a commission in the Madras Light Cavalry, but never took up his post, instead being called to the bar in 1852, after which he practiced as a conveyancing barrister. In July 1855, Pauncefote briefly became private secretary to Sir William Molesworth, Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time. His appointment lasted only short period ending with Molesworth's death in October that same year. In 1862, facing crippling financial losses, Pauncefote decided to go and practise as a barrister in Hong Kong. In 1865 he was appointed acting Attorney General and in 1866 became the Attorney General of Hong Kong.Review of Wright, Leigh, Julian Pauncefote and British Imperial Policy 1855-1889 on the freelibrary.com. Ex officio he served as acting Chief Justice and acting Puisne Judge on a number of occasions.Norton-Kyshe, the History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong, Vol II. In Hong Kong, Pauncefote was involved in a major case involving the rights of enslaved coolies to free themselves. He ended up being sued for false imprisonment in the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. In 1871, Kwok A Sing, a coolie on board a French ship the Nouvelle Penelope which had sailed from Macau, killed the master and took over the ship. Kwok was arrested in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. Kwok made a habeas corpus application seeking his release. Chief Justice John Jackson Smale ordered his release on the basis that Kwok was entitled to take any necessary steps to secure his freedom. Pauncefote, as Attorney General of Hong Kong, then had Kwok re-arrested to be tried for piracy. Smale again ordered Kwok's release on the basis the second arrest breached the first habeas corpus order. Kwok then sued Pauncefote for damages for false imprisonment under the Habeas Corpus Act. Kwok almost won with the British jury finding 4‚Äì3 in Kwok's favour. Because a majority of five was needed to find in Kwok's favour the verdict was treated as a verdict for Pauncefote.Re Kwok A Sing (No.1) and Re Kwok A Sing (No.2) [2001] HKC 710 and 737. North China Herald, 28 December 1871, pp. 1003‚Äì4, for details of the case against Pauncefote. In 1874, Pauncefote was appointed Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands and was knighted. Diplomatic career In 1876 Pauncefote returned to London as Assistant Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He soon transferred to the Foreign Office where he took over the same post at the Foreign Office in 1876. Having been made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1879 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) the following year, Pauncefote was promoted Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1882. He was appointed first British delegate to the Suez Canal Conference in Paris in 1885, and was rewarded for his services in this respect with appointment as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). In 1888 he became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and the following year was sent to the United States as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. His position was elevated in 1893 to Ambassador, and it made him the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps because Ambassador is superior to all other Envoys dispatched by other countries. He and American secretary of state Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty, but the U.S. Senate, jealous of its prerogatives. refused to ratify it.Nelson M. Blake, \\"The Olney-Pauncefote Treaty of 1897,\\" American Historical Review, (1945) 50#2 pp. 228-243 in JSTOR He was Britain's representative at negotiations and signatory of the Tripartite Convention in 1899 that partitioned the Samoan islands. In 1901 he negotiated the Hay‚ÄìPauncefote Treaty (with American Secretary of State John Hay), nullifying the Clayton‚ÄìBulwer Treaty of 1850, giving the United States the right to create and control a canal across Central America. Having finally become a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in 1892, Pauncefote the following year became the first British Ambassador to the United States. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1894 and raised to the peerage as Baron Pauncefote, \\"of Preston, Dymock in the County of Gloucester\\", in 1899.

Jurica (Woodbridge, 2010), pp. 301-317 Marriage & issue Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote, with his wife Selina Cubitt, and daughters In 1859 he married Selina Cubitt, a daughter of William Cubitt, by whom he had one son, who died as an infant, and four daughters, including: *Hon. Lilian Pauncefote (1875‚Äì1963), youngest daughter, who on 24 February 1900 married her distant kinsman Sir Robert Bromley, 6th Baronet (1874‚Äì1906) of Stoke Hall, East Stoke in Nottinghamshire (descended in the male line from Sir George Smith, 1st Baronet (1714-1769)), honorary attach√© to the British embassy in Washington.

His formal state funeral took place at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, where his daughter had been married. His remains were transferred back to the United Kingdom in the , and were buried in the churchyard at East Stoke in Nottinghamshire on 15 July 1902.

More precisely, in a category E with a terminal object 1, an NNO N is given by: # a global element z : 1 ‚Üí N, and # an arrow s : N ‚Üí N, such that for any object A of E, global element q : 1 ‚Üí A, and arrow f : A ‚Üí A, there exists a unique arrow u : N ‚Üí A such that: # u ‚àò z = q, and # u ‚àò s = f ‚àò u. In other words, the triangle and square in the following diagram commute. A commutative diagram expressing the equations in the definition of an NNO The pair (q, f) is sometimes called the recursion data for u, given in the form of a recursive definition: # ‚ä¢ u (z) = q # y ‚ààE N ‚ä¢ u (s y) = f (u (y)) The above definition is the universal property of NNOs, meaning they are defined up to canonical isomorphism. If the arrow u as defined above merely has to exist, that is, uniqueness is not required, then N is called a weak NNO.  Equivalent definitions  NNOs in cartesian closed categories (CCCs) or topoi are sometimes defined in the following equivalent way (due to Lawvere): for every pair of arrows g : A ‚Üí B and f : B ‚Üí B, there is a unique h : N √ó A ‚Üí B such that the squares in the following diagram commute. alternate NNO definition This same construction defines weak NNOs in cartesian categories that are not cartesian closed. In a category with a terminal object 1 and binary coproducts (denoted by +), an NNO can be defined as the initial algebra of the endofunctor that acts on objects by and on arrows by .  Properties  * Every NNO is an initial object of the category of diagrams of the form ::1 \\\\xrightarrow{~ \\\\quad q \\\\quad ~} A \\\\xrightarrow{~ \\\\quad f \\\\quad ~} A * If a cartesian closed category has weak NNOs, then every slice of it also has a weak NNO. * NNOs can be used for non-standard models of type theory in a way analogous to non-standard models of analysis. Such categories (or topoi) tend to have \\"infinitely many\\" non-standard natural numbers. (Like always, there are simple ways to get non-standard NNOs; for example, if z = s z, in which case the category or topos E is trivial.) * Freyd showed that z and s form a coproduct diagram for NNOs; also, !N : N ‚Üí 1 is a coequalizer of s and 1N, i.e., every pair of global elements of N are connected by means of s; furthermore, this pair of facts characterize all NNOs.  Examples  * In Set, the category of sets, the standard natural numbers are an NNO. A terminal object in Set is a singleton, and a function out of a singleton picks out a single element of a set. The natural numbers ùêç are an NNO where is a function from a singleton to ùêç whose image is zero, and is the successor function. (We could actually allow to pick out any element of ùêç, and the resulting NNO would be isomorphic to this one.) One can prove that the diagram in the definition commutes using mathematical induction. * In the category of types of Martin- L√∂f type theory (with types as objects and functions as arrows), the standard natural numbers type nat is an NNO. One can use the recursor for nat to show that the appropriate diagram commutes. * Assume that \\\\mathcal{E} is a Grothendieck topos with terminal object \\\\top and that \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\simeq \\\\mathbf{Shv}(\\\\mathfrak{C},J) for some Grothendieck topology J on the category \\\\mathfrak{C} .

Zeilinger is professor of physics at the University of Vienna and Senior Scientist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information IQOQI at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Most of his research concerns the fundamental aspects and applications of quantum entanglement. Biography Anton Zeilinger, born 1945 in Austria, has held positions at the Technical University of Vienna and the University of Innsbruck. He has held visiting positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), at Humboldt University in Berlin, Merton College, Oxford and the Coll√®ge de France (Chaire Internationale) in Paris. Zeilinger's awards include the Wolf Prize in Physics (2010), the Inaugural Isaac Newton Medal of the IOP (2007) and the King Faisal International Prize (2005). In 2005, Anton Zeilinger was among the \\"10 people who could change the world\\", elected by the British newspaper New Statesman. He is a member of seven Scientific Academies. Anton Zeilinger is currently Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna and Senior Scientist at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information of the Austrian Academy of Sciences to whose Presidency he was recently elected. Since 2006, Zeilinger is the vice chairman of the board of trustees of the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, an ambitious project initiated by Zeilinger's proposal. In 2009, he founded the International Academy TraunkirchenInternational Academy Traunkirchen which is dedicated to the support of gifted students in science and technology. He is a fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Adams, going so far as to name his sailboat 42. Work Anton Zeilinger is a pioneer in the field of quantum information and of the foundations of quantum mechanics. He realized many important quantum information protocols for the first time, including quantum teleportation of an independent qubit, entanglement swapping (i.e. the teleportation of an entangled state), hyper-dense coding (which was the first entanglement-based protocol ever realized in experiment), entanglement-based quantum cryptography, one-way quantum computation and blind quantum computation. His further contributions to the experimental and conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics include multi-particle entanglement and matter wave interference all the way from neutrons via atoms to macromolecules such as fullerenes. =Quantum teleportation= Most widely known is his first realization of quantum teleportation of an independent qubit.D.

Quantum teleportation is an essential concept in many quantum information protocols. Besides its role for the transfer of quantum information, it is also considered as an important possible mechanism for building gates within quantum computers. =Entanglement swapping ‚Äì teleportation of entanglement= Entanglement swapping is the teleportation of an entangled state. After its proposal,M. Zukowski, A. Zeilinger, M. A. Horne & A.K. Ekert, Event-Ready-Detectors Bell Experiment via Entanglement Swapping, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 4287‚Äì90 (1993).

Zeilinger, Experimental delayed-choice entanglement swapping, Nature Physics 8, 479‚Äì484 (2012). Abstract. Entanglement swapping is the crucial ingredient for quantum repeaters which are expected to connect future quantum computers. =Entanglement beyond two qubits ‚Äì GHZ-states and their realizations= Anton Zeilinger contributed decisively to the opening up of the field of multi-particle entanglement. In 1990, he was the first with Greenberger and Horne to work on entanglement of more than two qubits.D. M. Greenberger, M. A. Horne, A. Shimony & A. Zeilinger, Bell‚Äôs Theorem without Inequalities, American Journal of Physics 58, 1131‚Äì1143 (1990). This paper has become a citation classic. The resulting GHZ theorem (see Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger state) is fundamental for quantum physics, as it provides the most succinct contradiction between local realism and the predictions of quantum mechanics. Also, GHZ states opened up the field of multi-particle entanglement. Surprisingly, multi-particle entangled states exhibit qualitatively different properties compared to two-particle entanglement. In the 1990s, it became the main goal of Zeilinger's research to realize such GHZ states in the laboratory, which required the development of many new methods and tools. Finally, in 1999, he succeeded in providing the first experimental evidence of entanglement beyond two particlesD. Bouwmeester, J.-W. Pan, M. Daniell, H. Weinfurter & A. Zeilinger, Observation of three-photon Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger entanglement, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 (7), 1345‚Äì1349 (1999). Abstract. and also the first test of quantum nonlocality for GHZ states.J.-W. Pan, D. Bouwmeester, M. Daniell, H. Weinfurter & A. Zeilinger, Experimental test of quantum nonlocality in three- photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement, Nature 403, 515‚Äì519 (2000). Abstract. He also was the first to realize that there are different classes of higher-dimensional entangled states and proposed W-states. Today, multi- particle states have become an essential workhorse in quantum computation and thus, GHZ-states have even become an individual entry in the PACS code. =Quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation= In 1996, Anton Zeilinger with his group realized hyper-dense coding.K. Mattle, H. Weinfurter, P.G. Kwiat & A. Zeilinger, Dense Coding in Experimental Quantum Communication, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 4656‚Äì59 (1996). Abstract. There, one can encode into one qubit more than one classical bit of information. This was the first realization of a quantum information protocol with an entangled state, where one is able to achieve something impossible with classical physics. In 1998 (published in 2000),T. Jennewein, C. Simon, G. Weihs, H. Weinfurter & A. Zeilinger, Quantum Cryptography with Entangled Photons, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 4729‚Äì4732 (2000). Abstract. This paper was featured in several popular science magazines, both online and in print. his group was the first to implement quantum cryptography with entangled photons. Zeilinger's group is now also developing a quantum cryptography prototype in collaboration with industry. He then also applied quantum entanglement to optical quantum computation, where in 2005,P. Walther, K.J. Resch, T. Rudolph, E. Schenck, H. Weinfurter, V. Vedral, M. Aspelmeyer & A. Zeilinger, Experimental one-way quantum computing, Nature 434 (7030), 169‚Äì176 (2005). Abstract. he performed the first implementation of one-way quantum computation. This is a protocol based on quantum measurement as proposed by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn.E. Knill, R. Laflamme & G. J. Milburn, A scheme for efficient quantum computation with linear optics, Nature 409, 46‚Äì52 (2001). Abstract. Most recently, it has been shownS. Barz, E. Kashefi, A. Broadbent, J. F. Fitzsimons, A. Zeilinger & P. Walther, Demonstration of Blind Quantum Computing, Science 20, 303‚Äì308 (2012). Abstract. that one-way quantum computation can be used to implement blind quantum computing. This solves a problem in Cloud computing, namely that, whatever algorithm a client employs on a quantum server is completely unknown, i.e. blind, to the operator of the server. The experiments of Zeilinger and his group on the distribution of entanglement over large distances began with both free-space and fiber-based quantum communication and teleportation between laboratories located on the different sides of the river Danube. This was then extended to larger distances across the city of Vienna and over 144 km between two Canary Islands, resulting in a successful demonstration that quantum communication with satellites is feasible. His dream is to put sources of entangled light onto a satellite in orbit. A first step was achieved during an experiment at the Italian Matera Laser Ranging Observatory.P. Villoresi, T. Jennewein, F. Tamburini, M. Aspelmeyer, C. Bonato, R. Ursin, C. Pernechele, V. Luceri, G. Bianco, A. Zeilinger & C.

Zeilinger, Entanglement of the orbital angular momentum states of photons, Nature 412 (6844), 313‚Äì316 (2001). Abstract. opened up a new burgeoning field of research in many laboratories. =Macroscopic quantum superposition= Zeilinger is also interested to extend quantum mechanics into the macroscopic domain. In the early 1990s, he started experiments in the field of atom optics. He developed a number of ways to coherently manipulate atomic beams, many of which, like the coherent energy shift of an atomic De Broglie wave upon diffraction at a time-modulated light wave, have become cornerstones of today's ultracold atom experiments. In 1999, Zeilinger abandoned atom optics for experiments with very complex and massive macro-molecules ‚Äì fullerenes. The successful demonstration of quantum interference for these C60 and C70 moleculesM. Arndt, O. Nairz, J. Voss- Andreae, C. Keller, G. van der Zouw & A.

Selected by the American Physical Society as a physics highlight of 1999. in 1999 opened up a very active field of research. Key results include the most precise quantitative study to date of decoherence by thermal radiation and by atomic collisions and the first quantum interference of complex biological macro-molecules. This work is continued by Markus Arndt. In 2005, Zeilinger with his group again started a new field, the quantum physics of mechanical cantilevers. The group was the first ‚Äì in the year 2006 along with work from Heidmann in Paris and Kippenberg in Garching ‚Äì to demonstrate experimentally the self-cooling of a micro-mirror by radiation pressure, that is, without feedback.S. Gigan, H. R. B√∂hm, M. Paternostro, F. Blaser, G. Langer, J. B. Hertzberg, K. Schwab, D. B√§uerle, M. Aspelmeyer & A. Zeilinger, Self-cooling of a micro-mirror by radiation pressure, Nature 444, 67‚Äì70 (2006). Abstract. Selected as ‚ÄúHighlight of the recent literature‚Äù by Science (January 2007). That phenomenon can be seen as a consequence of the coupling of a high-entropy mechanical system with a low-entropy radiation field. This work is now continued independently by Markus Aspelmeyer. Most recently, using orbital angular momentum states, he was able to demonstrate entanglement of angular momentum up to 300 ƒß.R. Fickler, R. Lapkiewicz, W. N. Plick, M. Krenn, C. Sch√§ff, S. Ramelow & A. Zeilinger, Quantum entanglement of high angular momenta, Science 338, 640‚Äì643 (2012). Abstract. Selected as one of the top 10 breakthroughs of the year 2012 by IOP‚Äôs Physics World. Also featured in DPG‚Äôs Physik Journal. =Further fundamental tests= Zeilinger's program of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics is aimed at implementing experimental realizations of many non- classical features of quantum physics for individual systems. In 1998,G. Weihs, T. Jennewein, C. Simon, H. Weinfurter & A. Zeilinger, Violation of Bell‚Äôs inequality under strict Einstein locality conditions, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (23), 5039‚Äì5043 (1998). Abstract. This paper is a classic. It is cited (among others) in the German wikipedia article on Bell‚Äôs inequality and in several popular science books and science books for University students. he provided the final test of Bell's inequality closing the communication loophole by using superfast random number generators. More recently, his group also realized the first Bell inequality experiment implementing the freedom- of-choice conditionT. Scheidl, R. Ursin, J. Kofler, S. Ramelow, X. Ma, T. Herbst, L. Ratschbacher, A. Fedrizzi, N. K. Langford, T. Jennewein & A. Zeilinger, Violation of local realism with freedom of choice, PNAS 107 (46), 19709 ‚Äì 19713 (2010). Abstract and, most recently,M. Giustina et al., Significant-Loophole-Free Test of Bell‚Äôs Theorem with Entangled Photons, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 250401 (2015) Abstract they provided the first realization of a Bell test without the fair sampling assumption for photons. All these experiments are not only of fundamental interest, but also important for quantum cryptography. A finally loophole-free entanglement-based implementation of quantum cryptography is generally considered to be absolutely secure against any eavesdropping. Among the further fundamental tests he performed the most notable one is his test of a large class of nonlocal realistic theories proposed by Leggett.A. J. Leggett, Nonlocal Hidden-Variable Theories and Quantum Mechanics: An Incompatibility Theorem, Foundations of Physics 33 (10), 1469‚Äì1493 (2003)(doi:10.1023/A:1026096313729) Abstract. The group of theories excluded by that experiment can be classified as those which allow reasonable subdivision of ensembles into sub-ensembles. It goes significantly beyond Bell's theorem. While Bell showed that a theory which is both local and realistic is at variance with quantum mechanics, Leggett considered nonlocal realistic theories where the individual photons are assumed to carry polarization. The resulting Leggett inequality was shown to be violated in the experiments of the Zeilinger group.S. Gr√∂blacher, T. Paterek, R. Kaltenbaek, C. Brukner, M. Zukowski, M. Aspelmeyer & A. Zeilinger, An experimental test of non-local realism, Nature 446, 871‚Äì875 (2007). Abstract. In an analogous way, his group showed that even quantum systems where entanglement is not possible exhibit non-classical features which cannot be explained by underlying non-contextual probability distributions.R. Lapkiewicz, P. Li, C. Sch√§ff, N. K. Langford, S. Ramelow, M. Wiesniak & A. Zeilinger, Experimental non-classicality of an indivisible quantum system, Nature 474, 490‚Äì493 (2011).Abstract It is expected that these latter experiments will also open up novel ways for quantum information. =Neutron interferometry= Anton Zeilinger's earliest work is perhaps his least known. His work on neutron interferometry has provided an important foundation for his later research achievements. As a member of the group of his thesis supervisor, Helmut Rauch, at the Technical University of Vienna, Zeilinger participated in a number of neutron interferometry experiments at the Institut Laue‚ÄìLangevin (ILL) in Grenoble. His very first such experiment confirmed a fundamental prediction of quantum mechanics, the sign change of a spinor phase upon rotation. This was followed by the first experimental realization of coherent spin superposition of matter waves. He continued his work in neutron interferometry at MIT with C.G. Shull (Nobel Laureate), focusing specifically on dynamical diffraction effects of neutrons in perfect crystals which are due to multi-wave coherent superposition. After his return to Europe, he built up an interferometer for very cold neutrons which preceded later similar experiments with atoms. The fundamental experiments there included a most precise test of the linearity of quantum mechanics and a beautiful double-slit diffraction experiment with only one neutron at a time in the apparatus. Actually, in that experiment, while one neutron was registered, the next neutron still resided in its Uranium nucleus waiting for fission to happen. Then, as a professor at the University of Innsbruck, Zeilinger started experiments on entangled photons, as the low phase space density of neutrons produced by reactors precluded their use in such experiments. In all his career, from TU Vienna through Innsbruck and back to the University of Vienna, Zeilinger has had a most salubrious effect on the work of his colleagues and competitors alike, always noting connections and extensions to be investigated and unstintingly sharing remarks that have enhanced the field of quantum mechanics from foundational to purely applied work.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1965 to 1977, 1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1987. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1979 to 1984. He resigned from the Labour Party in 1982 to join Fine Gael. Early life O'Leary was born in Cork in 1936. He the son of a publican, O'Leary was educated at Presentation College, University College Cork, Columbia University, and King's Inns. On returning to Ireland, he became involved in the Labour Party and was employed as Education Officer for the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union (ITGWU). In this r√¥le he was instrumental in establishing the Universities Branch, affiliated to Dublin North-Central constituency, bringing together Dublin University Fabian Society and University College Dublin Labour Party students. Political career O'Leary was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Labour Party TD for Dublin North-Central at the 1965 general election. His agent was Bob Mitchell, Chairman of Dublin University Fabian Society, who could claim credit in a dirty campaign for picking up transfers to squeeze out the Labour Party front-runner on the 11th recount. When he was first elected to the D√°il, O'Leary encouraged the Labour Party to take a more left-wing stance in its policies. He was initially strongly opposed to the idea of a coalition with Fine Gael, but following the 1969 general election he believed that there was a need for a new approach. When the Labour Party and Fine Gael formed the National Coalition government following the 1973 general election he was appointed Minister for Labour. In 1977, he was narrowly defeated by Frank Cluskey for the leadership of the party. O'Leary was elected to the European Parliament for the Dublin constituency in 1979. Cluskey resigned as Labour Party leader when he lost his D√°il seat at the 1981 general election and O'Leary was elected unanimously to succeed him. In the short-lived Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party government of 1981 to 1982, O'Leary became T√°naiste and Minister for Energy. After the government's defeat at the February 1982 general election he remained as leader until he suddenly resigned both the leadership and his party membership on October 28 in the aftermath of a party conference vote on a potential coalition with Fine Gael. On November 2 he joined Fine Gael, subsequently being elected a TD for that party in the Dublin South-West constituency at the November 1982 general election. He was kept out of cabinet office by his former Labour colleagues. In 1985, O'Leary introduced a private member's bill on divorce which forced the government into holding the 1986 divorce referendum. When the Progressive Democrats were formed in 1985 he considered joining, but remained loyal to Fine Gael and Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. He did not contest the 1987 general election and afterwards he moved back to Cork and practised as a barrister. He was elected as a Fine Gael member of Cork City Council at the 1991 local elections. He unsuccessfully contested the 1992 general election in Cork North-Central and received about 2% of the valid poll. He was appointed a District Court judge in 1997 by the Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party‚ÄìDemocratic Left coalition government. Death O'Leary died in France in May 2006, following a drowning accident in a swimming pool. He was on holiday, having retired as a judge just days earlier.

He is one of Ireland's wealthiest businessmen. Early life O'Leary grew up near Mullingar, County Westmeath. His father was the part owner of a textile factory. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare before studying business and economics at Trinity College, Dublin. After graduating in 1983, he worked as a trainee with Stokes Kennedy Crowley (later known as KPMG), studying the Irish tax system. He left after two years in 1985, setting up profitable newsagents in Walkinstown and Terenure, Dublin. While at Stokes Kennedy Crowley, O'Leary had met Tony Ryan, head of Guinness Peat Aviation, a leasing company (GPA). Ryan was one of KPMG's clients and O'Leary advised Ryan on his personal income tax affairs. In 1987, Ryan hired O'Leary as his personal financial and tax advisor, where Ryan's main interest was in GPA. Ryanair career Under O'Leary's management, Ryanair further developed the low-cost model originated by Southwest Airlines. O'Leary described the ancillary revenue model in a 2001 interview, saying \\"The other airlines are asking how they can put up fares. We are asking how we could get rid of them.\\"\\"Flying for Free on Ryanair\\", 13 May 2001, BBC News The business model envisioned by O'Leary uses receipts from on board shopping, internet gaming, car hire and hotel bookings to supplement the ticket revenue from selling airline seats. Savings are also made by negotiating discounts with airports for reduced landing fees. In many cases, regional airports have made no charges so as to secure flights that bring passengers and wealth into their area. The deregulation of Ireland's major airports and a transformation of traditional full-service airlines are among his demands.RT√â radio 10 February 2007, in \\"Conversations with Eamon Dunphy\\"Irish Post: Ryanair chief hints of possible departure Controversy and reputation O'Leary has a reputation for loose talk in the airline industry and among its regulators. Many press articles have described him as arrogant, and prone to making comments which he later contradicts.British GQ 10 Things To Know Today He has been extravagantly outspoken in his public statements, sometimes resorting to personal attacks and foul language. His abrasive management style, ruthless pursuit of cost-cutting and his explicitly hostile attitude towards corporate competitors, airport authorities, governments, unions and customers has become a hallmark. He was reported to have been aggressive and hostile in dealings with a woman who was awarded free flights for life in 1988.\\"Woman claims Ryanair reneged on free travel prize\\", 28 February 2002, at RTE Business; last accessed 18 December 2006. In 2007, he was forced to retract a claim that Ryanair had cut emissions of carbon dioxide by half over the previous five years; the claim should have been that emissions 'per passenger' had been cut by half.\\"Ryanair retracts emissions claim\\", 29 January 2007, at news.bbc.co.uk; last accessed 19 March 2010. O'Leary has been reported to have impersonated a journalist in an attempt to find information passed on to a newspaper following a safety incident on a Ryanair flight. On occasion he has apologised for personal attacks under threat of legal action. He has been criticized by a judge for lying, who said he was lucky not to be found guilty of contempt of court. In April 2017, he called concerns about climate change \\"complete nonsense\\".See: Topman Ryanair: Zorg over klimaatverandering is 'complete onzin', Financieel Dagblad (a Dutch financial newspaper), 10 April 2017. Accessed on 10 April 2017. In 2002 he said that his company is against any long-haul transatlantic services, stating that: > The low-cost model only really works for short-haul flights [...] If we > started flying farther afield, we'd have to do something stupid like > introducing what I call a 'rich class' to make it pay. However, more than a decade later, in 2013 he said, while at the Paris Air Show, that he wanted to sell cheap flights from the U.S. to Europe for as low as 10 euros ($13) or $10, if conditions were right. He said that he needed a fleet of at least 30 twin-aisle aircraft and access to ports (e.g. major U.S. and European cities, in the airline industry there are so called slots or sometimes gates, often regulated by law, and without obtaining them it is impossible to have regular service to airports). Despite his claims in 2002, there were so called budget airliners in the past ‚Äì for example Laker Airways flights from London to New York in the late 1970s or long-hauls at budget- fares on other continents like AirAsiaX in Malaysia and the Australian Jetstar Group. Reacting to the decision to close European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the ash plume from an erupting Icelandic volcano, Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, he said \\"there was no ash cloud. It was mythical. It's become evident the airspace closure was completely unnecessary.\\" One study concluded that serious structural damage to aircraft could have occurred if passenger planes had continued to fly. In May 2014 O'Leary was highly critical of a 24-hour strike by Aer Lingus cabin crew, staged on 30 May 2014. Aer Lingus, whose biggest shareholder at the time was O'Leary's company Ryanair, had to cancel 200 flights and disrupt travel plans for 200,000 people. O'Leary accused Aer Lingus of \\"mismanagement\\" of its employee relations, called for the sacking of a board member, and said the striking employees should be punished by having their discount travel incentives withdrawn for a year. According to the Bilderberg Group, O'Leary was to attend the Bilderberg Group in 2015. O'Leary was also seen attending the 2017 Bilderberg meeting in Washington D.C. In February 2020 O'Leary suggested that airport security should focus on single Muslim men, and called obese passengers \\"monsters\\". =Registration of private car as taxi= Mercedes-Benz S500, operated by O'Leary Cabs and complete with \\"for hire\\" roof bar In 2004 he purchased a taxi plate for his Mercedes-Benz S-Class, to enable it to be classified as a taxi so that he could legally make use of Dublin's bus lanes to speed up his car journeys around the city. A press report suggested that since he had stopped driving his own taxi, he has employed a driver with full PSV licence. In 2005 the Irish transport minister expressed concern at this abuse by O'Leary and others. Personal life O'Leary lives in Gigginstown House near Delvin in County Westmeath. He married Anita Farrell in September 2003, and they have four children. He breeds Aberdeen Angus cattle and horses at his Gigginstown House Stud in County Westmeath. In 2006, his horses War of Attrition and in 2016 Don Cossack have won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the 2016 Grand National with Rule The World. He also won in both the 2018 Grand National and 2019 Grand National with Tiger Roll. O'Leary has also been a Manchester City supporter since an early age. In 2003, he was offered the opportunity to buy a stake in the club but believed the potential benefits did not outweigh the risk and preferred to visit England to watch a few matches each season. He wore a Manchester City shirt when unveiling Ryanair's new destinations to and from Manchester Airport in 2011. In February 2015 he revealed in an interview in The Sun that he was offered the starring role in The Apprentice reality game show, but turned it down for family reasons before it was eventually offered to and accepted by Lord Sugar.

The Heritage Front maintained a telephone message line with a different editorial each day. The voice on the hotline was Gary Schipper. The line resulted in complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and hearings into allegations that the group violated Canada's hate crime laws.Canada ( Human Rights Commission ) v. Heritage Front ( T.D. ), [1994] 1 F.C. 203; 8 Oct 1993 Docket: T-1539-92 The group organized a series of white power rock concerts in Toronto and elsewhere. Immediately after one of these concerts, a Tamil man, Sivarajah Vinasithamby, 41, returning home from work was beaten and partially paralyzed by several white power skinheads who had just left the concert. History The Heritage Front was founded in 1989 by former Nationalist Party of Canada members Wolfgang Droege, Gerry Lincoln, Grant Bristow (a plant working for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)) and James Scott Dawson. They were joined by Al Overfield and other former members of the Nationalist Party who had become disenchanted with Don Andrews's leadership and felt that a new organization and tactics were necessary. The idea for the new group was developed in early September 1989 when a delegation of 18 Canadian far right activists were visiting Libya at the invitation of Muammar al-Gaddafi, who was celebrating the twentieth anniversary of his regime. The Heritage Front formed an alliance with the Church of the Creator and its Canadian leader George Burdi. Other prominent figures in the Canadian far right, such as Paul Fromm and Ernst Z√ºndel, worked with the Heritage Front but did not join the organization. In 1992, the Heritage Front illegally brought prominent American neo-Nazis Tom Metzger and his son John Metzger to Canada to speak, and provided security at a speech by Holocaust denier David Irving. Droege retired in 1995, following legal troubles, and handed leadership over to Marc Lemire. Under Lemire's leadership, the membership of the group declined rapidly, and by 2005 it existed in name only. Now it is defunct. The activities of the Heritage Front led to the formation of an Anti-Racist Action (ARA) branch in Toronto, which engaged in a series of demonstrations and confrontations with the Heritage Front, culminating in 1993 with a riot on Parliament Hill between members of ARA and the Heritage Front after a concert by George Burdi's rock band RaHoWa. Four Heritage Front members, including Burdi, were arrested and charged with assault. Burdi was sentenced to a year in prison for aggravated assault, and later dropped out of the movement and renounced racism. A month after the clash in Ottawa, ARA held a militant demonstration outside the Toronto home of Gary Schipper, which resulted in thousands of dollars of damage to the property. Droege and other members of the Heritage Front responded that evening by attacking members of ARA outside of Sneaky Dee's - a known ARA hangout - resulting in Droege and other Heritage Front members being charged with assault. In 1995, Droege was convicted of the assault and sentenced to five months in prison. He also spent time in jail for contempt of court and other violations relating to the Canadian Human Rights Commission tribunal. Grant Bristow, a mole for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), infiltrated the group and became one of its leaders. According to the CSIS and Bristow, their aim was to gather intelligence on the far right and to suppress its violent activity. Bristow's role in the group was made public in 1994 by the Toronto Sun, and became the subject of an inquiry by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which published a report on the matter in that same year.

Culin√°ria Portuguesa, by Ant√≥nio-Maria De Oliveira Bello, better known as Olleboma; was the first ‚ÄòPortuguese-only‚Äô recipe book published in 1936. Despite being relatively restricted to an Atlantic, Celtic sustenance, the Portuguese cuisine also has strong French and Mediterranean influences. The influence of Portugal's former colonial possessions is also notable, especially in the wide variety of spices used. These spices include piri piri (small, fiery chili peppers), white pepper, black pepper, paprika, clove, allspice, cumin and nutmeg are used in meat, fish or multiple savoury dishes from Continental Portugal, the Azores and Madeira islands. Cinnamon, vanilla, cardamom, aniseed, clove and allspice are used in many traditional desserts and sometimes in savoury dishes. Garlic and onions are widely used, as are herbs, such as bay leaf, parsley, oregano, thyme, mint, marjoram, rosemary and coriander being the most prevalent. Broa was likely introduced by the Suebi as brau√æ (bread) Olive oil is one of the bases of Portuguese cuisine, which is used both for cooking and flavouring raw meals. This has led to a unique classification of olive oils in Portugal, depending on their acidity: 1.5 degrees is only for cooking with (virgin olive oil), anything lower than 1 degree is good for dousing over fish, potatoes and vegetables (extra virgin). 0.7, 0.5 or even 0.3 degrees are for those who do not enjoy the taste of olive oil at all, or who wish to use it in, say, a mayonnaise or sauce where the taste is meant to be disguised. Portuguese dishes include meats (pork, beef, poultry mainly also game (hunting) and others), seafood (fish, crustaceans such as lobster, crab, shrimps, prawns, octopus, and molluscs such as scallops, clams and barnacles), vegetables and legumes (a variety of soups) and desserts (cakes being the most numerous). Portuguese often consume bread with their meals and there are numerous varieties of traditional fresh breads like broaVerbete \\"broa\\" no dicionario Priberam . which may also have regional and national variations within the countries under Lusophone or Galician influence. In a wider sense, Portuguese and Galician cuisine share many traditions and features. Meals Traditional caldo verde served in a tigela bowl A Portuguese breakfast often consists of fresh bread, with butter, ham, cheese or jam, accompanied by coffee, milk, tea or hot chocolate. A small espresso coffee (sometimes called a bica after the spout of the coffee machine, or Cimbalino after the Italian coffee machine La Cimbali) is a very popular beverage had during breakfast or after lunch, which is enjoyed at home or at the many caf√©s in towns and cities throughout Portugal. Sweet pastries are also very popular, as well as breakfast cereal, mixed with milk or yogurt and fruit. Lunch, often lasting over an hour, is served between noon and 2 o'clock, typically around 1 o'clock and dinner is generally served around 8 o'clock. There are three main courses, with lunch and dinner usually including a soup. A common Portuguese soup is caldo verde, which consists of a base of cooked, then pureed, potato, onion and garlic, to which shredded collard greens are then added. Slices of chouri√ßo (a smoked or spicy Portuguese sausage) are often added as well, but may be omitted, thereby making the soup fully vegan. Among fish recipes, salted cod (bacalhau) dishes are pervasive. The most typical desserts are arroz doce (rice pudding decorated with cinnamon) and caramel custard, known as pudim de ovos or fl√£ de caramelo. There is also a wide variety of cheeses made from the milk of sheep, goats or cows. These cheeses can also contain a mixture of different kinds of milk. The most famous are queijo da serra from the region of Serra da Estrela, Queijo S√£o Jorge from the island of S√£o Jorge, and Requeij√£o.Queijos portugueses. Infop√©dia [Online]. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003-2013. A popular pastry is the pastel de nata, a small custard tart often sprinkled with cinnamon. Fish and seafood Past√©is de bacalhau (literally \\"codfish pastries\\") Portugal is a seafaring nation with a well-developed fishing industry and this is reflected in the amount of fish and seafood eaten. The country has Europe's highest fish consumption per capita, and is among the top four in the world for this indicator. PESSOA, M.F.; MENDES, B.; OLIVEIRA, J.S. CULTURAS MARINHAS EM PORTUGAL , \\"O consumo m√©dio anual em produtos do mar pela popula√ß√£o portuguesa, estima-se em cerca de 58,5 kg/ por habitante sendo, por isso, o maior consumidor em produtos marinhos da Europa e um dos quatro pa√≠ses a n√≠vel mundial com uma dieta √† base de produtos do mar.\\" Fish is served grilled, boiled (including poached and simmered), fried or deep-fried, stewed (often in clay pot cooking), roasted, or even steamed. Foremost amongst these is bacalhau (cod), which is the type of fish most consumed in Portugal.SILVA, A. J. M. (2015), The fable of the cod and the promised sea. About portuguese traditions of bacalhau, in BARATA, F. T- and ROCHA, J. M. (eds.), Heritages and Memories from the Sea, Proceedings of the 1st International Conference of the UNESCO Chair in Intangible Heritage and Traditional Know-How: Linking Heritage, 14‚Äì16 January 2015. University of Evora, √âvora, pp. 130-143. PDF version It is said that there are more than 365 ways to cook cod, one for every day of the year. Cod is almost always used dried and salted, because the Portuguese fishing tradition in the North Atlantic developed before the invention of refrigeration‚Äîtherefore it needs to be soaked in water or sometimes milk before cooking. The simpler fish dishes are often flavoured with virgin olive oil and white wine vinegar. Portugal has been fishing and trading cod since the 15th century, and this cod trade accounts for its widespread use in the cuisine. Other popular seafoods includes fresh sardines (especially as sardinhas assadas), sea bass, snapper, swordfish, mackerel, sole, brill, halibut, John Dory, octopus, squid, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp and prawns, lobster, spiny lobster, and many other crustaceans, such as barnacles, hake, horse mackerel (scad), scabbard (especially in Madeira), and a great variety of other fish and shellfish, as well as molluscs, such as clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and periwinkles. Caldeirada is a stew consisting of a variety of fish and shellfish with potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, parsley, garlic and onions. River lamprey and eels are considered fresh water delicacies. The Coimbra and Aveiro regions of central Portugal, are renowned for eel stews and lamprey seasonal dishes and festivals. Arganil and Penacova have popular dishes such as Arroz de Lampreia or Lampreia √† Bordalesa. Grilled sardines in Portugal Sardines used to be preserved in brine for sale in rural areas. Later, sardine canneries developed all along the Portuguese coast. Ray fish is dried in the sun in Northern Portugal. Canned tuna is widely available in Continental Portugal. Tuna used to be plentiful in the waters of the Algarve. They were trapped in fixed nets when they passed the Portuguese southern coast on their way to spawn in the Mediterranean, and again when they returned to the Atlantic. Portuguese writer Raul Brand√£o, in his book Os Pescadores, describes how the tuna was hooked from the raised net into the boats, and how the fishermen would amuse themselves riding the larger fish around the net. Fresh tuna, however, is usually eaten in Madeira and the Algarve where tuna steaks are an important item in local cuisine. Canned sardines or tuna, served with boiled potatoes, black-eyed peas, collard greens and hard-boiled eggs, constitute a convenient meal when there is no time to prepare anything more elaborate. Meat and poultry Bife com ovo √† cavalo Portuguese Chicken Piri Piri (Frango assado) Cured meats Eating meat and poultry on a daily basis was historically a privilege of the upper classes. Pork and beef are the most common meats in the country. Meat was a staple at the nobleman's table during the Middle Ages. A Portuguese Renaissance chronicler, Garcia de Resende, describes how an entr√©e at a royal banquet was composed of a whole roasted ox garnished with a circle of chickens. A common Portuguese dish, mainly eaten in winter, is cozido √† portuguesa, which somewhat parallels the French pot-au-feu or the New England boiled dinner. Its composition depends on the cook's imagination and budget. An extensive lavish cozido may include beef, pork, salt pork, several types of charcutaria (such as cured chouri√ßo, morcela e chouri√ßo de sangue, lingui√ßa, farinheira, etc.), pig's feet, cured ham, potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage and rice. This would originally have been a favourite food of the affluent farmer, which later reached the tables of the urban bourgeoisie and typical restaurants. Tripas √† moda do Porto (tripe with white beans) is said to have originated in the 14th century, when the Castilians laid siege to Lisbon and blockaded the Tagus entrance. The Portuguese chronicler Fern√£o Lopes dramatically recounts how starvation spread all over the city. Food prices rose astronomically, and small boys would go to the former wheat market place in search of a few grains on the ground, which they would eagerly put in their mouths when found. Old and sick people, as well as prostitutes, or in short anybody who would not be able to aid in the city's defence, were sent out to the Castilian camp, only to be returned to Lisbon by the invaders. It was at this point that the citizens of Porto decided to organize a supply fleet that managed to slip through the river blockade. Apparently, since all available meat was sent to the capital for a while, Porto residents were limited to tripe and other organs. Others claim that it was only in 1415 that Porto deprived itself of meat to supply the expedition that conquered the city of Ceuta. Whatever the truth may be, since at least the 17th century, people from Porto have been known as tripeiros or tripe eaters. Another Portuguese dish with tripe is Dobrada. Nowadays, the Porto region is equally known for the toasted sandwich known as a francesinha ( Frenchie diminutive). Many other meat dishes feature in Portuguese cuisine. In the Bairrada area, a famous dish is Leit√£o √† Bairrada (roasted suckling pig). Nearby, another dish, chanfana (goat slowly cooked in red wine, paprika and white pepper) is claimed by two towns, Miranda do Corvo (\\"Capital da Chanfana\\") and Vila Nova de Poiares (\\"Capital Universal da Chanfana\\"). Carne de porco √† alentejana, fried pork with clams, is a popular dish with a misleading name as it originated in the Algarve, not in Alentejo. Alentejo is a vast agricultural province with only one sizeable fishing port, Sines; and in the past, shellfish would not have been available in the inland areas. On the other hand, all points in the Algarve are relatively close to the coast and pigs used to be fed with fish, so clams were added to the fried pork to disguise the fishy taste of the meat. The dish was used to test Jewish converts‚Äô new Christian faith; consisting of pork and shellfish (two non-kosher items), Crist√£os-novos were expected to eat the dish in public in order to prove they had renounced the Jewish faith. Nowadays, however, nobody would dream of calling it carne de porco √† Algarvia. In Alto Alentejo (North Alentejo), there is a dish made with lungs, blood and liver, of either pork or lamb. This traditional Easter dish is eaten at other times of year as well. Alcatra, beef marinated in red wine, garlic and spices like cloves and whole allspice, then roasted in a clay pot, is a tradition of Terceira Island in the Azores. Alheiras basket display, Mirandela Alheira, a yellowish sausage from Tr√°s-os-Montes, traditionally served with fried potatoes and a fried egg, has an interesting story. In the late 15th century, King Manuel of Portugal ordered all resident Jews to convert to Christianity or leave the country. The King did not really want to expel the Jews, who constituted the economic and professional √©lite of the kingdom, but was forced to do so by outside pressures. So, when the deadline arrived, he announced that no ships were available for those who refused conversion‚Äîthe vast majority‚Äîand had men, women and children dragged to churches for a forced mass baptism. Others were even baptized near the ships themselves, which gave birth to a concept popular at the time: baptizados em p√©, literally meaning: \\"baptized while standing\\". It is believed that some of the Jews maintained their religion secretly, but tried to show an image of being good Christians. Since avoiding pork was a tell-tale practice in the eyes of the Portuguese Inquisition, new Christians devised a type of sausage that would give the appearance of being made with pork, but only contained heavily spiced game and chicken. Over time, pork has been added to the alheiras. Alheira-sausage varieties with PGI protection status, include Alheira de Vinhais and Alheira de Barroso-Montalegre.Alheira de Barroso-Montalegre in the DOOR Data Base of the European Union.Alheira de Vinhais in the DOOR Data Base of the European Union. Farinheira is another Portuguese smoked sausage, which uses wheat flour as base ingredient. This sausage is one of the ingredients of traditional dishes like Cozido √† Portuguesa. Borba, Estremoz and Portalegre farinheiras all have a \\"PGI\\" in the European Union. The Portuguese steak, bife, is a slice of fried beef or pork marinated in spices and served in a wine-based sauce with fried potatoes, rice, or salad. An egg, sunny-side up, may be placed on top of the meat, in which case the dish acquires a new name, bife com ovo a cavalo (steak with an egg on horseback). This dish is sometimes referred to as bitoque, to demonstrate the idea that the meat only \\"touches\\" the grill twice, meaning that it does not grill for too long before being served, resulting in a rare to medium-rare cut of meat. Another variation of bife is bife √† casa (house steak), which may resemble the bife √† cavalo or may feature garnishing, such as asparagus. Iscas (fried liver) were a favourite request in old Lisbon taverns. Sometimes, they were called iscas com elas, the elas referring to saut√©ed potatoes. Small beef or pork steaks in a roll (pregos or bifanas, respectively) are popular snacks, often served at beer halls with a large mug of beer. In modern days, a prego or bifana, eaten at a snack bar counter, may constitute lunch in itself. Espetada (meat on a skewer) is very popular in the island of Madeira. Presunto de Chaves, cured prosciutto display Presunto (prosciutto ham) comes in a wide variety in Portugal, the most famous presunto being from the Chaves region. Presunto is usually cut in thin slices or small pieces and consumed as aperitif, tea, or added as ingredient to different dishes. Several varieties of presunto are protected by European law with protected designations of origin (PDO) or protected geographical indication (PGI), such as Presunto de Barrancos or Presunto B√≠saro de Vinhais.Presunto de Barrancos in the DOOR database of the European Union. Accessed 16 March 2014.Presunto de Vinhais ou Presunto B√≠saro de Vinhais in the DOOR database of the European Union. Accessed 16 March 2014. Porco B√≠saro, a Celtic swine native to Portugal Porco b√≠saro is a prized native pig breed in Portugal with PDO status. Several products derived from this breed, such as ¬´Bucho de Vinhais¬ª, ¬´Chouri√ßo de Ossos de Vinhais¬ª and ¬´Chouri√ßa Doce de Vinhais¬ª also have PGI status. According to the General Cattle Census on the Continent of the Kingdom of Portugal (1870), ‚Äú‚Ä¶ b√≠saro is the name given to the tucked-up pig, more or less leggy, with loose ears to distinguish him from the good plump and pernicious pig of the Alentejo‚Äù. The name Celtic is proposed and used by Sanson to express the antiquity of the race of this type, which was the only one that existed in the regions inhabited by the Celtic people, such as the north of Portugal and Galicia, the former Gaul and the British islands, before the introduction in these countries, of the Asian and Romanesque races. In 1878, Macedo Pinto, describes the b√≠saro pig as an animal belonging to the Typo Bizaro or Celta, with the morphological characteristics mentioned above, distinguishing two varieties within the breed, according to the corpulence, color and greater or lesser amount of bristles. He considered the existence of pigs from 200 to 250 kg of carcass and others between 120 to 150 kg; as for color, he says they are mostly black, also some spotted and those with white fur were called Galegos, as they come from Galicia. Molarinhos were spotted animals that had few bristles and smooth, smooth skin. The same author also mentions that they are animals of slow and late growth, difficult to fatten (only completing their growth at the age of two), producing more lean meat than fat and accumulating more in the fat than in thick blankets of bacon. In 1946, Cunha Ortigosa classifies the B√≠sara breed, originally from the Celtic family, as one of the three national breeds. When describing the varieties within the breed, in addition to Galega and Beir√¥a which encompasses the Molarinho and Cerd√µes subtypes. Poultry, easily raised around a peasant's home, was at first considered quality food. Turkeys were only eaten for Christmas or on special occasions, such as wedding receptions or banquets. Up until the 1930s, the farmers from the outskirts of Lisbon would come around Christmas time to bring herds of turkeys to the city streets for sale. Before being killed, a stiff dose of brandy was forced down the birds' throats to make the meat more tender and tasty, and hopefully to ensure a happy state of mind when the time would come for the use of a sharp knife. Poor people ate chicken almost only when they were sick. Nowadays, mass production in poultry farms makes these meats accessible to all classes. Thus bifes de peru, turkey steaks, have become an addition to Portuguese tables. Vegetables and starches Brassica oleracea var. viridis, known in Portugal as couve-galega Vegetables that are popular in Portuguese cookery include numerous cabbage and collard varieties, tomatoes, onions and bell peppers. There are many starchy dishes, such as feijoada, a rich black bean stew with beef and pork, and a√ßorda, a Portuguese bread soup; ‚Äô‚Äôcozido‚Äô‚Äô stews with kale, white-beans, red- beans, Catarino and Bragan√ßano, faba-beans, black-eyed beans; pumpkins like menina and porqueira http://www.drapn.min- agricultura.pt/drapn/conteudos/cen_documentos/norte/CURCUBITACEAS.pdf varietals, are used in soups and souffl√©s. https://www.portaldojardim.com/pdj/2009/12/09/abobora One of numerous vegetable-and-starch-rich soups and broths, is Caurdo or Caldo √† Lavrador a soup made of cabbage, red beans, potatoes, prosciutto chunks and wheat-flour. Many dishes are served with salads often made from tomato, lettuce, shredded carrots and onion, usually seasoned with olive oil and vinegar. Potatoes and rice are also extremely common in Portuguese cuisine. Soups made from a variety of vegetables, root vegetables, meats and beans are commonly available, one of the most popular being caldo verde, made from potato pur√©e, thinly sliced kale, and slices of chouri√ßo. Fruits, nuts, and berries P√™ra Rocha (Pyrus communis L.) Before the arrival of potatoes from the New World, chestnuts (Castanea sativa) were widely used as seasonal staple ingredients. There is a revival of chestnut dishes, desserts and compotes in Portugal and production is relevant in inland areas of central and northern Portugal. http://www.iniav.pt/fotos/gca/manual_v_1369126967._final_agro_448_red.pdf Other seasonal fruit, nuts and berries such as: Pears, apples, table grapes, plums, peaches, cherries, sour cherries, melons, watermelons, citrus, figs, apricots, walnuts, pine nuts, almonds, hazelnuts, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, redcurrant and blueberries are part of the Portuguese diet. These are consumed naturally or used as desserts, marmalades, compotes, jellies and liqueurs. Cheese A plate of Portuguese cheeses There are a wide variety of Portuguese cheeses, made from cow's, goat's or sheep's milk. Usually these are very strongly flavoured and fragrant. Traditional Portuguese cuisine does not include cheese in its recipes, so it is usually eaten on its own before or after the main dishes. The Queijo da Serra da Estrela, which is very strong in flavour, can be eaten soft or more matured. Serra da Estrela is handmade from fresh sheep's milk and thistle-derived rennet. In the Azores islands, there is a type of cheese made from cow's milk with a spicy taste, the Queijo S√£o Jorge. Other well known cheeses with protected designation of origin, such as Queijo de Azeit√£o, Queijo de Castelo Branco. The Queijo mesti√ßo de Tolosa, is the onlyRegisted cheeses from Portugal in the DOOR database of the European Union. Retrieved 26 March 2014 Portuguese cheese with protected geographical indication and it is made in the civil parish of Tolosa, in the small village of Nisa, Portalegre District, Alto Alentejo. Nearby is also Queijo de Nisa another local variation within the Portalegre District. Alcoholic beverages =Wines and beers= Porto wine Bunch of Alvarinho grapes Wine (red, white and \\"green\\") is the traditional Portuguese drink, the ros√© variety being popular in non-Portuguese markets and not particularly common in Portugal itself. Vinho verde, termed \\"green\\" wine, is a specific kind of wine which can be red, white or ros√©, and is only produced in the northwestern (Minho province) and does not refer to the colour of the drink, but to the fact that this wine needs to be drunk \\"young\\". A \\"green wine\\" should be consumed as a new wine while a \\"maduro\\" wine usually can be consumed after a period of ageing. Green wines are usually slightly sparkling. Traditionally grown on the schist slopes of the River Douro and immediate tributaries, Port wine is a fortified wine of distinct flavour produced in Douro, which is normally served with desserts. Alvarinho white wines from Minho are also highly sought after. Vinho da Madeira, is a regional wine produced in Madeira, similar to sherry. From the distillation of grape wastes from wine production, this is then turned into a variety of brandies (called aguardente, literally \\"burning water\\"), which are very strong-tasting. Typical liqueurs, such as Licor Beir√£o and Ginjinha, are very popular alcoholic beverages in Portugal. In the south, particularly the Algarve, a distilled spirit called medronho, which is made from the fruit of the strawberry tree. Beer was already consumed in Pre-Roman times, namely by the Lusitanians who drank beer much more than wine. The latinised word ‚Äòcerveja‚Äô (from cerevisia < cervesia) derives from an older Celtic term used in Gaul. During the Reconquista, many knights from Northern Europe preferred beer to the local wine. The ‚ÄòBiergarten‚Äô culture, called Cervejaria in Portugal, is widespread in all regions and several local brands are popular with locals and visitors alike. Lisbon has a Beer Museum focusing on Portuguese and Lusophone countries‚Äô beer traditions. Pastries and sweets Past√©is de Nata and other sweets at a shop in Lisbon P√£o-de-L√≥ Marzipan in Lisbon Portuguese version of Cr√®me br√ªl√©e, known as Leite-creme Portuguese sweets have had a large impact on the development of Western cuisines. Many words like marmalade, caramel, molasses and sugar have Portuguese origins. The Portuguese sponge cake called p√£o-de-l√≥ is believed to be based on the 17th century French recipe pain de lof, which in turn derived from Dutch ‚Äúloef‚Äù. The French eventually called their cake Genoise. Probably the most famous of the Portuguese patisseries are the past√©is de nata, originally known as Past√©is de Bel√©m in the Lisbon district with the same name in the early nineteenth century. It is unclear when and where the recipe was first started. Monks of the military-religious Order of Christ lived in a church on the same location and provided assistance to seafarers in transit since the early fourteenth century, at least. The House of Aviz and the Jer√≥nimos Monastery followed, the monastery lastly being occupied by the Hieronymite monks. Following the 1820 liberal revolution, events led to the closure of all monastic orders. The Past√©is de Bel√©m were first commercialised just outside the Jer√≥nimos monastery by people who had lost their jobs there. The original patisserie, adjacent to the monastery still operates today. This pastry is now found worldwide, it is known in the UK by its original name or also as Portuguese custard tart. Many of the country's typical pastries were created in the Middle Ages monasteries by nuns and monks and sold as a means of supplementing their incomes. The names of these desserts are usually related to monastic life; barriga de freira (nun's belly), papos d‚Äôanjo (angel's chests), and toucinho do c√©u (bacon from heaven). For that reason, they are often referred to as do√ßaria conventual or receitas mon√°sticas (monastic recipes). Their legacy dates back to the 15th century when sugar from overseas became easier to access by all classes. Nuns at the time, were often young nobles who inherited knowledge from their households and developed recipes. These recipes were passed and perfected from generation to generation, usually within the secrecy of convents. Many of today‚Äôs Portuguese deserts originated in convents and monasteries. The Andalusian influence in Southern Portugal can be found in sweets that incorporate figs, almonds and honey, namely the Algarve marzipan colourful sweets. Most towns have a local specialty, usually egg or cream- based pastry. Some examples are leite-creme (a dessert consisting of an egg custard-base topped with a layer of hard caramel, a variant of creme br√ªl√©e) and pudim fl√£. Other very popular pastries found in most caf√©s, bakeries and pastry shops across the country are the Bola de Berlim, the Bolo de arroz, and the Tent√∫gal pastries. Doce de Chila/Gila is made from squash), wafer paper, and candied egg threads called fios de ovos or angel hair.Rice pudding is also popular. Influences on world cuisine Portuguese-influenced Brazilian feijoada vindalho served alongside other Portuguese-Goan dishes P√£o de Castela (Kasutera), a specialty of Nagasaki, Japan Portugal formerly had a large empire and the cuisine has been influenced in both directions. Portuguese influences are strongly evident in Brazilian cuisine, which features its own versions of Portuguese dishes, such as feijoada and caldeirada (fish stew). Other Portuguese influences can be tasted in the Chinese territory of Macau (Macanese cuisine) and in the Indian province of Goa, where Goan dishes, such as vindalho (a spicy curry), show the pairing of vinegar, chilli pepper and garlic. The Persian orange, grown widely in southern Europe since the 11th century, was bitter. Sweet oranges were brought from India to Europe in the 15th century by Portuguese traders. Some Southeast Indo-European languages name the orange after Portugal, which was formerly its main source of imports. Examples are Albanian portokall, Bulgarian portokal [–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–æ–∫–∞–ª], Greek portokali [œÄŒøœÅœÑŒøŒ∫Œ¨ŒªŒπ], Persian porteghal [Ÿæÿ±ÿ™ŸÇÿßŸÑ], and Romanian portocalƒÉ. In South Italian dialects (Neapolitan), the orange is named portogallo or purtualle, literally \\"the Portuguese ones\\". Related names can also be found in other languages: Turkish Portakal, Arabic al-burtuqal [ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±ÿ™ŸÇÿßŸÑ], Amharic birtukan [·â¢·à≠·â±·ä´·äï], and Georgian phortokhali [·É§·Éù·É†·Éó·Éù·ÉÆ·Éê·Éö·Éò]. The Portuguese imported spices, such as cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) now liberally used in its traditional desserts and savoury dishes, from Asia. The Portuguese \\"canja\\", chicken soup made with pasta or rice, is a popular food therapy for the sick, which shares similarities with the Asian congee, used in the same way, indicating it may have come from the East. In 1543, Portuguese trade ships reached Japan and introduced refined sugar, valued there as a luxury good. Japanese lords enjoyed Portuguese confectionery so much it was remodelled in the now traditional Japanese konpeit≈ç (candy), kasutera (sponge cake), and keiran somen (the Japanese version of Portuguese \\"fios de ovos\\" (angel hair). This dish is also popular in Thai cuisine under the name of \\"kanom foy tong\\"),Kyoto Foodie, Wagashi: Angel Hair Keiran Somen (Fios de Ovos) Where and what to eat in Kyoto, 20 December 2008 creating the Nanban- gashi, or \\"New-Style Wagashi\\". During this Nanban trade period, tempura was introduced to Japan by early Portuguese missionaries. Catherine of Braganza, 1665 Tea was made fashionable in Britain in the 1660s after the marriage of King Charles II to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza (Catarina De Bragan√ßa), who brought her liking for tea, originally from the colony of Macau, to the court. The love of tea, which makes the English English; was actually influenced by a Portuguese woman and her tea habits. This princess became the Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. When she relocated up north to join King Charles, she is said to have packed loose-leaf tea as part of her personal belongings; it would also have likely been part of her dowry. A fun legend has it that the crates were marked Transporte de Ervas Aromaticas (Transport of Aromatic Herbs) ‚Äì later abbreviated to T.E.A. Queen Catherine also introduced marmalade to the British and another European novelty to the court‚Äôs table etiquette: using a knife and fork, instead of eating with your fingers. All over the world, Portuguese immigrants influenced the cuisine of their new \\"homelands\\", such as Hawaii and parts of New England. P√£o doce (Portuguese sweet bread), malassadas, sopa de feij√£o (bean soup), and Portuguese sausages (such as lingui√ßa and chouri√ßo) are eaten regularly in the Hawaiian islands by families of all ethnicities. Similarly, the \\"papo-seco\\" is a Portuguese bread roll with an open texture, which has become a staple of caf√©s in Jersey, where there is a substantial Portuguese community. In Australia and Canada, variants of \\"Portuguese-style\\" chicken, sold principally in fast food outlets, have become extremely popular in the last two decades.Bird on the wing Sydney Morning Herald, 16 April 2004 Offerings include conventional chicken dishes and a variety of chicken and beef burgers. In some cases, such as \\"Portuguese chicken sandwiches\\", the dishes offered bear only a loose connection to Portuguese cuisine, usually only the use of \\"Piri-piri sauce\\" (a Portuguese sauce made with piri piri) and the connection is made simply as a marketing technique. The Portuguese had a major influence on African cuisine and vice versa. They are responsible for introducing corn in the African continent. In turn, the South African restaurant chain Nando's, among others, have helped diffusing Portuguese cuisine worldwide, in Asia for example, where the East Timorese cuisine also received influence. =Madeira wine and early American history= The indoors of the company Pereira D'Oliveiras of Madeira wine production and selling in Funchal, Madeira The 18th century Madeira was more popular in North America and the Caribbean than it did in the British Empire. Barrel-aged madeira especially was a luxury product consumed by wealthy colonists. The price continued to rise from ¬£5 at the start of the 18th century to ¬£43 by the early 19th-century. It was even served as a toast during the First Continental Congress in 1775. Madeira was an important wine in the history of the United States of America. No wine- quality grapes could be grown among the 13 colonies, so imports were needed, with a great focus on Madeira. One of the major events on the road to revolution in which Madeira played a key role was the British seizure of John Hancock's sloop the Liberty on 9 May 1768. Hancock's boat was seized after he had unloaded a cargo of 25 casks (3,150 gallons) of Madeira wine, and a dispute arose over import duties. The seizure of the Liberty caused riots to erupt among the people of Boston. Madeira wine was a favorite of Thomas Jefferson after George Wythe introduced him to it. It was used to toast The Declaration of Independence and George Washington, Betsy Ross, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams are also said to have appreciated the qualities of Madeira. The wine was mentioned in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. On one occasion, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, of the great quantities of Madeira he consumed while a Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. A bottle of Madeira was used by visiting Captain James Server to christen the USS Constitution in 1797. Chief Justice John Marshall was also known to appreciate Madeira, as did his fellow justices on the early U.S. Supreme Court.

The country's cuisine is shaped by its location in the fertile North Sea river delta of the European Plain, giving rise to fishing, farming (for crops and domesticated animals), and trading over sea, its former colonial empire and the spice trade. Traditionally, Dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward, with many vegetables and little meat: breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings like cheese, while dinner is meat and potatoes, supplemented with seasonal vegetables. The diet contains many dairy products and was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat, reflecting the dietary needs of the laborers whose culture molded the country. Without many refinements, it is best described as rustic, though many holidays are celebrated with special foods. During the twentieth century, Dutch cuisine and diet changed. Influenced by the eating culture of its colonies (particularly the Dutch East Indies), it became more cosmopolitan and most international cuisines are represented in the major cities. History A still life with turkey pie, oysters, lemon and grapes by Pieter Claesz (1627). =12th‚Äì13th centuries= Little evidence is available about food and drink in the late medieval Low Countries. In the consumption of pottage, the Low Countries were not very different from other Western European countries during the Middle Ages. Half-liquid pottage consisted of milk, beer, water, root vegetable and peas or grain, sometimes enriched with a piece of meat. The content changes throughout the seasons. Beer flavoured with gruit was produced until the 14th century at the monasteries. Gruit was replaced with hop, a tradition introduced from the German city of Bremen, and this started off a beer culture and the Low Counties as a major exporter of beer. Beer was in medieval times the common drink as water was of poor quality, and milk‚Äîcoming from the low- lying grasslands of Holland and Friesland‚Äîwas mainly used for the production of butter and cheese. Dutch butter and cheese became famous products at an early stage and continued to be so for centuries. =14th‚Äì15th centuries= The sea and the rivers provided an abundance of fish. The process of gibbing was invented by Willem Beukelszoon, a 14th-century Zealand fisherman. The invention created an export industry for salt herring () that was monopolized by the Dutch. They began to build ships and eventually moved from trading in herring to colonizing and the Dutch Lowlands (the Netherlands as a country did not exist until 1581), ultimately leading to the Dutch becoming a seafaring power. Herring is still very important to the Dutch who celebrate Vlaggetjesdag (Flag Day) each spring, as a tradition that dates back to the 14th century when fishermen went out to sea in their small boats to capture the annual catch (Hollandse Nieuwe), and to preserve and export their catch abroad. Gardening was initially practiced by monasteries, but castles and country houses began also to develop gardens with herbs and vegetables and hunting grounds. The famous tourist attraction and flower park Keukenhof (literally kitchen garden) is an example of a former 15th-century hunting ground and herbs garden for Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut's castle kitchen. Orchards for pears and apples connected to castles were later used for export and set off a Dutch horticulture tradition that remains to this day. During the 15th century haute cuisine began to emerge, largely limited to the aristocracy. Cookery books from this period are aimed at the upper class. The first Dutch-language cook book printed in Brussels is called Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen (A notable book of cookery) from ca. 1510. It offers medieval recipes for festivities, such as sauces, game, jellies, fish, meat, pies, eggs, dairy products, candied quinces and ginger and contains one of the oldest known recipes for 'appeltaerten', apple pie. The recipes come from various sources, 61 of them are translations of the French recipe book Le Viandier. Historically, Dutch cuisine was closely related to northern French cuisine, since the two countries have nearby borders and the Low Countries and Northern France have been historically ruled by the Dukes of Burgundy. This is still visible in traditional Dutch restaurants and the Southern regional cuisine, that is still colloquially referred to as Bourgondisch. =16th‚Äì17th centuries= As the Dutch Republic enters its Golden Age in the 17th century, dishes of this kind became available to the wealthy middle class as well, often consisting of a rich variety of fruits, cheeses, meat, wine, and nuts. The Dutch Empire enabled spices, sugar, and exotic fruits to be imported to the country. The Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale to Europe. The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon. The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in 1711. By the late 17th century, tea and coffee consumption were increasing and becoming part of everyday life. Tea was served with sweets, candy or marzipan and cookies. The availability of relatively cheaper spices resulted in a tradition of spiced cookies called speculaas, the exact recipes of which were kept secret by bakers. Vegetables, meat, poultry and salted, smoked or fresh fish and eggs were prepared in the Dutch kitchens of the time. The meal started with green salads and cold or warm cooked vegetables with dressing, vegetable dishes with butter, herbs or edible flowers and continued with numerous fish- and meat dishes. Exotic ingredients such as dates, rice, cinnamon, ginger and saffron were used. Savoury tarts and pastries followed. The meal ended with jellies, cheese, nuts and sweet pastries, washed down with sweet spiced wine.De verstandige kok. Marleen Willebrands Of course, even in the Golden Age, not everyone could afford such luxuries and the everyday meal of the ordinary Dutchman was still a humble affair of grain or legume pottage served with rye.

In the early 19th century, while the rich could eat what they desired, the working population ate bread (rye bread in some areas) and potatoes, pancakes in some areas, occasionally fish and other seafood, fruit and vegetables, but usually little meat: \\"the diet of the Dutch in the nineteenth century consisted of some bread, and a great deal of potatoes\\". The diet consisted in a frugal fashion, of such simple dishes as bread and herring. Throughout the nineteenth century many people suffered from some mild form of malnutrition. Potatoes, in fact, were often eaten at every meal, every day of the week. They were peeled and boiled for the main meal, lunch, and then warmed and mashed for dinner, with leftovers saved for breakfast. They were served with salt, sometimes vinegar, but without gravy or any other fat, making for a diet with \\"incredible monotony\\". During the nineteenth century, the poor people drank little else but water (of poor quality), sometimes watery coffee (or chicory) or tea. In some areas hot chocolate was consumed, but the most popular drinks (beside water) were beer and jenever. For most of the century beer was drunk in the southern part, where Catholicism dominated, and in Catholic enclaves in the other areas. Jenever consumption early in the nineteenth century was twice that of the equivalent consumption of distilled spirits in neighbouring countries. =20th‚Äì21st centuries= The modest and plain look of what is nowadays considered the traditional Dutch cuisine, appears to be the result of a fairly recent development. In the twentieth century, the new availability of mass education meant that a great number of girls could be sent to a new school type, the Huishoudschool (housekeeping school), where young women were trained to become domestic servants and where lessons in cooking cheap and simple meals were a major part of the curriculum, often based on more traditional Dutch dishes, and leading to increased uniformity in the Dutch diet. Values taught in that school system included frugality, proper table manners, and healthy eating. Regional cuisines Gouda cheese market Modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. =Northeastern cuisine= A metworst from Groningen. The regions in the north and east of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers make up north eastern Dutch cuisine. The region is the least populated area of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry, though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the IJsselmeer also include a large amount of fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the metworst-family of Dutch sausages, are found throughout the region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Most towns and various villages have their own variety of this sausage. The region also produces the traditional smoked sausages, of which (Gelderse) rookworst is the most renowned. These sausages traditionally have been smoked over wood chips, and are served after they have been boiled in water. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot, hutspot or zuurkool (sauerkraut); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food. In Gelderland and Overijssel kruudmoes was a traditional food. The provinces are also home to rye bread (a kind of Pumpernickel) and many kinds of pastries and cookies. In contrast to southern Dutch cuisine, which tends to be soft and moist, the northeastern rye bread and pastries generally are of a hard texture, and the pasties are heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of Kruidkoek (such as ), ' and ' (small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron) are considered typical. Each of the provinces of Gelderland, Overijssel and Groningen has a long-standing rye bread tradition, but rye bread from Friesland became well known because of its taste. Notable characteristics of Fries roggebrood (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark color. In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many bitters (such as Beerenburg) and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from Jenever, typical for the rest of the country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. Friese Nagelkaas (Friesian Clove) is a notable example. =Western cuisine= Edam cheese A Zeeuwse bolus with butter The provinces of North Holland, South Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and the Gelderlandic region of Betuwe are the parts of the Netherlands which make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Due to the abundance of surface water and grassland, necessary to sustain dairy cattle, the area is known for its many dairy products, which includes prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Leyden (spiced cheese with cumin), Edam (traditionally in small spheres) as well as Leerdammer, and Beemster. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter- making process, karnemelk (buttermilk), is also considered typical for this region. Seafood such as soused herring, mussels (called Zeeuwse Mosselen, since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's Oosterschelde), eels, oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region. Kibbeling, once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish, has become a national fast food, just as '. Pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy, and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelized, powdered or crystallized. The oliebol (in its modern form) and Zeeuwse bolus are good examples. Cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar, like stroopwafel, as well as a filling of some kind, mostly almond, like '. Zaanstreek in North Holland is known for its chocolate industry, due to the development of the Dutch process chocolate in 1828 by Coenraad van Houten, that introduced the modern era of chocolate and was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form which was up till then drunk as a liquid. Zaanstreek is since the 16th century also known for its mayonnaise (for the Dutch a popular condiment to eat with French fries), and typical whole-grain mustards (popular to eat with bitterballen). The traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer (strong pale lager) and Jenever, a high proof juniper-flavored spirit, that came to be known in England as gin. A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, Advocaat, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region. =Southern cuisine= Limburgish vlaai Southern Dutch cuisine constitutes the cuisine of the Dutch provinces of North-Brabant and Limburg and the Flemish Region in Belgium. It is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes and is often called Burgundian which is a Dutch idiom invoking the rich Burgundian court which ruled the Low Countries in the Middle Ages renowned for its splendor and great feasts. It is the only Dutch culinary region which developed an haute cuisine and it forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants including typical main courses served such as Biefstuk, Varkenshaas, Ossenhaas, these are premium cuts of meat, generally pork or beef, accompanied by a wide variety of sauces and potatoes which have been double fried in the traditional Dutch (or Belgian) manner. Hachee Stews, such as hachee, a stew of onions, beef and a thick gravy, contain a lot of flavour and require hours to prepare. Vegetable soups are made from richly flavored stock or bouillon and typically contain small meatballs alongside a wide variety of different vegetables. Asparagus and witloof are highly prized and traditionally eaten with cheese or ham. Pastries are abundant, often with rich fillings of cream, custard or fruits. Cakes, such as the Vlaai from Limburg and the Moorkop and Bossche Bol from Brabant, are typical pastries. Savoury pastries also occur, with the worstenbroodje (a roll with a sausage of ground beef, literally translates into sausage bread) being the most popular. The traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer. There are many local brands, ranging from Trappist beer to Kriek lambic. 5 of the 11 International Trappist Association recognised breweries in the world, are located in the Southern Dutch cultural area. Beer, like wine in French cuisine, is also used in cooking; often in stews. Foods origin =Native= Dutch agriculture roughly consists of five sectors: tillage-based, greenhouse-based, fruit agriculture, animal husbandry and fishery. * Tillage-based crops include potatoes, kale, beetroot, green beans, carrots, celeriac, onions, all the common kinds of cabbages, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, endive, spinach, Belgian endive, asparagus and lettuce. Recently some initiatives have been started to encourage interest in such \\"forgotten\\" vegetables as common purslane, medlars, parsnips, and black salsify. * Greenhouses are used to produce tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, and sweet peppers * Fruits include apples, pears, cherries, berries, and plums * The Dutch keep cattle for milk, butter, cheese, and for their meat, chickens for their eggs and for meat, pigs for their meat and a variety of non-edible products, and sheep for their wool and meat. Usually, the goat meat is increasingly kept for a cheese production. Traditionally, the horse meat was a common dish (steak, sausage, and thinly- sliced smoked meat) but is less popular today. * The fishery sector lands cod, herring, European plaice, sole, mackerel, eels, tuna, salmon, trout, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and sardines. The Dutch are famous for their smoked eel and soused herring, which is eaten raw. =Colonial influences= A small rijsttafel at a private party in Rotterdam, Netherlands Indonesian and Indo dishes became popular due to the arrival of former Dutch colonials and people of Eurasian descent into the Netherlands, especially after the independence of Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule in 1949. C. Countess van Limburg Stirum writes in her book The Art of Dutch Cooking (1962): \\"There exist countless Indonesian dishes, some of which take hours to prepare; but a few easy ones have become so popular that they can be regarded as 'national dishes'\\". She then provides recipes for nasi goreng (fried rice), pisang goreng (fried bananas), lumpia goreng (fried spring rolls), bami (fried noodles), satay (grilled skewered meat), satay sauce (peanut sauce), and sambal oelek (chilli paste).C. Countess van Limburg Stirum: The Art of Dutch Cooking; First published in 1962 by Andre Deutsch Limited, London; p.179-p.185 Of the Dutch- Indonesian fusion dishes the best known is the rijsttafel (\\"Rice table\\"), which is an elaborate meal consisting of many (up to several dozens) small dishes (hence filling \\"an entire table\\"). While popular in the Netherlands, Rijsttafel is now rare in Indonesia itself, while almost every town in the Netherlands has an Indonesian-Chinese restaurant. A popular fusion dish is ', patatje oorlog or patatje pinda, French fries with satay sauce as condiment, served at snack bars. Surinamese cuisine is also popular in the Netherlands, especially in the bigger cities. Surinamese establishments commonly offer roti, a staple of the Hindustani community in Suriname, various Surinamese interpretations of Chinese Indonesian cuisine, as well as Surinamese sandwiches (Surinaamse broodjes). =International influences= Italian and American style pizzerias have become widespread. In recent decades, Arab and Turkish dishes have become increasingly popular as well, especially as a snack food. In larger towns and cities, small restaurants selling kebabs, shawarma, and falafel can be found on virtually any street corner. Nowadays, food from every nook or corner of the world can be found throughout the country, especially in bigger towns and cities, including Greek, Thai, Japanese, and even African cuisines. Structure of meals =Breakfast and lunch= A boterham met oude kaas (sandwich with \\"old\\" cheese) Hagelslag, muisjes and vlokken on display in a Dutch supermarket. Kruidkoek, peperkoek, and ontbijtkoek are a few of the regional names for a local version of gingerbread. Uitsmijter spek en kaas: a couple of eggs fried with bacon and cheese Breakfast and lunch differ little in Dutch cuisine and both consist of bread with a wide variety of cold cuts, cheeses and sweet toppings; such as hagelslag, vlokken, muisjes, ', chocolate spread, treacle (a thick, dark brown sugar syrup called stroop), apple butter and peanut butter. The Dutch are famous for their dairy products and especially for their cheeses. The vast majority of Dutch cheeses are semi-hard or hard cheeses. Famous Dutch cheeses include Gouda cheese, Edam cheese, and Leyden cheese. A typically Dutch way of making cheese is to blend in herbs or spices during the first stages of the production process. Famous examples of this are cheeses with cloves (usually the Friesian Clove), cumin (most famously Leyden cheese), or nettles. Dutch bread tends to be very airy, as it is made from yeast dough. From the 1970s onward Dutch bread became predominantly whole grain, with additional seeds such as sunflower or pumpkin seeds often mixed with the dough for taste. Rye bread is one of the few dense breads of the Netherlands. White bread used to be the luxury bread, often made with milk as well as water. A Frisian luxury version of white bread is suikerbrood, white bread with large lumps of sugar mixed with the dough. Kerststol is a traditional Dutch Christmas bread made of bread dough with sugar, dried fruits, raisins, almond paste; and currants, and lemon and orange zest, eaten sliced, spread with butter. Ontbijtkoek may be eaten as a substitute for a full breakfast, or simply as a snack. It is served as a small slice, usually with butter. =Tea time= Dutch people invite friends over for koffietijd (coffee time), which consists of coffee and cake or a biscuit, served between 10:00 and 11:00 am (before lunch), 4:00 pm (between lunch and dinner) or between 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm (after dinner). The Dutch drink coffee and tea throughout the day, often served with a single or double biscuit. Dutch thrift led to the famous standard rule of only one cookie with each cup of coffee. It has been suggested that the reasons for this can be found in the Protestant mentality and upbringing in the northern Netherlands. The traditionally Roman Catholic south does not share this tradition as for instance in Limburg, where serving a large vlaai (sweet pie or pastry with filling), cut into eight pieces, is tradition when visitors are expected. A popular Dutch story (never confirmed) says that in the late 1940s the wife of the then Prime Minister, Willem Drees, served coffee and one biscuit to a visiting American diplomat, who then became convinced that the money from the Marshall Plan was being well spent. Caf√© au lait is also very common. It is called koffie verkeerd (literally \\"wrong coffee\\") and consists of equal parts black coffee and hot milk. The Dutch drink tea without milk and the tea is quite a lot weaker than typical English or Irish types of tea which are stronger and are usually taken with milk. Other hot drinks used to include warm lemonade, called kwast (hot water with lemon juice), and anijsmelk (hot milk with aniseed). In the autumn and winter the very popular hot chocolate or chocolate milk is drunk. Both anijsmelk and kwast are hardly drunk any more and have lost their popularity. =Borreltijd= Borrelnootjes Between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm it is time for an alcoholic beverage (borrel), beer or wine, and a savory snack. This is when the famous bitterballen is served: a mini variant of the kroket, deep-fried ragout filled balls with a crunchy layer of very fine bread-crumbs. Bitterballen is served with mustard. Borreltijd mostly occurs on the weekends. Also (peanuts in a spiced crusty coating) and kaasstengels (crusty cheese sticks) are typical borrel snacks. =Dinner= Boerenkoolstamppot, with rookworst Dutch pea soup, also called snert Dinner, traditionally served early by international standards, starts around or even before 6 o'clock in the evening. The old-fashioned Dutch dinner consists of one simple course: potatoes, meat and vegetables‚Äîknown under the acronym \\"AVG\\" (aardappelen, vlees, groente). AVG consists traditionally of potatoes with a large portion of vegetables and a small portion of meat with gravy, or a potato and vegetable stew. Vegetable stews served as side dishes are for example rodekool met appeltjes (red cabbage with apples), or rode bieten (beetroot). Regular spices used in stews of this kind may be bay leaves, juniper berries, cloves, and vinegar, although strong spices are generally used sparingly. Stews are often served with pickles, including augurken (gherkins) or cocktail onions (zilveruitjes). Due to the influx of other countries, traditional meals have lost some popularity. Stamppot, mashed potatoes with different options for vegetables, is traditionally eaten in winter. If there is a starter, it is usually soup. The below listed meals have historic origins as meals for common laborers. From the 17th to 19th centuries workers worked 10 to 16 hours on farms or in factories in unheated rooms, hence these meals are very heavy on calories and fat and were meant to replenish a laborer's energy. *Stamppot, boiled potatoes mashed with vegetables and served with a meat and/or gravy, comes in a number of varieties: ** Hutspot, made with potatoes, carrots, and onions served with meats like rookworst (smoked sausage), slow-cooked meat, or bacon. Before potatoes were introduced in Europe hutspot was made from parsnips, carrots, and onions ** Stamppot andijvie, raw endive mashed with hot potatoes, served with diced fried spek (a kind of bacon) ** Hete bliksem (\\"hot lightning\\"), boiled potatoes and green apples, served with stroop (treacle) or tossed with diced speck ** Stamppot zuurkool, sauerkraut mashed with potatoes. Served with fried bacon or a sausage. Sometimes curry powder, raisins or slices of pineapple or banana are used to give a stamppot an exotic touch ** Stamppot boerenkool, curly kale mixed with potatoes, served with gravy, mustard, and rookworst sausage. It is one of the oldest and most popular Dutch dishes. Boerenkool was mentioned in cookbooks from the year 1661. 1661 mashed potatoes were not used in this dish yet, although the sausage was already served with the cabbage in this dish. The dish became popular after a few bad corn-seasons when potatoes became popular as food. Stamppot boerenkool is high in carbohydrates, which makes it a popular meal for cold winter days. * Snert, also called erwtensoep, is a very thick pea soup that can be served either as a main dish or as an appetizer and is traditionally eaten during the winter. Snert has a very thick consistency and often includes pieces of pork and rookworst and is almost a stew rather than a soup. The thick consistency of the Dutch pea soup is often described as that \\"...you should be able to stand a spoon upright in a good pea soup\\".Hester, Carla Dutch food and eating habits The Holland Ring, 28 October 2008 It is customarily served with roggebrood (rye bread) spread with butter and topped with katenspek, a variety of bacon which is first cooked and then smoked. The meat from the soup may also be put on the rye bread and eaten with mustard. Meat dishes include: Slavink (at top) with potatoes and sweet pepper sauce * Gehaktballen, meatballs (usually made of half pork, half beef) * Slavink, minced meat wrapped in bacon * Balkenbrij, a type of liverwurst and meatloaf. The butter based gravy (boterjus), in which the meat has been fried or cooked, is also served. A variant of this, eaten around the IJsselmeer, is butter en eek, where vinegar is added to the gravy. Flour dishes: * Pannekoeken (large and thin pancakes) with bacon, apples, cheese, or raisins. * Poffertjes (miniature pancakes) and spekdik (a Northern variant with bacon). * ' (similar to French toast). * Broeder, a type of boiled pudding usually containing buckwheat, is a traditional dinner mainly in West Friesland. Seafood: *' (mussels) are quite popular and commonly served with french fries. *Kibbeling, chunks of sea fish that are battered and fried. =Dessert= chocolate and vanilla vla The final course is a sweet dessert, traditionally yogurt with some sugar or vla, thin milk pudding (cooked milk with custard). Other desserts include: *Vla (vanilla custard) is often mixed with yogurt (and sometimes yoghurt and syrup, making the Dutch vla-flip). *', a bread porridge made from old bread, milk, butter, and sugar. *', a sweet pudding made of semolina and served with red berry coulis. *'''' *'''' *'''' *'''' *'''' *' (rice pudding) *Krentjebrij (also called watergruwel) =Special occasions= Oliebollen, a Dutch pastry eaten on New Year's Eve Appeltaart, Dutch apple pie A chocolate letter of the first letter of the child's name is a typical present given to children during the Sinterklaas feast; it is supposedly thrown down the chimney by a Zwarte Piet or by Sinterklaas himself Special occasions call for special foods. The birth of a child is an occasion for serving beschuit met muisjes (Dutch rusk covered with sugared aniseed). The Dutch festival of Sinterklaas is held on 5 December. Saint Nicholas leaves gifts in the children‚Äôs shoes. On this occasion, the Dutch drink hot chocolate milk and eat spice cookies, like speculaas. Special treats distributed by Saint Nicholas' aide Zwarte Piet include pepernoten (irregular shaped small cookies made of rye, honey and anise, often confused with kruidnoten); kruidnoten (gingernut-like biscuits but made with speculaas spices: a mix of cinnamon, pepper, cloves, and nutmeg); ' or banket (a baked pastry crust filled with a sugared almond paste filling and shaped into a letter); chocolate letters; marzipan (often in the shape of animals or other topical items), ' (discs of fondant); and '. Christmas in the Netherlands is a typical family holiday. Traditionally there is family brunch with kerststol (fruited raisin bread; often filled with almond paste). Christmas dinner is also a family occasion where ' (a kind of roulade consisting of spiced pork), roast pork, game, or other luxury meat may be served. On New Year's Eve, Dutch houses smell of the piping hot oil of deep-fat fryers used to prepare oliebollen and ' (a kind of apple fritter) ‚Äì not to be mistaken for the ' which is completely different. Also ananasbeignets (pineapple fritter) are considered a treat. Oliebollen are yeast dough balls, either plain or filled with glac√© fruits, apple pieces, raisins, and sultanas are served with powdered sugar and are a special treat for New Year's Eve. In the 17th century, Dutch settlers also took their oliebollen to the American colonies, where they are now known in a slightly different form as doughnuts. In Limburg, nonnevotten are sometimes served during New Year's Eve, although it is mostly eaten during Carnival. Around New Years ' are popular, in particular in the northern provinces. On birthdays all kinds of cakes and cookies are eaten, including appeltaart, ', bossche bol, ', ', ' (cookies filled with almond meal), ', janhagel, , ', ', ', ', ', ', peperkoek (gingerbread), ', spekkoek (originally from Indonesia), ', tompouce, ', ', ', and stroopwafel. Poffertjes are tiny puffed pancakes served on special occasions, served warm with melting butter and powdered sugar on top. They are mostly combined with a drink: plain milk, chocolate milk, or a yogurt drink. Cafeterias all around the Netherlands sell poffertjes. Dutch people call such a restaurant a '. Poffertjes can be eaten as a dessert after dinner or as a sweet lunch. =Sweets= Griotten, a type of soft sweet Dutch liquorice A famous Dutch sweet is zoute drop and other liquorice sweets. These sweets are small, black and look much like gums. Similar to Pontefract cakes found in Yorkshire, England. The four types of drop are soft sweet, soft salt, hard sweet, and hard salty drop. Liquorice can be bought in shops and pharmacies. It also has a medical function as it is supposed to soften the symptoms throat and stomach aches. Dutch drop is sold in a large variety of shapes and forms. When they are flavored with coconut fondant they are called ' (lit. \\"English liquorice\\"; liquorice allsorts). Other varieties are made with honey ('), mint ('), salammoniac (salmiakdrop), or laurel ('). Typical shapes are diamonds, ovals, oblongs, and as coins. A honeycomb shape for honey ' is also popular. Some manufacturers have introduced speciality ranges where the drop is made in thematic shapes, such as cars ('), farm animals, and farm machinery ('), etcetera. Another popular Dutch sweet is the stroopwafel (\\"stroop\\" meaning syrup). A thin waffle cookie, made typically in a pizelle pan, is sliced horizontally and used for sandwiching a layer of syrup, the stroop. Occasionally, crushed hazelnuts will be mixed with the stroop, and the dough may be spiced with cinnamon. One of the Dutch confectionery specialties is vlaai. It is a sweet pie made with a yeast dough and filled with fruit (such as apple, apricot, pineapple, plum, or berry filling). Other ingredients may include custard and rhubarb. Rice vlaai, stuffed with a rich rice-and-cream filling, and pudding vlaai sprinkled with crumbs are also popular. They can be additionally grafted with fruits, whipped cream or chocolate. Banket is a type of pastry or cookie that is traditionally eaten on Saint Nicholas Day (December 6, but celebrated as a children's feast on the 5th) and on Christmas Eve in Holland. =Alcoholic drinks= Bottles of Heineken, Grolsch, and Bavaria beer Wine plays only a modest role in Dutch cuisine, but there are many brands of beer and strong alcoholic liquor. The most famous Dutch beer producers are Heineken in the west, Grolsch in the east, Alfa and Bavaria in the south. Traditionally, Noord-Brabant and Limburg had a strong beer tradition, brewing many different types of beer (not unlike beer in Belgium). The Dutch cities in the west used to have a long brewing tradition as well, but in the 20th century, big brewers took over many of these smaller breweries or offered them a license to sell their beer brand, while stopping their own production. In the 21st century, many new microbreweries were founded, brewing top fermenting beers in many different styles. In September 2013, there were 184 active breweries in the Netherlands. Popular styles include bock, trappist ale, stout, and wheat beer. Of the range of bitters, Beerenburg is the most famous. Strong liquors include Jenever (distilled malt wine and the precursor to Gin), ' (brandy) and Vieux, which is an imitation Cognac, but also Kandeel (made from white wine), ' (a liquor made from aniseed), ' (an orange-flavored brandy, which is traditionally served on festivities surrounding the royal family), Advocaat, Boerenjongens (raisins in brandy), and ' (apricots in brandy). =Fast food= A frikandel with fries Hollandse nieuwe, \\"new\\" raw herring Gerookte paling, smoked eel The Dutch have their own types of fast food, sold at a snack bar. A Dutch fast food meal often consists of a portion of French fries (called patat or friet), with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany French fries is fritessaus (a low fat mayonnaise substitute), while others can be ketchup or currysaus, hot peanut sauce, a pickle relish of chopped vegetables and spices, such as piccalilli or joppiesaus. Sometimes the French fries are served with a combinations of different sauces, most famously speciaal (lit. \\"special\\"), which consists of mayonnaise with spiced ketchup, chopped raw onions, and ' (lit. \\"war\\"), which consists of fries covered in a generous amount of hot peanut sauce, mayonnaise, and chopped raw onions. A recently introduced Dutch-Turkish variety from Rotterdam is the kapsalon (lit. \\"barbershop\\"), consisting of fries, topped with either shawarma, kebab, or d√∂ner kebab and finished with salad, cheese, and various sauces such as sambal and garlic sauce. Snacks made with meat are usually deep fried. This includes the frikandel (a skinless minced meat sausage), and the kroket (a meat ragout roll covered in breadcrumbs). They are available in bread rolls, especially Broodje kroket in order to take away. A smaller, round version of the croquette, which is the bitterballen, is often served with mustard as a snack in bars but also at official receptions. Regional snacks include the ' (a combination of egg and ragout) in the north and east of the country, and the slightly spiced ' or ', slightly spiced sausage meat baked in pastry (similar to the English sausage roll). Other snacks are the Indonesian-inspired bamischijf (a disk shaped mie goreng patty which is covered with breadcrumbs and deep-fried), ' (similar to the bamischijf, a deep-fried nasi goreng filled ball covered in breadcrumbs), and kaassouffl√© (lit. \\"cheese souffl√©\\" it is a deep fried puff pastry envelope with a small amount of cheese in the center, popular with vegetarians). Fish is also sold as fast food at the so-called viskraam, most often street stalls and market stalls that specialize only in prepared fish products. The Netherlands is famous for its raw herring, optionally served together with chopped raw onions and gherkins, and which is eaten by lifting the herring high up into the air by its tail, and then biting into it upwards (except for Amsterdam, where the herring is cut to pieces and served on paper platter). Raw herring is also commonly sold in a soft white bun.

Members were known as Labour Unionists. 1918 and 1919 were the years of intense class conflict throughout Britain. This period also saw a large increase in trade union membership and a series of strikes. These union activities raised fears in a section of the Ulster Unionist leadership, principally Edward Carson and R. Dawson Bates. Carson at this time was president of the British Empire Union, and had been predisposed to amplify the danger of a Bolshevik outbreak in Britain.Paul Bew, Peter Gibbon and Henry Patterson, Northern Ireland: 1921 / 2001 Political Forces and Social Classes, Serif (London 2002), , pp. 16‚Äì17. Founding The Ulster Unionist Labour Association was made up of trade unionists and Ulster Unionists and was founded by Carson along with John Miller AndrewsJohn Miller Andrews chaired UULA meetings later becoming a Minister of Labour from 1921 to 1937. He was Minister of Finance from 1937 to 1940, when on the death of Lord Craigavon, he became the second Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.Brian Lalor, The Encyclopaedia of Ireland, Gill & Macmillan (Ireland 2003), , pp. 23‚Äì24 as a means of instigating a purge from the local trade union movement of 'Bolsheviks' and republicans. Both Carson and Bates feared this class conflict and the development of a militant Sinn F√©in would threaten the class alliance with dissolution which had been embodied in the old Ulster Volunteers. By sounding the counter-revolutionary alarm, it would be a call to \\"loyal workers\\" against the twin threats of socialism and republicanism. The grouping adopted as formal policy an opposition to socialism, but was seen by many as an attempt to show that the Unionist Party had the interests of the working class at heart.John F. Harbinson, The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882‚Äì1973, p. 67. Members included Tommy Henderson, later an independent Unionist MP. 1918 General Election During the 1918 General Election the aims of the UULA were set out by R. Dawson Bates. In a letter to Carson he stated that they would be used as a means of distracting younger members of the working class from the Independent Labour Party, who held views which were very different from their own organisation, i.e. socialism.Jurgen Elvert, Northern Ireland, past and present, Stuttgart: F. Steiner, 1994. , p. 93. The Belfast Labour Party put four candidates forward but the results were disappointing. They lost out to two UULA and two Unionist candidates. The UULA had three members returned, all of them in Belfast.Graham S. Walker, A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, pragmatism and pessimism, Manchester University Press (2004), , p. 44. Workers' strike Predominantly Protestant, Belfast engineering and shipyard workers traditionally well organised, staged a three-week strike demanding a 10-hour reduction in the working week. This was done in defiance of the national leadership of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. The strike was extended to include electricity and municipal gas workers causing large sections of industry and commerce to close down. They began to publish a daily newspaper and a General Strike Committee was formed and began to issue permits allowing only \\"necessary\\" production. Sectarianism By 1920 growing unemployment in the linen industries and engineering sector were creating tension within the \\"Protestant bloc\\". Large numbers of well organised ex-servicemen were still out of work and a cause of concern to the local middle class. It was the local middle class who alleged that \\"peaceful penetration\\" of Belfast industry during the war by thousands of Catholics created the unemployment problem, especially that of the ex- servicemen. It would be the local middle class who succeeded in giving the conflict its sectarian twist. In the spring and summer of 1920 \\"indignation\\" meetings were held in Belfast by working-class members of Carson‚Äôs ‚ÄúOld Town Hall circle‚Äù to attack the British unions for their \\"Bolshevism\\" and \\"pro- republicanism\\". Leading Unionists and employers went along in these events and even justified them, as they perceiving themselves to be vulnerable. After one meeting held in the shipyards in July, attacks began on workers identified as Belfast Labour members, socialists and Catholics. This then spread to some sections of the linen industry and the engineering industry resulting in over \\"8,000 expulsions within a week.\\"Bew, Gibbon and Patterson, Northern Ireland (2002), pp. 18‚Äì19. Paul Collins suggests that the expulsions were partly the result of a speech made by Carson on 12 July Orange Order celebrations linking Labour with Sinn F√©in: \\"‚Ä¶These men who come forward as the friends of Labour care no more about Labour than does the man in the moon. Their real object, and the real insidious nature of their propaganda is that they mislead and bring about disunity amongst our own people and in the end before we know where we are, we may find ourselves in the same bondage and slavery as is the rest of Ireland in the South and West.\\"Elvert, Northern Ireland, past and present (1994), p. 94. Collins however suggests that the direct cause of the expulsions was the killing of Banbridge RIC man Colonel Smyth on 7 July in Cork. Rail Union members in the south of Ireland refused to allow his body travel home by train, leading many Loyalists to then identify the Labour movement with his assassins. It was on the day of his funeral Collins says that the expulsions began resulting in ten thousand Catholics and so-called \\"Rotten Prods\\" with connections to Labour. Most Protestant employers looked on with tacit approval as \\"Vigilance Committees\\" were established to prevent \\"disloyalist\\" workers from being re-employed. Protestant domination of the Belfast industries was celebrated with Union Jack unfurlings and addressed by members of the UULA. B Specials established Catholic retaliation and reprisals were inevitable with gun and bomb attacks on trains carrying shipyard workers. This resulted in yet more reprisals with widespread looting and burning of Catholic owned businesses. The British army while guarding Catholic properties clashed with Protestant crowds with fatal consequences. This resulted in UULA creating an \\"unofficial special constabulary\\", with members drawn chiefly from the shipyards, tasked with \\"policing\\" Protestant areas. Carson and Craig need to establish a militant basis for resistance to republicanism wished to reconstitute the UVF‚Äô which could operate independently of the British. They then set about securing British government approval and funds for the UULA constabularies in Belfast along with the UVF. While Sir Neville Macready commander-in-chief of the British army in Ireland withheld his approval, he and his supporters in the Irish administration were over-ridden; Lloyd George's government approved from the beginning and granted official status in the form of the B Specials in November 1920. This official endorsement would shape both the formation of the state of Northern Ireland and Catholic feelings to it. Other activities Besides its opposition to a united Ireland and to socialism, the Association did not make serious attempts to speak on behalf of loyalist workers. However, it did organise some limited adult education in its early days, and opened two working men's clubs in East and North Belfast. The Association was also able to appoint twenty delegates to the Ulster Unionist Council as late as the early 1970s.Harbinson, The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882‚Äì1973, p. 185. Decline The organisation was never able to attract leading trade unionists, and soon declined in importance. While Andrews and William Grant were initially able to speak on its behalf in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, in later years only the less prominent William Kennedy and occasional Senators sat in the Stormont Parliament.Harbinson, The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882‚Äì1973, p. 68. The Great Depression saw many workers look instead to the official trade union movement and the Northern Ireland Labour Party, and many branches of the UULA became moribund. A drive to reinvigorate the UULA was launched in the 1950s, although only one new branch was formed, in Derry. In the 1970s, its role as a movement for the mobilisation of the loyalist working classes was taken over by more militant groups such as the Loyalist Association of Workers and the Ulster Workers Council. Already by the early 1970s, the Association's primary role was organising the wreath-laying at the annual memorial service for Carson, and today it exists solely to perform this ceremonial role.Peter Barberis et al., Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p. 255.

It contains the Caldera de Taburiente, which dominates the northern part of the island, and was designated as a national park in 1954. The telescopes of the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory are situated very close to the summit. Topography and flora The caldera is about 10 km across, and in places the walls tower 2000 m over the caldera floor. The highest point is the Roque de los Muchachos on the northern wall, at 2426 m altitude, which can be reached by road. The Cumbrecita is at a lower point in the south-eastern part of the caldera's rim. In the south-west, the caldera opens to the sea, through a riverbed called the Barranco de las Angustias. The Cumbre Nueva is a ridge that starts at the caldera and continues to the south. The main flora of the national park comprises a large forest of Canary Island Pine, with a population of the endangered Canary Islands Juniper also present.  Geological origins A satellite picture of the Caldera de Taburiente. Barranco de las Angustias is in the upper right and Cumbre Nueva is in the upper left. (South is above and north is below.) The caldera originated some 2 million years ago, with a massive shield volcano about 20 km in diameter. The caldera was not formed by an explosion of that volcano, however, but by erosion starting from the volcano's original crater. Modern history During the Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands in the 15th century, the caldera was the site of the last stand of the indigenous people of the archipelago, a branch of the Guanches known as Benahoaritas. It proved impregnable to the invading Spaniards, and they only defeated the Benahoarita by luring their leader out on the pretext of holding talks. In 1815, German geologist Christian Leopold von Buch visited the Canary Islands, during which he visited the island of Tenerife where he was taken to the Caldera de las Ca√±adas. He visited La Palma after he had been to Tenerife, and in his journal he makes it clear that he was able to distinguish between a caldera of volcanic origin and the erosional origins for the caldera Taburiente. Following his return to Germany he published his journal and he introduced the term caldera to the geological vocabulary. In the 1830s the caldera provided inspiration for some art that combined a study of geology with botany, such as the work of Sabin Berthelot and Felix-Achille St. Aulaire.Met Museum New York, \\"A Memory of Caldera\\" by Felix-Achille St. Aulaire, online at http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/356782 Name The word caldera means cauldron in Spanish.

It is located on the West bank of the Oder River, on the border with Poland, about 20 km south of Szczecin, Poland. It is located within the historic region of Pomerania. History Preserved medieval town walls The existence of the town was first documented in 1124, when it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, which had been conquered by the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth. It was then visited by Otto of Bamberg,Gustav Kratz, Die St√§dte der Provinz Pommern. Abriss ihrer Geschichte, zumeist nach Urkunden, Berlin, 1865, p. 145 (in German) who was entrusted by Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth with the Christianization of Western Pomerania.D. J. Medley, The church and the empire, Kessinger Publishing, 2004, p. 152 The name of the town derives from Old-Polabian from the word * < *, meaning \\"small fortified settlement\\". Following the fragmentation of Poland in 1138 it was part of the separate Duchy of Pomerania, which in 1227 fell under the overlordship of the multi-ethnic Holy Roman Empire. In 1236, the castle was the seat of the local Slavic castellan. In 1249 Gartz was granted town privileges by Duke Barnim I the Good. Because of its strategic location on the river, the town was frequently vulnerable during military campaigns. In 1284, it was one of the Pomeranian towns that guaranteed a peace treaty between the Duchy of Pomerania and the Margraviate of Brandenburg.Kratz, p. 147 It was granted several privileges by Pomeranian dukes in the following decades.Kratz, p. 147-148 During a Pomeranian succession war, in 1468, the town opened its gates to Brandenburgians, what was taken in other Pomeranian cities and towns as an act of treason.Kratz, p. 150 In 1473, the Duchy of Pomerania made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture the town, however in 1477, with the help of the cities of Stargard and Szczecin, Gartz was finally recaptured, which was confirmed in a subsequent peace treaty. In 1502, Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania temporarily resided in the town. The town was devastated in the Thirty Years' War, the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War and the Great Northern War in the 17th‚Äì18th century. In the 17th century it became part of Sweden, in 1720 it was annexed by Prussia, and from 1871 it formed part of the German Empire. In the final stages of World War II, in 1945, the town was heavily destroyed. Since the Oder-Neisse line was made the German-Polish border after the defeat of Nazi Germany in the war in 1945, Gartz is now a border town. After the war it was part of communist East Germany. After the fall of communism in Central Europe and the German reunification, in 1990 Gartz entered a partnership with the nearby Polish town of Gryfino as its twin town, and in 1998 river cruises between the towns were launched. In 1991, the town was assigned to the state of Brandenburg, despite historically belonging to Pomerania. In 1993, a Polish-German school project was established at the local school. The town was affected by the 1997 Central European flood. Many Poles moved to Gartz, and as of 2014, 32 of 62 children in the local kindergarten had non-German parents.Zuzug in die Uckermark, Hurra, die Polen kommen!

She has been a news presenter and journalist for many years and in more recent times, has become popular throughout social media. In 2016, she was nominated for the Gold Logie becoming the first SBS personality to be nominated for the award in the station's 36-year run. Early life Lee Lin Chin was born in Jakarta, Indonesia to Chinese parents and grew up in Singapore where her media career began in television and radio in 1968. =Media career in Australia= Lee Lin Chin, at the Logies. Chin's eccentric style has led her to somewhat of an iconic status. Chin migrated to Australia in 1980 where she began working for SBS TV as a translator for Chinese language films. Wanting to return to broadcasting, Chin moved to ABC Radio in both Newcastle and Darwin. In 1987, Chin moved to SBS World News, presenting the weekend news, where she remained until her retirement in 2018. Chin has had many roles throughout her career, including news reading, research, reporting, interviews, selecting and programming music, voice-overs for commercials, and producing in-flight programmes for international airlines. Chin has also starred in a minor role as a newsreader in the independent Australian movie Resistance by Hugh Keays- Byrne. She also had a small role, playing a Thai interpreter, in the 1989 Australian mini-series Bangkok Hilton, with Nicole Kidman. More recently, Chin has been involved in creating small segments for SBS's The Feed where she presents small comedy segments including 'Pranked with Lee Lin Chin', 'Lee Lin Chin Versus Maggie Beer', 'Celebrity Chin Wag', comedic cooking show 'Lee Linguine' and most recently 'The Real Newsreaders of Sydney' with fellow newsreaders Sandra Sully and Natalie Barr. On 18 May 2015, she was announced to be Australia's spokesperson for the 2015 Eurovision Song Contest. She gave the \\"all-important\\" twelve points to the eventual winner, Sweden's M√•ns Zelmerl√∂w and his song \\"Heroes\\".

In 2018, she was replaced in this role by Ricardo Goncalves. On 6 August 2015, The Sydney Morning Herald revealed that the tweets posted on Chin's official Twitter account were ghostwritten by comedian Chris Leben, head comedy writer for The Feed. It is unclear how much of an input Chin actually has in overseeing the account, however, an SBS spokesperson insists that Chin \\"Has to see everything that goes out in her name.\\" Chin's depiction on The Feed and social media are more or less an exaggeration of herself that are \\"inspired by\\" her personality. An SBS insider states that Chin \\"can be quite funny, which she is never allowed to be on the news.\\" They believe the key to her success is that \\"people get to see something they don't usually get to see.\\" In July 2018, Chin announced her resignation stating that \\"...working two days a week didn't give me enough time to devote to the pub and re-reading the complete works of Shakespeare. So now that I work zero days that issue has been addressed.\\" In October 2018, Chin was placed number 74 on Maxim magazine's Hot 100 list Personal life Lee Lin enjoys travelling and reading, William Faulkner being a particular passion of hers.

As in all traditional folk dishes, the exact recipe is not consistent from time to time, or place to place. Basic ingredients include lamb, or mutton (mutton is used as it comes from less tender sheep over a year old, is fattier, and has a stronger flavour, and was generally more common in less- affluent times), as well as potatoes, onions, and parsley. It may sometimes also include carrots. Irish stew is also made with kid goat. Irish stew is considered a national dish of Ireland. History Close-up view of an Irish stew, with a Guinness stout Stewing is an ancient method of cooking meats that is common throughout the world. After the idea of the cauldron was imported from continental Europe and/or Britain, the cauldron (along with the already established spit) became the dominant cooking tool in ancient Ireland, ovens being practically unknown to the ancient Gaels. The cauldron, along with flesh-hooks for suspending the meat, eventually became preferred over the spit for feasting purposes, as evidenced by archaeological findings that indicate a predominance of flesh hooks over roasting spits in Ireland and Britain. Many food historians believe that goat was originally the meat of choice, eventually being supplanted by beef and mutton. The root vegetables and meat (originally goat) for the stew were then all in place, save for the potato. The introduction of the potato, originally a South American crop, did not occur until after the 16th century. A 19th-century American recipe was recorded by Helen Stuart Campbell, a professor of domestic science at Kansas State Agricultural Culture. According to Campbell the stew was made with boneless beef or mutton, trimmed of fat and cut into small cubes, less than one inch square. To its broth were added onions and potatoes, and carrots (if beef was used), with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper. This stew was gently simmered for several hours and thickened with flour before serving.  Laws and regulations  =Canada= According to Canadian regulations, commercially produced Irish stew must contain at least 20% mutton, lamb, and 30% vegetables. It may also include gravy, salt, seasoning, and spices.

Grammatically, ' is in the ablative case, with an instrumental meaning. The phrase comes from a prayer of confession of sinfulness, known as the Confiteor, used in the Roman Rite at the beginning of Mass or when receiving the sacrament of Penance. The expression is used also as an admission of having made a mistake that should have been avoided, and may be accompanied by beating the breast as in its use in a religious context.  Religious use  In the present form of the Confiteor as used in the celebration of Mass, mea culpa is said three times, the third time with the addition of the adjective maxima (\\"very great\\", usually translated as \\"most grievous\\"), and is accompanied by the gesture of beating the breast.

I me repente.\\"Troilus and Criseyde, Book II, 525 Although the Confiteor was not then part of the Mass, it was used in administering the sacrament of Penance. In some forms it already included the phrase mea culpa. Thus the 9th-century Paenitentiale Vallicellanum II had a thrice-repeated mea culpa (without maxima) in its elaborate form of the Confiteor. In about 1220, the rite of public penance in Siena for those who had committed murder required the penitent to throw himself on the ground three times, saying: Mea culpa; peccavi; Domine miserere mei (\\"Through my fault. I have sinned. Lord, have mercy on me\\").

Her poetry was mainly in Afrikaans, although she has translated some of her own work (and those of others) into English. Eybers was born in Klerksdorp, Transvaal. She grew up in the town of Schweizer-Reneke, where her father was a Nederduits-Hervormde (Dutch Reformed) minister. After completing her high school studies there at the age of 16, she enrolled at the University of the Witwatersrand for a Bachelor of Arts degree, which she achieved cum laude. After her graduation she became a journalist. In 1937 Eybers married the businessman Albert Wessels, with whom she had three daughters and a son. Counted among the so-called Dertigers, she became the first Afrikaans woman to win the Hertzog Prize for poetry in 1943. She won the prize again in 1971. Her work has received many other awards in both South Africa and the Netherlands, including the Constantijn Huygens Prize in 1978 and the P. C. Hooft Award in 1991. Eybers' first collection of poems, Belydenis in die Skemering (\\"Confession at twilight\\"), was published in 1936. Her second collection, Die Stil Avontuur (\\"The silent adventure\\"), was published in 1939 and was mainly about being a mother. Die Vrou en ander verse (The woman and other poems) was published in 1945 while her fourth poetry collection, Die Ander Dors (The other thirst) was published in 1946. Many other poetry collections followed regularly, including: * Tussensang (In-between song), 1950 * Helder Halfjaar (Bright half-year), 1956 * Versamelde Gedigte (Collected poems), 1957 * Neerslag (Precipitation), 1958 * Balans (Balance), 1962 * Onderdak (Under shelter), 1965 * Kruis of Munt (Head or tail), 1973 More recent works include the bilingual Verbruikersverse/Consumer's verse (1997) en Winter-surplus (1999). Translations of her poems have also been published in German, French, Italian and Hebrew. The South African composer Cromwell Everson composed a song using Eybers' poem \\"Die Vreemde Dae\\". After her divorce in 1961 she met Pieter Hennipman, with whom she stayed until his death in 1994.Ena Jansen (1998) Afstand & verbintenis. p. 107 She lived in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and she was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery.

The first Delta III launch was on August 26, 1998. Of its three flights, the first two were failures, and the third, though declared successful, reached the low end of its targeted orbit range and carried only a dummy (inert) payload. The Delta III could deliver up to 8,400 pounds (3,800 kilograms) to geostationary transfer orbit, twice the payload of its predecessor, the Delta II. Under the four-digit designation system from earlier Delta rockets, the Delta III is classified as the Delta 8930.  Description  DCSS upper stage undergoing testing at Plum Brook Field Station in January 1998 Like the Delta II, the first stage of the Delta III burned kerosene and liquid oxygen and was powered by one Rocketdyne RS-27A main engine with two vernier engines for roll control. While the propellant load and gross mass of the stage were nearly identical to the Delta II, the diameter of the kerosene tank was increased from 2.4 meters to 4 meters. This reduced the overall length of the vehicle and allowed the Delta III to use the same launch facilities as the Delta II with only minor modifications. First stage thrust was augmented by nine GEM-46 solid rocket boosters, sometimes referred to as GEM LDXL (Large Diameter Extended Length). These were 14.7 meters in length, 1.2 m (46 inches) in diameter, and had a mass of 19 metric tons each, about 6 metric tons more than the Delta II's standard GEM-40 motors. Six were ignited on the launch pad, while the remaining three were ignited just before burnout and separation of the ground-lit boosters. To maintain steering authority, three of the boosters had vectoring nozzles. GEM-46 boosters would later find use on the Delta II, leading to the Delta II Heavy. The second stage of the Delta III was the newly developed Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS), which burned liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The liquid hydrogen tank was 4 meters in diameter, while the separate liquid oxygen tank was 2.4 meters in diameter. This stage offered significantly better performance than the Delta II's second stage, the Delta-K, which burns hypergolic propellants. The DCSS was powered by a Pratt & Whitney RL10B-2 engine, derived from the RL10 powering the Centaur upper stage but featuring electromechanical actuators for gimbal control and an extending nozzle for increased specific impulse. After Delta III's retirement, this stage was modified for use as the Delta IV's second stage. The payload fairing was a new composite design, matching the upper stage hydrogen tank at 4 meters diameter and allowing larger payloads than the Delta II's 9.5 or 10 foot fairing. Payload to GTO (Geostationary-Transfer Orbit) was doubled versus the Delta II but the consecutive failures of the initial Delta IIIs, combined with the more-advanced Delta IV program and the continuing success of the Delta II, left the Delta III as an interim vehicle.  Launches  Delta Flight 259: The inaugural launch on August 26, 1998 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ended in failure, when software adapted from the Delta II caused a guidance failure during first-stage flight. The failure and subsequent vehicle motion depleted the hydraulic fluid used for steering. Upon loss of control, the vehicle was destroyed. The Galaxy 10 satellite (Hughes HS601 HP type) was destroyed. Delta Flight 269: The second launch on May 4, 1999, carrying the Orion 3 satellite (Hughes HS601 model), also ended in failure. The second stage engine experienced a pressure anomaly and rupture, and shut down while its second burn was underway, leaving the payload in a useless orbit. Delta Flight 280: The third and final flight on August 23, 2000 launched a satellite simulator into a 180.76 √ó 20,694 km orbit. While the apogee was 2,710 km lower than the targeted 185 √ó 23,404 km, and somewhat a partial failure, it was within the allowable 3,000 km margin of error and demonstrated the propellant depletion shutdown capability of the DCSS, modified versions of which would become the second stage of the Delta IV.

Early life  Born at Mordano, province of Bologna, Grandi was a graduate in law and economics at the University of Bologna in 1919 (after serving in World War I). Grandi started a career as a lawyer in Imola. Attracted to the political left, he nonetheless became impressed with Benito Mussolini after the two met in 1914, and became a staunch advocate of Italy's entry into the World War. He joined the Blackshirts at age 25, and was one of 35 Fascist delegates elected, along with Mussolini, in May 1921 to the Chamber of Deputies. Grandi survived an ambush carried out by leftist militants in 1920, and had his studio devastated on one occasion.  Fascist statesman  John Simon in 1932 After the March on Rome on 28 October 1922, in which the Fascists took power in Italy, Grandi became part of the new government; first as the undersecretary of the interior (1923), then as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1929) and then as Italy's ambassador to the United Kingdom (1932 to 1939). Grandi was an ally to the most radical and violent groups of fascists, always surrounding himself with members of the Blackshirts. He used his power base to voice criticism of Mussolini's attempt to reach an armistice with left-wingers and was at one point under suspicion for having attempted to replace the latter with the skeptical alleged Mussolini forerunner Gabriele D'Annunzio. In 1939, he was recalled to Italy after attempting a pact between his country and Britain to prevent Italy from entering World War II. Under pressure from Hitler, Mussolini removed him from the post of ambassador and appointed him Minister of Justice. As a diplomat, Grandi created a net of connections that were rivaled only by Mussolini's son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano, and he attempted to use it for his own gains. Thus, he persuaded King Victor Emmanuel III to grant him a title in 1937, and he managed to retain a comfortable position until he was sent by Mussolini to the Greek Front with the other Gerarchi in 1941. As Mussolini's ambassador to London, he had affairs with some of the most influential noblewomen of the time--including Lady Alexandra Curzon, daughter of the Viceroy of India, George Curzon.  Coup and later life  Grandi reportedly opposed the antisemitic Italian Racial Laws of 1938, and the country's entry into World War II. He was dropped from the Cabinet in February 1943 for his increasing criticism of the war effort. As the war began to have its devastating effect on Italy after the Allied invasion of Sicily, Grandi and other members of the Fascist Grand Council met on 24 July 1943. When Mussolini said that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south, Grandi launched a blistering attack on his former comrade-in-arms. He then made a motion (Ordine del giorno Grandi) asking King Victor Emmanuel III to resume his full constitutional authority. The resolution, voted at 2:00 on 25 July, passed by a vote of 19 to 8, with one abstention, effectively removing Mussolini from office. Those leading government figures who had voted for the resolution included Giuseppe Bottai and Emilio De Bono as well as Grandi. The King had Mussolini arrested the same day. Grandi also negotiated a truce with the left-wing movements, notably with the trade unions (grouped in the Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro), which gave way to the Italian resistance movement against Nazi Germany. While the Allies occupied the south, an alternate Fascist government was established in Northern Italy as the Italian Social Republic. It sentenced Grandi to death in absentia for treason in the Verona trial that took place on 8 to 10 January 1944. Grandi, however, had made sure to flee to Francisco Franco's Spain in August 1943. He lived there, then in Portugal (1943‚Äì1948), Argentina,\\"Former Mussolini Aide Lands in Argentina,\\" The Modesto Bee, 16 March 1949, p.6 and then S√£o Paulo, Brazil, until he returned to Italy in the 1960s; he died in Bologna. Coincidentally, Grandi died on the same weekend as two postwar Italian Fascist leaders. Like Grandi, Pino Romualdi died on 21 May 1988, and Giorgio Almirante died the following day.\\"Obituaries Dino Grandi, 92; rival of Mussolini's,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, 24 May 1988, p.48  References  External links * Category:1895 births Category:1988 deaths Category:People from the Province of Bologna Category:Counts of Italy Category:Members of the Grand Council of Fascism Category:Foreign ministers of Italy Category:Mussolini Cabinet Category:Deputies of Legislature XXVI of the Kingdom of Italy Category:Members of the Chamber of Fasces and Corporations Category:Ambassadors of Italy to the United Kingdom Category:Italian lawyers Category:Italian military personnel of World War I Category:Italian people of World War II Category:People sentenced to death in absentia Category:Recipients of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus Category:Italian exiles Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Dino Grandi"},{"id":"918842","text":"Finn Tugwell (born 18 March 1976) is a Danish table tennis player who currently plays for Roskilde BTK.

It is the type genus of the poppy family, Papaveraceae. Description The flowers have two sepals that fall off as the bud opens, and four (or up to six) petals in red, pink, orange, yellow, or lilac. There are many stamens in several whorls around a compound pistil, which results from the fusion of carpels. The stigmas are visible on top of the capsule, and the number of stigmas corresponds to the number of fused carpels. The ovary later develops into a dehiscing capsule, capped by the dried stigmas. The opened capsule scatters its numerous, tiny seeds as air movement shakes it, due to the long stem. The typical Papaver gynoecium is superior (the flower is hypogynous) with a globular ovary. The style is characteristically absent for the type species opium poppy, and several others, although those with a style do exist. The sessile plate-like stigmata lies on top of the ovary. Pollen- receptive surfaces. The characteristic fruit type of Papaver is the unilocular capsule. The stigmatic disc rests on top of the capsule, and beneath it are dehiscent pores or valves.Bernath. 1998. Poppy: the genus Papaver.‚Äî(Medicinal and aromatic plants : industrial profiles; v. 3).

Meconidium, P. sect. Oxytona, P. sect. Papaver, P. sect. Pilosa, P. sect. Pseudopilosa, P. cambrica, P. sect. Californicum, P. sect. Horrida and P. sect. Rhoeadium *Clade 3. P. sect. Argemonidium, Roemeria refracta The following are lectotypified with their lectotype species: * P. sect. Carinatae (P. macrostomum Boiss. & Huet) * P. sect. Oxytona (P. orientale L.) * P. sect. Macrantha (P. orientale L.) - superfluous * P. sect. Calomecon (Calomecon orientale) Phylogeny of Papaver and related genera Illustration of Papaver argemone Papaver sect. Argemonidium includes four annual, half-rosette species, P. argemone, P. pavonium, P. apulum, and P. hybridum (Kadereit 1986a). Papaver apulum, P. argemone and P. pavonium occur allopatrically from the Adriatic Sea to the Himalayan range. P. hybridum is distributed widely from the Himalayas to Macaronesian Islands. These species are easily distinguished in petal and capsule characters, but are clearly closely related according to molecular analysis. Argemonidium is a sister group to all other Papaver sections, with characteristic indels. Morphological characters also support this distinction, including the presence of an apical plug in the capsules, long internodes above the basal leaf rosette, bristly capsules and polyporate pollen grains.Ernst WR. 1962. A comparative morphology of the Papaveraceae. PhD thesis, Stanford University, Stanford, California Carolan et al. (2006) supported Kadereit et al. (1997)‚Äôs suggestions that Argemonidium and Roemeria are in fact sister taxa. They share some morphological characters that distinguish them from Papaver, including polyporate pollen grains, and long internodes superior the basal leaf rosette. Previous taxonomies of the Old World clade did include the close relationship between Argemonidium and Roemeria, nor Argemonidium‚Äôs distinctness from Papaver s.s. Carolan suggest Argemonidium be elevated to genus status, with Roemeria a sub-genus. Papaver spicatum Papaver sect. Meconella is widely distributed, with populations spanning central, inner and eastern Asia, Siberia, Scandinavia, northern Greenland, Canada, the Rocky Mountains, and regions of Europe. It has been distinguished from other Papaver sections morphologically by its bristly, valvate capsules, pinnatisect leaves, pale stamen, and white, orange or yellow corolla. Older taxonomies divided Meconella into two groups based on degree of leaf dissection (finely dissected leaves vs. broad leaf lobes). Kadereit (1990) and Kadereit and Sytsma (1992) regarded finely dissected leaves as a derived character, and suggested that Meconella formed a group with Argemonidium as sister to other Papaver sects. Bittkau and Kadereit (2002) demonstrated that for P. alpinum s.l. broad leaf lobes were ancestral. Carolan et al. (2006) resolved Meconopsis as sister to sect. Meconella, forming a sister clade to the rest of Papaver, excluding Argemonidium. Meconella possesses a sessile stigmatic disc, similar to the typical discs of Papaver sect. Papaver., yet differences in the disc and other morphological characters have led to suggestions that this feature may not be homologous. The results of the Carolan et al. (2006) analysis present a major problem to previous taxonomy of the genera Meconopsis, and Papaver. As several species of Meconopsis (excluding M. cambrica) and P. Meconella resolved as a monophyletic group, sister to other Papaver sects., either Meconella must be elevated to genus status, or combined with the Asian species of Meconopsis, as a subgenus of Papaver. The fire poppy, Papaver californicum, is placed in a section, Papaver sect. Californicum, on its own. Papaver sects. Californicum and Horrida have unique geographic distributions in relation to the rest of the genus. Horrida is represented by a single species Papaver aculeatum of, an annual flower native to South Africa. The capsule is glabrous narrow, long and poricidal. The vegetative parts are covered with setae, and the growth form is a rosette with rarely branching axes, and narrowly elliptical incised leaves.Kadereit JW. 1988c. The affinities of the south-hemispherical Papaver aculeatum Thunb. (Papaveraceae). Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie 109: 335‚Äì341 P. sect. californicum, is also represented by a single annual species, of the same name. As the name implies, it is native to western North America, and is characterized by a slender, ribbed, glabrous capsule, a racemose inforescence, yellow anthers and filaments, and valvate capsule dehiscece. archive Previous morphological-based taxonomies of these species have led to unreliable groupings. Horrida and Pilosa have recemose inforescences, pale filiform filaments and long capsules with flat stigmatic discs, while P. californicum and sect. Meconidium share valvate capsule dehiscence and pale filaments, but geographically these species are distinct, and do not follow molecular evidence. Commonality among these features is therefore hypothesized to be a result of convergence. In Carolan et al.‚Äôs (2006) combined ITS, trnL-F trees, both Horrida and Californicum attach to basal nodes within the main clade Papaver. Kadereit et al. (1997) postulated that Stylomecon heterophylla arose from within Papaver and should not be relegated as a separate genus. S. heterophylla and P. californicum are both native to southwestern North America, and share habitats. They are also morphologically similar, sharing glabrous buds, bright orange corollas, and yellow anthers. Their capsules are different, with S. heterophylla possessing a distinct style that is reminiscent of those in many Meconopsis species. However, Carolan et al.‚Äôs (2006) analysis strongly supports a monophyletic group for S. heterophylla and P. californicum, sister to the core Papaver sects, with Horrida, basal to that grouping. They recommended that both sects. Californicum and Horrida be elevated to ‚Äúsubgenera‚Äù within Papaver. The authors reject the genus status of Stylomecon. Meconopsis is composed of mostly Asian dwelling species, and a single European representative, M. cambrica. Kadereit et al. (1997) first provided evidence that this relationship is not monophyletic. Carolan et al. (2006) confirmed the separation of M. cambrica from the rest of Meconopsis. In fact, it forms a well-supported sister-group to the core sections of Papaver, excluding Argemonidium, Californicum, Horrida and Meconella. The core sections of Papaver s.s. form a well-supported clade, consisting of Pseudopilosa, Pilosa, Papaver, Carinatae, Meconidium, Oxytona, and Rhoeadium. Pseudopilosa spp. have a subscapose growth habit, and their distribution includes south-western Asia, northern Africa and southern Spain. There are some leaves on the lower part of the flower axis carrying a single flower. Carolan et al.‚Äôs (2006) analysis placed Pseudopilosa as sister to the remaining Papaver s.s. sections. Pilosa is a single species, P. pilosum, found mostly in western Turkey Sects. Pilosa and Pseudopilosa are separated based on morphological and chemical differences. Papaver rhoeas, a common poppy across Europe The monophyly of Carinatae, Papaver and Rhoeadium is questionable based on current molecular evidence. Papaver sect. Rhoeadium comprises seventeen annual species. Carolan et al. (2006) use three representative species, P. commutatum, P. dubium, and P. rhoeas for their genetic analysis. The geographic center of Rhoeadium‚Äôs diversity is in south-western Asia and the Aegean area. They have porocidal capsules and usually dark filaments. This section is morphologically diverse however, leading Kadereit (1989) to recognize three distinct groups. The first comprises species with tetraploid and hexaploid genomes, with long capsules. The second group contains diploid species and diverse morphologies. The third group consists of diploid species and uniform morphologies. Carolan et al. (2006) showed some incongruences between their trnL-F and ITS maximum parsimony trees, showing weak support for Kadereit's (1989) groupings. Further analyses with more species and more samples will be necessary to resolve the phylogeny at this level. Papaver has traditionally been characterized by the absence of a stigma, and the presence of a sessile stigmatic disc. Carolan et al. (2006) demonstrated that several species with this trait however are closely related to taxa possessing a style e.g. S. heterophylla and P. californicum, and P. sect. Meconella and Asian Meconopsis. This evidence, in combination with morphological differences among the discs suggests convergent evolutionary pathways. Papaver has long been considered the most derived clade within Papaveroideae, due to the belief that the stigmatic disc was an apomorphous characteristic. Sections Meconella and Californicum exhibit valvate dehiscence, and their basal position within Papaver suggest this may be an ancestral form. Its presence in Meconidium, however, suggests it is also a synapomorphy within that group. Note: Meconella (not to be confused with the genus Meconella) has an alpine and circumpolar arctic distribution and includes some of the most northerly-growing vascular land plants.  Species  There are 70‚Äì100 species, including: *Papaver acrochaetum *Papaver aculeatum : South African poppy *Papaver alboroseum : pale poppy *Papaver alpinum : dwarf poppy *Papaver amurense *Papaver apokrinomenon *Papaver apulum *Papaver arachnoideum *Papaver arenarium *Papaver argemone : long pricklyhead poppy, prickly poppy, pale poppy *Papaver armeniacum *Papaver atlanticum (syn.

They were found in Egyptian tombs. In Greek mythology, the poppy was associated with Demeter, goddess of fertility and agriculture. The origin of the cultural symbol was probably Minoan Crete, because a figurine known as the \\"poppy goddess\\" was found at a Minoan sanctuary in Crete. People believed they would get a bountiful crop if poppies grew in their fields, hence the name 'corn poppy'. Papaver with black olives The seed-heads of Papaver somniferum are slit to release the latex, which contains various alkaloids. In the course of history, poppies have always been attributed important medicinal properties. The stems contain a milky latex that may cause skin irritation, and the latex in the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) contains several narcotic alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. The alkaloid rhoeadine, derived from the flowers of the corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas), is used as a mild sedative. Poppy seeds are used in baking and cooking, and poppyseed oil is used in cooking and pharmaceuticals, and as a radiocontrast agent. The ancient Greeks portrayed Hypnos, Nyx and Thanatos, the gods of sleep, night and death, with the symbol of the poppy. The earliest written record appeared in the eighth century BC. Early Greek accounts seem to indicate the plant was used for euthanasia; on some Greek islands, women used it in old age to shorten the time left until natural death. Hippocrates (460‚Äì377 BC) was one of the first to emphasize the medicinal uses of the poppy and outline several methods of preparation. He described poppy juice as narcotic, hypnotic, and cathartic. He also recognized the plant's uses as food, particularly the seeds. By the first century AD, Dioskorides wrote down the first poppy taxonomy. He distinguished between several different kinds, the first of which was the \\"cultivated\\" or \\"garden\\" poppies. He further distinguished two types within this category, ones with black and others with white seeds. Both had elongated capsules and the black- seeded variety was involuted. Historians speculate this variety was Papaver somniferum. Other species were in use, as well. Dioskorides named the ‚Äúflowering‚Äù poppy as a type with strong hypnotic properties. This is believed to be Papaver hybridum. Finally, the ‚Äúwild‚Äù poppy he described is believed to be Papaver orientale. Pliny the Elder, a Roman historian, later mentioned an ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù type between the wild and cultivated poppy, likely Papaver rhoeas. He wrote about medical applications of the plant; the leaves and capsules were boiled in water to create juice, pressed and rubbed to create tablets, and the dried latex was used to form opium. These products were used in much the same way they are in many cultures today, to promote sleep and to relieve indigestion and respiratory problems. A century later, Galen wrote even more extensively about the diverse applications of various poppy products. He wrote that opium was the strongest known drug for dulling the senses and for inducing sleep. He wrote about its use to treat a variety of ailments, including eye and lung inflammation. The First (18391842) and Second Opium Wars (18561860) between China and Great Britain resulted from attempts by successive Chinese emperors to suppress increasing imports of opium into the country.Gray, Jack. 2002. Rebellions and Revolutions: China from the 1800s to 2000. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 22‚Äì23 . In the first half of the 19th century, poppy seed oil was an important food crop, but large-scale production did not begin until Europe began to manufacture morphine in the mid-19th century. While 800‚Äì1000 tons of Indian opium are processed legally each year, this represents only an estimated 5% of total opium production worldwide; the majority is produced illegally. The first factory specializing in dry capsule processing was built in 1928. Today, morphine and codeine are common alkaloids found in several poppy varieties, and are important drugs for much of the world. Australia, Turkey and India are the most important producers of poppy for medicinal use, while the US, the UK, France, Australia and Hungary are the largest processors.Dicker, Jason. \\"The Poppy Industry in Tasmania\\" .

The Opium Poppy Control Act Of 1942 led to the ‚ÄúPoppy Rebellion‚Äù, and a battle between California farmers and the federal government.

The introduction of such systems began in Leicestershire in 1957. West Yorkshire followed in 1963, but the system has gradually been withdrawn in some areas since the introduction of the National Curriculum. This is because of the nature of the curriculum, which is divided into Key Stages which do not fully align with the three-tier system. In some areas (such as Leicestershire) where this type of school is in use, the middle-tier schools are known as High Schools; in other areas it is the upper tier schools that are called High Schools, especially if they do not include Years 12 and 13. In 2018, both Northumberland and Bedford were moving away from the three-tier model. =Grammar schools and Upper schools= In Buckinghamshire, which retains the 11-plus, the term is used for secondary schools which admit applicants without reference to the test.

The name refers to the magnetic dipole that forms within the reaction chamber, similar to Earth's or Jupiter's magnetospheres. It is believed that such an apparatus could contain plasma more efficiently than other fusion reactor designs. MIT News, David Chandler, MIT News Office, March 19, 2008. Accessed March 2008 The concept of the levitated dipole as a fusion reactor was first theorized by Akira Hasegawa in 1987.  Concept  The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the circulation of charges in the Earth's molten core. The resulting magnetic dipole field forms a shape with magnetic field lines passing through the Earth's center, reaching the surface near the poles and extending far into space above the equator. Charged particles entering the field will tend to follow the lines of force, moving north or south. As they reach the polar regions, the magnetic lines begin to cluster together, and this increasing field can cause particles below a certain energy threshold to reflect, and begin travelling in the opposite direction. Such particles bounce back and forth between the poles until the collide with other particles. Particles with greater energy continue towards the Earth, impacting the atmosphere and causing the aurora. This basic concept is used in the magnetic mirror approach to fusion energy. The mirror uses a solenoid to confine the plasma in the center of a cylinder, and then two magnets at either end to force the magnetic lines closer together to create reflecting areas. One of the most promising of the early approaches to fusion, the mirror ultimately proved to be very \\"leaky\\", with the fuel refusing to properly reflect from the ends as the density and energy were increased. Annoyingly, it was the particles with the most energy, those most likely to undergo fusion, that preferentially escaped. Research into large mirror machines ended in the 1980s as it became clear they would not reach fusion breakeven in a practically sized device. The levitated dipole can be thought of, in some ways, as a toroidal mirror, much more similar to the Earth's field than the linear system in a traditional mirror. In this case, the confinement area is not the linear area between the mirrors, but the toroidal area around the outside of the central magnet, similar to the area around the Earth's equator. Particles in this area that move up or down see increasing magnetic density and tend to move back towards the equator area again. This gives the system some level of natural stability. Particles with higher energy, the ones that would escape a traditional mirror, instead follow the field lines through the hollow center of the magnet, recirculating back into the equatorial area again. This makes the levitated dipole unique when compared with other magnetic confinement machines. In those experiments, small fluctuations can cause significant energy loss. By contrast, in a dipolar magnetic field, fluctuations tend to compress the plasma, without energy loss. This compression effect was first noticed by Akira Hasegawa (of the Hasegawa-Mima equation) after participating in the Voyager 2 encounter with Uranus.  Examples  The Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX) The concept of the levitated dipole was first realized when Jay Kesner of MIT and Michael Mauel of Columbia University made a joint proposal to test the concept in 1997. This led to the development of two experiments: the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX) at MIT and the Collisionless Terrella Experiment (CTX) at Columbia University.

Made on a budget of $15 million, the film received mixed reviews from critics, and it earned only $23,662 in the United States. In the years that have passed All The Queen's Men has become a Cult Favourite. Plot During World War II the British army is attempting to retrieve an Enigma machine from Germany. Having failed in previous attempts, they decide to send four men undercover to the factory that makes the devices in Berlin. Unfortunately the factory is populated entirely by women, and they only have men to send. American O'Rourke (LeBlanc), British transvestite Tony Parker (Izzard), genius Johnno (David Birkin), and the reluctant Archie (James Cosmo) are sent to infiltrate the factory dressed as women. Dropped in the wrong area, the team must first try to find their bearings. Aided by Romy, a sympathiser to their cause, they find their way to the factory. They manage to retrieve the Enigma machine, against the expectations of the British army. Just before they leave Germany, they realize they were tricked‚Äîthe British government already had the device, but wanted to make the Germans think they were still after it. They were specifically chosen as the team most likely to fail. Leaving Germany with an Enigma machine would, in fact, destroy the usefulness of the machine, as the Germans would know it was stolen and switch to a different code system. Archie volunteers to be captured with the machine to allow the mission to \\"fail\\".

Klerksdorp used to be the largest city in the North West Province located south-easterly to Mahikeng.http://www.matlosana.gov.za/Documents/IDP/IDP%20REVIEW%20DOCUMENT%20%202017-2018%20DRAFT1.pdf Mahikeng, the provincial capital, lies roughly 170 km north-west of Klerksdorp and Johannesburg 170 km in a north-eastern direction. History Australians and New Zealanders at Klerksdorp, 24 March 1901 by Charles Hammond (1904) The city was founded in 1837 or 1838 when the Voortrekkers settled on the banks of the Schoonspruit (\\"Clear stream\\"), which flows through the town. Klerksdorp is the oldest European settlement north of the Vaal River, and thus of the former Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Z.A.R), also known as the Transvaal Republic. The most prominent of the first settlers was Hendrik Grobler who claimed a farm of about 160 km¬≤, called it Elandsheuwel (\\"Hill of the Eland\\"). He gave plots of land and communal grazing rights on this farm to other Voortrekkers in return for their labour in building a dam and an irrigation canal. This collection of smallholdings was later given the name of Klerksdorp in honour of the first landdrost (magistrate) of the area, Jacob de Clercq. Old Klerksdorp Stock Exchange In November 1885 gold was discovered in the Klerksdorp district by M. G. Jansen van Vuuren as well as on the Witwatersrand, which lies about 160 km to the east. As a consequence, thousands of fortune-seekers descended on the small village, turning it into a town with 70 taverns and even a stock exchange of its own. This stock exchange opened its doors in 1888 and soon did a roaring trade, selling as much as the equivalent of R20 000 in one day. However, the nature of the gold reef demanded expensive and sophisticated equipment to mine and extract the gold, causing the majority of diggers to move away in the late 1890s and leading to a decline in the gold mining industry. This also led to an early demise for the Stock Exchange that stood empty for many years, were converted to a movie theatre in 1912 and finally being demolished 1958. The amalgamation process used to extract the gold from the crushed ore was relatively inefficient and largely contributed to decline. By 1893 the new MacArthur-Forrest process used for gold extraction brought a short-lived revival in the Klerksdorp gold mining industry, but uncertainty created by the Jameson Raid of December 1895 as well as transport problems created by the Rinderpest of 1896 soon led to a near collapse of the industry. Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Africans Klerksdorp Concentration Camp for Whites During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), heavy fighting occurred in the area, which also housed two large concentration camps, one for Whites (centred on modern day Klerksdorp High School) and a separate one for Africans (situated in the area that is today the Ellaton and Neserhof suburbs). The most famous of the battles around Klerksdorp, is that of the Battle of Ysterspruit (\\"Iron Stream\\"), in which the Boer general Koos de la Rey achieved a great victory. The battle is one of the most celebrated of the general's career, being the battle in which the Boer soldiers pioneered the art of firing from horseback. On April 11, 1902, Rooiwal, near Klerksdorp, saw the Battle of Rooiwal, the last major engagement of the war, where a Boer charge was beaten off by entrenched British troops. The graves of the victims of both the concentration camps can still be visited today in the Old Cemetery Complex just outside town, numbering just below a thousand. Klerksdorp was connected by rail to Krugersdorp on 3 August 1897 and to Kimberley in 1906. Today Klerksdorp is celebrated as the birthplace of Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Mpilo Tutu on October 7, 1931. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his work towards \\"a democratic and just society without racial divisions\\". The life work of Desmond Tutu has been to heal the scars left among the descendants of the many battles for control of South Africa. There is an irony of his birthplace set amidst Boer monuments and old battlefields, early settlements by those same Boers, among them famous leaders like Jacob de Clerq, even close to Witwatersrand where gold was discovered. He somehow managed to rise beyond pettiness and division to bring all these forces together with displaced native peoples in places such as this creating an international role model. He was later awarded multiple worldwide honors for his achievements in the reconciliation of the ethnic and cultural divisions in the history of his country. The gold mining industry was revived by large mining companies in 1932, causing the town to undergo an economic revival, which accelerated after World War II. Geography =Climate= Klerksdorp has a semi-arid climate (BSh/BSk, according to the K√∂ppen climate classification), with warm to hot summers and cool, dry winters. The average annual precipitation is , with most rainfall occurring mainly during summer. Klerksdorp today The greater city area surrounding Klerksdorp incorporates the towns of Orkney, Kanana, Stilfontein, Khuma, Hartbeesfontein and Tigane, giving it a population of more than 350,000 inhabitants (Census Statistics South Africa 2001). Together with Rustenburg, Klerksdorp forms the economic heart of North West Province. It is one of the hubs of the South African gold mining industry, although its importance has been decreasing in recent years. A major earthquake in March 2005 caused significant damage to the eastern suburb of Stilfontein and caused widespread damage to mining activities. It is expected to be a large uranium producer in the future. Apart from mining, Klerksdorp is positioned as a notable medical, retail and educational centre for North West Province and Northern Free State. The Klerksdorp district is a major contributor to South African agriculture; maize, sorghum, groundnuts and sunflower are important crops farmed in the district. Klerksdorp has the largest agricultural co-op in the southern hemisphere, named 'Senwes'. The farming district is also known for its Sussex cattle herds - the city is the headquarters of the South African Sussex Cattle Breeders Association. Tourist attractions * Mining shafts excavated in the 1880s. * The Klerksdorp Museum. It was built in 1891 as a prison and served as such until 1973. The house of the warden hosts period exhibitions. It exhibits the Klerksdorp sphere, spherical to subspherical objects that pseudoarcheologists consider to be man-made. * The Faan Meintjies Nature Reserve, located about 15 km from Klerksdorp.

After reaching an extremely high temperature, the nuclear fuel and accompanying cladding liquefies and relocates itself to the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel. A loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) is a mode of failure for a nuclear reactor; if not managed effectively, the results of a LOCA could result in reactor core damage. Each nuclear plant's emergency core cooling system (ECCS) exists specifically to deal with a LOCA. Nuclear reactors generate heat internally; to remove this heat and convert it into useful electrical power, a coolant system is used. If this coolant flow is reduced, or lost altogether, the nuclear reactor's emergency shutdown system is designed to stop the fission chain reaction. However, due to radioactive decay, the nuclear fuel will continue to generate a significant amount of heat. The decay heat produced by a reactor shutdown from full power is initially equivalent to about 5 to 6% of the thermal rating of the reactor. If all of the independent cooling trains of the ECCS fail to operate as designed, this heat can increase the fuel temperature to the point of damaging the reactor. *If water is present, it may boil, bursting out of its pipes. For this reason, nuclear power plants are equipped with pressure-operated relief valves and backup supplies of cooling water. *If graphite and air are present, the graphite may catch fire, spreading radioactive contamination. This situation exists only in AGRs, RBMKs, Magnox and weapons-production reactors, which use graphite as a neutron moderator (see Chernobyl disaster and Windscale fire). *The fuel and reactor internals may melt; if the melted configuration remains critical, the molten mass will continue to generate heat, possibly melting its way down through the bottom of the reactor. Such an event is called a nuclear meltdown and can have severe consequences. The so- called \\"China syndrome\\" would be this process taken to an extreme: the molten mass working its way down through the soil to the water table (and below) ‚Äì however, current understanding and experience of nuclear fission reactions suggests that the molten mass would become too disrupted to carry on heat generation before descending very far; for example, in the Chernobyl disaster the reactor core melted and core material was found in the basement, too widely dispersed to carry on a chain reaction (but still dangerously radioactive). *Some reactor designs have passive safety features that prevent meltdowns from occurring in these extreme circumstances. The Pebble Bed Reactor, for instance, can withstand extreme temperature transients in its fuel. Another example is the CANDU reactor, which has two large masses of relatively cool, low-pressure water (first is the heavy-water moderator; second is the light-water-filled shield tank) that act as heat sinks. Another example is the Hydrogen Moderated Self-regulating Nuclear Power Module, in which the chemical decomposition of the uranium hydride fuel halts the fission reaction by removing the hydrogen moderator. The same principle is used in TRIGA research reactors. Under operating conditions, a reactor may passively (that is, in the absence of any control systems) increase or decrease its power output in the event of a LOCA or of voids appearing in its coolant system (by water boiling, for example). This is measured by the coolant void coefficient. Most modern nuclear power plants have a negative void coefficient, indicating that as water turns to steam, power instantly decreases. Two exceptions are the Russian RBMK and the Canadian CANDU. Boiling water reactors, on the other hand, are designed to have steam voids inside the reactor vessel. Modern reactors are designed to prevent and withstand loss of coolant, regardless of their void coefficient, using various techniques. Some, such as the pebble bed reactor, passively slow down the chain reaction when coolant is lost; others have extensive safety systems to rapidly shut down the chain reaction, and may have extensive passive safety systems (such as a large thermal heat sink around the reactor core, passively-activated backup cooling/condensing systems, or a passively cooled containment structure) that mitigate the risk of further damage. Progression after loss-of-coolant A great deal of work goes into the prevention of a serious core event. If such an event were to occur, three different physical processes are expected to increase the time between the start of the accident and the time when a large release of radioactivity could occur. These three factors would provide additional time to the plant operators in order to mitigate the result of the event: #The time required for the water to boil away (coolant, moderator). Assuming that at the moment that the accident occurs the reactor will be SCRAMed (immediate and full insertion of all control rods), so reducing the thermal power input and further delaying the boiling. #The time required for the fuel to melt. After the water has boiled, then the time required for the fuel to reach its melting point will be dictated by the heat input due to decay of fission products, the heat capacity of the fuel and the melting point of the fuel. #The time required for the molten fuel to breach the primary pressure boundary. The time required for the molten metal of the core to breach the primary pressure boundary (in light water reactors this is the pressure vessel; in CANDU and RBMK reactors this is the array of pressurized fuel channels; in PHWR reactors like Atucha I, it will be a double barrier of channels and the pressure vessel) will depend on temperatures and boundary materials. Whether or not the fuel remains critical in the conditions inside the damaged core or beyond will play a significant role.

It is located approximately west of the town of Custer in Black Hills of South Dakota. It became a national monument in 1908. History Frank and Albert Michaud, two local prospectors, discovered the cave in 1900, when they felt cold air blowing out of a small hole in a canyon. It is unknown whether any previous inhabitants of the area were aware of the natural cave opening, which was not large enough for a person to enter.Jewel Cave brochure; National Park Service; GPO, WDC After enlarging the cave entrance with dynamite, the Michaud brothers found a cavern lined with calcite crystals, which led them to name it \\"Jewel Cave\\". The brothers tried to capitalize on the discovery, widening the opening, building walkways inside, and opening it to tourists. Although their venture was unsuccessful, news of the discovery eventually reached Washington. President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Jewel Cave a National Monument on February 7, 1908. The area around the natural entrance to the cave was further developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. The National Park Service assumed management of the monument in 1933 and began offering tours in 1939. Jan and Herb Conn As recently as 1959, less than of passageway had been discovered. That year, however, Herb and Jan Conn, local rock climbers, began exploring, and within two years had mapped . Much of the new discoveries lay outside the boundaries of the monument, under land managed by the United States Forest Service. The two agencies performed a land swap in 1965, establishing the present boundaries of the park, and enabling the development of a new part of the cave. The Park Service sunk a elevator shaft to a previously remote cave area, and built concrete walks and metal stairs and platforms along a one-half-mile loop. The \\"Scenic Tour\\" was opened in 1972. Most modern-day visitors tour that part of the cave. In August 2000, an forest fire burned 90% of the monument and the surrounding area. The visitor center and historic buildings were spared. Exploration Location of the cave with respect to regional Black Hills geology By 1979, Herb and Jan Conn had discovered, named, and mapped more than of passages. Although they largely retired from caving by the early 1980s, exploration has continued unabated. Because the areas being explored take many hours to reach, explorers now sometimes camp in the cave during expeditions of as long as four days. The cave is mapped by traditional survey techniques, using compass, clinometer and today with lasers instead of tape measures. Its of mapped passageway make Jewel Cave the third longest cave in the world, after Mammoth Cave System in Kentucky and Sistema Sac Actun at the Yucat√°n Peninsula (Mexico), at . The discovered areas in the cave account for only about 3 to 5% of the estimated total air volume of the cave. The cave volume is estimated by measuring the amount of air that the cave \\"exhales\\" when the outside air pressure drops and \\"inhales\\" when the outside air pressure rises. Geology Hydromagnesite balloon Jewel Cave is a \\"breathing cave,\\" which means air enters or exits the cave with changes in atmospheric pressure from day to night or due to changes in the weather. This was first explained by Herb Conn in 1966. Most of the cave formed within the Mississippian Pahasapa Limestone deposited 350 million years ago. The later limestones, sandstones, and shales deposited in these Paleozoic and Mesozoic seas were eroded with the geologic uplift associated with Laramide Orogeny and the formation of the Black Hills. The main passages of the cave then formed in the early Cenozoic. Uplift continued in the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene lowering the water table and draining the cave. Jewel Cave passages follow a pattern of joint development. The faults and joints are associated with the uplift of the Black Hills approximately 58 to 54 million years ago. After main cave dissolution, a thick layer of calcite lined the walls about 2.5 million years ago. During cave development and afterwards, speleothems and speleogens formed, including the \\"jewels\\" or spar. Other examples include stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, cave popcorn, boxworks, helictites, scintillites, conulites, coralloids, cave pearls, rimstone, rafts, rims, vents, and frostwork. The gypsum formations include needles, beards, cotton, hair, flowers, and spiders. Finally, Jewel Cave contains a very rare formation called a hydromagnesite balloon. Those are created when gas of an unknown source inflates a pasty substance formed by the precipitation of the magnesium carbonate hydroxide mineral. Access Jewel Cave is open year round. The Park Service offers three tours: the scenic tour, a half-mile loop through a paved and lighted central portion of the cave accessible by elevator; the historic tour, a candlelight tour through the earliest-discovered part of the cave; and a wild caving tour, through an undeveloped part of the cave near the scenic loop. There are 3 surface trails varying in length and difficulty. File:Jewel Cave 1.jpgMuch of Jewel Cave is covered with spar crystals, but they are rarely as clear as this cluster. File:Jewel Cave 2.jpgSpar crystals cover much of the walls in some sections of the cave. Typically they are a dull brown color as in this room.

The building shares with the Fairmont Royal York Hotel the block in Toronto's financial district bordered by Bay, Front, York, and Wellington streets. It is owned by the real estate firm Oxford Properties. Built to be the new main office of the Royal Bank after its decision to move its centre of operations from Place Ville Marie in Montreal to Toronto in the late 1970s, Royal Bank Plaza consists of a South Tower and a North Tower. The South Tower, a skyscraper, is the taller of the two at ; the North Tower has a height of . The structures each have a triangular footprint and sit on opposing corners of the square site. The exteriors of the structures are largely covered with gold-bronze glass with tan granite accents. Together, both towers contain more than 14,000 windows which project from the facade to form angular bays set into brushed aluminum frames. Due to these angled-bays, the buildings are home to many spiders that have built webs on the outside of Royal Bank Plaza. Six bays are grouped between piers which are covered in the same glass. The upper stories are recessed and contain three larger angled-bays between the piers. The double-height entry is also recessed from the facade and covered in dark- tinted glass set into dark aluminum frames. The glass for the body of the building was manufactured by Canadian Pittsburgh Industries and was coloured using of gold, valued at CA$70 per pane at the time of installation. In addition to office space and the Toronto Main Branch of the Royal Bank, Royal Bank Plaza also contains a shopping concourse which is part of the PATH network, linking directly to the TD Centre as well as Union Station, Brookfield Place (BCE Place) and the Fairmont Royal York. The concourse merchants mall and tower lobbies underwent extensive renovations between 2005 and 2007. The building was constructed with a large atrium above the main banking hall that linked the two towers, but in the 1990s a trading floor was added, closing the open space. The bank maintains a presence in a number of other towers in the downtown core, including the Royal Bank Building at 20 King Street West adjacent to Scotia Plaza, the RBC Centre at 155 Wellington Street West, and the building complex at 310, 315, 320 and 330 Front Street West, next to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, which is also owned by Oxford.

Data code 035: 3rd week 1975 The SR-50 was Texas Instruments' first scientific pocket calculator with trigonometric and logarithm functions. It enhanced their earlier SR-10 and SR-11 calculators, introduced in 1973, which had featured scientific notation, squares, square root, and reciprocals, but had no trig or log functions, and lacked other features. The SR-50 was introduced in 1974 and sold for US$170.20 Years of Texas Instruments Consumer Products It competed with the Hewlett-Packard HP-35. Design The SR-50 measured 5-3/4 inches long by 3-1/8 inches wide by 1-3/16 inches high (147 mm by 78 mm by 31 mm) and was powered by a rechargeable NiCad battery pack, built from three soldered AA cells. It had 40 keys, and flat sliding switches for degrees/radians and on/off. \\"SR\\" stood for \\"slide rule.\\" The SR-50 had a red LED display with a signed ten-digit mantissa plus a signed two-digit exponent for floating point numbers (negative values were indicated with a leading minus sign and positive values with no sign). Internally, calculations were performed with a 13-digit mantissa, providing much greater calculation accuracy than the 10-digit precision of most scientific calculators of the time. After the leading sign, digits consisted of a seven-segment display plus decimal point. A blinking display indicated an error, such as a calculation error or an overflow or underflow condition. Like most scientific calculators, the SR-50 mostly used ordinary infix notation, as opposed to the postfix Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) employed by its competitor, the Hewlett Packard HP-35. The SR-50 followed the standard order of operations by performing unary (single-argument) operations (reciprocal, square, square root, log, trig and hyperbolic trig functions) immediately, and multiplication, division, root, and power operations before addition and subtraction operations. But: you had to enter parameters first when using single-argument operations (e. g. 30 sin). As an example, the keypresses to calculate \\"3 x log(4) + 5\\" was entered almost as written, namely \\"3 x 4 log + 5 =\\". This is because the calculator would execute the log function before performing the multiplication operation, and complete the multiplication operation before executing the addition operation. It did so by having unary operations operate on the X register, addition and subtraction operate on the X and Z registers, and multiplication, division, power, and root functions operate on the X and Y registers in its operational stack. An unusual feature of the SR-50 was that its included functions like factorial and hyperbolic trig functions, which were found on very few calculators (including the HP-35 and HP-45) at the time. The user invoked the hyperbolic functions by entering the function argument and then pressing the \\"hyp\\" key, followed by the \\"sin\\", \\"cos\\", or \\"tan\\" function key. The inverse hyperbolic functions were accessed by first pressing the \\"arc\\" and \\"hyp\\" keys (in any order) and then pressing the \\"sin\\", \\"cos\\", or \\"tan\\" key. Hyperbolic trig arguments were always assumed to be in radians regardless of the setting of the degree/radian (D/R) mode switch. In addition to its three-register operational stack, consisting of X, Y, and Z registers, the SR-50 also included one memory (M) register to which the value in the X (display) register could be directly added using the \\"summation\\" key.Texas Instruments SR-50 Slide Rule Calculator User's Manual The SR-50 had very fast trig functions (about half a second to evaluate each function) and was a popular calculator to use in contests involving pocket calculators.

The SR-51 had the same physical dimensions but added a 2nd function for most buttons. Most notable among the added functions were the ability to enter x:y pairs and do linear regression analysis on them. The later and lighter versions SR-50A and SR-51II and SR-51III were based on smaller ICs and battery packs and reached broadest distribution. A further update resulted in the programmable model SR-52 in late 1975. It was thicker and longer and could perform 224 program steps recorded on magnetic cards, similar to its competitor HP-65. The card was pulled through the reader by an electric motor. The matte white upper face of the cards could be marked with pen or pencil to indicate the program and the functions assigned to the calculator's programmable keys. The card could be stored in a slot above the programmable keys with its markings visible. In 1976 Texas Instruments released the TI-30 budget calculator at one-third the price of the SR-50, so sales of the SR-50 quickly dropped.

The DOT pictograms are a set of fifty pictograms used to convey information useful to travelers without using words. Such images are often used in airports, train stations, hotels, and other public places for foreign tourists, as well as being easier to identify than strings of text. Among these pictograms are graphics representing toilets and telephones. As a result of their near-universal acceptance, some describe them as the \\"Helvetica\\" of pictograms, and the character portrayed within them as Helvetica Man. As works of the United States government, the images are in the public domain and thus can be used by anyone for any purpose, without licensing issues. History In 1974, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) recognized the shortcomings of pictograms drawn on an ad hoc basis across the United States Interstate Highway System and commissioned the American Institute of Graphic Arts to produce a comprehensive set of pictograms. In collaboration with Roger Cook and Don Shanosky of Cook and Shanosky Associates, the designers conducted an exhaustive survey of pictograms already in use around the world, which drew from sources as diverse as Tokyo International Airport and the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The designers rated these pictograms based on criteria such as their legibility, their international recognizability and their resistance to vandalism. After determining which features were the most successful and appropriate, the designers drew a set of pictograms to represent 34 meanings requested by the DOT. In 1979, 16 symbols were added, bringing the total to 50. Development of symbols =Initial groundwork= Symbols were collected from a variety of sources, including railways, Olympic events, airports and government agencies to form a catalog of each type of symbol to be created for close examination. A key goal was to avoid starting from scratch when possible, and instead build off previous development of robust symbol designs in existing systems. =Evaluation= The first overall step was to identify the symbols that were to be developed for the project, these were referred to as 'message areas'. The Department of Transportation's Office of Facilitation and AIGA committee devised the initial list of 34 messages. These messages were broken into four broad categories: 'Public Services', facility services and modes of transport (Telephones, toilets, first aid); 'Concessions', commercial activities (Car rental, coffee shop, shops); 'Processing Activities', passenger related processes (Ticket purchase, customs); 'Regulations', (No smoking, No entry). Symbols that conveyed the messages sought by the committee from the 24 sources were broken into 'concept groups', a simple grouping of symbols that used similar general designs to convey the message. For example 'Telephone' symbols were divided into 4 concept groups: 'Telephone handset', 'Telephone dial', 'Front view of dial telephone' and 'Handset and dial'. =Scoring= Symbols were assessed on three characteristics: Semantic, syntactic, pragmatic. Scores for these three categories were awarded by each committee member on a scale of 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). In addition to the individual score of each symbol, 'concept groups' were given a overall score based on how well the concept met the three categories. =Recommendations= Finally they made recommendations and observations based on their scores and discussions about the symbols they reviewed. For the 'Telephone' symbol, the handset icon was common but an odd shape that could be confusable for other items, like wrenches; while symbols with dials were easy to understand, but already obsolete with the increased use of Push-button telephone. The recommendations were summarized to suggest the final course of action to be taken with designing a symbol for the concept.

It was replaced in the 2nd printing of Official Signs & Icons with Greek cross colored 'Safety Green' from ANSI Z535.1-2002. The adoption of a green Greek cross or white Greek cross on a green background is a common replacement, due to the visual similarity and wide usage, as the white cross on green background is used in ISO 7010 to represent first aid.

Fluent in German, he became friendly with Ernst R√∂hm who arranged for him to interview Adolf Hitler in 1931. During hostilities he led a black propaganda campaign against Hitler by radio from England, so successfully that he was named in the Nazis' Black Book for immediate arrest after their planned invasion of Britain. Early life Denis Sefton Delmer, known familiarly as \\"Tom\\", was born in Berlin as a British subject, as a son of Australian parents living in Germany. His father, Frederick Sefton Delmer, a Jewish-British of Australian heritageHitler's Black Book - information for Sefton Delmer, \\"Amtsgruppe IVB4 - The Office of Jewish Affairs\\", Forces War Records (1941), forces-war-records.co.uk, born in Hobart, Tasmania, was Professor of English Literature at Berlin University and author of a standard textbook for German schools. On the outbreak of the First World War his father was interned in Ruhleben internment camp as an enemy alien. In 1917, the Delmer family was repatriated to England in a prisoner exchange between the British and German governments. Delmer was educated at the Friedrichwerdersches Gymnasium, Berlin, St Paul's School, London, and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he obtained a second-class degree in modern languages. He was brought up to speak only German until the age of five,Sefton Delmer: Trail Sinister Secker & Warburg, London, 1961, p. 19. and as late as 1939 spoke English with a slight accent.Sefton Delmer, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Early career The Reichstag fire in Berlin, 1933 After leaving university, Delmer worked as a freelance journalist until he was recruited by the Daily Express to become head of its new Berlin Bureau. Whilst in Germany, he became friendly with Ernst R√∂hm, who arranged for him to become the first British journalist to interview Adolf Hitler, in April 1931.Adolf Hitler by Sefton Delmer at psywar.org, accessed 1 August 2017 In the 1932 German federal election, Delmer travelled with Hitler aboard his private aircraft. He was \\"embedded with Nazi party activists\\" at this time, \\"taking copious notes on everything from the style of the would-be F√ºhrer's oratory to the group think that lay behind the bond he was forming with the German people.\\"James Crossland: \\"Fake news is old news\\". History Today (November 2018), p. 19. He was also present in 1933 when Hitler inspected the aftermath of the Reichstag fire. During this period, Delmer was criticised for being a Nazi sympathiser, and for a time, the British government thought he was in the pay of the Nazis. At the same time, the Nazi leaders were convinced Delmer was a member of MI6; his denials of any involvement only served to strengthen their belief that he was not only a member, but an important one. In 1933, Delmer was sent to France as head of the Daily Express Paris Bureau. In 1936, Delmer married Isabel Nichols. Delmer covered important events in Europe including the Spanish Civil WarBoadilla by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press, London, 2018 and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in 1939. He also reported on the German western offensive in 1940. Wartime Delmer returned to Britain and worked for a time as an announcer for the German service of the BBC. After Hitler broadcast a speech from the Reichstag offering peace terms, Delmer responded immediately, stating that the British cast the terms in \\"your lying, stinking teeth\\".This incident was described in Black Boomerang. Delmer's instant, and unauthorised rejection had a great impact on Germany, where Joseph Goebbels concluded it had to have come from the government.Balfour, Michael. Propaganda in War 1939‚Äì1945: Organisation, Policies and Publics in Britain and Germany, Routledge & Kegan Paul pp. 195‚Äì196. That gave an impact any authorisation would have prevented and produced consternation in Whitehall. The effect was desirable, but it was unclear whether such a spokesman would again happen to say what the government wanted.Balfour, p. 195. =Radio stations= Gliwice Radio Tower, site of the Gleiwitz incident by the SS in 1939 In September 1940, Delmer was recruited by the Political Warfare Executive (PWE),Twigge, Stephen & Edward Hampshire, & Graham Macklin. British Intelligence, (National Archives, 2008), pp. 72‚Äì73. to organise black propaganda broadcasts to Nazi Germany as part of a psychological warfare campaign. Leonard Ingrams gained clearance for Delmer to work for the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. Based at Wavendon Towers (now in Milton Keynes), the operation joined a number of other \\"research units\\" operating propaganda broadcasts. The concept was that the radio station would undermine Hitler by pretending to be a fervent Hitler-Nazi supporter. Delmer's first, most notable success was a shortwave station: Gustav Siegfried Eins (Gustave Siegfried One), G3 in the Research units. It was \\"run\\" by the character \\"Der Chef\\", an unrepentant Nazi, who disparaged both Winston Churchill (\\"that flatfooted son of a drunken Jew\\") and the \\"Parteikommune\\", the \\"Party Commune\\" supporters who betrayed the Nazi revolution. The station name, \\"Gustav Siegfried Eins\\" (phonetic alphabet for \\"GS1\\") left a question in listeners' minds ‚Äì did it mean Geheimsender 1: (Secret Transmitter 1) or Generalstab 1 (General Staff 1)? The station was broadcast from nearby Gawcott. GS1 went on the air on the evening of 23 May 1941. Der Chef, played by Peter Secklemann, a former Berlin journalist, was then the only member of the team to have arrived at the discreet house known as \\"The Rookery\\" in Aspley Guise, Bedfordshire.The Rookery, Aspley Guise ‚Äì Bedfordshire Record Office, accessed 26 July 2010 For Delmer at The Rookery, see also Willi Frischauer, The Man Who Came Back: The Story of Otto John (1958, ebook 2013). Unmaterial Books. Another journalist, Johannes Reinholz, played an adjutant to Der Chef. When Stafford Cripps discovered what Delmer was involved with (through the intervention of Richard Crossman) Cripps wrote to Anthony Eden, then Foreign Secretary: \\"If this is the sort of thing that is needed to win the war, why, I'd rather lose it.\\"Sir Stafford Cripps and the German Admiral's Orgy by Lee Richards, PsyWar.Org, 2007. Delmer was defended by Robert Bruce Lockhart, who pointed out the need to reach the sadist in the German nature. GS1 ran for 700 broadcasts before Delmer killed it off in late 1943 with gunfire heard over the radio intimating the authorities had caught up with Der Chef. The dramatic ending may have been deliberately based on the Gleiwitz incident, when the Nazis staged the capture of a German radio station by Polish forces, an operation which Hitler used to justify the invasion of Poland and the start of World War II. Owing to an error by a non-German- speaking transmitter engineer, the programme was accidentally repeated and Der Chef's dramatic on-air murder was broadcast twice. Delmer created several stations and was successful through a careful use of intelligence using gossip intercepted in German mail to neutral countries to create credible stories. Delmer's credit within the intelligence agencies was such that the Admiralty sought him out to target German submarine crews with demoralising news bulletins. For this, Delmer had access to Aspidistra, a 500 kW radio transmitter obtained from RCA in the US (their largest off-the-shelf-model), which Section VIII bought for ¬£165,000. Use of Aspidistra, which began in 1942, was split between PWE, the BBC, and the RAF. Delmer's creation was Deutscher Kurzwellensender Atlantik (or popularly Atlantiksender). This station used US jazz (banned within Germany as decadent) and up-to-date dance music from Germany (extracted via Sweden and RAF courier), as well as an in- house German dance band. Important details on naval procedures came from anti- Nazis identified in POW camps, whose mail was sifted to create personalised announcements. Agnes Bernelle \\"played\\" the seductive \\"Vicki\\" and announced news bulletins. Christ the King (G.8) broadcast an attack on the conscience of religious Germans, telling of the horrors of the labour and concentration camps, through a German priest. =Soldatensender Calais= Soldatensender Calais (\\"Calais Armed Forces Radio Station\\") was another clandestine radio station directed at the German armed forces by Delmer. Based in Milton Bryan and transmitting from Crowborough, Soldatensender Calais broadcast a combination of popular music, \\"cover\\" support of the war, and \\"dirt\\" ‚Äì items inserted to demoralise German forces. Delmer's black propaganda sought to propagate rumours that German soldiers' wives were sleeping with the many foreign workers in Germany at the time. As it happened, the station, broadcast by Aspidistra, proved to be popular on the German home front. Delmer also oversaw the production of a daily \\"grey\\" German-language newspaper titled Nachrichten f√ºr die Truppe (\\"News for the Troops\\"), which first appeared in May 1944, much of its text being based on the Soldatensender Calais broadcasts. Nachrichten f√ºr die Truppe was written by a team provided to Delmer by SHAEF, and disseminated over Germany, Belgium, and France each morning by the Special Leaflet Squadron of the US Eighth Air Force. When fighting entered Germany itself, black propaganda was used to create an impression of an anti-Nazi resistance movement. At the end of the war in Europe, Delmer advised his colleagues not to publicise the work they had been involved in, lest unrepentant Nazis claim (as had been the case after the First World War), that they had been defeated by unconscionable methods, rather than on the battlefield.Rankin, Churchill's Wizards Consequently, former Nazis were able to claim, without contradiction, that they had assisted the fictitious resistance movement; Delmer described this unintended consequence as a \\"black boomerang\\". Later career and retirement After the Second World War, Delmer returned to the Daily Express as chief foreign affairs reporter. Reinhard Gehlen stated it was Delmer‚Äôs Daily Express article of 17 March 1952 which dragged the German intelligence chief into the daylight by unleashing a \\"flood of further publications\\". Over the next fifteen years, he covered nearly every major foreign news story for the newspaper. However, he was sacked by Lord Beaverbrook in 1959 over an expenses issue,See Chapter Two of Tail of a Tale by Sefton DelmerThe hiring and firing by Beaverbrook. and retired to Lamarsh in Essex, near Little Sampford, where his former wife Isabel lived with her third husband. Delmer wrote two volumes of autobiography, Trail Sinister (1961) and Black Boomerang (1962), and several other books, including Weimar Germany (1972) and The Counterfeit Spy (1971). David Hare based his play Licking Hitler on Black Boomerang, and his plot included the faked, on-air discovery and shooting of the broadcaster, in the same way as Delmer had finished the career of \\"Der Chef\\". Delmer was the subject of a This Is Your Life broadcast in 1962, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews outside Le Caprice restaurant in London's Mayfair.

The UVF had been banned by the Government of Northern Ireland in 1966, but was legalised at the same time as Sinn F√©in by Labour Secretary of State Merlyn Rees in April 1974 in order to encourage a political path for Loyalist and republican paramilitary groups. It launched its manifesto \\"The Volunteer Political Party - a progressive and forward thinking unionist party\\" at a press conference on 27 September.Frenett, Ross. \\"‚ÄòProtestant Socialists‚Äô? Ulster Loyalism and Working-Class Politics:1969-1974,\\" Scrinium, University College Cork (2010), p.37 Influenced by the thinking of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, it opposed internment without trial and the idea of independence for Northern Ireland and supported a more equitable distribution of resources to deprived parts of the United Kingdom. The party applied to join the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) but was rebuffed, with the mainstream unionist parties wary of being linked to paramilitaries. Ken Gibson contested the West Belfast seat, which included parts of the Shankill district, in the October 1974 general election. Despite the security risks, the VPP also carried out some limited canvassing on the Catholic Falls Road.Frenett, Ross. \\"‚ÄòProtestant Socialists‚Äô? Ulster Loyalism and Working-Class Politics:1969-1974,\\" Scrinium, University College Cork (2010), p.39 The VPP claimed to stand for the working class and an election pamphlet attacked the disgraceful social conditions on the Shankill. In the election, Gibson was supported by Glen Barr of Vanguard, Charles Harding Smith, the leader of the West Belfast Ulster Defence Association and the independent Shankill councillor Hugh Smyth, who went on to become one of the founders of the Progressive Unionist Party. Standing against the official UUUC candidate, Johnny McQuade of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), they won only 2,690 votes (6%), 14% of the total unionist vote. Because of this failure, the party was dissolved the following month by a meeting of all UVF commanders. A statement announced; \\"The low poll for the VPP candidate indicates that the general public does not support the political involvement of the UVF. It would therefore be fruitless to promote the Volunteer Party as a party political machine\\". Most of its members returned to the UVF (some of whom were later to form the Progressive Unionist Party). The UVF turned back to violence and was banned again by the British government on 4 October 1975.

The city was founded in 1823 and its name originates from the Piedra Movediza (\\"Moving Stone\\") which fell in 1912. The city is the birthplace of many notable sports personalities, as well as former president of Argentina Mauricio Macri. Geography Tandil is located above sea level and its coordinates are . The city borders Rauch and Azul (to the north), Ayacucho and Balcarce (to the east), Lober√≠a, Necochea and Benito Ju√°rez (to the south) and Azul and Benito Ju√°rez (to the west). Tandil is situated approximately midway between La Plata (the provincial capital), to its NE, and Bah√≠a Blanca, lying the same distance to its SW; it is also NW of Mar del Plata, and SSW of Buenos Aires. Tandil is in a zone known as the Humid Pampa. According to the 2010 census (INDEC), Tandil had a population of 116,916. The total area of the Tandil partido is . Climate Tandil's climate is mild and humid (classified as Cfb or an oceanic climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification), with an average temperature of and of precipitation annually. Mornings are often cold in autumn, winter and spring, and generally fresh in the summer. Fog is very common in autumn and winter, when frosts are also common. Minimum temperatures below have been recorded in the winter months. Rainfall occurs throughout the year but more frequently in summer. Snow and heat waves are not very common. The climatological data in the table below is from the period 1981‚Äì2010: Place name alt= City Hall Replica of the Piedra Movediza installed in 2007 It is widely believed that the name of the city comes from the Mapuche words tan (\\"falling\\"), and lil (\\"rock\\"). It is probably a reference to the Piedra Movediza (\\"Moving Stone\\"), a large boulder which stood seemingly miraculously balanced on the edge of a rocky foothill. In order to demonstrate the slight movements of the boulder, it was common practice to place bottles under its base to watch them shatter. The \\"Moving Stone\\" toppled on February 29, 1912, and split into two pieces at the bottom of the hill. In May 2007, a fix replica was set up in the same place where the original stood. The replica, made by engineering students, is actually cemented in place and does not teeter the way the original did. History The town was founded by Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez on April 4, 1823, named Fuerte Independencia (Fort Independence). In time the original natives became assimilated and mingled with the increasing European population. The vast majority of immigrants came from Spain and Italy, but also Danish people settled, the latter constituting a very active community. Tandil was designated a city (although by modern standards it was a large town) in 1895 and became a popular tourist destination attracting people from Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina. The Piedra Movediza fell in 1912 and split in two below. Although it is impossible after the fact to ascertain the reason it fell, it is very possible that the delicately balanced rock was thrown off balance by the common practice of placing glass bottles under it and watching them explode. This was the way the locals would prove to visitors that the rock, in fact, moved, since the movement was too subtle to be detected by the naked eye. There have been projects to restore the rock, and a replica stone was placed where the original used to be. Other similar stones like El Centinela are also attractions, but none has the truly astonishing quality of teetering ever so slowly like the \\"moving rock\\" once did. National University of Central Buenos Aires Province The National University of Central Buenos Aires Province (Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia Buenos Aires) is a public university located in Tandil. It was founded in 1974 as part of University of Buenos Aires Professor Alberto Taquini's plan to geographically diversify Argentina's National University system.

From 1924 Abraham attended King Edward VI School, Southampton, before achieving a First in Chemistry at The Queen's College, Oxford. Abraham completed his DPhil at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Sir Robert Robinson, during which he was the first to crystallise lysozyme, an enzyme discovered by Sir Alexander Fleming and shown to have antibacterial properties, and was later the first enzyme to have its structure solved using X-ray crystallography, by Lord David Philips.  Research  He then won a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship and spent a year in Stockholm at the Biokemiska Institut. He then moved back to Oxford and became part of a research team led by Sir Howard Florey at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, responsible for the development of penicillin and its medical applications. Sir Edward was specifically involved in the purification process and determination of its chemical structure. In 1940 Edward discovered penicillinase as the cause of bacterial resistance to antibiotics such as penicillin. In October 1943 Abraham and Sir Ernst Boris Chain proposed a novel beta-lactam structure with a fused two ring system. This proposal was confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography. Florey formally recognised Abraham's work in 1948 by nominating him to be one of the first three \\"penicillin\\" research Fellows at Lincoln College, Oxford. Later that year samples of a Cephalosporium acremonium fungus with antibacterial properties were received from Giuseppe Brotzu. Abraham and Guy Newton purified the antibiotics from this fungus and found one, cephalosporin C, was not degraded by penicilinase and hence able to cure infections from penicillin-resistant bacteria. During a skiing holiday in 1958 Abraham conceived the structure of cephalosporin C, which he then went on to establish with Newton, and was confirmed by Dorothy Hodgkin through X-ray crystallography. Abraham showed that modification of the 7-amino- cephalosporanic acid nucleus was able to increase the potency of this antibiotic and registered a patent on the compound. This resulted in the first commercially sold cephalosporin antibiotic Cefalotin sold by Eli Lilly and Company. There are now five generations of cephalosporins, of which some are among the few remaining antibiotics for the treatment of MRSA. In 1964 he became Professor of Chemical Pathology, and remained a Fellow of Lincoln until his retirement in 1980.  Personal life  Abraham was born at 47 South View Road, Shirley, Southampton. His parents were Maria Agnes Abraham, n√©e Hearne and Albert Penley Abraham, a customs and excise officer. In 1938 he met Asbj√∂rg Harung from Norway whom he married in Bergen the following year: she remained in Norway, trapped by the German invasion, before escaping to Sweden in 1942 when she was reunited with her husband. They had a son Michael Erling Penley Abraham, born in Oxford in July 1943. Edward Abraham died in May 1999, in Oxford, following a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Asbj√∂rg. Sir Edward and Lady Abraham lived at Badgers Wood, Bedwells Heath, Boars Hill, where part of the land, Abraham Wood is now managed by the Oxford Preservation Trust.  Legacy  He was a noted biochemist, his work on antibiotics producing great clinical advances. His principal work was concerned with the development of penicillin, and also later cephalosporin, an antibiotic capable of destroying penicillin-resistant bacteria. These vital drugs are now used extensively in the treatment of various infections, including pneumonia, bronchitis, septicaemia and infected surgical wounds. Through the registration of the patent on cephalosporin, he was able to generate a regular income, which he devoted almost entirely to the establishment of two charitable trusts for the support of biomedical research, the Edward Penley Abraham Research Fund, the E.P.A. Cephalosporin Fund and The Guy Newton Research Fund. As of 2016 the combined endowment of these charities is over ¬£194 million. By the end of the twentieth century, the charitable funds had donated more than ¬£30m to the University of Oxford, mainly to the Dunn School of Pathology and to Lincoln College, along with other grants to The Royal Society and King Edward VI School, Southampton. Four recent Oxford buildings received funds from Abraham's trusts: * the EP Abraham research building (completed in 2001, on South Parks Road) * Lincoln College's EPA Science Centre (an accommodation and conferencing complex, including Lady Abraham House, completed in 2005, on Museum Road), * Linacre College's Edward & Asbj√∂rg Abraham Building (completed in 1995) * The Oxford Molecular Pathology Institute, completed in 2011, is also largely funded by proceeds from Abrahams patents. Funding from these trusts have also helped to establish two scholarship programmes for doctoral students at the University of Oxford (the Oxford-E P Abraham Research Fund Graduate Scholarship and the Oxford-EPA Cephalosporin Graduate Scholarship). Abraham Wood is a bluebell wood at Boars Hill donated to the Oxford Preservation Trust in memory of Sir Edward and Lady Abraham.  Awards  Abraham was the recipient of many awards over his lifetime: * Fellow of the Royal Society in 1958 * CBE in 1973 * Royal Medal of the Royal Society (1973) * Knight Bachelor in 1980 * Mullard Award of the Royal Society (1980) * Scheele Award in 1975 * Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983.

The device was the first of its kind to test the levitated dipole concept and was funded by the US Department of Energy. The machine was also part of a collaboration between the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center and Columbia University, where another levitated dipole experiment, the Collisionless Terrella Experiment (CTX), was located. LDX ceased operations in November 2011 when its funding from the Department of Energy ended as resources were being diverted to tokamak research.  Concept and development  The concept of the levitated dipole as a fusion reactor was first theorized by Akira Hasegawa in 1987. The concept was later proposed as an experiment by Jay Kesner of MIT and Michael Mauel of Columbia University in 1997. The pair assembled a team and raised money to build the machine. They achieved first plasma on Friday, August 13, 2004 at 12:53 PM. First plasma was done by (1) successfully levitating the dipole magnet and (2) RF heating the plasma. The LDX team has since successfully conducted several levitation tests, including a 40-minute suspension of the superconducting coil on February 9, 2007. Shortly after, the coil was damaged in a control test in February 2007 and replaced in May 2007. The replacement coil was inferior, a copper wound electromagnet, that was also water cooled. Scientific results, including the observation of an inward turbulent pinch, were reported in Nature Physics.  The Machine  = The Dipole = This experiment needed a very special free-floating electromagnet, which created the unique \\"toilet-bowl\\" magnetic field. The magnetic field was originally made of two counter-wound rings of currents. Each ring contained a 19-strand niobium-tin Rutherford cable (common in superconducting magnets). These looped around inside an Inconel magnet; a magnet that looked like an oversized donut. The donut was charged using induction. Once charged, it generated a magnetic field for roughly an 8-hour period. Overall, the ring weighed 450 kilograms and levitated 1.6 meters above a superconducting ring. The ring produced roughly a 5-tesla field.\\"Design and Fabrication of the Cryostat for the Floating Coil of the Levitated Dipole Experiment (LDX)\\" A. Zhukovsky, M. Morgan, D. Garnier, A.

This coil is used to charge the dipole, using induction. The coil exposing the dipole to a varying magnetic field. Next, the dipole is raised into the center of the chamber. This could be done with supports or using the field itself. Around the outside of this chamber were Helmholtz coils, which were used to produce a uniform surrounding magnetic field. This external field would interact with the dipole field, suspending the dipole. It was in this surrounding field that plasma moved. The plasma forms around the dipole and inside the chamber. The plasma is formed by heating a low pressure gas. The gas is heated using a radio frequency, essentially microwaving the plasma in a 17-kilowatt field.\\"Optimization of Hot Electron Diagnostics on LDX\\" Nogami, Woskov, Kesner, Garnier, Mauel, 2009 = The Diagnostics = A flux loop is a loop of wire. The magnetic field passes through the wire loop. As the field varied inside the loop, it generated a current. This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured. The machine was monitored using diagnostics fairly standard to all of fusion. These included: # A Flux loop. This is a loop of wire. The magnetic field passes through the wire loop.

This was measured and from the signal the magnetic flux was measured. # An X-ray detector.\\"X-Ray Diagnostics for the Levitated Dipole Experiment\\" Jennifer L. Ellsworth, Master's Thesis, MIT 2004 This diagnostic measured the X-rays emitted. From this, the plasmas' temperature was found. There were four of these inside the machine, each measuring along a cord (or line out) inside the machine. This detector was good for measuring electrons, typically around 100 electron- volts. All plasma loses energy by emitting light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, for any reason.J. Larmor, \\"On a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 190, (1897) pp. 205‚Äì300 (Third and last in a series of papers with the same name). If the reason is deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is Cyclotron radiation at low speeds and Synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as Bremsstrahlung radiation. # An X-ray Camera.\\"Diagnostic setup for spatial and temporal measurements of plasma fluctuations using electric probes in the LDX\\" E Ortiz, M Mauel, D Garnier, 45th DPP meeting, October 2003 This can read lower energy X-rays. # A Conventional Video Camera # An emissive Langmuir probe. A Langmuir probe is a wire, stuck into a plasma, which absorbs the surrounding charged particles. You can vary the voltage on this wire. As the voltage changes, the charged particles absorbed change, making an IV curve.

This leads to a giant encapsulation of the electromagnet. As material passes through the center, the density spikes. This is because much plasma is trying to squeeze through a limited area. This is where most of the fusion reactions occur. This behavior has been called a turbulent pinch. In large amounts, the plasma formed two shells around the dipole: a low-density shell, occupying a large volume and a high-density shell, closer to the dipole. This is shown here. The plasma was trapped fairly well. It gave a maximum beta number of 0.26.\\"Improved Confinement During Magnetic Levitation in LDX\\", 50th Annual Meeting of the APS DDP, November 18, 2008 M Manuel A value of 1 is ideal. = Modes of Operation = There were two modes of operation observed:\\"Helium Catalyzed D-D Fusion in a Levitated Dipole\\" Presentation Kesner, Catto, Krasheninnikova APS 2005 DPP Meeting, Denver # Hot electron interchange: a lower density, mostly electron plasma. # A more conventional Magnetohydrodynamic mode These had been proposed by Nicholas Krall in the 1960s.\\"Stabilization of Hot Electron Plasma by a Cold Background\\" N Krall, Phys.

First, tritium is far more expensive than deuterium. This is because tritium is rare. It has a short half-life making it hard to produce and store. It is also considered a hazardous material, so using it is a hassle from a health, safety and environmental perspective. Finally, tritium and deuterium produces fast neutrons which means any reactor burning it would require heavy shielding.

The worlds of medieval Europe. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2003, 210. The goal of both the Pax Dei and the Treuga Dei was to limit the violence of feuding endemic to the western half of the former Carolingian Empire ‚Äì following its collapse in the middle of the 9th century ‚Äì using the threat of spiritual sanctions.Head and Landes, The Peace of God, 1. The eastern half of the former Carolingian Empire did not experience the same collapse of central authority, and neither did England.Daileader 2001. Those Who Fought. The Peace of God was first proclaimed in 989, at the Council of Charroux. It sought to protect ecclesiastical property, agricultural resources and unarmed clerics.Head 1999. p. 656. The Truce of God, first proclaimed in 1027 at the Council of Toulouges, attempted to limit the days of the week and times of year that the nobility engaged in violence. The movement survived in some form until the thirteenth century. Other strategies to deal with the problem of violence in the western half of the former Carolingian Empire include Chivalry and the Crusades. Georges Duby summarized the widening social repercussions of Pax Dei: Background The eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon, interpreting Tacitus, Germania ¬ß40, detected a parallel among the pagan German tribes who worshipped a goddess of the earth (identified by modern scholars with Nerthus) who in Gibbon's interpretation resided at the island of R√ºgen, who annually travelled to visit the tribes. However, Gibbon's assertion has since been discredited, given that the canon law of Pax Dei derives no foundation from pagan customs, but rather from rational principles of Roman Law regarding violence. The Christian concept evolved from the earlier concept of Pax Romana. As early as 697, Adomn√°n of Iona promulgated the C√°in Adomn√°in, which provided sanctions against the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands. Some historians note a preexisting ecclesiastical discussion of peace for secular authorities in 494 with Pope Gelasius I's letter to Emperor Anastasius: This ecclesiastical argument flourished in the eleventh century regarding the issues of secular violence and ecclesiastical precedence over secular authorities as private wars and violent feuding began to endanger both church buildings and monastic communities across Europe. Other ecclesiastical steps to protect church property were also observed from the tenth to the eleventh century, as seen with the Council of Trosly specifically commenting on the role of destruction of church property as sacrilegious. Overview The Peace and Truce of God movement was one of the ways that the Church attempted to civilize the feudal structures of society through non-violent means. After the collapse of the Carolingian empire in the ninth century, France had degenerated into many small counties and lordships, in which local lords and knights frequently fought each other for control.Landes, Richard. \\"Peace of God: Pax Dei The West Frankish nobility capitalized on the accession of the Carolingian throne and ushered in the Capetian dynasty and further altered French, and by extension, European medieval society. One of the critical points of this dynastic shift is what Guy Bois characterizes \\"the mutation of the year 1000,\\" wherein the period is known for the inexorable link between chaos and creativity.Bois, La Mutation de l'an mil (Paris, 1989). The chaos of the period is attributed to the issue of violent feuding, with the castellans and their milites working towards consolidated power and freedom from the overarching political structure of the Carolingian empire. Frederick S. Paxton argues that the political and cultural landscape of the period highlights some of the prevailing cultural anxieties and issues surrounding the millennium, particularly \\"unparalleled disorder in governmental, legal, and social institutions\\" and Carolingian society was faced with a \\"king unable and the nobility unwilling to act [causing] the French people, imbued with a 'national spirit' peculiarly creative in the fight against political and social ills, turned to spiritual sanctions as the only available means to limit violence.\\"Frederick S. Paxton, \\"History, Historians, and the Peace of God\\", in The Peace of God, 21. While some historians have postulated that the Peace of God and Truce of God movements stem from the inability or unwillingness of the top tiers of Carolingian society to quell the violence and feuding amongst Capetian nobles, other scholars have argued that there was a castellan revolution ongoing in the Frankish kingdoms that contributed to the problem. According to Andr√© Debord, the Peace and Truce movements originated in the reaction against the social and political upheaval that stemmed from rapid proliferation of castle-building during the early eleventh century, particularly in Aquitaine.Andr√© Debord, \\"The Castellan Revolution and the Peace of God in Aquitaine\\", in The Peace of God, 135. The major point of contention in early eleventh century France was the role of comital power and the ways in which social forces exerted influence on the possession of power. Around 1030, and at the same general time as the deaths of William the Great, William IV, and Ademar of Chabannes, comital power was supreme in the Charente.Debord, 141. This period was the site of transformation of the comital power of dukes and counts because castle construction was an inherent consolidation of power, but at the same time \\"those who held comital fortresses had a distinct tendency toward insubordination as soon as the count or duke turned their backs,\\" hence figures who held little traditional power, such as Hugh the Chiliarc, \\"could cause the prestigious duke of Aquitaine the worst kind of difficulties.\\"Debord, 141. At the same time there were often attacks from the Vikings, who settled in northern France as Normans but continued to raid territory further inland. The two movements began at separate times and places, but by the eleventh century they became synonymous as the \\"Peace and Truce of God\\". \\"Germans looked with mingled horror and contempt at the French 'anarchy'. To Maintain the king's peace was the first duty of a German sovereign.\\"Thompson, James Westfall. \\"German Feudalism\\". The American Historical Review 28, No. 3 (Apr., 1923) p. 458-9. The movement, though seemingly redundant to the duties of the crown, had a religious momentum that would not be denied. Holy Roman Emperor Henry III issued the earliest form of this in his empire while at Constance in 1043. In the Holy Roman Empire it subsequently developed into the similar concept of Landfriede.Arnold, Benjamin. German Knighthood 1050‚Äì1300. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985) p. 16 Peace of God The Peace of God or Pax Dei was a proclamation issued by local clergy that granted immunity from violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, beginning with the peasants (agricolae) and with the clergy. The Synod of Charroux decreed a limited Pax Dei in 989, and the practice spread to most of Western Europe over the next century,Thomas Head, \\"The Development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine (970‚Äì1005)\\" Speculum 74.3 (July 1999), pp. 656‚Äì686. surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century. At the Benedictine abbey of Charroux in La Marche on the borders of the Aquitaine \\"a great crowd of many people (populus) gathered there from the Poitou, the Limousin, and neighboring regions. Many bodies of saints were also brought there \\"bringing miracles in their wake\\".Letaldus of Micy, The Journey of the Body of St. Junianus to the Council of Charroux. Three canons promulgated at Charroux, under the leadership of Gombald Archbishop of Bordeaux and Gascony, were signed by the bishops of Poitiers, Limoges, P√©rigueux, Saintes and Angoul√™me, all in the west of France beyond the limited jurisdiction of King Hugh Capet. Excommunication would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals ‚Äì among which the donkey is mentioned, but not the horse (an item beyond the reach of a peasant) ‚Äì and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy \\"who is not bearing arms\\". Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church. Children and women (virgins and widows) were added to the early protections. The Pax Dei prohibited nobles from invading churches, from beating the defenseless, from burning houses, and so on. A synod of 1033 added merchants and their goods to the protected list. Significantly, the Peace of God movement began in Aquitaine, Burgundy and Languedoc, areas where central authority had most completely fragmented. The participation of large, enthusiastic crowds marks the Pax Dei phenomenon as one of the first popular religious movements of the Middle Ages. In the early phase, the blend of relics and crowds and enthusiasm stamped the movement with an exceptionally popular character. After a lull in the first two decades of the eleventh century, the movement spread to the north of France with the support of king Robert II of France (reigned 996‚Äì1031). There, the high nobility sponsored Peace assemblies throughout Flanders, Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy, the Ami√©nois, and Berry. The oaths to keep the peace sworn by nobles spread in time to the villagers themselves; heads of households meeting communally would ritually swear to uphold the common peace.Duby 1988:27. The tenth-century foundation of the Cluny Abbey in Burgundy aided the development of the Peace of God. Cluny was independent of any secular authority, subject to the Papacy alone, and while all church territory was inviolate, Cluny's territory extended far beyond its own boundaries. A piece of land 30 km in diameter was considered to be part of Cluny itself, and any smaller monastery that allied itself with Cluny was granted the same protection from violence. A Peace of God council gave this grant in Anse in 994. The monastery was also immune from excommunications, interdicts, and anathemas, which would normally affect an entire region. Fleury Abbey was granted similar protection. Many Cluniac monks came from the same knightly class whose violence they were trying to stop. The movement was not very effective. However it set a precedent that would be followed by other successful popular movements to control nobles' violence such as medieval communes and the Crusades. The phrase \\"Peace of God\\" also occurs as a general term that means \\"under the protection of the Church\\", used in multiple contexts in medieval society. For example, pilgrims who traveled on Crusade did so under the \\"peace of God\\" i.e. under the protection of the Church. This general usage of the term does not always relate to the Peace and Truce of God movement. Peace of God and Popular Participation One of the problems with the historiography regarding one of the most popular Peace of God movements, the Limousin Peace of God (994‚Äì1032/3), is that there is little direct textual evidenceRichard Landes, \\"Between Aristocracy and Heresy\\", In The Peace of God, 184. and most of the primary source material on this movement is around 300 pages from Ademar of Chabannes. Ademar is a monk of Saint-Eparchius of Angoul√™me, who spent time at Saint-Martial in Limoges and was a historian, liturgist, grammarian, and artist.Richard Landes, \\"Between Aristocracy and Heresy\\", In The Peace of God, 185. The Limousin Peace of God movement is generally accepted as mostly fiction because Ademar seems to have created a fiction about the actual development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine. One of the points that Richard Landes and other historians have noted is there was a Peace of God movement in Aquitaine because Rodulphus Glaber, writing about the Peace councils in Francia in 1033, did state that the movement started in Aquitaine. One of the major point of Landes' historiographical examination of the early councils of Limoges is the fact that ecclesiastical authorities promoted cultural and religious enthusiasm within the conciliar activities in the late tenth and early eleventh century. Landes, well known for his work on the apocalyptic strains of thought surrounding the year 1000, argues that the conciliar activities at Limoges and other areas in Aquitaine are crucial to understanding the role of the Peace of God movement overall because of the combination of the apocalyptic attitudes nearing the end of the tenth century and the popularity of penitential practices for natural and man-made disasters. In the case of Limoges, there was a major outbreak of a \\"'plague of plagues,' probably ergotism\\" and \\"the abbot and the bishop (brothers of the viscount), in consultation with the duke of Aquitaine, called for a three-day fast during which relics from all over would come to Limoges.\\"Richard Landes, \\"Between Aristocracy and Heresy\\", In The Peace of God, 187. The emphasis on relics in this particular instance is crucial to understanding the development of the Peace of God movement overall because popular participation in this movement across Europe stems from the popularity of relics and the penitential practices linked to the cult of the saints. In the case of Limoges, the cult of Saint Martial takes preeminence because of the miracles attested to his shrine during the Peace council of 994. From the Vita prolixior s. Martialis, the narrative directly correlates to Peace ideals: Truce of God The Truce of God or Treuga Dei had its origin in Normandy in the city of Caen.Watkin, William Ward. \\"The Middle Ages: The Approach to the Truce of God\\", The Rice Institute Pamphlet, Vol. XXIX, No. 4, October, 1942 It dates from the eleventh century. While the Truce of God is a temporary suspension of hostilities, as distinct from the Peace of God which is perpetual, the jurisdiction of the Truce of God is broader. The Truce of God prohibited fighting on Sundays and feria (feast days on which people were not obliged to work). It was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God, for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts. It confirmed permanent peace for all churches and their grounds, the monks, clerks and chattels; all women, pilgrims, merchants and their servants, cattle and horses; and men at work in the fields. For all others peace was required throughout Advent, the season of Lent, and from the beginning of the Rogation days until eight days after Pentecost. This prohibition was subsequently extended to specific days of the week, viz., Thursday, in memory of the Ascension, Friday, the day of the Passion, and Saturday, the day of the Resurrection (council 1041). By the middle of the twelfth century the number of proscribed days was extended until there was left some eighty days for fighting. The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany; the 1179 Third Council of the Lateran extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi, \\"De treugis servandis\\", which was inserted in the collection of canon law, Decretal of Gregory IX, I, tit., \\"De treuga et pace\\".Moeller, Charles. \\"Truce of God.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 1 Aug. 2014 Aquinas challenged the Truce, holding that it was lawful to wage war to safeguard the commonwealth on holy days and feast days. Peace of God and Truce of God within Chivalry and Crusade One of the interesting developments beginning at the end of the tenth century and continuing well into the eleventh century is the rhetoric of the Peace of God and Truce of God movements within chivalric pledges and as a way to divert knightly violence away from one's own country. While the Peace of God and the Truce of God must be seen as separately developing movements in Europe in terms of the roles of these movements martially and civilly, there are instances where the rhetoric of the movements is combined within oaths and speeches by both secular and ecclesiastical leaders. In terms of secular leadership, Robert the Pious (996‚Äì1031) espouses an oath that combines both religious movements: The oath is important because it shows that secular powers are now willing to show obedience to ecclesiastical powers and to rein in problematic knights and armies. Furthermore, knightly and martial violence is often subverted by ecclesiastical powers through the use of crusade. For Pope Urban II, at the Council of Clermont in 1095, the subversion of martial violence is effective in dealing with secular violence: The Peace of God and the Truce of God therefore works within the rhetorical landscape of subverting violence by redirecting it to more applicable regions, such as a crusade in the Middle East against Islam in an attempt to regain Jerusalem. Other developments Beginning in the 11th century, knighthood developed a religious character. Prospective knights underwent rigorous religious rituals in order to be initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, was given a symbolic bath, had his hair cut to represent humility, and he spent a night praying, his weapons upon an altar representing the dedication of his weapons to the Church and God. Advancements in metallurgy allowed inscriptions and pictures of holy symbols to be engraved on helmets, swords, shields, a horse‚Äôs saddle and bridle. Relics and objects with religious symbols, often of saints, on them were routinely carried into battles by knights in medieval times. The symbols allowed for a physical reminder to knights and military men that God was supporting their efforts, providing protection to those soldiers as well as the assurance of a victory over their enemies. In addition to the Peace and Truce of God movement, other non-violent, although less direct, methods of controlling violence were used by the clergy. By adding the religious oaths of fealty to the feudal act of homage, and in organizing rights and duties within the system, churchmen did their utmost to civilize feudal society in general and to set limits on feudal violence in particular. Louis IX of France was famous for his attention to the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace, at least within the Kingdom of France. He issued the first extant ordinance indefinitely prohibiting warfare in France, a text dating from January 1258 that outlawed guerrae omnes as well as arson, and disturbances to carts and to agricolae who work with carts or plows. Those who transgressed this prohibition were to be punished as peace-breakers (fractores pacis) by the king's officer and the bishop-elect of le Puy-en-Velay. Louis IX promulgated this text as a simple royal act on the basis of his authority as king.Firnhaber-Baker, Justine. \\"From God's Peace to the King's Order: Late Medieval Limitations on Non-Royal Warfare\\", Essays in Medieval Studies, Volume 23, 2006, pp. 19‚Äì30 The Bianchi was a religious movement that swept through Italy for several months in 1399. Tens of thousands of men, women and children could be found travelling across the country to pray and promote peace. It was a shock to many observers and caught authorities off guard. It also brought peace, at least for a few months, to much of Italy.

It features Helen Broderick, Victor Moore, Betty Furness, Eric Blore and Georges Metaxa, with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Dorothy Fields. The film was directed by George Stevens. Noted dance critic Arlene Croce considers Swing Time Astaire and Rogers' best dance musical,Croce, pp.98-115 a view shared by John MuellerMueller, pp.100-113 and Hannah Hyam. It features four dance routines that are each regarded as masterpieces. According to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical, Swing Time is \\"a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals\\". The Oxford Companion says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it \\"left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ‚Ä¶ Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.\\"Hischak, Thomas. \\"Swing Time\\". The Oxford Companion to the American Musical, Oxford University Press 2009. Oxford Reference Online, accessed September 25, 2016 (requires subscription) \\"Never Gonna Dance\\" is often singled out as the partnership's and collaborator Hermes Pan's most profound achievement in filmed dance, while \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and went on to become Astaire's most successful hit record, scoring first place in the U.S. charts in 1936. Jerome Kern's score, the second of two he composed specially for Astaire,The other one was You Were Never Lovelier, while Kern's Roberta was originally written for the Broadway stage contains three of his most memorable songs.Mueller, p.101n: \\"In a 1936 letter George Gershwin was somewhat patronizing about the music: 'Although I don't think Kern has written any outstanding song hits, I think he did a very credible job with the music and some of it is really quite delightful. Of course, he never was really quite ideal for Astaire and I take that into consideration'\\". The film's plot has been criticized, though,Mueller, p.101: \\"the story is riddled with inconsistencies, implausibilities, contrivances, omissions, and irrationalities,\\" Croce, p.102: \\"discontinuities in the plot,\\" also see Hyam, p.46 as has the performance of Metaxa. More praised is Rogers' acting and dancing performance.Mueller, p.103: \\"her finest in the series.\\" Rogers herself credited much of the film's success to Stevens: \\"He gave us a certain quality, I think, that made it stand out above the others.\\" Swing Time also marked the beginning of a decline in popularity of the Astaire‚ÄìRogers partnership among the general public, with box office receipts falling faster than usual, after a successful opening. Nevertheless, the film was a sizable hit, costing $886,000, grossing over $2,600,000 worldwide, and showing a net profit of $830,000. The partnership never again regained the creative heights scaled in this and previous films.Croce, p.104: \\"Swing Time is an apotheosis.\\" In 1999 Swing Time was one of Entertainment Weekly's top 100 films. In 2004 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In the new AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it has been added at #90. Plot John \\"Lucky\\" Garnett (Fred Astaire) is a gambler and dancer. He is set to marry Margaret (Betty Furness), but his friends hold him up quibbling about a minor alteration to his suit, so that he is late for the wedding. Margaret's father phones to call off the wedding, but Lucky doesn't get that message. His friends bet him that he will not be getting married, and he agrees to the bet. Margaret's father tells Lucky that he must earn $25,000 to demonstrate his good intentions. He and his friend \\"Pop\\" Cardetti (Victor Moore) try to buy train tickets, but his friends take his money ‚Äì because he lost the bet. So they hitch the first freight train to New York. Broke, they wander around the city. Lucky meets Penny (Ginger Rogers), a dance school instructor, when he asks for change for a quarter. It's his lucky quarter and Pop feels bad that Lucky lost it. They attempt to get it back, but Penny is in no mood to deal with them. When she drops her things, Pop sneaks the quarter out of her purse, and she thinks Lucky did it. They follow Penny to her work. To be able to apologize, he has to take a dancing lesson from her. She's still furious at him. After a disastrous lesson, Penny tells him to \\"save his money\\" since he will never learn to dance. Her boss, Mr. Gordon (Eric Blore), overhears her comment and fires her. Lucky dances with Penny to \\"prove\\" how much she's taught him. Not only does Mr. Gordon give Penny her job back, he sets up an audition with the owner of a local venue. They check into the same hotel where Penny is staying. Lucky does not have a tuxedo to wear to the audition. He tries to get a tuxedo off a drunk man, but he ends up losing his own clothes instead. They miss the audition, and Penny gets mad at Lucky all over again. Lucky arranges another audition. He and Pop picket in front of Penny's door until she gives in and forgives him. But they cannot audition because the club has lost their band leader, Ricardo Romero (Georges Metaxa), to a casino. They go to Club Raymond where Lucky gambles to win enough to get Ricky back. Meanwhile, Ricky declares his feelings for Penny. Lucky is about to win enough to marry Margaret, but he takes his last bet off in time... proving he is no longer interested in her, but in Penny, instead. The club owner bets him double or nothing and they gamble for Ricky's contract. Upon seeing that the club owner intends to cheat, Pop cheats as well, and Lucky wins the contract. Lucky and Penny dance at the club. They are dancing together all the time, but Lucky does not trust himself around Penny because he feels guilty about not telling her about Margaret. He's avoiding her, which Penny notices, so she and her friend Mabel Anderson (Helen Broderick) conspire to get Lucky and Pop out to the country. Pop lets slip the information about Lucky and Margaret. Despite her best efforts, the two begin a romance, even as Ricky continues to woo Penny. When Margaret shows up, Lucky tries to avoid her; but, too late, Penny finds out. She agrees to marry Ricky. Margaret calls off her engagement to Lucky before he can. Lucky successfully stops Penny's wedding. And the two end up together, much to everyone's delight. Cast * Fred Astaire as John \\"Lucky\\" Garnett * Ginger Rogers as Penelope \\"Penny\\" Carroll * Victor Moore as Edwin \\"Pop\\" Cardetti * Eric Blore as Mr. Gordon * Helen Broderick as Mabel Anderson * Betty Furness as Margaret Watson * Georges Metaxa as Ricardo Romero * Landers Stevens as Judge Watson Production Initially, the working titles for the film were I Won't Dance and Never Gonna Dance, but studio executives worried that no one would come see a musical where no one danced, and the title was changed. Pick Yourself Up was also considered as a title, as were 15 other possibilities. Erwin Gelsey's original screen story was purchased by RKO, and in November 1935, Gelsey was hired to adapt the story. Although he did not receive any screen credit, he was under consideration for screenplay credit as late as July 1936. Howard Lindsay wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which was then considerably re-written by Allan Scott. Just before shooting started, in April 1936, Scott was called back from New York to write additional dialogue. Astaire spent almost eight weeks preparing for the film's dance numbers. The \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\" number, a tribute to Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, was the last part of the film shot, because of the special effects required. To create the effect that Astaire was dancing with three shadows of himself that were larger-than-life, Astaire had to be filmed dancing in front of a blank white screen on which a powerful light projected his shadow. This footage was tripled in the film lab. Astaire was next filmed performing under normal lighting in front of another white screen while watching a projection of the shadow dancing, and the four shots were optically combined. In its entirety, the sequence took three full days of shooting, and the film overall took several weeks longer to shoot than the normal Astaire-Rogers film. The New York street scenes were shot on Paramount's back lot, the train station interiors and exteriors at the Los Angeles Santa Fe Railroad Station, and the freight yard scene was shot in downtown Los Angeles. Musical numbers * \\"Pick Yourself Up\\": The first of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' standards is a charming polka first sung and then danced to by Astaire and Rogers. One of their most joyous and exuberant numbers is also a technical tour-de-force with the basic polka embellished by syncopated rhythms and overlaid with tap decoration. In particular, Rogers recaptures the spontaneity and commitment that she first displayed in the \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\" number from Roberta (1935). * \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\": Kern and Fields' classic Oscar-winning foxtrot is sung by Astaire, seated at a piano, while Ginger is busy washing her hair in a side room. Here, Astaire conveys a sunny yet nostalgic romanticism but later, when the music is danced to as part of \\"Never Gonna Dance\\", the pair will create a mood of sombre poignancy. As evidence of its enduring appeal, this song is regularly featured in modern cinema and television. It is featured in the films Chinatown (1974) and My Best Friend's Wedding (1997) and it played a prominent role as the key linking element in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine series finale \\"What You Leave Behind\\". * \\"Waltz in Swing Time\\": Described by one critic as \\"the finest piece of pure dance music ever written for Astaire\\", this is the most virtuosic partnered romantic duet Astaire ever committed to film. Kern was always reluctant to compose in the swing style, so the film's orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett - a longtime Kern associate on Broadway - composed the number using some themes provided by Kern. The song's interlude, a 3/4 treatment of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" was added by rehearsal pianist Hal Borne. Bennett recalled Kern's request to attend to the number - \\"see what Freddie [Astaire] wants\\" - to Arlene Croce in 1976,Croce, p. 112 and later in a letter to John Mueller; the published sheet music notes that the waltz was \\"constructed and arranged\\" by Bennett. The dance is a nostalgic celebration of love, in the form of a syncopated waltz with tap overlays ‚Äì a concept Astaire later reworked in the similarly impressive \\"Belle of New York\\" segment of the \\"Currier and Ives\\" routine from The Belle of New York (1952). In the midst of this most complex of routines, Astaire and Rogers find time to gently poke fun at notions of elegance, in a delicate reminder of a similar episode in \\"Pick Yourself Up\\". * \\"A Fine Romance\\": Kern and Fields' third standard, a quickstep to Fields' bittersweet lyrics, is sung alternately by Rogers and Astaire, with Rogers providing an object lesson in acting while a bowler-hatted Astaire appears at times to be impersonating Stan Laurel. Never a man to discard a favourite piece of fine clothing, Astaire wears the same coat in the opening scene of Holiday Inn (1941). * \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\": Once again, Kern, Bennett and Borne combined their talents to produce a jaunty instrumental piece ideally suited to Astaire, who here ‚Äì while overtly paying tribute to Bill Robinson ‚Äì actually broadens his tribute to African‚ÄìAmerican tap dancers by dancing in the style of Astaire's one-time teacher John W. Bubbles, and dressing in the style of the character Sportin' Life, whom Bubbles played the year before in Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. Dorothy Fields recounts how Astaire managed to inspire the reluctant Kern by visiting his home and singing while dancing on and around his furniture. It is the only number in which Astaire ‚Äì again bowler-hatted ‚Äì appears in blackface. The idea of using trick photography to show Astaire dancing with three of his shadows was invented by Hermes Pan, who also choreographed the opening chorus, after which Astaire dances a short opening solo which features poses mimicking, perhaps satirising, Al Jolson ‚Äì all of which was captured by Stevens in one take. There follows a two-minute solo of Astaire dancing with his shadows which took three days to shoot. Astaire's choreography exercises every limb and makes extensive use of hand-clappers. This routine earned Hermes Pan an Academy Award nomination for Best Dance Direction. * \\"Never Gonna Dance\\": After Astaire sings Fields' memorable closing line: \\"la belle, la perfectly swell romance\\" of Kern's haunting ballad, they begin the acknowledgement phase of the dance ‚Äì possibly their greatest ‚Äì replete with a poignant nostalgia for their now-doomed affair, where music changes to \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and they dance slowly in a manner reminiscent of the opening part of \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" from Follow the Fleet. At the end of this episode, Astaire adopts a crestfallen, helpless pose. They now begin the denial phase, and again the music changes and speeds up, this time to the \\"Waltz In Swing Time\\" while the dancers separate to twirl their way up their respective staircases, escaping to the platform at the top of the Silver Sandal Set ‚Äì one of the most beautiful Art Deco-influenced Hollywood Moderne creations of Carroll Clark and John Harkrider. Here the music switches again to a frantic, fast-paced, recapitulation of \\"Never Gonna Dance\\" as the pair dance a last, desperate, and virtuosic routine before Ginger flees and Astaire repeats his pose of dejection, in a final acceptance of the affair's end. This final routine was shot forty-seven times in one day before Astaire was satisfied, with Rogers' feet left bruised and bleeding by the time they finished. * Finale duet: At the end of the film, Astaire and Rogers sing shortened versions of \\"A Fine Romance\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" simultaneously (with altered lyrics). Harmonies have been very slightly altered so that the two songs fit well together. Musical notes * Kern and Fields also wrote an additional song, \\"It's Not in the Cards\\", as a full opening number, but it was edited out, being heard only momentarily at the conclusion of the first scene and later as background music. * Kern was hired to write seven songs, for which he was paid $50,000 and gross percentage up to $37,500. Astaire requested that two of the songs be swing numbers, but the weak version of \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\" he delivered remained unacceptable even though Astaire spent several hours tap-dancing in Kern's hotel room in an attempt to loosen it up. Kern required the services of Robert Russell Bennet, and, during rehearsal, Astaire's rehearsal pianist Hal Borne contributed ideas. Although Astaire requested that Borne receive credit for his contribution, Kern was insistent that Borne receive no credit, was not to compose any music, and was not to be paid for writing any music. Bennett also received no credit in the film, but the sheet music for \\"Waltz in Swing Time\\" credits him with the construction and arrangement. Reception =Box office= According to RKO records the film made $1,624,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $994,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $830,000. It was the 15th most popular film at the British box office in 1935-36.\\"The Film Business in the United States and Britain during the 1930s\\" by John Sedgwick and Michael Pokorny, The Economic History ReviewNew Series, Vol. 58, No. 1 (Feb., 2005), pp.97 =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 29 reviews, with an average rating of 8.58/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire are brilliant in Swing Time, one of the duo's most charming and wonderfully choreographed films.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". * American Dancer, November 1936: \\"Astaire's dancing can no longer be classified as mere tap, because it is such a perfect blend of tap, modern and ballet, with a generous share of Astaire's personality and good humor...Rogers is vastly improved...but she cannot, as yet, vie with Astaire's amazing agility, superb grace and sophisticated charm. With Astaire one feels, with each succeeding picture, that surely his dancing has reached perfection and marks the end of invention of new steps: and yet he seems to go forward with ease and apparent nonchalance.\\" * Dance Magazine, November 1936, Joseph Arnold Kaye: \\"Much has been written about Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in Swing Time except, perhaps, one thing: Astaire and Rogers are the picture; everything else seems to have been put in to fill the time between swings. Dance routines are fresh and interesting, dance is superb. When Hollywood will learn to make a dance picture as good as the dancing, we cannot even guess.\\" * Variety, 2 September 1936, Abel: \\"Perhaps a shade under previous par, but it's another box-office and personal winner from the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers combo...Film's 103 minutes running time could have been pared to advantage but Swing Time will swing 'em past the wickets in above-average tempo.\\" =Awards and honors= At the 1937 Academy Awards Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields won the award for Best Music, Original Song and Hermes Pan was nominated, but did not win, for his choreography for \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\". In 1999, Entertainment Weekly named Swing Time as one of the top 100 films, and in 2004, the film was included in the United States National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Three years later, in 2007, the American Film Institute ranked Swing Time #90 on their 10th Anniversary list of 100 Years...100 Movies. Adaptations A Broadway musical, Never Gonna Dance based on the film, used much of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' original score.

Founded in 1906 during the late Qing dynasty, it is the oldest zoo in China and oldest public park in northern China. The zoo is also a center of zoological research that studies and breeds rare animals from various continents. The zoo occupies an area of , including of lakes and ponds in Xicheng District. It has one of the largest animal collections in the country. The zoo and its aquarium have over 450 species of land animals and over 500 species of marine animals; in all, it is home to 14,500 animals. More than five million people visit the zoo each year. Like many of Beijing's parks, the zoo's grounds resemble classical Chinese gardens, with flower beds amidst natural scenery, including dense groves of trees, stretches of meadows, small streams and rivers, lotus pools, and hills dotted with pavilions and historical buildings. The Beijing Zoo is well known for its collection of rare animals endemic to China including the giant pandas, which are zoo's most popular animals, the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China, the golden snub-nosed monkey, South China tiger, white-lipped deer, Pere David's deer, crested ibis, Chinese alligator, and Chinese giant salamander.

In 1906, the Imperial Ministry for Agricultural, Industry and Commerce established an experimental farm outside of Xizhimen on land that encompassed two gardens, the Leshan and Ji, and two temples, the Guangshan and Huining. The Experimental Farm consisted of an experimental farm, a botantical garden, a small menagerie of . The experimental farm had five main experimental areas for grain, sericulture, vegetables, fruits and flowers. The menagerie was the earliest public zoo in China and the oldest public park in northern China.(Chinese) \\"Brief History\\" Beijing Zoo Official Website Accessed Jan. 21, 2020 Most of the animals were purchased by the Viceroy of Liangjiang, Duanfang, from Germany. The animal collection attracted great interest when the farm opened to visitors on June 16, 1908. Admission cost eight copper coins with children at half price. The Empress Dowager Cixi and the Guangxu Emperor each visited the zoo twice. The farm was known as the Wanshouyuan or the \\"Garden of Ten Thousand Beasts.\\" Among the historical buildings at the zoo is Changguanlou, a Baroque-style country-palace of Empress Dowager Cixi, designed by a French architect and built in 1908. It remains one of the best preserved Western-style palaces in China.(Chinese) Accessed 2012-04-06 =Republican Era= After the Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911, the zoo became a national botanical garden during the Republican period. In the 1930s, with French aid, Lamarck Hall, named after the botanist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, was built at the experimental farm and housed plant research. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese occupiers built the monkey mountain in 1942, but used the experimental farm as a storage depot.(Chinese) \\"8Â§ÑÊäóÊàòÁ∫™ÂøµÈÅóËøπÈ¶ñÊ¨°ÂèëÂ∏É Âåó‰∫¨Âä®Áâ©Âõ≠ 'Áå¥Â±±' ‰∏äÊ¶ú\\" ‰∫¨ÂçéÊó∂Êä• 2015-08-27 Accessed Jan. 21, 2020 In 1943, the Imperial Japanese Army poisoned the zoo's six lions and two leopards, purportedly to remove potential interference with air defenses.

In 1952, national leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Ren Bishi donated their war horses to the park. The zoo sent staff to study zoo management in the Soviet Union and Poland, and began to trade animals with Eastern Bloc countries, Burma, India, Indonesia, and Japan to expand its collection. Zoo staff used some 30 species from the zoo including South China Tiger, Fran√ßois' langur, Chinese alligator, python and black bear in such trades. The Moscow Zoo and Leipzig Zoo donated 14 species including African lion, polar bear, brown bear, emu and Himalayan vulture. The park was renamed the Beijing Zoo in 1955.(Chinese) \\"Âåó‰∫¨Âä®Áâ©Âõ≠Ôºà‰∏âÔºâ\\" Âåó‰∫¨ÊóÖÊ∏∏ÈõÜÊï£‰∏≠ÂøÉ 2016-10-31 Accessed Jan. 21, 2020 Guo Moruo, the renowned writer and president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote the calligraphy for the zoo's entrance sign. Leading Chinese universities also established a research presence in the zoo to study animal behavior and to breed endangered species. Giant panda was displayed at the zoo for the first time in 1955 and successfully bred by zoo staff in 1963. New enclosures opened in the 1950s, the Lion-Tiger Mountain, Elephant House, Primate House, and Reptile House, which had specimens of over 100 species including crocodiles and pythons. In 1958, the city government approved the expansion of the zoo to 21 hectares on the north bank of the Nanchang River. In 1965, when the construction of the Capital Indoor Stadium took away 4 hectares of the zoo's land to the west, the city granted the zoo 2.3 hectares near the Ming Tombs north of the city. This land became the zoo's off-site breeding center. The zoo's development came to an abrupt halt with the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 as zoo staff were purged, research work stopped, and contacts with foreign zoos were severed. When Guo Moruo was denounced, the sign bearing his calligraphy was removed and replaced with one featuring characters pieced together from Chairman Mao's calligraphy. In the 1970s, as China forged diplomatic relations with the Western bloc, the zoo received animal gifts from the Australia, France, Mexico, Nepal, Spain, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The zoo also organized a four-year mission to Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania, which brought back 157 species and 1,000 animals including and aardvark, African elephant, baboon, giant tortoises, giraffe, Grant's gazelle, oryx, ostrich, Thomson's gazelle, wildebeest, and zebra. During the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Beijing Zoo sent a pair of giant pandas, Yingxin and Yong Yong, to Los Angeles for an exhibition. In 1987, Yong Yong and Ling Ling went on exhibition at the Bronx Zoo. Present The buildings in the zoo cover an area of more than 50,000 square meters, including the elephant hall, the lion and tiger hall, the monkey hall, the panda hall, and many others. Altogether, there are more than 30 large halls. The Beijing Zoo maintains an active breeding program that produced 1,104 surviving offspring of 92 species in 2013 including the critically endangered Northern white-cheeked gibbon and Guizhou snub-nosed monkey. Other reproduced species in 2013 include giant panda, golden takin, chimpanzee, De Brazza's monkey, Patas monkey, vervet monkey, mantled guereza, Bengal slow loris, tufted capuchin, Pere David's deer and hippopatamus.(Chinese) Beijing Zoo Magazine Jan. 2014 edition, pg. 11 Accessed Jan. 21, 2020 Visitors to the zoo can also explore its many Qing dynasty buildings.

Controversies According to a 2010 article in The Guardian, a restaurant located in the Beijing Zoo, named \\"Bin Feng Tan,\\" offers various dishes of exotic animals on its menu. The restaurant manager commented that its dishes were within the law, as the animal products were supplied by exotic animal farms. However, the restaurant has received a backlash since the news spread. Ge Rui of the International Wildlife Fund describes the restaurant's menu and practices as \\"utterly inappropriate for a zoo\\" and \\"socially irresponsible.\\" Following the negative coverage, the restaurant stated they would be revising the menu. In popular culture A significant portion of James Rollins' Sigma Force novel, The Bone Labyrinth (2015), takes place in, near, and below the Beijing Zoo. Rollins depicts unsanitary and inhumane conditions at the zoo, and inhumane animal experimentation there. In the \\"Author's Note to Readers: Truth or Fiction\\", Rollins writes: \\"I did visit the Beijing Zoo and found the state of that zoological park to be appalling. The government continues to hint at changes and plans to move the place into a larger facility outside the city with more modern accommodations. So hopefully now that I've blown it up, they'll get on with those plans.\\" See also * List of endangered and protected species of China References External links * * China Report - Beijing Zoo Update * Brief Introduction Category:Buildings and structures in Beijing Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Beijing Category:Parks and gardens in Beijing Category:Tourist attractions in Beijing Category:Xicheng District Category:Zoos established in 1906 Category:Zoos in China Category:1906 establishments in China ","title":"Beijing Zoo"},{"id":"919010","text":"Huaqiao University Xiamen Campus Huaqiao University (; Abbreviated name: HQU)is a national university located in Xiamen and Quanzhou, Fujian province, China.

Written by Frederic Raphael, the film is about a husband and wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was considered somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning, often leaving the viewer to interpolate what has intervened, which is sometimes revealed in later scenes. Several locations are used in different segments to show continuity throughout the twelve-year period. Raphael received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, Hepburn received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Henry Mancini received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score. The film's theme song, \\"Two for the Road\\", was composed by Mancini, with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse. Mancini, who composed many notable theme songs for films, including \\"Moon River\\" for Breakfast at Tiffany's, considered \\"Two for the Road\\" his favourite. Cars featured in the film, being driven by the couple or ridden in by them, include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, an Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint coup√©,https://www.imcdb.org/m62407.html VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire; the cars are often used to re- establish the time period after a jump. In one scene of this movie, Audrey Hepburn appears dressed in a shiny black PVC trouser suit designed by Paco Rabanne. The film was ranked #57 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Passions list. Plot Now a successful and wealthy architect, Mark Wallace (Albert Finney) and his wife Joanna (Jo) Wallace (Audrey Hepburn) fly their white 1965 Mercedes 230SL roadster to Northern France in order to drive to Saint-Tropez to celebrate the completion of a building project for a client, Maurice. Tensions between the couple are evident, and as they journey south they both remember and discuss several past journeys along the same road. The earliest memory is their first meeting on a ferry crossing in 1954, when Mark was travelling alone and Joanna was part of a girls' choir. They meet again when Joanna's choir bus goes off the road and Mark helps get them back on the road. When the other girls get chickenpox, Joanna and Mark unexpectedly wind up hitchhiking south together. The next story involves the two newlyweds travelling with Mark's ex-girlfriend Cathy Manchester (Eleanor Bron), her husband (William Daniels) and daughter Ruth 'Ruthie' (Gabrielle Middleton) from the USA. Ruthie is not given any limits, and her behaviour frustrates Mark and Jo. Eventually Ruthie reveals the unkind descriptions of Joanna her parents have made in private. At this point Mark and Joanna decide to travel alone. Next the pair are seen driving an MG which begins to have exhaust troubles, finally catching on fire. On this journey Joanna announces that she is pregnant. They also meet the wealthy Maurice Dalbret (Claude Dauphin) and his wife Fran√ßoise (Nadia Gray). Maurice becomes a generous but demanding client for Mark. The next story shows them travelling with their young daughter Caroline (Kathy Chelimsky). In another episode, Mark is travelling alone and has a fling with another motorist. The fling is shown to be fleeting and unserious in nature. Later, Joanna has an affair with Fran√ßoise's brother David (Georges Descri√®res), which is portrayed as much more serious than Mark's and threatens to end the marriage. However, while Joanna dines with David, they witness a couple eating together without saying a word. David asks offhandedly, \\"What kind of people can sit there without a word to say to each other?\\" Joanna replies excitedly, \\"Married people!\\" and, realizing she misses Mark despite their faded passion, runs back to him. At the end of the film, the Wallaces manage to end their long-term relationship to Maurice and find a new client in Rome. They honestly analyze the fears and insecurities which have plagued them throughout the film. Finally, they cross the border from France into Italy. This is new ground for them as well as for the audience, signalling a move beyond the old issues into a more mature future.

FNU has been hailed as the province's \\"cradle of teachers.\\" History Tracing its origin back to Fujian Superior Normal School, founded in 1907, Fujian Normal University (FNU) is Fujian's oldest university and one of China's most time- honored teachers‚Äô colleges. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the school (which had been renamed Fujian Provincial Normal College) merged in 1953 with Fukian Christian University and Hua Nan Women's College to form a new and significantly expanded Fujian Normal College. It acquired its current name of Fujian Normal University in 1972. Overview In Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province, FNU has two campuses ‚Äî Qishan and Cangshan ‚Äî with a land area of about 230 hectares. The university consists of 28 colleges, which together offer 56 undergraduate programs, over 120 master programs (including those conferring professional degrees in pedagogy, public administration, physical culture and arts), about 50 doctoral programs and 7 post-doctoral research centers. These programs cover subject areas in literature, history, philosophy, physics, engineering, pedagogy, economics, law, business management, agriculture, etc. A balanced and coordinated development of this spectrum of disciplines has given FNU a distinct identity as a multi-discipline comprehensive university. By conferring a range of academic degrees, from bachelors to doctorates, these programs enable FNU to set up a full-fledged educational system in its institutional framework. Training programs In addition to regular academic programs, FNU has been authorized by the state to provide on-the-job training for teachers of elementary, secondary, occupational schools as well as colleges. It has been singled out for setting up experimental pilot programs in distance education and in teaching Chinese as a foreign language. It has been authorized to admit students from Taiwan on an experimental basis. Teaching, however, is just one aspect of the dual task which FNU has taken on. To turn the university into a school oriented to both teaching and research, its faculty has been paying just as much attention to scientific investigations and scholarly pursuits. The efforts have started to pay off. The university is at present the proud host to as many as four national centers for scientific research and personnel training, eight key laboratories or research centers sponsored by the ministries concerned or the provincial government, one Ministry of Education sponsored research center for basic education, and several dozen of provincially sponsored laboratories and research institutes. Students Over 20,000 students are enrolled in the two campuses in Fuzhou, among whom over 4,600 are pursuing their graduate degrees. Some others are international students from 17 countries such as the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and the Republic of Korea, and from China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan areas or from overseas Chinese families around the world. =International student life= Most of the international students come from neighbouring Asian countries, including Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea. The International Students College is near many shopping areas including Student Street (), Baolong Mall (), Taijiang (), and Dongbai Yuan Hong (). Faculty FNU attaches the greatest importance to recruiting talented researchers and distinguished scholars for its teaching staff. Maintaining a high-quality, properly tiered, and professionally dedicated faculty has been its top priority. It has a 2,600-strong teaching and auxiliary staff. Its faculty counts more than 700 full and associate professors, among whom two have been elected members of the Eurasian Academy of Sciences, seven have received the honorific title of \\"Young and Middle-aged Experts with Distinguished Services,\\" two are members of the subject-specific advisory groups under the State Council Commission for Regulating Academic Degrees, six are \\"Professors Extraordinaire\\" or \\"Minjiang Scholars\\", one has been honored as \\"China‚Äôs Distinguished Teacher\\", six as \\"Fujian‚Äôs Distinguished Teachers,\\" and 22 as \\"Fujian‚Äôs Distinguished Experts\\", to mention a fraction of the honors and recognitions won by FNU scholars. Facilities The university is noted for its fine facilities for teaching and research. Its library holds a collection of as many as 2.86 million books. It is one of the largest libraries in normal universities throughout China. The library is famed internationally for its very impressive collections of ancient texts, rare books, rubbings of engraved tablets, photographs, calligraphic works and paintings, Fujian's local cultural and historical documents, early editions of foreign language publications, and major newspapers published during the historic period known as the May Fourth Movement. The university is equipped with over 7,000 computers for teaching and research, over 100 multimedia classrooms, and more than 30 language laboratories. Among its facilities for conducting pedagogical and scientific experiments are a university computation center, an analyzing and testing center, a center of modern educational technologies, in addition to the 70-odd research institutes and centers run by its colleges. A high- speed intranet serves the campuses, and it is expanding rapidly to cater to the ever-increasing needs of the university community. International education Founded in 1988, the International College of Chinese Studies of the Fujian Normal University (formerly International Cultural and Educational Exchange Center, FNU) was authorized by the State Education Commission as one of the four Chinese teaching bases to admit students from Southeast Asia. In 1997, it received its current name. The International College of Chinese Studies undertakes the work of recruiting, teaching and advising foreign students for degree and non-degree courses. The school has a well-equipped administrative system, qualified teachers, and modest teaching and learning means. However, complaints have been filed by students with regard to the living conditions. Buildings and dormitories often do not meet appropriate safety standards.

Biography Sidgwick was born in Park Town, Oxford, the elder of two children of William Carr Sidgwick, lecturer at Oriel College, and Sarah Isabella (n√©e Thompson), descended from a notable family; her uncle was Thomas Perronet Thompson. He was initially educated at Summer Fields School but, after a year, he entered Rugby School in 1886. From there he was elected to an open scholarship in Natural Science at Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a first in 1895, and went on to gain another first in Greats in 1897, a very rare feat. His principal interest, though, was science, and he spent some time in Wilhelm Ostwald‚Äôs laboratory in Germany, where he fell ill and had to go home. He returned to Germany in the autumn of 1899, this time in Hans von Pechmann‚Äôs lab at the University of T√ºbingen. His researches on derivatives of acetone-dicarboxylic acid resulted in his being award a DSc in 1901. Sidgwick was elected to a Fellowship at Lincoln College, where he went into residence in October 1901 and remained for the rest of his life. In 1914 Sidgwick was one of the members of the party chosen to represent the British Association for the meeting held in Australia. On 1 July he set sail on the maiden voyage of the Euripides from London to Brisbane, disembarking at Adelaide.UK and Ireland, Outward Passenger Lists, 1890-1960 A fellow first- class passenger was Sir Ernest Rutherford, who had been knighted that year. Sidgwick became a devotee of the physicist, and would hear no criticism of him in later years. On the return journey, via Penang, in November 1914, a fellow passenger on the Kashima Maru was the astronomer and physicist Professor A S Eddington.UK and Ireland, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878-1960 Sidgwick became absorbed by the study of atomic structure and its importance in chemical bonding. He explained the bonding in coordination compounds (complexes), with a convincing account of the significance of the dative bond. Together with his students he demonstrated the existence and wide-ranging importance of the hydrogen bond. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1922. In 1927, he proposed the inert pair effect which describes the stability of heavier p-block atoms in an oxidation state two less than the maximum. In 1940 his Bakerian lecture with Herbert Marcus Powell correlated molecular geometry with the number of valence electrons on a central atom. These ideas were later developed into the VSEPR theory by Gillespie and Nyholm. The scope and significance of his researches brought international fame for Sidgwick. He travelled to Toronto for a British Association meeting in 1924, and then explored much of western Canada. Another BA meeting in 1929 took him to Cape Town and then Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, and back home via Aden and Suez. Two years later he was off to spend a semester at Cornell University, via New York and Princeton University. Cornell provided him ‚Äúwith every luxury that an American laboratory can supply. Two offices, four telephones, a private laboratory, and a stenographer, all to myself. . . It is a wonderful place, with a great deal of good work going on, and everybody is most kind, so that I can see that I am going to have a very pleasant time here.‚Äù His stay at Ithaca was followed by a 10,000 mile trip to the West and back via Yellowstone National Park, Buffalo, Ottawa and Quebec. Back in Oxford, he concentrated as much as he could on new books, and revisions to earlier ones, but was diverted by his serving on several committees.

Children should not take medication with bismuth subsalicylate while recovering from influenza or chicken pox, as epidemiologic evidence points to an association between the use of salicylate-containing medications during certain viral infections and the onset of Reye syndrome.Aspirin or Salicylate-Containing Medications, reyessyndrome.org For the same reason, it is typically recommended that nursing mothers not use medication containing bismuth subsalicylate because small amounts of the medication are excreted in human breast milk, and these pose a theoretical risk of Reye's syndrome to nursing children. Salicylates are very toxic to cats, and thus bismuth subsalicylate should not be administered to cats.Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook, Carlson and Giffin, page 390. The British National Formulary does not recommend bismuth-containing antacids (unless chelated), cautioning that absorbed bismuth can be neurotoxic, causing encephalopathy, and that such antacids tend to be constipating. Mechanism of action Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antacid and antidiarrheal, and to treat some other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea. The means by which this occurs is still not well documented. It is thought to be some combination of the following:Bismuth subsalicylate, DrugBank. *Stimulation of absorption of fluids and electrolytes by the intestinal wall (antisecretory action) *As a salicylate, reducing inflammation/irritation of stomach and intestinal lining through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase 1/2 *Reduction in hypermotility of the stomach *Binding of toxins produced by Escherichia coli *Bactericidal action of a number of its subcomponents, including salicylic acid *Bactericidal action via a so-called oligodynamic effect in which small amounts of heavy metals such as bismuth damage many different bacteria species. *Weak antacid properties In vitro and in vivo data have shown that bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the gut to bismuth oxychloride and salicylic acid and less commonly bismuth hydroxide. In the stomach, this is likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The salicylic acid is absorbed and therapeutical concentrations of salicylic acid can be found in blood after bismuth subsalicylate administration. Bismuth oxychloride and bismuth hydroxide are both believed to have bactericidal effects, as is salicylic acid for enterotoxigenic E. coli a common cause of \\"traveler's diarrhea.\\" Organobismuth compounds have historically been used in growth media for selective isolation of microorganisms. Such salts have been shown to inhibit proliferation of Helicobacter pylori, other enteric bacteria, and some fungi. Decomposition Bismuth slag from decomposition of Pepto- Bismol Bismuth subsalicylate is the only active ingredient in an over-the- counter drug that can leave a shiny metal oxide slag behind after being completely burnt with a blow torch. History 1957 Life magazine ad for the product While bismuth salts were in use in Europe by the late 1700s, the combination of bismuth subsalicylate and zinc salts for astringency with salol (phenyl salicilate) appears to have begun in the US in the early 1900s as a remedy for life-threatening diarrhea in infants with cholera. At first sold directly to physicians, it was first marketed as Bismosal in 1918. Pepto- Bismol began being sold in 1900 or 1901 History of Pepto Bismol by a doctor in New York. It was originally sold as a remedy for infant diarrhea by Norwich Pharmacal Company under the name \\"Bismosal: Mixture Cholera Infantum\\". It was renamed Pepto-Bismol in 1919. Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 1982. As of 1946 and 1959, Canadian advertisements placed by Norwich show the product as Pepto-Besmal both in graphic and text. Pepto-Bismol is an over-the-counter drug currently produced by the Procter & Gamble company in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

In a general sense, an FED consists of a matrix of cathode ray tubes, each tube producing a single sub-pixel, grouped in threes to form red-green-blue (RGB) pixels. FEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high contrast levels and very fast response times, with the packaging advantages of LCD and other flat-panel technologies. They also offer the possibility of requiring less power, about half that of an LCD system. Sony was the major proponent of the FED design and put considerable research and development effort into the system during the 2000s, planning mass production in 2009. Sony's FED efforts started winding down in 2009, as LCD became the dominant flat-panel technology.Serkan Toto, \\"FED: Sony calls it quits, basically burying the technology as a whole\\", CrunchGear, 31 Mar 2009. In January 2010, AU Optronics announced that it acquired essential FED assets from Sony and intends to continue development of the technology. , no large-scale commercial FED production has been undertaken. FEDs can also be made transparent. FEDs are closely related to another developing display technology, the surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), differing primarily in details of the electron-emission system. Operation FED display operates like a conventional cathode ray tube (CRT) with an electron gun that uses high voltage (10 kV) to accelerate electrons, which in turn excite the phosphors, but instead of a single electron gun, an FED display contains a grid of individual nanoscopic electron guns. It consists of 2 sheets of glass spaced at regular intervals that face each other, one of which contains the emitters, spacers and the grid, and the other that contains the phosphors. An FED screen is constructed by laying down a series of metal stripes onto a glass plate to form a series of cathode lines. Photolithography is used to lay down a series of rows of switching gates at right angles to the cathode lines, forming an addressable grid. At the intersection of each row and column a small patch of up to 4,500 emitters is deposited, typically using methods developed from inkjet printers. The metal grid is laid on top of the switching gates to complete the gun structure. A high voltage-gradient field is created between the emitters and a metal mesh suspended above them, pulling electrons from the tips of the emitters. This is a highly non-linear process, and small changes in voltage will quickly cause the number of emitted electrons to saturate. The grid can be individually addressed, but only the emitters located at the crossing points of the powered cathode, gate lines will have enough power to produce a visible spot, and any power leaks to surrounding elements will not be visible. Richard Fink, \\"A closer look at SED, FED technologies\\" , EE Tines-Asia, August 16‚Äì31, 2007, pp. 1‚Äì4. The non-linearity of the process allows avoidance of active matrix addressing schemes - once the pixel lights up, it will naturally glow. Non- linearity also means that the brightness of the sub-pixel is pulse-width modulated to control the number of electrons being produced, like in plasma displays. The grid voltage sends the electrons flowing into the open area between the emitters at the back and the screen at the front of the display, where a second accelerating voltage additionally accelerates them towards the screen, giving them enough energy to light the phosphors. Since the electrons from any single emitter are fired toward a single sub-pixel, the scanning electromagnets are not needed. CNT-FEDs use carbon nanotubes doped with nitrogen and/or boron as emitters. Samsung has previously worked on the development of this kind of display, however, Samsung has never released any products using this technology. CNT-FED places the carbon nanotube emitters at the bottom center of cavities called gate holes, which are made using electrically insulating material. A gold film is deposited on top of this material without blocking the gate holes in order to allow electrons from the carbon nanotubes to pass through. The gold film acts as a gate or grid, which accelerates the electrons. Gold is also used as the cathode, and the carbon nanotubes are built on top of it. The cathode is laid out using photolithography to create an addressable grid. Spacers are placed at regular intervals which keep both glass panels 300 microns apart. The space created by the spaces contains a vacuum. The anode may be made out of aluminum or Indium tin oxide (ITO), and it may be placed below or on top of the phosphors.https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-comprehensive-scheme-of-a- CNT-FED-b-CNT-BLU-c-buckypaper- BLU_fig1_257336940https://www.researchgate.net/figure/CNT-Field-Emission- Display-FED-Monitor-4_fig1_27237144 Disadvantages Just like any other displays with individually addressable sub-pixels, FED displays can potentially suffer from manufacturing problems that will result in dead pixels. However, the emitters are so small that many \\"guns\\" can power a sub- pixel, the screen can be examined for dead emitters and pixel brightness corrected by increasing the pulse width to make up for the loss through increased emissions from the other emitters feeding the same pixel. # The efficiency of the field emitters is based on the extremely small radii of the tips, but this small size renders the cathodes susceptible to damage by ion impact. The ions are produced by the high voltages interacting with residual gas molecules inside the device. # FED display requires a vacuum to operate, so the display tube has to be sealed and mechanically robust. However, since the distance between the emitters and phosphors is quite small, generally a few millimeters, the screen can be mechanically reinforced by placing spacer strips or posts between the front and back face of the tube. # FEDs require high vacuum levels, which are difficult to attain: the vacuum suitable for conventional CRTs and vacuum tubes is not sufficient for long-term FED operation. Intense electron bombardment of the phosphor layer will also release gas during use.Light emitting principle of an FED system by SHARP Competing technologies =Cathode ray tube= FEDs eliminate much of the electrical complexity of cathode ray tubes, including the heated filaments in the electron gun used to generate electrons and the electromagnets in the deflection yokes used to steer the beam, and are thus much more power efficient than a CRT of similar size. However, FEDs are technically worse than CRTs, as they are not capable of multiscanning. =LCD= Flat-panel LCDs use a bright light source and filter out half of the light with a polarizer, and then filter most of the light to produce red, green and blue (RGB) sources for the sub-pixels. That means that, at best, only 1/6 (or less in practice) of the light being generated at the back of the panel reaches the screen. In most cases the liquid crystal matrix itself then filters out additional light in order to change the brightness of the sub-pixels and produce a color gamut. So in spite of using extremely efficient light sources like cold-cathode fluorescent lamps or high-power white LEDs, the overall efficiency of an LCD is not very high. Although the lighting process used in the FED is less efficient, only lit sub-pixels require power, which means that FEDs are more efficient than LCDs. Sony's 36\\" FED prototypes have been shown drawing only 14 W when displaying brightly lit scenes, whereas a conventional LCD screen of similar size would normally draw well over 100 W. Avoiding the need for a backlighting system and thin-film transistor active matrix also greatly reduces the complexity of the set as a whole, while also reducing its front- to-back thickness. While an FED has two sheets of glass instead of the one in an LCD, the overall weight is likely to be less than of a similarly sized LCD. > FEDs are also claimed to be cheaper to manufacture, as they have fewer total components and processes involved. However, they are not easy devices to manufacture as a reliable commercial device, and considerable production difficulties have been encountered. This led to a race with two other front- running technologies aiming to replace LCDs in television use, the active- matrix OLED and surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED). =OLED= Organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) cells directly emit light. Therefore, OLEDs require no separate light source and are highly efficient in terms of light output. They offer the same high contrast levels and fast response times that FED offers. OLEDs are a serious competitor to FEDs, but suffer from the same sorts of problems bringing them to mass production. =SED= SEDs are very similar to FEDs, the primary difference between the two technologies is that SED uses a single emitter for each column instead of the individual spots of the FED. Whereas an FED uses electrons emitted directly toward the front of the screen, the SED uses electrons that are emitted from the vicinity of a small \\"gap\\" in a surface-conducting track laid down parallel to the plane of the panel, and extracted sideways to their original direction of motion. SED uses an emitter array based on palladium oxide laid down by an inkjet or silk- screen process. SED has been considered to be the variant of FED that is feasible to mass-produce, however, as of late 2009 no commercial SED display products have been made available by the industry. History The first concentrated effort to develop FED systems started in 1991 by Silicon Video Corporation, later Candescent Technologies. Their \\"ThinCRT\\" displays used metal emitters, originally built out of tiny molybdenum cones known as Spindt tips. They suffered from erosion due to the high accelerating voltages. Attempts to lower accelerating voltages and find suitable phosphors that would work at lower power levels, as well as address the erosion problem through better materials, were unsuccessful. Candescent pushed ahead with development in spite of problems, breaking ground on a new production facility in Silicon Valley in 1998, partnering with Sony. However the technology was not ready, and the company suspended equipment purchases in early 1999, citing \\"contamination issues\\".Jerry Ascierto, \\"Candescent Delays Plant, Replaces CEO\\", Electronic News, 1 March 1999 The plant was never completed, and after spending $600 million on development they filed for Chapter 11 protection in June 2004, and sold all of their assets to Canon that August.\\"Candescent Technologies Files Chapter 11 and Announces a Sale of Its Assets\\", Business Wire, 23 June 2004 Another attempt to address the erosion issues was made by Advance Nanotech, a subsidiary of SI Diamond Technology of Austin, Texas. Advance Nanotech developed a doped diamond dust, whose sharp corners appeared to be an ideal emitter. However the development never panned out and was abandoned in 2003. Advance Nanotech then applied their efforts to the similar SED display, licensing their technology to Canon. When Canon brought in Toshiba to help developing the display, Advance Nanotech sued, but ultimately lost in their efforts to re-negotiate the contracts based on their claim that Canon transferred the technology to Toshiba. Recent FED research focuses on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as emitters. Nano-emissive display (NED) is Motorola's term for their carbon-nanotube-based FED technology. A prototype model was demonstrated in May 2005, but Motorola has now halted all FED-related development. Futaba Corporation has been running a Spindt-type development program since 1990. They have produced prototypes of smaller FED systems for a number of years and demonstrated them at various trade shows, but like the Candescent efforts no large-screen production has been forthcoming. Development continues on a nanotube based version. Sony, having abandoned their efforts with Candescent, licensed CNT technology from Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc.,\\"Arrowhead Subsidiary, Unidym, to Merge with Carbon Nanotechnologies\\" , nanotechwire, 23 March 2007 of Houston, Texas, who were the public licensing agent for a number of technologies developed at Rice University's Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory. In 2007 they demonstrated an FED display at a trade show in Japan and claimed they would be introducing production models in 2009.\\"Sony to Debut FED In 2009, Insists on Confusing Consumers With Yet Another Display Technology\\", Gizmodo, 9 April 2007 They later spun off their FED efforts to Field Emission Technologies Inc., which continued to aim for a 2009 release.Sumner Lemon, \\"Sony spinoff plans high-end FED monitors for 2009\\", IDG News Service, 4 October 2007 Their plans to start production at a former Pioneer factory in Kagoshima were delayed by financial issues in late 2008.Christopher MacManus, \\"Sony Delays Acquisition of FED Factory\\", Sony Insider, 5 November 2008 On March 26, 2009 Field Emission Technologies Inc. (FET) announced that it was closing down due to the inability to raise capital. In January 2010, Taiwanese AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) announced that it had acquired assets from Sony's FET and FET Japan, including \\"patents, know-how, inventions, and relevant equipment related to FED technology and materials\\". In November 2010, Nikkei reported that AUO plans to start mass production of FED panels in the fourth quarter of 2011, however AUO commented that the technology is still in the research stage and there are no plans to begin mass production at this moment.

The novel depicts Harry as an ordinary working man of the Depression Era, forced by dire economic forces into the black-market activity of running contraband between Cuba and Florida. A wealthy fishing charter customer (one of the \\"Have's\\") bilks Harry by slipping away without paying after a three-week fishing trip, leaving Harry destitute. Stuck in Havana and motivated by the need to support his family, Harry then himself turns to crime. He makes a fateful decision to swindle would-be Chinese immigrants seeking passage into Florida from Cuba. Instead of transporting them as agreed, he murders the Chinese middle-man and puts the men ashore in Cuba. Harry begins to ferry different types of illegal cargo between the two countries, including alcohol and Cuban revolutionaries. These events alternate with chapters that describe the dissolute lives of wealthy yacht owners. The Great Depression features prominently in the novel, forcing depravity and hunger on the poor residents of Key West (the \\"Have Not's\\") who are referred to locally as \\"Conchs\\". The racism of the era runs through the novel in the language used by Harry and the other white Americans towards other races. To Have and Have Not was Hemingway's second novel set in the United States, after The Torrents of Spring. Written sporadically between 1935 and 1937, and revised as he traveled back and forth from Spain during the Spanish Civil War, To Have and Have Not portrays Key West and Cuba in the 1930s, and provides a social commentary on that time and place. Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers describes the novel as heavily influenced by the Marxist ideology Hemingway was exposed to by his support of the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War while he was writing it. The work got a mixed critical reception. The novel had its origins in two short stories published earlier in periodicals by Hemingway (\\"One Trip Across\\" and \\"The Tradesman's Return\\") which make up the opening chapters, and a novella, written later, which makes up about two-thirds of the book. The narrative is told from multiple viewpoints, at different times, by different characters, and the characters' names are frequently supplied under the chapter headings to indicate who is narrating that chapter. Background and publication history To Have and Have Not began as a short story‚Äîpublished as \\"One Trip Across\\" in Cosmopolitan in 1934‚Äîintroducing the character Harry Morgan. A second story was written and published in Esquire in 1936, at which point Hemingway decided to write a novel about Harry Morgan. However, the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War delayed his work on it. To Have and Have Not was published by Scribner's on 15 October 1937 to a first edition print-run of approximately 10,000 copies.Oliver, p. 327 Cosmopolitan Magazine published a section of the novel as \\"One Trip Across\\" in 1934; Esquire Magazine published a section as \\"The Tradesman's Return\\" in 1936. It was also published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII.  Film adaptations  The novel was adapted into a 1944 film, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The film, directed by Howard Hawks, changed the story's setting from Key West to Martinique under the Vichy regime, and made significant alterations to the plot, including removing themes involving economic inequality and class conflict, and turning the story into a romantic thriller centering on the sparks going on between Harry Morgan and Marie Browning. It was one of the influences for Bold Venture, a 1951‚Äì1952 syndicated radio series starring Bogart and Bacall. The second film version, titled The Breaking Point (1950), was directed by Michael Curtiz and stars John Garfield and Patricia Neal with Juano Hernandez as Morgan's partner. The movie shifted the action to southern California and made Garfield a former PT Boat captain but is otherwise the most faithful to the original book. The third film version, titled The Gun Runners (1958), was directed by Don Siegel and stars Audie Murphy in the Bogart/Garfield role and Everett Sloane in Walter Brennan's part as the alcoholic sidekick, although Sloane's interpretation was less overtly comedic than Brennan's. The movie features a bravura performance by Eddie Albert as a charismatic villain. Pauline Kael and Bosley Crowther have claimed that the ending was used for John Huston's film Key Largo (1948); Kael also said that \\"One Trip Across\\" was made into The Gun Runners (1958). In 1987 the Iranian director Nasser Taghvai adapted the novel into a nationalized version called Captain Khorshid which took the events from Cuba to the shores of the Persian Gulf.

( ) is a chain of pharmacy and convenience stores owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance. They are primarily located in New York City, known for its high volume small store layouts in densely populated Manhattan locations. In 2012 the company headquarters was moved to 40 Wall Street in Lower Manhattan, the location of its newest flagship store. History Founded in 1960, the chain was started with three stores by Abraham, Eli, and Jack Cohen, with a warehouse located between Duane Street and Reade Street on Broadway in Lower Manhattan.Mount, Ian (2005-05-29) \\"The Mystery of Duane Reade\\". nymag.com.

The streets themselves were named after early American politicians James Duane (1733-1797) and Joseph Reade (1694-1771).Pickman, Sarah (2006-09-28) \\"\\". Archaeology. Retrieved June 17, 2013. The Cohen family sold Duane Reade to Bain Capital in 1992 \\"for a reported $239 million\\". Bain Capital in 1997 then sold majority ownership of the chain to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Duane Reade completed its initial public offering (IPO) on February 10, 1998, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DRD. On August 2, 2004, the company announced it was acquired by Oak Hill Capital Partners and was again a private company. Gary Charboneau, the company's senior vice- president of sales and marketing since 1993, explained his store layout strategy in New York magazine in 2005. He designed each store using four sections: one for beauty and cosmetic products, another that serves as a pharmacy, a third section for seasonal products such as cards and candy, and a fourth for household and grocery items. Cosmetic items were placed near store entrances, pharmacy sections were moved to the rear of stores since‚Äîaccording to Charboneau‚Äî\\"people don‚Äôt browse for prescriptions\\", and the other two sections occupied remaining space. As Ian Mount wrote in the magazine article, \\"half of Duane Reade‚Äôs sales come from food, cosmetics, and the like.\\" Under CEO Anthony Cuti, who was previously president of Pathmark, the store expanded from 59 stores in 1996 to 249 stores in May 2005, with more stores in New York City than any other drugstore chain. In September 1998, Duane Reade acquired Rock Bottom Stores Inc, another drug retail chain with 38 retail stores, for $30 million plus an additional $31 million for the stores inventories. While sales for Duane Reade rose from $1.14 billion in the 2001 fiscal year to $1.38 billion in 2003, the combined impact of union disputes, a local recession, and the destruction of their best-performing store in the September 11 attacks forced the company to slow its expansion from 30 new stores a year in 2001 and 2002 to no more than 17 a year in 2003 and 2004. Despite its expansion, the company had long-term debts of $405 million by October 2008, losing $33.1 million in the first half of that year. Almost all of its stores are located in New York City or the immediate suburbs. On April 19, 2006, it was announced that after nearly 5 years, Duane Reade agreed to settle with Disabled In Action to make all of its stores ADA-compliant. According to the New York Daily News, Duane Reade estimated it would take two years to inspect and revamp its stores for wheelchair access. In November 2008, Duane Reade began rolling out a new logo. In April 2009, Duane Reade hired DeVito/Verdi as its lead advertising agency.Ad week, \\"DeVito/Verdi Takes Duane Reade\\", April 7, 2000, retrieved June 17, 2009 On April 9, 2010, Duane Reade was acquired by the Walgreen Company for $1.075 billion consisting of $618 million in cash and $427 million of assumed debt.

Litigation and disputes Duane Reade and its executives have been involved in various disputes with federal and local governments and labor unions over its business practices. Two unions and Duane Reade Inc. struck a deal on April 11, 2006, to close a five-year contract dispute. The three-year deal covers \\"all of Duane Reade's clerks, cashiers, pharmacy clerks, pharmacy technicians, and photo technicians\\", and it closes a dispute dating from September 2001, when their previous contract expired. As part of the deal, Duane Reade and the unions settled all outstanding union and company claims before the National Labor Relations Board. In November 1997, the company settled charges that it sold drugs and other products in its New Jersey stores that were expired or overpriced. It agreed to pay a total of $200,000 in civil penalties, investigative costs, and fees, and to comply with the state's laws and regulations, but did not admit wrongdoing. Its embattled CEO Anthony Cuti, along with former CFO William Tennant, were indicted on October 9, 2008, in Manhattan federal court for falsely reporting company income and conspiring to commit securities fraud from December 2000 to June 2005. Cuti had already been replaced in November 2005 by industry veteran Richard Dreiling, COO of San Francisco-area-based Longs Drugs stores. In June 2010, Cuti and Tennant were convicted of securities fraud occurring between November 2000 and June 2005. They faced up to 20 years in prison.

Rider Haggard's 1885 novel King Solomon's Mines and its sequels. Allan Quatermain was also the title of a book in this sequence. An English professional big game hunter and adventurer, in film and television he has been portrayed by Richard Chamberlain, Sean Connery, Cedric Hardwicke, Patrick Swayze and Stewart Granger among others.  History  Allan Quatermain, having waited until the last minute, orders his men to fire in this illustration by Thure de Thulstrup from Maiwa's Revenge (1888) The character Quatermain is an English-born professional big game hunter and occasional trader in southern Africa, who supports colonial efforts to 'spread civilization' in the 'dark continent', though he also favours native Africans having a say in their affairs. An outdoorsman who finds English cities and climate unbearable, he prefers to spend most of his life in Africa, where he grew up under the care of his widower father, a Christian missionary. In the earliest-written novels, native Africans refer to Quatermain as Macumazahn, meaning \\"Watcher-by-Night,\\" a reference to his nocturnal habits and keen instincts. In later-written novels, Macumazahn is said to be a short form of Macumazana, meaning \\"One who stands out.\\" Quatermain is frequently accompanied by his native servant, the Hottentot Hans, a wise and caring family retainer from his youth. His sarcastic comments offer a sharp critique of European conventions. In his final adventures, Quatermain is joined by two British companions, Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good of the Royal Navy, and by his African friend Umslopogaas. = Appearance and character = The series spans 50 years of Quatermain's life, from 18 to 68; at the start of the foundation novel King Solomon's Mines he has just turned 55, giving him a birthdate of 1830. Physically, he is small, wiry, and unattractive, with a beard and short hair that sticks up. His one skill is his marksmanship, where he has no equal. Quatermain is aware that as a professional hunter, he has helped to destroy his beloved wild free places of Africa. In old age he hunts without pleasure, having no other means of making a living. About Quatermain's family, little is written. He lives at Durban, in Natal, South Africa. He marries twice, but is quickly widowed both times. He entrusts the printing of memoirs in the series to his son Harry, whose death he mourns in the opening of the novel Allan Quatermain. Harry Quatermain is a medical student who dies of smallpox while working in a hospital. Haggard did not write the Quatermain novels in chronological order, and made errors with some details. Quatermain's birth, age at the time of his marriages, and age at the time of his death cannot be reconciled to the apparent date of Harry's birth and age at death.  Series  Although some of Haggard's Quatermain novels stand alone, there are two important series. In the Zulu trilogy, Marie (1912), Child of Storm (1913), and Finished (1917), Quatermain becomes ensnared in the vengeance of Zikali, the dwarf wizard known as \\"The-thing-that-should-never-have-been-born\\" and \\"Opener-of-Roads.\\" Zikali plots and finally achieves the overthrow of the Zulu royal House of Senzangakona, founded by Shaka and ending under Cetewayo (Cetshwayo kaMpande) (Haggard's questionable spelling of Zulu names is used in the first instance). These novels are prequels to the foundation pair, King Solomon's Mines (1885) and Allan Quatermain (1887), which describe Quatermain's discovery of vast wealth, his discontent with a life of ease, and his fatal return to Africa following the death of his son Harry. With She and Allan (1920), Haggard engineered a crossover between his two most popular series, uniting Quatermain with Ayesha, the central character of his hugely successful \\"She\\" novels, and bringing in several other key characters from each series‚ÄîHans, Umslopogaas, and Zikali from the Quatermain series, and Bilali, Ayesha's faithful minister. This book formed the third part of the \\"She\\" trilogy, although in chronological terms, it necessarily served as a prequel to the first two \\"She\\" books, since Holly and Leo, the protagonists of the first two books, both die at the end of the second novel.  Chronology of Haggard's Allan Quatermain, Ayesha, and Umslopogaas novels and short stories  Dates of events in Allan Quatermain's life and Ayesha's, are shown at left. Dates of publication in book form are shown at right.From J. E. Scott, \\"A Note Concerning the Late Mr Allan Quatermain\\", in A Bibliography of the Works of Sir Henry Haggard 1856‚Äì1925, London: Elkin Mathews Ltd, 1947. The four Ayesha novels are marked (*). Allan Quatermain and Umslopogaas appears only in She and Allan (1921), third-published of the four, and second in the fictional Ayesha chronology. The three Umslopogaas novels are marked (**). Ayesha appears only in She and Allan (1921), the third-published of the three, and second in the fictional Umslopogaas chronology, along with Allan Quatermain, who also appears in the 1887 novel Allan Quatermain, which marks the last chronological appearance of the iconic character created by Haggard, which is chronologically followed by Ayesha: The Return of She (1905).

The character was used by writer Alan Moore and artist Kevin O'Neill in their series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, adapted to film in 2003, based on the premise that he faked his death to enjoy a quiet retirement. One of the Sherlock Holmes pastiches of James Lovegrove, The Devil's Dust (2018), features both Holmes and Quatermain. In 2005, the first Allan Quatermain pastiche novel‚Äîwhich also features Sherlock Holmes‚ÄîThe Great Detective at the Crucible of Life by Thomas Kent Miller, was published by Wildside Press.Miller, Thomas Kent The Great Detective at the Crucible of Life. Wildside Press 2005Drew, Bernard A. Literary Afterlife: The Posthumous Continuations of 325 Authors‚Äô Fictional Characters, McFarland 2010, p. 10 This novel is notable because it was the first prose fiction with Allan Quatermain as the protagonist to be published in 78 years since H. Rider Haggard's own Allan and the Ice-gods was published posthumously in 1927.  * * = Film and television incarnations = The character of Allan Quatermain has been portrayed in film and television by Richard Chamberlain, John Colicos, Sean Connery, Cedric Hardwicke, and Patrick Swayze. Stewart Granger also played Quatermain in the 1950 Hollywood film adaptation of King Solomon's Mines, which was directed by Compton Bennett. Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold is a film released in 1987 which is freely adapted from the plot of Haggard's 1887 novel. He was also featured in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, released in 2003 (portrayed by Connery), where he served as the team leader and a mentor and father-figure to American Secret Service agent Tom Sawyer, and the 2008 direct-to-DVD Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls. In 2010, it was announced that Sam Worthington would portray the character in an upcoming sci-fi adaptation of King Solomon's Mines.  Influences  The real-life adventures of Frederick Selous, the British big game hunter and explorer of Colonial Africa, inspired Haggard to create the Allan Quatermain character. Haggard was also heavily influenced by other larger-than-life adventurers whom he later met in Africa, most notably American Scout Frederick Russell Burnham. He was further influenced by South Africa's vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost civilizations being uncovered in Africa, such as Great Zimbabwe. The similarities are striking between Haggard's close friend Burnham and his Quatermain character: both were small and wiry Victorian adventurers in colonial Africa; both sought and discovered ancient treasures and civilizations; both battled large wild animals and native peoples; both were renowned for their ability to track, even at night; and both men had similar nicknames (Quatermain, \\"Watcher-by-Night\\"; Burnham, \\"He-who-sees-in-the- dark\\"). The beliefs and views of the fictional Quatermain are those of Haggard himself, and beliefs that were common among the 19th-century European colonists. These include conventional Victorian ideas concerning the superiority of the white race; an admiration for \\"warrior races,\\" such as the Zulu; a disdain for natives corrupted by white influences; and a general contempt for Afrikaners (Boers). But in other ways Haggard's views were advanced for his times. The first chapter of King Solomon's Mines contains an express denunciation of the use of the pejorative term \\"nigger.\\" Quatermain frequently encounters natives who are more brave and wise than Europeans, and women (black and white) who are smarter and emotionally stronger than men (though not necessarily as good; cf. the title character of \\"She\\"). Through the Quatermain novels and his other works, Haggard also expresses his own mysticism and interest in non-Christian concepts, particularly karma and reincarnation, though he expresses these concepts in such a way as to be compatible with the Christian faith.  Influenced  Quatermain was one of the templates for the American film character Indiana Jones. The route to King Solomon's Mines described by Haggard was also referred to in the movie The Librarian: Return to King Solomon's Mines, specifically the reference to Sheba's Breasts and Three Witches Mountain, which are geographical features mentioned by Quatermain in the novel. In the Graham Greene novel The Heart of the Matter (1948), the main character Scobie remembers Allan Quatermain as his childhood hero.  Publications  = Books written by H.

At the time its name was Dalian Marine College, and it was the only maritime college in China. In 1960, DMU was designated a national key institution of higher education. Later in 1983, the Asia-Pacific Region Maritime Training Center was established at DMU by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the IMO, and in 1985, a branch of the World Maritime University (WMU) was established. In 1994 the university's name was changed to the present one. In 1998 it was the first maritime university in China to receive the ISO 9001 Certificate. In 2004, the university successfully passed the quality assessment of undergraduate teaching by the Ministry of Education. Former Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin once wrote a few words of encouragement for DMU: ‚ÄúBe steadfast, rigorous, industrious, and pioneering in order to build the University into one of the preeminent maritime universities in the world‚Äù. Through continual development, DMU has been at the forefront of similar universities both in broadening the scope and in enhancing the level of its programs. On June 6, 2009, DMU celebrated its centennial, with vice chairman of standing committee of 11th National People's Congress Chen Zhili as the main guest.

Access Tourist train to Tavira island Access to the island is by ferry or water taxi from Quatro √Åguas, southeast of Tavira, and also by a small floating bridge in the Santa Luzia/Pedras d'El Rei area, followed by a small train trip (operating during the summer months) or by foot in a footpath parallel to the railway line (c. 2 km). History Graveyard of Anchors on Tavira island The island was home to a thriving tuna industry using the old Phoenician technique called Almadrava, between 1841 and 1967, on Barril beach around 80 families lived. During the 1960's the numbers of Tuna declined and the migration patterns changed and fishing for tuna was abandoned as well as the canning factories in the area. Sometime after 1966 the anchors used in the Almadrava technique were lined up on the island as a monument to the old tuna fishing industry. A Train was used to transport the large Tuna's to the mainland from the island which has been converted to transport tourists. The old fisherman's houses are now used as shops and restaurants.

It was published in three volumes containing eight books in 2003 and 2004. The story follows the adventures of a sizable cast of characters living amidst some of the central events of the late 17th and early 18th centuries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Central America. Despite featuring a literary treatment consistent with historical fiction, Stephenson has characterized the work as science fiction, because of the presence of some anomalous occurrences and the work's particular emphasis on themes relating to science and technology. The sciences of cryptology and numismatics feature heavily in the series, as they do in some of Stephenson's other works. Books The Baroque Cycle consists of several novels \\"lumped together into three volumes because it is more convenient from a publishing standpoint\\"; Stephenson felt calling the works a trilogy would be \\"bogus\\".Stephenson comment on MetaWeb Appearing in print in 2003 and 2004, the cycle contains eight books originally published in three volumes: * Quicksilver, Vol. I of the Baroque Cycle ‚Äì Arthur C. Clarke Award winner, Locus Award nominee, 2004 ** Book 1 ‚Äì Quicksilver ** Book 2 ‚Äì King of the Vagabonds ** Book 3 ‚Äì Odalisque * The Confusion, Vol. II of the Baroque Cycle ‚Äì Locus Award winner ** Book 4 ‚Äì Bonanza ** Book 5 ‚Äì The Juncto * The System of the World, Vol. III of the Baroque Cycle ‚Äì Locus Award winner, Arthur C. Clarke Award nominee, 2005 ** Book 6 ‚Äì Solomon's Gold ** Book 7 ‚Äì Currency ** Book 8 ‚Äì The System of the World Setting The books travel throughout early modern Europe between the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy and the beginning of the 18th century. Though most of the focus is in Europe, the adventures of one character, Jack Shaftoe, do take him throughout the world, and the fledgling British colonies in North America are important to another (Daniel Waterhouse). Quicksilver takes place mainly in the years between the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in England (1660) and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Confusion follows Quicksilver without temporal interruption, but ranges geographically from Europe and the Mediterranean through India to the Philippines, Japan and Mexico. The System of the World takes place principally in London in 1714, about ten years after the events of The Confusion. Themes A central theme in the series is Europe's transformation away from feudal rule and control toward the rational, scientific, and more merit-based systems of government, finance, and social development that define what is now considered \\"western\\" and \\"modern\\". Characters include Sir Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, William of Orange, Louis XIV of France, Oliver Cromwell, Peter the Great, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and many other people of note of that time. The fictional characters of Eliza, Jack and Daniel collectively cause real historic effects. The books feature considerable sections concerning alchemy. The principal alchemist of the tale is the mysterious Enoch Root, who, along with the descendants of several characters in this series, is also featured in the Stephenson novels Cryptonomicon and Fall. Inspiration Stephenson was inspired to write The Baroque Cycle when, while working on Cryptonomicon, he encountered a statement by George Dyson in \\"Darwin among the Machines\\" that suggests Leibniz was \\"arguably the founder of symbolic logic and he worked with computing machines\\".Stephenson, Neal. \\"How the Baroque Cycle Began\\" in P.S. of Quicksilver Perennial ed. 2004. He also had heard considerable discussion of the Leibniz‚ÄìNewton calculus controversy and Newton's work at the treasury during the last 30 years of his life, and in particular the case against Leibniz as summed up in the Commercium Epistolicum of 1712 was a huge inspiration which went on to inform the project. He found \\"this information striking when [he] was already working on a book about money and a book about computers\\". Further research into the period excited Stephenson and he embarked on writing the historical piece that became The Baroque Cycle.

Bernard Cohen (1 March 1914 ‚Äì 20 June 2003) was the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the history of science at Harvard University and the author of many books on the history of science and, in particular, Isaac Newton. Cohen was the first American to receive a PhD in history of science, was a Harvard undergraduate ('37) and then a PhD student and prot√©g√© of George Sarton who was the founder of Isis and the History of Science Society. Cohen taught at Harvard from 1942 until his death, and his tenure was marked by the development of Harvard's program in the history of science. He went on to succeed Sarton as editor of Isis (1952-1958) and, later, president of the Society (1961-1962); he was also a president of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science. Cohen was an internationally recognized Newton scholar; his interests were encyclopedic, ranging from science and public policy to the history of computers, with several decades as a special consultant for history of computing with IBM. Among his hundreds of publications were such major books as Franklin and Newton (1956), The Birth of a New Physics (1959), The Newtonian Revolution (1980), Revolution in Science (1985), Science and the Founding Fathers (1995), Howard Aiken: Portrait of a Computer Pioneer (1999), and his last book, The Triumph of Numbers (2005), not to mention two jointly authored contributions, the variorum edition and new English translation of Newton's Principia. Cohen's April 1955 interview with Albert Einstein was the last Einstein gave before his death, in that same month. It was published that July in Scientific American, which also published Cohen's 1984 essay on Florence Nightingale. In 1974 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. Many consider Cohen's most important work to be his 1999 translation, with the late Anne Whitman, of Newton's Principia. This 974-page work took Cohen over 15 years to fully translate. Cohen supervised the doctoral dissertations of Lorraine Daston, Judith Grabiner, Kenneth Manning, Uta Merzbach, and Joan L. Richards. Among Cohen's other students (and prot√©g√©s) were the Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hosein Nasr, Tufts University professor George E. Smith, Bucknell University professor Martha Verbrugge, Allen G.

Sheng Jing Hospital is famous for gynaecology and obstetrics. History The China Medical University (CMU) was the first medical school established by the Chinese Communist Party. Its precursor was the Chinese Workers‚Äô-Peasants‚Äô Red Army Military Medical School and Chinese Workers‚Äô-Peasants‚Äô Red Army Health School which had been founded in Ruijin city, Jiangxi province, in 1931. After the Long March with the Red Army, it was relocated to Shanbei. In 1940 comrade Mao Zedong proposed, and the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party approved, the name of the school being changed to China Medical University. In July 1946 the university was ordered to enter northeast China with the army and reached Xinshan city (now Hegang city), Heilongjiang province. In November 1948 the whole northeast of China was liberated and the university was ordered to move to Shenyang. In 1948 and 1949 it absorbed the medical school formerly operated by the (Japanese) South Manchuria Railway (the South Manchuria Medical College, later called the Shenyang Medical College which had opened in 1911) and the Mukden Medical College (sometimes spelled Moukden Medical College) whose origins go back to 1892 when Dr Dugald Christie founded the Shenjing Medical School. In 1911/1912 this became a formal medical college, the Mukden Medical College.

Established in 1951 the university is primarily responsible for educating teachers to teach in high schools around the province, though non-teacher training courses are offered. History Liaoning Normal University was established in August 1951, as part of the newly founded People‚Äôs Republic of China‚Äôs drive to reform the teacher training system. Under the new shifan () system certain institutions of further and higher education were established with the role of training future teachers. Financial incentives (such as tuition waivers, stipends and fellowships) were offered to encourage students to study at these institutions. The normal universities comprised the highest point of this reformed system and were the only institutions from which senior high school teachers could graduate. Liaoning Normal University was one of two normal universities (along with Shenyang Normal University, founded the same year) in Liaoning province. Present Liaoning Normal University remains the provincial centre for teacher training in Liaoning. The university comprises 10 colleges, divided into 25 departments, offering 39 programmes for those studying for a bachelor's degree, 36 for those studying for a master's degree and 2 for doctoral candidates. The Chinese government's recent move away from the shifan system had brought significant changes to the university. With more and more teachers are being recruited from regular universities, Liaoning Normal University (as with most normal universities) has expanded to offer a number of non-education-specific courses and to increase its focus on research. LNU now boasts, amongst others, a Ministry of Education sponsored Research Institute of Basic Education, an Ocean Economics and Sustainable Development Center and a center for researching the works of Sun Zi. Research originating from the university has resulted in 74 Science and Technology Progress Awards, 18 patents, and 190 contracts for technology or service transfer. Liaoning Normal University The move away from a narrow focus on education teaching has also resulted in an increased emphasis on business- related subjects, in part through a partnership with Missouri State University who maintain a branch campus within the university's main campus. Another avenue LNU has pursued is language teaching and testing -- foreign languages for Chinese students (the university hosts an International Japanese Language Testing Center and an IELTS Testing Center and established a course training provincial government officials wishing to study at the University of Ulster) and the teaching of Chinese to overseas students (currently 338 students are enrolled on Chinese language courses). Education remains, however, the focus, with a large education department and the maintenance of an affiliated high school for the purposes of teacher practice. This focus is reflected in the university's stated aim of its 10-year plan which is \\"to become the province's largest center for teacher education and serve as a role model for other schools.\\" Campus Liaoning Normal University is on one campus, on Huang He Road (), in the west of Dalian. The campus, which is divided into southern and northern sections by the road, occupies 116 areas, with 350,000 square meters of building space. The university's libraries hold 1.33 million volumes. =Missouri State University China Campus= LNU-MSU College of International Business The Missouri State University College of International Business China Campus is located inside the Liaoning Normal University campus.

The missionaries were killed in the Boxer Rebellion during the summer of 1900, but Kung was sheltered by his family and survived. A few years later, now a young man, Kung was invited to continue his studies at Oberlin College. After graduating from Oberlin, he obtained his master's degree at Yale and then returned to China. In 1907 Kung founded Ming Hsien high school in his hometown of Taigu. (\\"Ming Hsien\\" means \\"remember the worthy\\" and was named in honor of his Oberlin missionary friends.) Beginning in 1908, Oberlin began sending recent graduates to teach at Ming Hsien and support Kung's efforts under the auspices of the Oberlin-Shansi Memorial Association. In 1950, following the Communist victory in the civil war, Ming Hsien was taken over by the party, turned into a university, and renamed \\"Shansi Agricultural University.\\" The American teachers from Oberlin were expelled and did not return until 1982, following China's \\"reform and opening.\\" Academics Primarily an agricultural university (one of the few remaining Chinese agricultural universities in a farming area), the school also has departments in the arts, physical education and English language study. The university maintains connections with Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, a non-profit organization operating out of Oberlin College, engaging in cross-cultural and education exchange programs. Each year, the university hosts young English teachers who have recently graduated from Oberlin College.

Founded in 1842, it ranks as Iowa's first co-educational institution of higher learning and the oldest of its type west of the Mississippi River. The university is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. Two campus buildings, Old Main and the Harlan-Lincoln House, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The latter, the former summer home of Robert Todd Lincoln, is now a museum featuring various artifacts from the Harlan and Lincoln families. History In 1841 a group of Methodist settlers in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, met and began lobbying the Iowa territorial legislature to establish an institute of higher learning in their burgeoning community. On February 17, 1842, the legislature granted a charter for the Mount Pleasant Literary Institute, soon to be renamed as Mount Pleasant Collegiate Institute. Despite the charter, organization and fund raising were slow going at first. Twenty acres of land was donated for the campus by four Mount Pleasant residents in March 1843. That same month, organizing officials hired Reverend Artistides J. Heustis as the institution's first president. From February 1855, the school was known as Iowa Wesleyan University, honoring John Wesley, the founder of Methodism The institution's name was modified to Iowa Wesleyan College in 1912, reflecting its contemporary status as a four-year baccalaureate degree institution of higher learning. On August 10, 2015, Iowa Wesleyan officially adopted its new name: Iowa Wesleyan University, reflecting its broad educational opportunities and its roots as one of the oldest four-year co-educational church-related universities west of the Mississippi River.

During the Fortieth Anniversary of the founding of the University in 1997, it was again renamed as Taoli Hu (in Chinese, Ê°ÉÊùé Taoli means intellectual; while in Mongolian, Toli means mirror). Its water surface is 13,000 square meters. Characteristics At nearly all colleges, a few courses taught in both Chinese and Mongolian are provided. Bachelor, Master and Doctoral degrees in a few majors are awarded by studying in Mongolian ‚Äì some courses in the Chinese language are always mandatory. In recent years, the University has also made efforts to provide courses taught in English, Japanese and Russian.

Being awarded the national key comprehensive university by the Ministry of Education of China in 1978, it was listed as one of 100 universities of the \\"211 Project\\" universities for key construction and development in 1997. Organization As most Chinese universities with strong Chinese characteristics, Inner Mongolia University includes a huge, bloated administrative system, besides its teaching and research system. There are even some enterprises operated under the umbrella of this university. Teaching units at this University were originally called \\"department\\". At the end of the 1990s, almost all of them were renamed \\"schools\\" (in the sense similar to, e.g., law school), under which several departments were covered. However, currently on the University website, they are translated as \\"colleges\\" in English. It is yet unclear whether these colleges are still equivalent to schools, or are enlarged based on those schools. Furthermore, this will not become clearer in the near future. * Administrative System: Party and Executive Affairs Office, Regulation Inspecting Committee(including Supervisory and Audit Office), Organization Department, Propaganda Department, Office Managing retired Staff, Personnel Department, Teaching Affairs Department, Research Affairs Department, Finance Department, Service Department, Public Security, Youth League committee(Students' Affairs Office), Staff Union. * Teaching System: Academy of Mongolian studies, College of Humanities, College of Foreign Languages, College of Economics and Management, College of Law, College of Science and Technology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, College of Life Sciences, College of Computer Science and Technology, College for Continuing Education, College of International Education, Postgraduate College, College of Arts, College for Professional Training, College of Public Policy and Management, Department of Physical Teaching. * Research System: Research of Mongolian Language, Research of Mongolian History, Research of Modern and Contemporary History, Research on Neighboring Countries, Research of Mongolian Culture, Center of Mongolology, Center of Economic and Social Development, Institute of High Polymer Science, Center for Laboratory Animal Science, Center of Biological Engineering, Research of Natural Resources. * Affiliations: Inner Mongolia University Library, Inner Mongolia University Journal, Inner Mongolia University Press. * Enterprises: Aodu Group cooperation, Xuri Biological High Tech Co.

He is also the leader of the unregistered neo-Nazi Nationalist Party of Canada and a perennial candidate for mayor of Toronto, Ontario. Early years Zlomisliƒá was born to Croat parents in the region of Vojvodina during World War II. His father was killed by the Nazis while fighting with the Yugoslav Partisans against the German occupation of Yugoslavia in late 1944. His mother, Rose, was shipped to Germany in 1943 to work as a slave labourer for the Nazis and Vilim was placed in an orphanage. In 1945, Rose was told that her son had been killed in an air raid. After the war, she met and married Frederick Andrews, a Canadian working for a United Nations agency in a German displaced persons' camp. The couple moved to Toronto.\\"PORTRAIT OF A RACIST\\" by Arthur Johnson, Globe and Mail, October 1, 1979 Vilim remained at the orphanage and was a member of the Communist Young Pioneers in the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He suffered an accident during a camping trip and a botched operation on his leg left him limping and permanently disabled. His mother continued to search for him after the war through the assistance of the Red Cross, which located Vilim in 1952 and brought him to Canada where he was re-united with his mother and re-named Donald Clarke Andrews. In Canada, Andrews developed a strong antipathy toward communism, which he blamed for his physical disability. After graduating from high school he began reading far-right tracts by the John Birch Society and George Lincoln Rockwell and adopted far-right and ultimately fascist ideas. Education and work Andrews was educated at R. H. King Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario and subsequently took a public health inspection course at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute and earned his qualifications in 1964. He worked as a public health inspector in Scarborough in the 1970s. More recently, he has derived his income by being a landlord.\\"Facing off with hate \\", The Ryersonian, March 21, 2007 Racist activity =Edmund Burke Society= In the 1960s, Andrews was drawn to far right racist groups and cofounded the Edmund Burke Society with Paul Fromm and Leigh Smith in 1967. =Western Guard= Andrews became the primary leader of the group and transformed it into the openly racist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist Western Guard in 1972. Paul Fromm split with Andrews shortly after the Western Guard was formed in 1972. Andrews was the first person in Canada charged with wilfully promoting hatred, and in 1975 he was charged with offences ranging from plotting arson, possession of weapons and explosives, and mischief, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail. Along with the Western Guard he also plotted to bomb a visiting Israeli soccer team, although he was never charged for this. Consequently, the leadership of the Western Guard fell to John Ross Taylor in 1976. =Nationalist Party= Don Andrews has run for Mayor of Toronto several times, most recently in 2014, when he came in seventh place with 0.10% of the vote. In the 1974 election, Andrews placed a distant second in the mayoralty race as no serious candidate ran against popular incumbent, David Crombie. As a result, the municipal law was changed so that the runner-up in the mayoralty contest no longer had the right to succeed to the mayor's chair should the position become vacant between elections. Andrews has only run on occasions when his name appears first on the ballot. He sat out the 2000 municipal election in which fringe candidate Enza \\"Supermodel\\" Anderson was a candidate. As of 1994, Andrews' organization had launched a campaign to celebrate \\"European Heritage Day,\\" but when it was realized that the event was spearheaded by a neo-Nazi organization, the various cities approached rejected it or revoked their original decision. In 1998, Andrews tried a new tactic by attempting to get a European heritage week declared in London, Ontario. When it was recognized as a neo-Nazi attempt, an emergency vote was held by the municipal government, and the week was cancelled. =Dominica invasion attempt= In what became known as Operation Red Dog, Ku Klux Klan leaders Wolfgang Droege and Don Black, as well as Patrick John, the former Prime Minister of Dominica, conspired to overthrow the government of Dominican Prime Minister Eugenia Charles. The invasion was meant to restore John to power and to transform the island into a white supremacist nation. John was forced to resign in 1979 after a popular uprising against his Administration. The plan was to charter a boat to Dominica and rendezvous via rubber boats with John and his makeshift army, made up of remnants of the Dominica Defence Force. The genesis of the idea came from long-time Klan member Mike Purdue, who was introduced in 1979 to Droege through David Duke. Duke initially involved Don Andrews but after Purdue changed the target island to Dominica, Andrews bailed out. Andrews however put Purdue in contact with Klansmen Arnie Polli and Roger Dermee who were paid US$3,000 to visit Dominica to obtain preliminary reconnaissance. Andrews also put Purdue in contact with Charles Yanover, who was a well-known organized crime figure. Yanover who was ecstatic with the idea, provided Purdue with a $10,000 advance. In return for the investment, Yanover was given the right to set up a gunrunning operation to smuggle weapons into South Africa and Central America.

Etymology The name first developed as a diminutive of Elizabeth in the 16th century and its use as an independent name started in the 18th century. The name Elizabeth has been around since the Middle Ages, mainly popularised by the French (using the spelling Elisabeth). Elizabeth with a ‚Äúz‚Äù is the typical spelling in English. Elizabeth is found in the Bible (Luke 1:57) as the mother of John the Baptist. Elizabeth became popularised during the late medieval period as a given name, mostly influenced by two saints ‚Äì St. Elizabeth of Hungary and St. Elizabeth of Portugal. It was brought to England by the French and the English can be credited with the formation of Eliza as a hypocorism (the French use √âlise).

The aim of the language, as expressed by John Chambers, is \\"to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully\\". The modern implementation of S is R, a part of the GNU free software project. S-PLUS, a commercial product, was formerly sold by TIBCO Software. History =\\"Old S\\"= S is one of several statistical computing languages that were designed at Bell Laboratories, and first took form between 1975‚Äì1976. Up to that time, much of the statistical computing was done by directly calling Fortran subroutines; however, S was designed to offer an alternate and more interactive approach. Early design decisions that hold even today include interactive graphics devices (printers and character terminals at the time), and providing easily accessible documentation for the functions. The first working version of S was built in 1976, and operated on the GCOS operating system. At this time, S was unnamed, and suggestions included ISCS (Interactive SCS), SCS (Statistical Computing System), and SAS (Statistical Analysis System) (which was already taken: see SAS System). The name 'S' (used with single quotation marks until 1979) was chosen, as it was a common letter in the suggestions and consistent with other programming languages designed from the same institution at the time (namely the C programming language). When UNIX/32V was ported to the (then new) 32-bit DEC VAX, computing on the Unix platform became feasible for S. In late 1979, S was ported from GCOS to UNIX, which would become the new primary platform. In 1980 the first version of S was distributed outside Bell Laboratories and in 1981 source versions were made available. In 1984 two books were published by the research team at Bell Laboratories: S: An Interactive Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics (1984 Brown Book) and Extending the S System. Also, in 1984 the source code for S became licensed through AT&T; Software Sales for education and commercial purposes. =\\"New S\\"= By 1988, many changes were made to S and the syntax of the language. The New S Language (1988 Blue Book) was published to introduce the new features, such as the transition from macros to functions and how functions can be passed to other functions (such as \`apply\`). Many other changes to the S language were to extend the concept of \\"objects\\", and to make the syntax more consistent (and strict). However, many users found the transition to New S difficult, since their macros needed to be rewritten. Many other changes to S took hold, such as the use of X11 and PostScript graphics devices, rewriting many internal functions from Fortran to C, and the use of double precision (only) arithmetic. The New S language is very similar to that used in modern versions of S-PLUS and R. In 1991, Statistical Models in S (1991 White Book) was published, which introduced the use of formula-notation (which use the '\`~\`' operator), data frame objects, and modifications to the use of object methods and classes. =S4= The latest version of the S standard is S4, released in 1998. It provides advanced object-oriented features. S4 classes differ markedly from S3 classes; S4 formally defines the representation and inheritance for each class, and has multiple dispatch: the generic function can be dispatched to a method based on the class of any number of arguments, not just one.

Its Chinese name was shortened in July 2002 to \\"Beijing Language University\\" with the approval of the Ministry of Education, but the English name remained unchanged. September 6, 2002, witnessed the celebration of the 40th anniversary of BLCU, for which General-Secretary Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing wrote letters of congratulations, and the Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peng wrote words of encouragement. BLCU was granted the privilege to confer doctoral degrees in foreign languages and literature in 2011.

China University of Political Science and Law is a first tier institution within the national key university Project 211 and the Project 985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines as part of the national endeavor to build world-class universities. CUPL is a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University with the highest status \\"A+\\" in legal studies. It is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese universities in legal studies. It is also one of the most competitive and selective universities to enter in China. CUPL has two campuses, one in Haidian District which is the original campus of the university, and the other located in Changping District. The university's Haidian campus now hosts postgraduate students only while undergraduates study at a much larger campus in Changping District. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors. CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries. History MBA Ceremony at Haidian Campus Dormitory Mainbuilding of CUPL Haidian Campus CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its official name Peking College of Political Science and Law and combined departments of law, political science, sociology and other subjects of Peking University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University and Tsinghua University. The prestigious scholar Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng (), who was educated at Harvard University and regarded as the founder of modern political science in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of Cultural Revolution CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch'ien died of illness in 1990. In 1983, under the policy of Central People's Government to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State's Seventh Five-Year-Plan in 1985. Under the motto of \\"Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public\\"; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of Roman law in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 demanding democracy and rule of law. To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an American Bar Association- approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the Duquesne University School of Law. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with Fordham University School of Law. CUPL also maintains relationship with the University of Exeter and the University of Oxford in England, Deakin University in Australia, the University of Pennsylvania, Georgetown University, Washington University in St. Louis, the UIUC, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of California, Davis in the United States, the University of Montreal in Canada, National University of Singapore Faculty of Law in Singapore and Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman in Malaysia. Postgraduate programs CUPL also offers two LLM programs and a PhD program for international students in English. One of them is based in Changping and is with the China-EU University. This is an EU funded course, and its main focus is on educating Chinese students on EU law. There is another LLM program at Haidian campus, in downtown Beijing, which is aimed at International students to learn about Chinese law. There is also a PhD programs in English at Haidian campus. These are flexible and taught entirely in English. They include the option to study Mandarin, and gain law work experience in Beijing and other cities in China. These postgraduate programs are also open as a semester program to international students from any institution around the world who would like to study at CUPL for one semester. Chinese language programs There are Chinese language programs for international students.

UIR was established in 1949 by China's first Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai to train diplomats. It became one of the National Key Universities in 1960, and was among the earliest universities in China to offer master's degrees. In 1983, the school was transformed to a comprehensive university. It was the first foreign study schools in China to make such a transformation. Its former English name is translated as \\"Institute of International Relations.\\" It is also colloquially known as \\"Guoguan\\" (ÂõΩÂÖ≥ Gu√≥ G≈´an). History UIR Main Academic Building The University of International Relations was founded in 1949 to train foreign affairs cadres for the newly created People's Republic of China. In 1961, the school merged with the Foreign Affairs College. In 1964, then-Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the creation of colleges and university departments to focus on international affairs. Several government agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, established their own institutes for the study of international affairs. The University of International Relations in Beijing was formally brought under the control of the Ministry of Public Security in 1965, and was charged with training intelligence agents for the Investigation Department (a precursor to the Ministry of State Security) and for Xinhua News Agency. Like many schools in China, the University of International Relations was shuttered during China's Cultural Revolution and reopened in 1978. It was among the first institutions of higher education authorized by the Chinese government to offer academic degrees in China.

She is depicted here in a c. 1765 Nishiki-e by Komatsuken. is the title given to a collection of diary fragments written by the 11th-century Japanese Heian era lady-in-waiting and writer Murasaki Shikibu. It is written in kana, then a newly developed writing system for vernacular Japanese, more common among women, who were generally unschooled in Chinese. Unlike modern diaries or journals, 10th-century Heian diaries tend to emphasize important events more than ordinary day-to-day life and do not follow a strict chronological order. The work includes vignettes, waka poems, and an epistolary section written in the form of a long letter. The diary was probably written between 1008 and 1010 when Murasaki was in service at the imperial court. The largest portion details the birth of Empress Sh≈çshi's (Akiko) children. Shorter vignettes describe interactions among imperial ladies-in-waiting and other court writers, such as Izumi Shikibu, Akazome Emon and Sei Sh≈çnagon. Murasaki includes her observations and opinions throughout, bringing to the work a sense of life at the early 11th century Heian court, lacking in other literature or chronicles of the era. A Japanese picture scroll, the Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki was produced during the Kamakura period in the 13th century, and the fragments of the diary serve as the basis for three important translations to English in the 20th century.  Background  At the peak of the Heian period, from the late 10th to early 11th century, as Japan sought to establish a unique national culture of its own it saw the genesis of early Japanese classical literature, which to a large part emerged from women's court literature.Henshall (1999), 24‚Äì25Bowring (2005), xii Through the rise and use of kana, aristocratic women court writers formed a foundation for classical court literature, according to Haruo Shirane. Kokin Wakash≈´'s first imperial waka collection, published c. 905, set the foundation for court literature. Up to this point, Japanese literature was written in Chinese ‚Äì traditionally the language of men in the public sphere. It was in the literature of the imperial court that the gradual shift toward vernacular kana writing system was most evident, and where waka poetry became immensely popular. As Shirane explains: \\"Waka became integral to the everyday life of the aristocracy, functioning as a form of elevated dialogue and the primary means of communication between the sexes, who usually were physically segregated from each other.\\" By the early 11th century new genres of women's court literature were appearing in the form of diaries and poetic stories. Women, relegated to the private sphere, quickly embraced the use of kana, unlike men who still conducted business in Chinese.Shirane (2008), 114 Women's writing showed a marked difference from men's, more personal and introspective in nature. Thus written Japanese was developed by women who used the language as a form of self-expression and, as Japanese literature scholar Richard Bowring says, by women who undertook the process of building \\"a flexible written style out of a language that had only previously existed in a spoken form\\".Bowring (2005), xviii Murasaki Shikibu, depicted by Tosa Mitsuoki, from his illustrations of The Tale of Genji (17th century) Emperor Ichij≈ç's court, dominated by the powerful Fujiwara clan, was the seat of two rival imperial empresses, Teishi and Sh≈çshi, each with ladies-in-waiting who were proficient writers producing works honoring their mistresses and the Fujiwara clan.Shirane (2008), 115 The three most noteworthy Heian era diaries in the genre of Nikki Bungaku ‚Äì Murasaki's Murasaki Shikibu nikki, Sei Sh≈çnagon's The Pillow Book and Izumi Shikibu's (Izumi Shikibu Nikki) ‚Äì came from the empresses's courts.Shirane (2008), 113 Murasaki's diary covers a discrete period, most likely from 1008 to 1010. Only short and fragmentary pieces of the diary survive and its importance lies, in part, in the revelations about the author, about whom most of the known biographical facts come from it and from her c. 1014 short poetry collection, the Murasaki Shikibu sh≈´ (or Poetic Memoirs).Shirane (1987), 215 Murasaki's given name is unknown. Women were often identified by their rank or that of a husband or another close male relative. \\"Murasaki\\" was given to her at court, from a character in Tale of the Genji; \\"Shikibu\\" denotes her father's rank at the Ministry of Ceremonial (Shikibu-sh≈ç).Tyler, Royall. \\"Murasaki Shikibu: Brief Life of a Legendary Novelist: c. 973 ‚Äì c. 1014\\". (May, 2002) Harvard Magazine. Retrieved August 21, 2011 A member of a minor branch of the Fujiwara clan, her father was a scholar of Chinese literature who educated both his children in classical Chinese, although educating a female child was exceedingly uncommon. Around 998 Murasaki married Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 ‚Äì c. 1001);Bowring (2005), xxxv she gave birth to a daughter in 999. Two years later her husband died. Scholars are unsure when she started writing the novel (monogatari) The Tale of Genji but she was certainly writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: \\"I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion ... doing little more than registering the passage of time .... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable\\".qtd in Mulhern (1991), 84; Murasaki Shikibu (Bowring translation, 2005), 33 On the strength of her reputation as an author, Murasaki entered service with Sh≈çshi at court, almost certainly at the request of Sh≈çshi's father, Fujiwara no Michinaga,Shirane (2008), 293 perhaps as an incentive to continue adding chapters to The Tale of Genji.Rohlich (1984), 540 She began writing her diary after entering imperial service. Diary The diary consists of a number of vignettes containing lengthy description of Sh≈çshi's (known as Akiko)'s eldest son Prince Atsuhira's birth, and an epistolary section.Keene (1999b), 40‚Äì41 Set at the imperial court in Kyoto, it opens with these words: \\"As autumn advances, the Tsuchimikado mansion looks unutterably beautiful. Every branch on every tree by the lake and each tuft of grass on the banks of the stream takes on its own particular color, which is then intensified by the evening light.\\"Murasaki Shikibu (Bowring translation, 2005), 3 The 50th day celebration of the birth of Prince Atsuhira-shinn≈ç (later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç). Fujiwara no Michinaga is in the foreground offering mochi. The figure to his right might be Murasaki Shikibu, c. 13th century.\\"Detached segment of The Diary of Lady Murasaki, emaki\\". Emuseum.jp The opening vignettes are followed by short accounts of the events surrounding Sh≈çshi's pregnancy. She begins with a description of the Empress's removal from the Imperial palace to her father's house, the various celebrations and rituals that took place during the pregnancy, and the eventual childbirth with its associated rites in celebration of the successful delivery of a male heir. These passages include specific readings of sutras and other Buddhist rituals associated with childbirth.Bowring (2005), xl‚Äìxliii Several passages account Murasaki's dissatisfaction with court life.Keene (1999b), 44 She describes feelings of helplessness, her sense of inadequacy compared to higher-ranked Fujiwara clan relatives and courtiers, and the pervasive loneliness after her husband's death. In doing so, she adds a sense of self to the diary entries.Mason (1980), 30 The diary includes autobiographical snippets about Murasaki's life before she entered imperial service, such as a childhood anecdote about how she learned Chinese: Some textual fragments may not have survived. Bowring believes the work is difficult to define, that piecing it together is puzzling. He sees four discrete sections, beginning with the dated descriptions of the birth, followed by two undated sections of introspective vignettes, and a final dated section in chronological order. This \\"strange arrangement\\", as he calls it, might be the result of stitching together a series of incomplete sources or fragments. The diary's text was used as a source for the Eiga Monogatari ‚Äì a laudatory work about Michinaga and the Fujiwara clan, written or compiled in the 11th century ‚Äì with entire sections copied verbatim from Murasaki's work. Yet the textual differences between the two suggests the Eiga Monogatori author had access to a different, perhaps more complete text of the diary than has survived.Bowring (2005), xl‚Äìxliv Bowring questions whether the current structure is original to Murasaki, and the degree to which it has been rearranged or rewritten since she authored it.Bowring (2005), xlix =Fujiwara dynasty= Fujiwara no Michinaga, shown here in a 13th-century illustration of the diary. Unlike the imaginary courts of Murasaki's romantic novel The Tale of Genji, the descriptions in the diary of imperial court life are starkly realistic. The ideal \\"shining prince\\" Genji of her novel contrasts sharply with Michinaga and his crass nature;Keene (1999b), 42‚Äì44 he embarrasses his wife and daughter with his drunken behavior, and his flirtations toward Murasaki make her uncomfortable. She writes about waking in the morning to find him lurking in the garden outside her window, and the ensuing exchange of waka: Whether the two were intimate is a question scholars have been unable to determine. Although the diary's sections about the birth of Sh≈çshi's son were meant as tribute to Michinaga, he is revealed as overly controlling. The child's birth was of enormous importance to Michinaga, who nine years earlier brought his daughter to court as concubine to Emperor Ichij≈ç; Sh≈çshi's quick ascendence to Empress and status as mother to the heir consolidated her father's power.Bowring (2005), xv The child's birth and its lengthy descriptions, \\"marked the final tightening of Michinaga's velvet-gloved strangle-hold on imperial succession through his masterful manipulation of marriage politics.\\"Rohlich (1984), 539 Empress Sh≈çshi and Murasaki reading Bai Juyi's poems in Chinese. From the Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki, 13th century. Michinaga dominated the child's father and attending priests throughout the birth ceremonies. After the birth, he visited twice daily, whereas the Emperor only made a single short imperial visit to his son.Bowring (2005), xxiv‚Äìxxv Murasaki chronicles each of Michinaga's ceremonial visits, as well as the lavish ceremony held 16 days after the birth.Mulhern (1991), 86 These include intricate descriptions of the ladies and their court attire: Sh≈çshi appears to have been serious and studious, a royal who expected decorum from her ladies-in-waiting ‚Äì which often created difficulties at a fractious court. When she asked Murasaki for lessons in Chinese,Waley (1960), viii‚Äìix she insisted they be conducted in secret. Murasaki explained that \\"because [Sh≈çshi] evinced a desire to know more about such things, to keep it secret we carefully chose times when the other women would not be present, and, from the summer before last I started given her informal lessons on the two volumes of 'New Ballads'. I hid this fact from others, as did Her Majesty\\". = Court life = Some of the diary's passages are unflinching in exposing the behavior at the imperial court, particularly that of drunken courtiers who seduced the ladies-in-waiting. As Keene describes it, the court was a place where the courtiers were \\"drunken men who make obscene jokes and paw at women\\". Murasaki complained about drunk courtiers and princes who behaved badly, such as the incident when at a banquet court poet Fujiwara no Kint≈ç joined a group of women asking whether Murasaki was present ‚Äì alluding to the character in The Tale of Genji. Murasaki retorted that none of the novel's characters lived at this tawdry and unpleasant court, so unlike the court in her novel.Keene (1999b), 45 She left the banquet when \\"Counsellor Takai ... started pulling at Lady Hy≈çbu's robes and singing dreadful songs, but His Excellency said nothing. I realized that it was bound to be a terribly drunken affair this evening, so ... Lady Saish≈ç and I decided to retire.\\"Keene (1999b), 45; Murasaki Shikibu (Bowring translation, 2005), 32 Drunk, disarranged, and disordered Heian courtiers seen here joking and flirting with ladies-in-waiting.

There are anecdotes about drunken revelries and courtly scandals concerning women who, because of behavior or age, were forced to leave imperial service. Murasaki suggests that the court women were weak-willed, uneducated, and inexperienced with men.Ury (2003), 175‚Äì188 The women lived in semi-seclusion in curtained areas or screened spaces without privacy. Men were allowed to enter the women's space at any time.Bowring (2005), xxvii When the Imperial palace burned down in 1005 the court was itinerant for the following years, depending on Michinaga for housing. Murasaki lived at his Biwa mansion, the Tsuchimikado mansion, or Emperor Ichij≈ç's mansion, where there was little space. Ladies-in-waiting had to sleep on thin futons rolled out on bare wood floors in a room often created by curtaining off a space. The dwellings were slightly raised and opened to the Japanese garden, affording little privacy.Bowring (2005), xxiv‚Äìxxvii Bowring explains how vulnerable the women were to men watching them: \\"A man standing outside in the garden looking in .... his eyes would have been roughly level with the skirts of the woman inside.\\" The houses were cold and drafty in the winter, with few braziers available to the women whose multilayered J≈´nihitoe kimonos kept them warm, of which there are detailed descriptions in the work. Heian era noble women dressed in six or seven garments, each layered over the next, some with multiple linings in differing hues and color combinations.Bowring (2005), xxviii‚Äìxxx The description of the clothing the ladies-in-waiting wore at an imperial event shows the importance of fashions, the arrangement of their layers, as well as Murasaki's keen observational eye: Combining layers of garments, each with multiple linings, to arrive at a harmonic color combination assumed an almost ritual fascination to the women. It required attention; and achieving an individual stylistic aesthetic was important. Murasaki chronicles the significance of making a mistake at a courtly function when two women failed in a perfect color combination: \\"That day all the women had done their utmost to dress well, but .... two of them showed a want of taste when it came to the color combinations at their sleeves ... [in] full view of the courtiers and senior nobles.\\"Murasaki Shikibu (Bowring translation, 2005), 65 =Ladies-in- waiting= Murasaki suffered overwhelming loneliness, had her own concerns about aging, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: \\"Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am .... [Sh≈çshi] too has often remarked that she thought I was not the kind of person with whom one could ever relax .... I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect.\\"qtd. in Keene (1999b), 46 Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki's loneliness may have been \\"the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it\\". He points out she had \\"exceptional powers of discernment\\" and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws. Her insights did not endear her to the other women at a court where intrigue, drama and scheming was the norm, yet for a novelist it was crucial. He believes that she needed to be aloof so as to be able to continue writing, but equally that she was intensely private, a woman who \\"chose not to reveal her true qualities\\" except to those who earned her trust and respect, as Sh≈çshi had.Keene (1999b), 46 The diary includes descriptions of other ladies-in- waiting who were writers, most notably Sei Sh≈çnagon, who had been in service to Sh≈çshi's rival and co-empress, Empress Teishi (Sadako). The two courts were competitive; both introduced educated ladies-in-waiting to their respective circles and encouraged rivalry among the women writers. Sh≈çnagon probably left court after Empress Teishi's death in 1006, and it is possible the two never met, yet Murasaki was quite aware of Sh≈çnagon's writing style and her character. She disparages Sh≈çnagon in her diary:Keene (1999a), 414‚Äì415 Murasaki is also critical of the two other women writers at Sh≈çshi's court ‚Äì poet Izumi Shikibu, and Akazome Emon who authored a monogatari.Mulhern (1994), 156 Of Izumi's writing and poetry she says: = The diary and The Tale of Genji = Murasaki's The Tale of Genji is barely mentioned in the diary. She writes the Emperor had the story read to him, and that colored papers and calligraphers had been selected for transcriptions of the manuscript ‚Äì done by court women. In one anecdote she tells of Michinaga sneaking into her room to help himself to a copy of the manuscript.Keene (1999b), 46‚Äì47 There are parallels between the later chapters of Genji and the diary. According to Genji scholar Shirane, the scene in the diary which describes Ichijo's imperial procession to Michinaga's mansion in 1008 corresponds closely to an imperial procession in \\"Chapter 33 (Wisteria Leaves)\\" of The Tale of Genji.Shirane (1987), 221 Shirane believes the similarities suggest portions of Genji may have been written during the period Murasaki was in imperial service and wrote the diary.Shirane (1987), 36 Style and genre Murasaki at her desk shown in a 19th-century ukiyo-e. Heian era diaries resemble autobiographical memoirs more than a diary in the modern sense. The author of a Heian-era diary (a nikki bungaku) would decide what to include, expand, or exclude. Time was treated in a similar manner ‚Äì a nikki might include long entries for a single event while other events were omitted. The nikki was considered a form of literature, often not written by the subject, almost always written in third-person, and sometimes included elements of fiction or history. These diaries are a repository of knowledge about the Heian Imperial court, considered highly important in Japanese literature, although many have not survived in a complete state. The format typically included waka poetry,Waka is always 31 syllables with a measures of 5/7 or 7/5 syllables. In the diary, Murasaki used the so-called short form consisting of a measure of 5/7/5/7/7 syllables. See Bowring, xix meant to convey information to the readers, as seen in Murasaki's descriptions of court ceremonies.McCullough (1990), 15‚Äì16 Few if any dates are included in Murasaki's diary and her working habits are not chronicled. It should not be compared to a modern 'writer's notebook', according to Keene. Although it chronicles public events, the inclusion of self-reflective passages is a unique and important part of the work, adding a human aspect unavailable in official accounts.Keene (1999b), 41‚Äì42 According to Keene, the author is revealed as a woman with great perception and self-awareness, yet a person who is withdrawn with few friends. She is unflinching in her criticism of aristocratic courtiers, seeing beyond superficial facades to their inner core, a quality Keene says is helpful for a novelist but less useful in the closed society she inhabited.Keene (1999b), 45 Bowring believes the work contains three styles, each distinct from the other. The first is the matter-of-fact chronicle of events, a chronicle which otherwise would typically have been written in Chinese. The second style is found in the author's self-reflective analysis. He considers the author's self-reflections the best that have survived from the period, noting that Murasaki's mastery of introspective style, still rare in Japanese, reflects her contributions to the development of written Japanese in that she conquered the limits of an inflexible language and writing system. The epistolary section represents the third style, a newly developed trend. Bowring sees this as the weakest portion of the work, a section where she fails to break free of the rhythms of spoken language.Bowring (2005), xviii‚Äìxix He explains that the rhythms of spoken language assumes the presence of an audience, is often ungrammatical, relies on \\"eye contact, shared experiences and particular relationships [to] provide a background which allows speech to be at times fragmentary and even allusive\\". In contrast, written language must compensate for \\"the gap between the producer and receiver of the message\\". She may have been experimenting with the new style of writing, either producing a fictional letter or writing a real letter, but he writes that at the end of the section the writing is weaker, \\"degenerating into ... disjointed rhythms that are characteristic of speech.\\"Bowring (2005), xix Translations In 1920, Annie Shepley Omori and Kochi Doi published Diaries of Court Ladies of Old Japan; this book combined their translation of Murasaki's diary with Izumi Shikibu's (The Izumi Shikibu nikki) and with the Sarashina nikki. Their translation had an introduction by Amy Lowell. Richard Bowring published translation in 1982,Ury (1983), 175 which contains a \\"lively and provocative\\" analysis.  Emakimono handscroll  In the 13th century a handscroll of the diary was produced, The Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki. The scroll, meant to be read from left to right, consists of calligraphy illustrated with paintings. Writing in \\"The House-bound Heart\\", Japanese scholar Penelope Mason explains that in an emakimono or emaki a narrative reaches its full potential through the combination of the writer's and the painter's art. About 20 percent of the scroll has survived; based on the existing fragments, the images would have closely followed the text of the diary.Mason (1980), 24 13th century emakimono painting showing a scene of two courtiers trying to gain entrance to the women's quarters. Murasaki is barely visible on the right. The work is a National Treasure of Japan, held at the Gotoh Museum. The illustrations in the emaki follow the late-Heian and early Kamakura period convention of Hikime kagibana (line-eye and hook-nose) in which individual facial expressions are omitted. Also typical of the period is the style of fukimuki yatai (blown off roof) depictions of interiors which seem to be visualized from above looking downward into a space. According to Mason, the interior scenes of human figures are juxtaposed against empty exterior gardens; the characters are 'house-bound'.Mason (1980), 22‚Äì24 In the diary Murasaki writes of love, hate and loneliness, feelings which make the illustrations, according to Mason, of the \\"finest extant examples of prose- poetry narrative illustrations from the period\\".Mason (1980), 29 Mason finds the illustration of two young courtiers opening the lattice blinds to enter the women's quarters particularly poignant, because Murasaki tries to hold the lattice shut against their advances. The image shows that the architecture and the men who keep her away from the freedom of the garden to the right.Mason (1980), 32‚Äì33 The scroll was discovered in 1920 in a five segment piece, by Morikawa Kanichir≈ç (Ê£ÆÂ∑ùÂãò‰∏ÄÈÉé). The Gotoh Museum holds segments one, two and four; the Tokyo National Museum holds the third segment; the fifth remains in a private collection.

In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by the central government ministry and the municipality government.History of CQUPT Schools CQUPT has 15 schools and institutesSchools in CQUPT with the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductors established in 2010.Press release on the establishment of Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor *School of Communications and Information Engineering **Communication Engineering **Telecommunication Engineering **Information Engineering **Radio and Television Engineering *School of Computer Science and Technology **Computer Science and Technology **Network Engineering **Information Security **AI tech **Geographic Information System *School of Automation **Automation **Measurement and Control Technology and Instrumentation **Electrical Engineering and Automation **Mechanical design and Automation **Internet of Things Engineering *School of Optoelectronic Engineering *School of Bioinformatics *School of Mathematics and Physics *School of Software Engineering (CQUPT-HP Software School) *School of Economics and Management *School of Arts and Communication *CQUPT Law School *CQUPT International School *School of Foreign Languages *School of Continuing Education *School of Physical Education *Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor A list of schools at CQUPT and the academic programs each offer can be found at the webpage 'School Navigation' from CQUPT's website. Research =Overview= CQUPT is the origin of the China's digital communications systems.Brief introduction to CQUPT's research on its website In the very recent years, over 600 scientific projects in the ICT field have been done in the university and 80 of them were granted the \\"Scientific Research Achievement Awards\\" by the government. CQUPT is the only Chinese university participating in the development of China's own 3G standard: TD-SCDMA. The world's first TD-SCDMA chip and mobile phone were developed at CQUPT. The university played a key role in the establishment of China's first national \\"EPA Communication Standard for Industrial Measurement and Control System\\", which was recognized by the IEC as international standard in the field of industrial automation. The university's spin-off company Chongqing CYIT Communications Technologies Company (CYIT) is among the first companies doing research on TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE in China and is already a frontrunner in the field nowadays.CYIT's website The university's strength also lies in areas such as computer science, automatic control technology, microtechnologies, and others, as one of the first academic institutions doing research in these fields in China. Research at CQUPT is done in about 30 research platforms. Each of the research platforms may contain several laboratories or research groups. Research at CQUPT is closely linked to the industry. In 2010, the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor, which is in and hosted by CQUPT, was founded with the participating of nearly 50 partners in industry from around the world, including Qualcomm in USA, Eplida in Japan, the International Association of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials European Microelectronics Center in Taiwan among others. The research at CQUPT is widely done in cooperation with other academic or industrial partners in the form of joint research centers or laboratory. Academic institutions which have founded joint research centers with CQUPT include the Chinese Science Academy (CSA), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, Essex University in UK, Inha University in South Korea, etc. The university's industrial partners, which have founded joint research centers or laboratories include Oracle, Cisco, Lenovo Mobile, Maipu Communications, and others.Introduction to CQUPT on its website, paragraph 7 The university boasts 11 Key Disciplines of ministry and provincial level, and 16 key laboratories, engineering research centres and humanities and social science bases. =Main research bases= *Nation Defense Mobilization center of 3G dual-use terminal equipment\\" (military-civilian alliance), under National Development and Reform Commission. *Mobile Communication Nation together with Local Engineering Research Center, under National Development and Reform Commission. *Mobile Communication National High-tech Base Innovation Platform, under National Development and Reform Commission. *Industrial Automation Tech National High-tech Base Innovation Platform, under National Development and Reform Commission. *National Accessible Information Engineering Research Center, under MIIT. *China National Information Security Application Base, under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. *Engineering research center of mobile communication, under the Ministry of Education *Key laboratory of networked control and intelligent instrument and meter, under the Ministry of Education *Key laboratory of mobile communication, under the Ministry of Information Industry and Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of computer network and communication technology, under the Ministry of Information Industry and Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of fiber-optic communication technology, under the Ministry of Information Industry and Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of postal automation technology, under the Ministry of Information Industry *\\"R&D; center of Chongqing industrial communication technology\\", co- founded with Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences *\\"Silian-CQUPT joint R&D; center\\", co-founded with China Silian Group *Key laboratory of signal and information processing, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Laboratory of industrial automation technology, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Chongqing Laboratory of Internet and Information Security, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Engineering research center of mobile communication, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of micro-electronic engineering, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Engineering technology research center of intelligent instrument and control device, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of network control technology and intelligent instrument and meter, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Key laboratory of e-commerce and modern logistics, under Chongqing Municipal Government *Engineering research center of automotive electronics and embedded system in universities, under Chongqing Municipal Government *R&D; center of industrial communication, under Chongqing Municipal Government 'Research Institutions' on CQUPT's website offers a complete list of research platforms and research institutions at CQUPT. Students and alumni Over the 60 years since the establishment of university in 1950, CQUPT has educated over 70,000 students in the field of Information and Communication, many of whom are in the high positions of China's telecommunications companies. The university is deemed as the cradle of talents of ICT industry in China. It boasts its high employment rate among Chinese universities.Introduction to CQUPT, paragraphs 4 & 5 Even though the university is featured with excellence in the area of Information and Communications, it is striving to offer a wide range of other subjects including science, engineering, economics, management, arts and education, most of which are related to applied science and engineering. The university offers 45 undergraduate programs, 37 postgraduate programs and Master of Engineering programs; it was also authorized to confer doctor‚Äôs degrees in the disciplines of Information and Communication Engineering, Computer Science and Technology, Electronic Science and Technology, Control Science and Engineering, Management and Engineering. CQUPT has about 20,000 students, including more than 3,000 postgraduates. Partnerships CQUPT has established good cooperative relations and links with over 30 prestigious universities in USA, Russia, UK, Italy, Canada, Korea, Singapore and so forth. Some examples of joint research centers co-founded with other academic institutions out of China include the Joint Research Center of 4G Mobile Communications co-founded with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, the Sino-Korean Institute of Spatial Information Systems founded with Inha University and Seowon University in South Korea, the Sino-Europe Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Robotics with the Essex University and Open University in UK. Research at CQUPT is also widely collaborated with famous companies in the industry. Many companies found joint laboratories or centers with CQUPT such as Oracle (CQUPT-Oracle Joint Laboratory of Database Technology), Lenovo Mobile (CQUPT-Lenovo Moile Internet Application Research Center), Cisco (CQUPT-Cisco Joint R&D; Center of Green Technology).Scientific Platforms and centers in CQUPT In July, 2010, the School of Computer Science and Technology signed a collaboration contract with Cornell University and founded the CU-CQUPT Joint Lab of Intelligent Computing.The press release on the establishment of CU-CQUPT joint laboratory Other education or research partners include IBM, Ericsson, Lenovo Mobile, Nokia, China Silian Group, Maipu Communications, Foxconn Technology, ProMOS Technologies and many others. To deepen the relationship with local industry, the university also establishes a good relationship with the local high-tech industry parks like Chongqing Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing Xiyong Microelectronics Industrial Park and Chayuan Industrial Park. Board In 2010, the university founded the university board. The board of the university include China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom, China Post, Huawei, ZTE, DaTang, China Putian, Lenovo and other industry partners.Introduction to CQUPT, Paragraph 7  References   External links  *CQUPT website (in English) * CQUPT website (in Chinese) *Introduction of CQUPT (in Chinese) *Research platforms in CQUPT (in Chinese) *Virtual Campus * CQUPT BBS Category:Universities and colleges in Chongqing Category:Educational institutions established in 1950 Category:Telecommunications organizations Category:Telecommunications in China Category:1950 establishments in China Category:Telecommunication education ","title":"Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications"},{"id":"919356","text":"Western Chongqing University (Ê∏ùË•øÂ≠¶Èô¢) is a public university located in Chongqing, China.

Boutwell, first President of the Anti-Imperialist League The American Anti-Imperialist League was an organization established on June 15, 1898, to battle the American annexation of the Philippines as an insular area. The anti-imperialists opposed expansion, believing that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just republican government must derive from \\"consent of the governed.\\" The League argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of American ideals of self-government and non- intervention‚Äîideals expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence, George Washington's Farewell Address and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.Fred Harvey Harrington, \\"Literary Aspects of American Anti- Imperialism 1898‚Äì1902,\\" New England Quarterly, Vol. 10, No. 4 (Dec., 1937), pg. 650. The Anti-Imperialist League was ultimately defeated in the battle of public opinion by a new wave of politicians who successfully advocated the virtues of American territorial expansion in the aftermath of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and in the first years of the 20th century.  Organizational history  = Forerunners = The idea for an Anti-Imperialist League was born in the spring of 1898. On June 2, retired Massachusetts banker Gamaliel Bradford published a letter in the Boston Evening Transcript in which he sought assistance gaining access to historic Faneuil Hall to hold a public meeting to organize opponents of American colonial expansion.E. Berkeley Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States: The Great Debate, 1890‚Äì1920. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1970; pp. 122‚Äì123. An opponent of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Bradford decried what he saw as an \\"insane and wicked\\" colonial ambition among some American decision-makers which was \\"driving the country to moral ruin.\\"Gamaliel Bradford, Boston Evening Transcript, June 2, 1898. Quoted in Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 123. Bradford's organizing efforts proved successful, and on June 15, 1898, his protest meeting against \\"the adoption of an imperial policy by the United States\\" was held.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 123. The June 15 meeting gave rise to a formal four member organizing committee known as the Anti-Imperialist Committee of Correspondence, headed by Bradford.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 126. This group contacted religious, business, labor, and humanitarian leaders from around the country and attempted to stir them into action to stop what they perceived as a growing menace of American colonial expansion into Hawaii and the former colonial possessions of the Spanish empire. A letter-writing campaign attempting to involve editors of newspapers and magazines was initiated. This initial pioneering effort by Bradford and his associates bore fruit on November 19, 1898, when the Anti-Imperialist Committee of Correspondence formally established itself as the Anti-Imperialist League. = Structure = President McKinley fires a cannon into an imperialism effigy in this cartoon by W.A. Rogers in Harper's Weekly of September 22, 1900. The Anti-Imperialist League was administered by three permanent officers‚Äîa President, Secretary, and Treasurer‚Äîworking in conjunction with a six-member Executive Committee.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 127. Unsurprisingly given the localized origins of the organization, the initial members of this leadership group all hailed from the Boston metropolitan area. Chosen as the high-profile President of the League was former Massachusetts Governor, Congressman, and United States Senator George S. Boutwell, who would remain in the position until his death in 1905. Practical day-to-day executive operations were placed in the hands of Secretary Erving Winslow. In addition to its Boston-based governing center, the Anti-Imperialist League also included a large list of public figures of national reputation who were enlisted as Vice-Presidents of the organization. This post was essentially ceremonial but was important in providing legitimacy to the organization. A total of 18 Vice-Presidents were named at the time of the November formation of the league, including among them former President of the United States Grover Cleveland, ex-US Senator and Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, and labor leader Samuel Gompers. During the first half of 1899 the number of \\"paper\\" Vice-Presidents of the League was boosted to 40, with a number of leading politicians and intellectuals added to the League's letterhead.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 128. Included among these were religious philosopher Felix Adler, former Iowa Governor William Larrabee, Republican Congressman Henry U. Johnson, and Stanford University president David Starr Jordan. Shortly after this expansion the Executive Committee of the League voted to move the offices of the organization to Washington, D.C., to be better situated for influencing American political leaders. Despite this decision to establish a nexus in the nation's capital, main operations of the organization remained in Boston. The decision to move to Washington was made moot with the establishment of an autonomous Washington Anti-Imperialist League in the fall of 1899. This affiliated group concentrated its efforts upon the lobbying of national politicians and removed any need for the Boston-based national organization to shift its headquarters. The Anti-Imperialist League would remain based in Boston for the duration of its existence. = Local organizations = The Anti-Imperialist League attempted to establish a network of local organizations in an effort to decentralize and expand the group's propaganda efforts. The group's largest and most influential local affiliates were located in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Chicago, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 133. In February 1899 the national office of the Anti- Imperialist League would peg the group's total membership at \\"considerably over 25,000.\\"Report of the Executive Committee of the Anti-Imperialist League, Feb. 10, 1899. Cited in Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 133. The total number of local branches of the group was reckoned as \\"at least 100\\" by November of that year. Local groups maintained a substantial degree of autonomy and often had unique local monikers, including the American League of Philadelphia and the Anti-Imperialist League of New York.Tompkins, Anti- Imperialism in the United States, pp. 134‚Äì135. The roster of officers of the New York branch was nearly as expansive and impressive as that of the original Boston organization, including a corps of 23 Vice-Presidents.Tompkins, Anti- Imperialism in the United States, pg. 135. = Three leagues become one = In October 1899 a Chicago group inspired by the Boston organization which had previously styled itself as the Central Anti-Imperialist League held a convention merging with another organization to form the American Anti- Imperialist League.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 134. This organization would in turn merge with the Boston-based Anti-Imperialist League in the following month, rechristening the Boston organization as the New England branch of the American Anti-Imperialist League. Despite this formal organizational change, the Boston office remained the leading center of the anti-imperialist movement nationwide. Many of the leaders of the Boston organization would be named leaders of the Chicago-based American Anti- Imperialist League, including George S. Boutwell as the group's first president, four of its six Vice-Presidents, and two of its nine-member Executive Committee. Nominal national headquarters of the organization would remain in Chicago until November 1904, when the vital Boston organization was reestablished as headquarters of the organization. Throughout it all, the loosely affiliated local Leagues would conduct their own activities, electing their own officers and producing their own publications. = Publications = One of the primary activities of the Anti-Imperialist League was the production of political leaflets and pamphlets meant to propagandize against American imperialist activities.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 131. These publications began to emerge immediately in 1898. Included among these were a series of \\"Broadsides\\" which made use of extensive quotations from founding fathers of America such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe, attempting to demonstrate a fundamental contradiction between the ideas upon which the American republic was founded and designs for colonial expansion being advanced by the nation's contemporary political leaders.Tompkins, Anti-Imperialism in the United States, pg. 132. Mark Twain, perhaps the most prominent member of the league, offered his voice through the publication of his essay \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness,\\" which appeared in the North American Review in February 1901. In his essay, Twain satirically portrayed the moral and cultural superiority of Americans compared to Filipinos to comment on what he believed to be the great irony of the Philippines annexation. Twain successfully gained popular support for the Anti-Imperialist League by claiming that America's international role was not to subjugate other nations for material gain, but to see \\"a nation of long harassed and persecuted slaves set free.\\"Twain, Mark. \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\". The Anti-Imperialist League of New York was particularly prominent in the production of propaganda pamphlets, drawing upon the impressive array of writers, public intellectuals, and politicians among its membership. The war that erupted in 1898 with Spain had its origins in the First Cuban Insurrection (1868‚Äì1878). The Cuban rebels had formed relationships with small groups of Americans committed to their cause. Many of these Americans supported the filibusters who attempted to run military supplies to the insurrectionists on the island. War had nearly erupted between the United States and Spain in 1873 when the Spanish captured the filibuster ship Virginius and executed most of the crew, including many American citizens. The Treaty of Zanj√≥n signaled a temporary peace, but American sympathies remained with the Cubans desiring independence. When the reforms promised by the treaty proved illusory, the insurrectionists and their American supporters prepared for a new round. = Election of 1900 = The 1900 presidential election caused internal squabbles in the League. Particularly controversial was the League's endorsement of William Jennings Bryan, a renowned anti-imperialist but also the leading critic of the gold standard, a position which alienated a substantial segment of the organization's leaders. A few League members, including Storey and Oswald Garrison Villard, attempted to organize a third party to both uphold the gold standard and oppose imperialism. This effort led to the formation of the National Party, which nominated Senator Donelson Caffery of Louisiana. The party quickly collapsed, however, when Caffery dropped out of the race, leaving Bryan as the only anti-imperialist candidate. Following the death of George Boutwell in 1905, prominent lawyer and civil rights activist Moorfield Storey would serve as President of the organization, filling that role from 1905 until the League dissolved in 1920. = Dissolution = Despite its anti- war record, the League did not object to U.S. entry into World War I (though several individual members did oppose intervention). By 1920, it was only a shadow of its former strength, and it disbanded on November 27, 1920.  Prominent members  * Charles Francis Adams, Jr. * Jane Addams * Felix Adler * Edward Atkinson * George S.

It is found in the work of J√ºrgen Habermas and Imre Lakatos.  Habermas  For Habermas, rational reconstruction is a philosophical and linguistic method that systematically translates intuitive knowledge of rules into a logical form.Habermas, J√ºrgen. (1979). Communication and the Evolution of Society. Toronto: Beacon Press. In other words, it is an approach to science and philosophy which attempts to put meanings into language properly. The type of formal analysis called rational reconstruction is used by Habermas to name the task that he sees as appropriate for philosophy. This mode of philosophical reflection can be compared to procedures traditionally taken up in philosophy and is concerned with the questions traditionally posed. That is, rational reconstruction involves making explicit and theoretically systematizing the universal and inescapable conditions for the possibility of certain types of phenomena. Put more specifically, it can be said that rational reconstruction is a manner of explicating the deep generative structures that give rise to and allow for particular performances, behaviours, and other symbolically pre-structured realities. Rational reconstruction is limited to the analysis of symbolically pre-structured realities because it is a procedure that is intimately tied to the interpretation of reality as opposed to its description. So, while the natural sciences generate theoretical knowledge about the general structures of an observable reality, rational reconstructions (sometimes called the reconstructive sciences) generate a theoretical knowledge of the deep structures of a reality accessible only through interpretation. Some questions cannot be dealt with through the process of rational reconstruction, but an extremely broad range of questions can be. It is hard to point out a phenomenon that is not in some way symbolically pre-structured, that is without some meaning to someone. While the meaning of any phenomenon must in some way be generated, and the interpretation of symbols is dependent upon intelligence, the bestowal of meaning is not arbitrary. Rational reconstruction attempts to make clear the underlying processes that generate particular meanings. It is concerned with the deep structures of intelligence that generate the knowledge, judgments and actions of subjects as well as the meaning, import and validity of objects. Because of this, those sciences that systematically explicate the intuitive knowledge of competent subjects by reconstructing the pretheoretical know-how of certain human capabilities can be seen as representative of this procedure of rational reconstruction. Habermas suggests along these lines that \\"we can distinguish between know-how, the ability of a competent subject who understands how to produce or accomplish something, and know-that, the explicit knowledge of how it is that he is able to do so\\" (Habermas, 1979). This should be understood in the context of rational reconstruction as two levels of the explication of meaning, two ways of understanding a symbolically pre-structured reality. The difference between the two levels is, in Habermas's terms, the content and the intuitively master rule-consciousness that allows for it, or in other terms, surface structures and deep structures. It is worth quoting Habermas at length to clarify this. Here he is discussing these two levels of analysis as applied to the interpretation of a text: \\"...the understanding of content pursues the connections that link the surface structures of an incomprehensible [symbolic] formation with surface structures, of other, familiar formations. Thus, linguistic expressions can be explicated through paraphrase in the same language [etc.]‚Ä¶. If she cannot attain her end in this way, the interpreter may find it necessary to alter her attitude. She then exchanges the attitude of understanding content (directed towards surface structures)‚Ä¶for an attitude in which she focuses on the generative structures of the expressions themselves. The interpreter then attempts to explicate the meaning of a symbolic formation with the help of the rules according to which the author must have produced it‚Ä¶.The attitude changes as soon as the interpreter tries not only to apply the intuitive knowledge of speakers but to reconstruct it. She then turns away from the surface structure of the symbolic formation‚Ä¶.She attempts instead to peer into the symbolic formation- penetrating through the surface as it were- in order to discover the rules according to which this symbolic formation was produced‚Ä¶. The object of understanding is no longer the content‚Ä¶but the intuitive rule consciousness. (Habermas, 1979).\\" Furthermore, following this distinction between surface and deep structures, Habermas views the task of the reconstructive sciences as moving in two directions, horizontal and vertical. The \\"horizontal\\" direction seeks to reconstruct fundamental and important competencies, while the \\"vertical\\" direction seeks to reconstruct the (genetic) logic of the development of these competencies. So there are surface structures and deep structures related to competencies and sub-competencies, and these are teased apart and reconstructed by engaging two distinct modes of understanding symbolically pre-structured realities. This should clarify what it is that rational reconstructions seek to accomplish. It should also be said that the results of systematized reconstructions claim to explicate \\"universal capabilities and not merely the particular competencies of individual groups\\" (Habermas, 1979). The theoretical claims of such rational reconstructions have the status of general theories of human competencies and behavior. \\"When the pretheoretical knowledge to be reconstructed expresses a universal capability, a general cognitive, linguistic, or interactive competence (or sub-competence), then what begins as an explication of meaning aims at the reconstruction of species competencies\\" (Habermas, 1979). These kinds of rational reconstructions are notably different from the purely philosophical but comparable solutions and methods offered up as definitive answers to such issues in the past. Kant's transcendental analysis sought to deduce the categorical framework that structured and determined experience. Hegel's dialectic sought to systematize the process of knowing, fitting each stage of insight as a defined moment to be subsumed in the development of absolute knowledge. These great systems were conceived as being a-priori, inescapably generative of all experience and knowledge, and they were understood to be factual, to be the truth. Habermas sees rational reconstruction as a similar, but less grandiose, undertaking: \\"Marked down in price the transcendental and dialectical modes of justification may still come in handy. All they can fairly be expected to furnish, however, is reconstructive hypotheses for use in empirical settings‚Ä¶.[Rational reconstructions are] fallibilistic in orientation, they reject the dubious faith in philosophy's ability to do things single handedly, hoping instead that the success that has for so long eluded it might come from an auspicious matching of different theoretical fragments (Habermas, 1990a).\\" Furthermore: \\"‚Ä¶.[In rational reconstruction] the distinction between drawing on a-priori knowledge and drawing on a-posteriori knowledge becomes blurred. On the one hand, the rule consciousness [i.e. intuitive know-how] of competent subjects is for them an a-priori knowledge; on the other hand, the reconstruction of this calls for inquiries undertaken with empirical [methods] (Habermas, 1979).\\" In this respect Habermas sees those theorists whose projects represented a blend of philosophy and scientific methods as important exemplars. He identifies Freud, Durkheim, Mead, Weber, Piaget, Chomsky and Kohlberg as those who \\"inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research‚Ä¶[initiating] paradigms in which a philosophical idea is present in embryo while at the same time empirical, yet universal, questions are being posed\\" (Habermas, 1990).Habermas, J√ºrgen. (1990). Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. These theorists approximated the ideal division of labor between philosophy and science that Habermas understands as crucial for progress to be achieved across disciplines; the human sciences in particular represent fertile ground for such cooperation.  Lakatos  Lakatos distinguishes between the \\"internal\\" and \\"external\\" history of science. Internal history focuses on normative concerns and the reasons scientists can be said to have for accepting or rejecting scientific theories according to some account of the logic of science. External history, on the other hand, focuses on the contingent non-rational factors that influenced the scientific process.Lakatos, Imre.

It is one of the top eight foreign studies universities in China, and is a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines. SISU is known for being one of the earliest institutions where China's higher education in foreign languages took shape. SISU was among the first batch of schools admitted to the Project 211. Like its rival Beijing Foreign Studies University, SISU is known for its strict admission selection. The Ministry of Education has designated SISU's English Literature a National Key Subject along with the English Literature of Peking University. History After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the East China office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China () and the government of the Shanghai Municipality decided to establish an institute for higher education in Russian studies to cultivate qualified diplomats and translators for international affairs. With the support of Mayor Chen Yi, the Shanghai Russian School () was officially established in December 1949. Jiang Chunfang, one of the most famous Russian translators in China and the first chief editor of the Encyclopedia of China, was appointed the school's first president. In 1950, the department of English was established and the college was incorporated as the foreign language school affiliated to the East China People's Revolution University (). The department of oriental language and literature was founded in April, 1951 and languages as Burmese, Vietnamese, Indonesian had respectively been introduced to teaching. Later in 1952, a nationwide restructuring of institutes of higher education began in China, and the department of oriental language and literature was incorporated into Peking University. The college was renamed as Shanghai Russian College that specialise in teaching Russian language. The university was used to be widely known as Shanghai Foreign Language Institute () since its expansion in 1956 and became a national key university approved by the State Council in 1963 with the department of Russian, English (re-established), French, German, Japanese, Arabic and Spanish. Approved by the Ministry of Education in 1994, it was officially renamed as Shanghai International Studies University (). In the same year, it was listed as one of the first colleges and universities jointly supervised by the national Ministry of Education and the Municipality of Shanghai. In 1996, SISU passed the evaluation process of Project 211 directed by the Ministry of Education, and became one of the nation's ‚Äú100 key universities for the 21st Century.‚Äù(zh) Academics =Schools and Departments= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" width=\\"100%\\" ----- valign=\\"top\\"  width=\\"50%\\"   width=\\"50%\\"  -----  valign=\\"top\\"  *School of English Studies **Department of English **Department of Translation and Interpreting *School of International Relations and Public Affairs *School of Japanese Studies **Department of Japanese *School of Asian and African Studies **Department of Arabic **Department of Korean **Department of Persian **Department of Vietnamese **Department of Indonesian **Department of Thai **Department of Hebrew **Department of Turkish **Department of Hindi **Department of Kiswahili *School of European and Latin American Studies **Department of Spanish **Department of Portuguese **Department of Italian **Department of Greek **Department of Dutch *Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies **Department of Russian **Department of Central and Eastern European languages ***Department of Ukrainian ***Department of Hungarian ***Department of Polish ***Department of Czech **Department of Central Asian languages ***Department of Uzbek ***Department of Kazakh *Department of French and Francophone Studies **Department of French *Department of Germanic Studies **Department of German **Department of Swedish  valign=\\"top\\"  *School of Law **Department of Law *School of Economics and Finance **Department of International Economics and Trade **Department of Finance **Department of Accounting *School of Business and Management **Department of Business Administration **Department of Public Relations **Department of Information Management and Information System **MBA Center *School of Journalism and Communication **Department of International Journalism **Department of Radio and Television Journalism **Department of Advertising **Department of Educational Technology **Department of Internet and Online Journalism *School of Education **Department of Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages **Department of English Education **Department of Business English *School of Chinese Studies and Exchange **Department of Chinese *Graduate Institute of Interpretation and Translation (GIIT) **Department of Translation and Interpretation **Department of Translation Studies } = Ranking = Shanghai International studies university is ranked the 76th in the QS BRICS 2016, the 142nd in the QS Asian University Rankings, and its linguistics is ranked 151‚Äì200 in the QS ranking by subject. = Graduate Education = There are 33 Master's Programs:(30 research programs) Adult Education, Ancient Chinese Literature, Arabic Language and Literature, Asian-African Languages and Literatures, Chinese and Foreign Political Institution, Chinese Linguistics and Philology, Communication, Comparative Literature and World Literature, Corporate Management, Curriculum and Teaching Methodology, Diplomacy, Education in Ideology and Politics, Educational Technology, English Language and Literature, European Languages and Literatures, Finance, French Language and Literature, Foreign Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, German Language and Literature, International Politics, International Relations, International Trade, Japanese Language and Literature, Journalism, Linguistics and Applied Linguistics, Modern and Contemporary Chinese Literature, Russian Language and Literature, Spanish Language and Literature, Technology Economy and Management, Translation Studies; (3 taught programs) Translation and Interpreting (MTI), Business Administration (MBA), Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages (MTCSOL).

The program was relocated to Shanghai and became the Shanghai University of Commerce in 1921.‰∏äË¥¢ÁÆÄ‰ªã Over the years the university had evolved. By 1928, It was renamed as the School of Commerce of the Central University. In 1932, it was split from the Central University and became the National Shanghai College of Commerce. In 1950, the institution became the Shanghai College of Finance and Economics. The institution adopted its present name the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 1985. Chen Yun, who was then a top leader of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, wrote the inscription of the school's name. Since then, SUFE has developed into a multidimensional university which focuses on applied economics and management, with economic theories as its basis. Its subjects include science, social sciences, laws, philosophy and humanities. Its aim is to train students to graduate with practical knowledge, versatile talents and a broad view. In 1997, Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for the university: Facing the new century, let us build the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics into a top-level socialist university (Èù¢ÂêëÊñ∞‰∏ñÁ∫™Êää‰∏äÊµ∑Ë¥¢ÁªèÂ§ßÂ≠¶Âª∫ËÆæÊàê‰∏∫ÂÖ∑Êúâ‰∏ÄÊµÅÊ∞¥Âπ≥ÁöÑÁ§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâÂ§ßÂ≠¶).‰∏äÊµ∑Ë¥¢ÁªèÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁÆÄ‰ªã  Present  At present, the university comprises 12 academic schools, one graduate school and more than 20 finance and economics research centers.

In 1981, SUFE became the first finance and economics university to receive accreditation for granting doctoral degrees. In addition, it was among the first nine schools to be selected as an \\"M.B.A. Experimental Education Base\\" and one of the first schools to set up a post-doctoral program in economics. In 1996, SUFE joined the Project 211, a program to build 100 key universities, after a fierce competition. In 2002, SUFE became the first mainland university to offer a master's program in Hong Kong. All of its programs continue to exceed world standards and are imbued with modernity, internationalism and cutting-edge information.Introduction  Notable Alumni  Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group Jiang Jianqing, Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Yu Zhiying, Chinese professional go player  Campuses  SUFE has four campuses.

He was a staff writer at The New Yorker, where he wrote a regular column on business and finance called \\"The Financial Page\\". Background Surowiecki was born in Meriden, Connecticut and spent several childhood years in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico where he received a junior high school education from Southwestern Educational Society (SESO). On May 5, 1979, he won the Scripps- Howard Regional Puerto Rico Spelling Bee championship. He is a 1984 graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall and a 1988 alumnus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a Morehead Scholar. Surowiecki pursued Ph.D. studies in American history on a Mellon Fellowship at Yale University from 1988 to 1995, but did not complete his studies and did not receive a doctoral degree. In 1995, he founded the now-defunct e-magazine Rogue and began a career in journalism. He lives in Brooklyn, New York and is married to Slate culture editor Meghan O'Rourke. Career Surowiecki's writing has appeared in a wide range of publications, including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Motley Fool, Foreign Affairs, Artforum, Wired, MIT Technology Review, and Slate. Before joining The New Yorker, he wrote ‚ÄúThe Bottom Line‚Äù column for New York magazine and was a contributing editor at Fortune. He got his start on the Internet when he was hired from graduate school by Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner, to be the Fool's editor-in-chief of its culture site on America Online, entitled \\"Rogue\\" (1995‚Äì1996). As The Motley Fool closed that site down and focused on finance, Surowiecki made the switch over to become a finance writer, which he did over the succeeding three years, including being assigned to write the Fool's column on Slate from 1997 to 2000. In 2002, Surowiecki edited an anthology, Best Business Crime Writing of the Year, a collection of articles from different business news sources that chronicle the fall from grace of various CEOs. In 2004, he published The Wisdom of Crowds, in which he argued that in some circumstances, large groups exhibit more intelligence than smaller, more elite groups, and that collective intelligence shapes business, economies, societies and nations. In an article in the Huffington Post in November 2013, Internet entrepreneur and researcher Neil Seeman drew on social media trends over the time since the publication of The Wisdom of Crowds to observe that Mr. Surowiecki wrote his observations about collective intelligence \\"prior to the proliferation of Facebook and Twitter and 'social filtering'; today, online, we increasingly do not reach any wisdom of any independently-minded crowds.

Film: An International History of the Medium. [London]: Thames and Hudson, [c. 1990]. p. 526. Film shots are an essential aspect of a movie where angles, transitions and cuts are used to further express emotion, ideas and movement. The term \\"shot\\" can refer to two different parts of the filmmaking process: #In production, a shot is the moment that the camera starts rolling until the moment it stops. #In film editing, a shot is the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts.Ascher, Steven, and Edward Pincus. The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age. New York: Plume, 1999. p. 214. Etymology The term \\"shot\\" is derived from the early days of film production when cameras were hand-cranked, and operated similarly to the hand- cranked machine guns of the time. That is, a cameraman would \\"shoot\\" film the way someone would \\"shoot\\" bullets from a machine gun.\\"Movie Speak; Scissorhands Revisited.\\" 10 August 2009. Podcast. \\"KCRW's The Business.\\" KCRW 89.9 FM. 12 August 2009.  Categories of shots  Shots can be categorized in a number of ways. =By field size= The field size explains how much of the subject and its surrounding area is visible within the camera's field of view, and is determined by two factors: the distance of the subject from the camera (\\"camera-subject distance\\") and the focal length of the lens. Note that the shorter a lens's focal length, the wider its angle of view (the 'angle' in wide-angle lens, for instance, which is \\"how much you see\\"), so the same idea can also be expressed as that the lens's angle of view plus camera-subject distance is the camera's field of view. :Caution: In this context, the focal length value differs with each film gauge and CCD size for optical reasons, but the angle of view is the same for any of them, so it's easier comparing the angle of view with lenses for different formats than their focal lengths. The same angle of view always gives the same field size at the same camera- subject distance no matter what format you're using, but the same focal length does not. :For in-depth information behind the laws of optics regarding the influence that focal length and different formats have on field sizes, see 35 mm equivalent focal length, crop factor, image sensor format, and Digital photography: Sensor size and angle of view. The same field size can be achieved at varied camera-subject distances by using a lens with a compensating focal length, and at varied focal lengths by choosing a compensating camera-subject distance. Field size differs from framing in that within professional environments where prime lenses are dominant, the latter applies only to camera placement (including camera angle), not focal length. However, maintaining an identical field size at varying camera-subject distances and focal lengths must be handled with caution as it applies different amounts of perspective distortion to the image: wide-angle lenses expand a perspective, while long focus lenses compress a perspective. The famous dolly zoom, taken with a variable focal length lens, is a vivid, intuitive demonstration of this effect. Thus, it's more common in photography and cinematography to determine an image's field size by only changing one out of the two factors. When shooting video or film with human subjects, it is best to avoid cutting off human subjects with the bottom of the frame at the natural cut-off points (joints, neck). When the frame cuts off the subject at these positions, it looks unnatural. Therefore, filmmakers utilize the following shot types because the brain understands that the body continues beneath what it sees in the frame. This is because of a psychological term called closure that refers to the human brain seeking complete perception of the subject. The field size (along with the specific amount of perspective distortion) greatly affects the narrative power of a shot. There are a number of standardized field sizes, the names of which are commonly derived from varying camera-subject distances while not changing the lens. Four basic kinds of field sizes (marked with an asterisk* in the gallery below) are: *the long shot or wide shot (often used as an establishing shot), that shows the environment around the subjects, *the full shot, where the entirety of the subject is just visible within the frame, *the medium-long shot, where the frame ends near the knees, *the medium shot, where the frame stops either just above or just below the waist, *the medium close-up, where more of the shoulder is visible than in the close-up, *the close-up, where the shoulder line is visible, *the extreme close-up, where the frame stops at the subject's chin and forehead. Three less often used field sizes (see gallery below) are: *the extreme long shot (used for epic views and panoramas), *the American shot (also 3/4 shot), a slight variation of the medium shot to also include OWB handgun holsters in Western movies, a characterization from French film criticism for a type of shot in certain American films of the 1930s and 1940s also referred to as a \\"Cowboy shot\\" in reference to the gun holster being just above the bottom frame line, *the \\"Italian shot\\", where only a person's eyes are visible, named after the genre of Italo-Westerns, particularly the Dollars Trilogy by Sergio Leone, that established this particular field size. = By camera placement = \\"Shots\\" referring to camera placement and angle rather than field size include:Ascher, 214-218 *Camera angles: **the aerial shot, **the bird's-eye shot (sometimes performed as a crane shot), **the low-angle shot, *the over the shoulder shot, *the point of view shot, *the reverse shot is defined as a 180-degree camera turn to the preceding image, common in point of view and over the shoulder (in the latter, care must be applied to avoid a continuity error by violating the 180 degree rule), *the two shot where two people are in the picture. = By other criteria = *the establishing shot is defined by giving an establishing \\"broad overview\\" over a scene, whether performed by a wide shot with a fixed camera, a zoom, a series of different close-ups achieved by camera motion, or a sequence of independent close-angle shots edited right after each other, *the master shot is a scene done in one single take, with no editing, *the freeze frame shot is created in editing by displaying a single frame for an elongated duration of time, *the insert shot is created in editing by replacing a picture with another while the audio stays the same (common in interviews to illustrate topics mentioned). *the Trolley shot A shot in which the camera moves toward or away from its subject while filming. Traditionally dolly shots are filmed from a camera dolly but the same motion may also be performed with a Steadicam, gimbal, etc. A dolly shot is generally described in terms of \\"dollying in\\" or \\"dollying out\\". Trucking in and out is also a common synonym  Film editing  A film editor at work in 1946 Cutting between shots taken at different times or from different perspectives is known as film editing, and is one of the central arts of filmmaking.Ascher, 346 Duration The length of shots is an important consideration that can greatly affect a film. The purpose of editing any given scene is to create a representation of the way the scene might be perceived by the \\"story teller.\\" Shots with a longer duration can make a scene seem more relaxed and slower paced whereas shots with a shorter duration can make a scene seem urgent and faster paced. The average shot length (ASL) of a film is one of its cinemetrical measures. For example, The Mist has a length of 117 minutes and consists of 1292 shots, so the ASL is 5.4 seconds, while Russian Ark is a single 96-minute long take, so an ASL of 96 minutes or about 5,760 seconds, a factor of 1,000 difference. Shots with extremely long durations are difficult to do because any error in the shot would force the filmmaker to restart from scratch, and are thus only occasionally used. Films famous for their long cuts include Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather in which the entire first scene is a long take featuring Bonasera describing the assault on his daughter, and Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, which only cuts at the end of each reel, and does so surreptitiously so that it seems as if the whole film is one take. Orson Welles's Touch of Evil opens with a long tracking crane shot, as does Robert Altman's The Player. In addition to Russian Ark, which was made in 2002 using digital recording technology, other films known for their extremely long takes include Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and the works of Andrei Tarkovsky starting with Solaris. B√©la Tarr is also known for using very long takes consistently in his films. Joss Whedon's feature film Serenity introduces the main characters with a long take. Although Fish & Cat is a single 134-minute long take, the narrator succeeded in playing with time and including several flashbacks.

After a pitch to recruit James into the agency, James initially declines until he reconsiders it as an opportunity to get answers to his father‚Äôs mysterious plane crash in Peru several years earlier. James passes the initial security screening and is bussed with the rest of his class to The Farm in rural Virginia where they undergo training as potential operatives. While there, James develops an attraction to Layla Moore (Moynahan) and a rivalry with Zack (Macht) whom is James‚Äô competition for top of the class. One night during a training exercise in which James and Layla are paired together to tail a mark, they are abducted by masked assailants and imprisoned where they are tortured psychologically and physically for several days. Their interrogators wish to know what happens at The Farm and the names of those who teach there. After resisting for days, James breaks when he‚Äôs told about Layla‚Äôs brutal treatment. He reveals Burke‚Äôs name, at which point it‚Äôs revealed that the whole experience was part of the exercise that the class was observing, including Layla, and that James failed by breaking. He is then dismissed from The Farm and the Agency. Later, Burke seeks out a despondent James and informs him that his discharge was part of a cover story because he‚Äôs been selected as a non-official cover operative, or ‚ÄúNOC‚Äù. He gives James a low-level data entry position at the Agency so he can get close to Layla who has graduated from the Farm and now holds a desk position higher in the Agency than James. Burke explains that Layla is suspected of working with foreign agents to steal CIA secrets, specifically a highly sensitive computer virus called \\"ICE-9\\" because it transmits via the electrical grid rather than telecommunications and is easily capable of disabling all electrical devices on the planet instantly, thus behaving similarly to the particle from the Kurt Vonnegut novel Cat's Cradle. James reunites with Layla and the two begin a romantic relationship. While staying overnight at her home, he checks her laptop for evidence of her crimes and she plants a bug on the lapel of his winter coat. Later, he witnesses her making a dead drop at Union Station, and follows the mysterious agent who retrieves what Layla left behind. The two end up in a shootout on the train tracks and the agent, who is revealed to be Zack, is killed. Believing both of them to be traitors, James confronts Layla who tells him that Zack was the NOC, not him, and that she was tasked with assessing the security protocols of the CIA headquarters because it was feared that someone else was stealing CIA material. James then goes to a meet with Burke wherein he confronts Burke about what‚Äôs really happening. Burke claims that Zack‚Äôs death was faked, that the gun Burke gave James is loaded with non-lethal ammunition, and that everyone is intending to rendezvous for debrief momentarily. However, Burke catches James off guard and shoots at him, narrowly missing him but blowing out the rear window of his vehicle in the process, proving that the gun was in fact loaded with live ammunition and therefore Zack is indeed dead. Burke pursues James through the abandoned warehouse they were parked outside of, explaining to James along the way why he set up the elaborate lie to implicate them and cover up his own crimes of selling Agency secrets to foreign governments. James meanwhile has set up a laptop running Spartacus though it failed to connect, however he leads Burke to believe it successfully transmitted his confession back to the Agency and he‚Äôs now incriminated for everything. Burke angrily destroys the laptop and pursues James outside of the warehouse where a CIA strike team lead by Dennis Slayne (Pruner), another Farm instructor, is waiting. Burke launches into a tirade, airing his grievances against the Agency, believing that he was never appreciated for all the sacrifices he made in his career. Slayne realizes that Burke is the one they‚Äôre looking for and directs the strike team to target Burke to take into custody, revealing they were originally there to arrest James. Realizing now that he really is incriminated, Burke refuses to be taken into custody and instead raises his empty gun at the strike team who quickly shoot and kill him. Slayne then drives James back to headquarters for a debrief, cryptically mentioning along the way that James was meant to be in that line of work because ‚Äúit‚Äôs in [his] blood‚Äù suggesting his father in fact worked for the agency, despite Burke‚Äôs earlier denial of such.

It was entered into the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival. The sex scenes in the film sparked uproar and disapproval from the audience and critics after the release. Restless was followed by Me and Morrison (2001) and Addiction (2004). Restless was co-written by Aleksi Bardy and its director, Aku Louhimies. However, they did not participate in the two sequels. Plot The film is about Ari (Mikko Nousiainen), a 27-year-old ambulance doctor with a terminally ill mother. One-night stands are his main pastime. He doesn't want to meet any of the girls again because he is certain that commitment equals pain. But one day Ari realises that he can't feel anything at all. Then he meets a woman named Tiina (Laura Malmivaara) on the beach. That same day they have sex in Ari's apartment and Tiina enters her phone number into Ari's in order to exchange contact details. At first Ari ignores Tiina's attempts to phone him to the amusement of his married colleague, Roope. Ari subsequently relents and they start dating each other reaching the point where Tiina, falling in love, begins to look for commitment. However, on Ari's birthday when Tiina brings him a cake to his apartment she arrives as another woman is leaving. Nonetheless she decides to maintain the relationship with him though expressing her desire for exclusivity. Ari is later introduced to Tiina's friends who include two other couples, Ilona an archaeologist who is dating Stig and Hanna-Riikka a priest who is dating and living with Riku. This introduction takes place as the five pre-existing companions sail to an island to celebrate the Mid-Summer Festival. During this holiday the six have a conversation in which Hanna-Riikka states that man is nothing without belief to which Ari immediately responds: \\"Then that must mean I am an ape.\\" The others laugh and Hanna-Riikka walks out. Ilona shows a clear interest in Ari and later initiates a sexual encounter with him. This affair continues for an unspecified length of time during which Ari and Tiina move in together and Hanna-Riikka confronts Ari with her suspicions of what's happening between him and Ilona. When these are confirmed Hanna-Rikka also confronts Ilona about her behaviour and is accused of being a hypocritical lesbian. When the Ilona and Ari decide to have one last episode of intercourse they are discovered by Stig who tells Tiina about the affair and Ari moves out. Riku offers him use of his couch much to Hanna-Riikka's displeasure. Meanwhile, Tiina discovers that she is pregnant and later gets a commitment from Ari to resume the relationship with the aim of being a responsible father to their child. Late one night Ari is called to Roope's house because his heavy drinking has precipitated the breakdown of his marriage to Piia. Ari arrives to find Roope with a bottle of spirits and his revolver. After Roope tells him about the fallout of his alcoholism, Ari says that Piia is actually outside sulking in the front garden. Roope asks Ari to talk to his wife because he considers Ari more knowledgeable about how to talk to women and gives Ari his revolver to prevent him from killing himself. Later, when Ari goes to his old apartment Tiina tells him that the hospital has called to inform him of his mother's death. The pair attends the funeral together. Then the film progresses to Tiina and Ilona reconciling, as do Ari and Stig who asks Ari to be his best man as the affair with Ilona apparently helped clarify Stig's perspective of the relationship to the point where marriage appeared feasible. The wedding is to be officiated by Hanna-Riikka, who by now has separated from Riku, and to be held on the island where the six earlier holidayed. During one of the drinking games they usually engage in, Hanna-Rikka states that she has never climaxed during sexual intercourse prompting Riku to walk out and the two are later seen arguing. At the reception Ari, in deep contemplation, tells Tiina that they need to talk. Once they are alone Ari states \\"What are we going to do?\\" to which Tiina again questions the commitment of Ari by arguing that they should get married. Ari opposes her and says that they should separate. To this, Tiina is shocked, so she proceeds to drink excessively at the wedding prompting Ilona to try stop her. Tiina ends up revealing to the groom that Ari has, in fact, only recently slept with the bride and also the priest. This leads to a confrontation with Ari using the butt of Roope's former revolver to knock both Stig and Riku to the ground and he leaves the reception. The film ends with narrating Ari's thoughts as he gets away from it all by physically distancing himself by travelling, Tiina has given birth, Ilona is lecturing while Stig and Riku have maintained their friendship. In the last scene Ari returns to a church where Hanna-Riikka is working.

Isert was born in Angerm√ºnde, Brandenburg, but educated in Berlin. He was the first scientist to identify the bird Red Bishop (Euplectes orix franciscana (Isert)'. He is also known for his attempts to end the Danish-Norwegian slave trade. He was appointed Chief Surgeon to Christiansborg (Osu, Accra) in Danish Guinea, arriving there in 1783. He sought this position because of his burning desire to collect plant specimens from West Africa. Once there, realizing that the inhabitants had no written language, he felt it his duty to record ‚Äì for future generations ‚Äì details of all aspects of life on the Gold Coast, as he observed them, thus creating an ethnographic, as well as botanical, work. After nearly three years on the Gold Coast Isert abruptly determined to leave the country on the first possible ship back to Europe. This was due to his extreme frustration at being hindered from exploring in Ashanti. It was on this ship, a slave ship en route from Danish Guinea, on the second day at sea, that he witnessed a slave rebellion on the open sea, which almost cost him his life. The cargo of 452 blacks rose against the whites, with a resulting loss of 34 of their number and 2 of the crew wounded after a heated battle. In the West Indies, he visited Saint Croix, Saint. Thomas, Saint John, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Sickened by the horror and human misery he saw, both in the slave- processing dungeons of Christiansborg, aboard the ship, and on the sugar plantations, Isert came up with an alternative to the abhorrent practice of the transatlantic slave trade. He found it not only inhumane, cruel and immoral, but also absurdly stupid. In a letter sent from Saint Croix in 1787 to his father, Isert asked questions: :Why were our forefathers not sensible enough to establish plantations right there in the fertile continent of Africa; plantations for sugar, coffee, cacao, cotton and other articles that had become so necessary in Europe? :\\"...if we had come to them with an olive branch in our hand instead of murderous steel, the natives would willingly have given us access to the best and most fertile parts of their lands, areas which for untold years had been lying desolate.\\" These African people would have helped us in freedom and, for low wages would have given us greatness and riches with no offense against nature, or our personal and national consciences. Why did we have to uproot vast numbers of people from their homelands, subject them to agony, torture, humiliation, and death; transplant them to alien continents, Caribbean islands, big and small? Why? Isert wanted to demonstrate that the establishment of working plantations on the continent of Africa could be practical and profitable. To this end, he enlisted the aid of Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann, who was then the Danish-Norwegian Minister of Finance. Schimmelmann, a well-known and well-off liberal, who was instrumental in the passage of the law ending the Danish-Norwegian transatlantic slave trade, agreed to finance Isert's endeavour. In 1788, Isert published his famous book Reise nach Guinea und den Carib√§ischen Inseln in Columbia (Journey to Guinea and the Caribbean Islands in Columbia), wherein he described his experiences with, and his views on, the slave trade. Later in the summer, he sailed for Africa and established a crown plantation, Frederiksnopel, near Akropong in the fertile and cool Akwapim Hills reminiscent of the Mediterranean, purchasing the land from the Akwapim chief, Nana Obuobi Atiemo, on behalf of the King Christian VII of Denmark. Isert and Nana Obuobi Atiemo had been comrades-in-arms during a war in 1783, waged at the Volta River, and had evidently formed a lasting friendship. With the help of Nana Obuobi Atiemo, who shared Isert's enthusiasm about the plan, paid African workers and the European group that had accompanied Isert, cleared the land and planted only easily cultivated plants, for their own sustenance. Trade products, such as sugar and cotton, would be put off until later. On 16 January 1789, Isert wrote a report to the King of Denmark in which he expressed the fine initial success that he was enjoying. Isert died on 21 January 1789, just five days after writing the report. It was believed that Isert had died from a tropical fever. His wife, Dorothea Elisabeth Plum died a short time after the birth of their child, a daughter, who also died, a month later, on 8 March. Isert's assistants attempted to carry on the project at Frederiksnopel, as did some others, but it failed due to various factors; such as distance from the sea, lack of support, and competition from Christiansborg. Convinced of the feasibility of the plantations, an edict was issued in the name of King Christian VII by his son Prince Frederick (who was then Regent because of his father's mental illness) on 16 March 1792, which came into effect on 1 January 1803. Denmark-Norway thus bears the honour of being the first established sovereign state to prohibit the transatlantic slave trade. But ultimately, the experimental plantations proved to be unsuccessful.

Five public experimental centers for teaching and research are under construction, namely the Center of Physical Science, Life Science, Information Science, Engineering and Material Science, and Application of Synchrotron Radiation. Main library building located in the West Campus =Hospital= The school hospital, is a specific attachment to the university, and holds the aim of providing such services as disease prevention, health care, treatment and health education for the teaching staff and the students. After over forty years of development and construction, the hospital has been steadily expanded, the level of treatment has continuously improved, and the equipment has constantly been upgraded. The hospital covers 5,200 m2, with 110 beds and more than 110 employees. The hospital is committed to the treatment and health care services for over 10,000 students, about 3,000 teachers and more than 700 retired employees, plus the families of the employees who live on the campus, which adds up to more than 20,000 people. A branch hospital and an outpatient department have been established separately on the west and the south campuses that are also centers for students' living and studying activities. The medical personnel are on duty around the clock for the convenience of the people. In addition to carrying out daily diagnosis and treatment, the school hospital also, according to the college hygiene regulations, undertakes physical examination services under the principle of prevention. It is already a convention for students to take physical examinations both after their entrance and before graduation, and another check during their college years. Physical examinations are given every two years for school personnel and those who have retired. To fulfill the demands of the science-major students for medical knowledge, the corresponding doctors of the school hospital have compiled a book titled Health Education for College Students, which, as the textbook for the selective course of health education, illuminates medical knowledge systematically from various angles. In recent years, this course has been taken by increasing numbers of students, and the title \\"advanced collective\\" has been bestowed on the hospital by the education authorities.

Founded in 1948 by a group of Colombian intellectuals led by Mario Laserna Pinz√≥n, it was the first Colombian university established as nonsectarian (independent from any political party or religious institution). Los Andes has consistently been regarded as the best Colombian university and has been considered one of the top 5 Latin American universities and one of the top 250 world universities, according to both the QS World Top University Ranking and the Times Higher Education Classification. The university is academically composed of nine schools, three special academic entities‚Äîthe Alberto Lleras Camargo School of Government, the Center for Research and Training in Education (, CIFE), and the Interdisciplinary Center for Development Studies (, CIDER)‚Äîand a joint academic venture with the medical institution Santa Fe de Bogot√° Foundation, offering 31 undergraduate, 18 doctoral, and 38 graduate degree-granting programs in areas of human knowledge such as medicine, engineering, science, law and others. As of 2011, the university had given birth to 128 research groups recognized by Colciencias, most of them in the social sciences, mathematics, physics and engineering. By 2017, the number of groups recognized by Colciencias has increased to 153 research groups. It is one of the few Colombian universities to have received the maximum high quality institutional accreditation by the Colombian Ministry of Education, given in January 2015. History =Historical context= In 1930, the Colombian presidential elections resulted in the appointment of Liberal party candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera to an office that had been, since 1880, under Conservative control. The latter years of this Conservative Republic were punctuated by events such as the Banana massacre, which may have been a contributing factor to the Colombian Conservative Party's loss of the presidency. Liberal president Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo started the Revoluci√≥n en Marcha in 1934. During this new period of Liberal government, known as the Liberal Republic, the administrations of Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo (1934-1938 and 1942-1946) implemented changes intended to modernize the country. Restructuring of higher education, in particular of the National University of Colombia in 1935, agrarian reform in 1936, and general promotion of industrialization resulted in rapid economic changes and growth. According to some estimates, around 50% of existing Colombian corporations in 1945 were founded between 1940 and 1945, promoting the accumulation of wealth and the creation of a new middle class with political interests and international aspirations. However, in order to continue industrial development, there was an urgent need for skilled labor, reflected in the speech given by the Colombian Minister of Education to the Congress of Colombia in 1946: These words echo the suggestions made around 35 years earlier by liberal leader Rafael Uribe Uribe regarding the need for the modernization of the educational system. These intellectual currents were coherent with previous educational developments such as the foundation of the Gimnasio Moderno in 1914. Amid the political tension and violence caused by the loss of liberal power in the 1946 elections, social unrest, and industrial growth, leftist liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n was assassinated on April 9, 1948, in an event that shook the country and was taken by the founders as \\"the best argument for the foundation of the university\\". =Foundation and early years (1949-1955)= In November 1948, around a year after arriving back in Colombia from Columbia University, accompanied by intellectuals from the elites of both traditional parties, Mario Laserna Pinz√≥n founded the Universidad de los Andes as the first nonsectarian and non-politically affiliated university in Colombia. The main goals with the establishment of the University were to provide Colombia with professionals whose technical knowledge benefited the development of the country, which made it necessary for them to study abroad and bring this knowledge back; and who would become leaders of their nation in the post-war world, facilitated by founders, faculty, and staff occupying important posts in government and institutions. In practice, Uniandes would be modeled after the American university, and its students would receive not only technical but also liberal education, in accordance to the need for the development of the human intellect for a practical, altruistic purpose, as per the Declaration of the Principles of the Founders. Classes started the 29th of March, 1949, with only 80 students taking courses from a small set of faculties and schools. Of note was the Colegio de Estudios Superiores, or college, which was modeled on the American university college and had the responsibilities of offering classes on Humanities, Spanish, English, Contemporary Civilization, and Colombian Geography & History. Classes belonging to distinct curricula, but not specific to each, such as mathematics for Engineering and Architecture students, were also the responsibility of the college. By the second academic year, in 1950, there were around 400 applications for 110 places of study in Uniandes. Increasing political violence in Colombia during the 1950s did not change the University's stance towards political neutrality, and the inclusion of government representatives in the Board, as well as rectors and administrative staff belonging to both Conservative and Liberal parties, ensured good relations with conservative, military, and liberal Colombian administrations. Starting in 1950, the three/two program was established at first with the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Through it, Uniandes students were able to course 5 semesters, or three years, at home, and then transfer to an American university to complete their undergraduate program. Participating universities included Pittsburgh, MIT, Vanderbilt, and Texas, among others. The funds for tuition expenses in the United States were initially provided by Colombian industries such as Avianca and Paz del R√≠o Steelworks; American philanthropic institutions (the Rockefeller Foundation); and Colombian, Canadian, and American private individuals. To manage these assets, the University hired ICETEX, a government agency established by University founder and then- Minister of Education Gabriel Betancourt, whose objective was to promote Colombian students abroad through grants and scholarships. Throughout the early 1950s, diverse experiments were carried out by the University as per its aspirations to fulfill the needs of its country and become an internationally recognized institution. Some of them failed, such as the Faculty of Aeronautic Sciences, due to low student interest; the Institute for Conservation of Natural Resources, which granted non-professional degrees on its subject matter; and the Preparatory Lyceum of Pereira, intended to equip high school students of this city with the necessary tools to thrive in Uniandes. Important successes were attained by the Cultural Extension Section: the organization of academic conferences whose speakers included the likes of John von Neumann, Arnold J. Toynbee, Hideki Yukawa, Thornton Wilder, and others. The subjects and structure of these conferences would give way to the establishment of the Female Section of the University in 1953, though its programs of study did not confer professional degrees. Active recruitment of foreign professors from abroad and from other Colombian educational institutions, such as the National University, the Normal Superior School, and the Gimnasio Moderno, was also an important strategy for the administrative staff in the initial years of Uniandes. =Later developments (1955-present)=  Mission  The University of Los Andes states that it is ‚Äúan autonomous, independent, and innovative institution that fosters pluralism, tolerance, and respect for ideas; it seeks academic excellence and imparts to its students a critical and ethical training to strengthen their awareness of their social and civic responsibilities, as well as their commitment to the environment.‚Äù  Staff  Los Andes' faculty members were mainly full-time academics, of whom 70% had a PhD from a top university in the world. Los Andes has traditionally supported instructors in undertaking their master's and PhD studies in different subject areas in renowned foreign universities.  Student population  * 55% male, 45% female * 30% come from outside Bogot√° * 95% of the undergraduate students come from the top 1% of the high school students in the country  Academic structure  Mario Laserna building of University of los Andes Students can register in classes from all academic programs offered at Los Andes; this interdisciplinary approach allows students to design their own curricular program, with the assistance of academic advisors. The following scheme shows the academic structure at Uniandes, which includes four cycles: a Basic Professional Cycle (CBP, in Spanish), which refers to the basic subjects belonging to each program; a Cycle of Elective Courses in Socio-humanistic issues (CSH, in Spanish), common to all programs and that offers about 180 courses; a Professional Cycle (CP, in Spanish), which includes the main professional subject for each program; and a Professional Complementary Cycle (CPC), which includes subjects from the specific program and subjects from other programs.  International students  International students can attend the university as visiting students, who must be enrolled in at least three courses per semester, or exchange students, who can take between two and six courses per semester. Los Andes has academic exchange programs with more than 119 universities in 34 countries worldwide. Best teachers from University Work at Nazarbayev Intellectual School. Give lessons to Abylai and Abzal from 11B grade.  Campus  Campus of University of Los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia, taken from neighboring buildings of CityU, in January, 2017. Uniandes started academic activities in terrains rented from the Community of the Good Shepherd, a religious institution, and would continue to do so for around five years before buying the first plots of land, with a size of approximately 0.025 square kilometers. Included in the purchase were several buildings that were used by the religious community, such as a convent and a prison for women. Due to the low university population, the existing buildings were mostly restored and conditioned to provide adequate facilities for academic activities. The campus is largely made up of a mixture of renovated industrial and religious buildings and newly constructed facilities. The infrastructure covers 180,551 sq mt and includes approximately 116 classrooms, 219 laboratories, a central library, and five satellite libraries (specialized by areas), were more than 445,000 books are available for students. It also has 26 computer rooms and six service units that hire out laptops, offering nearly 2,000 computers for student use (16.5 computers for each 100 students). As of 2017, there are 3,019 computers available for student use in the computer rooms. In 1956 a metallic cylindrical structure now known as La Caneca (the Trash Bin) was installed on campus. La Caneca is the sports center of the university and it is composed of a gym, a pool, and various courts for sports like tennis, squash, and football. The university's campus is in Bogota's historical center, an area that houses most of the city‚Äôs buildings of cultural interest, universities, banks, and large Colombian companies; the main offices of the national and local government; and a variety of cultural meeting places, such as libraries, museums, theatres, scientific and literary centers, and art galleries. Also on campus are: * Central cafeteria and many other food stations inside and outside the campus * Gym and sports facilities * Health services * Rest and study areas In addition to the main campus, the university also has an Internships Center for the Medicine Faculty, located at the Fundaci√≥n Santa Fe de Bogot√°, in the northern part of the city. Uniandes and Fundaci√≥n Santa Fe‚Äîone of the most renowned medical institutions in the country‚Äîengage in a joint academic venture.  University rankings  Universidad de los Andes has been consistently ranked as the best university in Colombia and has been considered one of the top 5 Latin American universities and one of the top 250 in the world.  Organization and structure  The university has a Board of Directors, an Executive committee, a Rector, and three Vice Rectors, for academic and administrative management. It also has a General Secretary, an Academic Council, department deans and coordinators, Faculty Councils, academic and administrative staff and departments for the smooth operation of the institution.  Mascot  The mascot of Uniandes is a goat called Seneca, after the Roman Stoic philosopher. Its story dates back to the late 1940s when a goat roamed the campus freely. Students adopted it, and it soon became a symbol of the university. The goat died in 1966 when it fell off a cliff. Today it is not possible to keep a goat on campus, but Seneca is fondly remembered. The wireless spots are named after the goat, and every year a goat is brought to the university to celebrate \\"Students' Day.\\"  Notable alumni  * C√©sar Gaviria ‚Äì President of Colombia from 1990 to 1994 and Secretary General of the Organization of American States (1994-2004) * Alejandro Gaviria Uribe ‚Äì Former 3rd Minister of Health and Social Protection of Colombia * Andrea Echeverri - Musician, lead singer of alternative rock band Aterciopelados * Patricia Cardoso - Filmmaker * Juan Carlos Echeverry (politician) ‚Äì Current CEO of Ecopetrol and was the 68th Minister of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia * Mar√≠a √Ångela Holgu√≠n ‚Äì Former Minister of Foreign Affairs, formerly the 25th Colombian Ambassador to the UN and Ambassador to Venezuela * Rafael Pardo Rueda ‚Äì Former 1st Minister of Labour of Colombia and formerly member of the Colombian Senate * Maria Fernanda Cardoso - Artist * Carlos Rodado Noriega ‚Äì Current Colombia Ambassador to Argentina, formerly 28th and 9th Minister of Mines and Energy of Colombia, Ambassador to Spain and member of the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia * Sergio Fajardo ‚Äì Former Governor of Antioquia (2012-2016) and mayor of Medellin (2004-2007) * Sim√≥n V√©lez ‚Äì Prize-winning architect known for his innovative use of bamboo as an essential building component * Luis Caballero (painter) ‚Äì Famous Colombian painter * Paola Turbay ‚Äì Colombian-American actress and former Miss Colombia (1992) * Gabriela Tafur ‚ÄìMiss Colombia (2018) * Ana Maria Rey ‚Äì Colombian theoretical physicist awarded the Genius Grant by the MacArthur Foundation for her research on ultra-cold atoms (1999) * Helena Groot de Restrepo - Professor, microbiologist, geneticist  See also  * List of Muisca research institutes * Excellence research centers in Colombia  References   External links  * Universidad de los Andes website Category:Educational institutions established in 1948 Category:Universities and colleges in Colombia Category:Universities and colleges in Bogot√° Category:1948 establishments in Colombia ","title":"University of Los Andes (Colombia)"},{"id":"919468","text":"Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc was a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company,See \\"A lot has been happening at Intrawest...and Snowshoe Mountain\\" ; \\"SkiSoutheast News\\", www.skisoutheast.tv, August 14, 2006. which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full. In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages. Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas. In May 2017, it was announced that Intrawest would no longer exist as public company after its acquisition by Henry Crown and Company and KSL Capital Partners. Intrawest resorts are now operated by Alterra Mountain Company, which announced its new name at the 2018 Outdoor Retailer show in Denver, Colorado. History In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012. Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world. On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, \\"for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets.\\" In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions. Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company's longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold to Henry Crown and Company (which owns Aspen Skiing Company) and KSL Capital Partners for $1.5 billion. In May 2017, it was announced that Intrawest would no longer exist as public company. The newly formed company is called Alterra Mountain Company, which was announced at the 2018 Outdoor Retailer Show in Denver, Colorado.https://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/09/aspen-steamboat-ski-area- merger/ https://www.denverpost.com/2017/04/10/intrawest-aspen-ksl-capital/ Latest resorts Resorts owned at least in part by Intrawest included: *Blue Mountain, Ontario *Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia *Steamboat Ski Resort, Colorado *Stratton Mountain Resort, Vermont *Mont Tremblant Resort, Quebec *Canadian Mountain Holidays, Alberta *Winter Park, Colorado (Intrawest is contracted to operate this city park which is owned by the City of Denver.) *Zihuatanejo, Mexico *Deer Valley Resort, Utah =Former resorts= * Mont Ste.

The best-known version is the one collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 161). An older, somewhat shorter version, \\"The Ungrateful Dwarf\\", was written by Caroline Stahl (1776‚Äì1837). Indeed, that appears to be the oldest variant; no previous oral version is known, although several have been collected since its publication in 1818.Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p. 772, Oral versions are very limited regionally.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p. 100, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977. The tale is of Aarne-Thompson type 426 (\\"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf\\"). This story is not related to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \\"Snow White\\" that provided the basis for the 1937 Walt Disney animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The modern German name of that heroine is Schneewittchen rather than Schneewei√üchen. This story has little in common but the similar name of its fair-haired girl. \\"Snow-White and Rose-Red\\" does feature encounters with one dwarf. Plot Snow-White and Rose-Red are two little girls living with their mother, a poor widow, in a small cottage by the woods. Fair-haired Snow-White is quiet and shy and prefers to spend her time indoors, doing housework and reading. Dark-haired Rose-Red is outspoken, lively and cheerful, and prefers to be outside. They are both very good girls who love each other and their mother dearly, and their mother is very fond of them as well. One winter night, there is a knock at the door. Rose-Red opens the door to find a bear. At first, she is terrified, but the bear tells her not to be afraid. \\"I'm half frozen and I merely want to warm up a little at your place,\\" he says. They let the bear in, and he lies down in front of the fire. Snow-White and Rose-Red beat the snow off the bear, and they quickly become quite friendly with him. They play with the bear and roll him around playfully. They let the bear spend the night in front of the fire. In the morning, he leaves trotting out into the woods. The bear comes back every night for the rest of that winter and the family grows used to him. Illustration for Josephine Pollard's book Hours in Fairy Land, published in 1883 When summer comes, the bear tells them that he must go away for a while to guard his treasure from a wicked dwarf. During the summer, when the girls are walking through the forest, they find a dwarf whose beard is stuck in a tree. The girls rescue him by cutting his beard free, but the dwarf is ungrateful and yells at them for cutting his beautiful beard. The girls encounter the dwarf several times that summer, rescue him from some peril each time and the dwarf is ungrateful. Then one day, they meet the dwarf once again. This time, he is terrified because the bear is about to kill him. The dwarf pleads with the bear and begs it to eat the girls. Instead, the bear pays no heed to his plea and kills the dwarf with one swipe of his paw. Instantly, the bear turns into a prince. The dwarf had previously put a spell on the prince by stealing his precious stones and turning him into a bear. The curse is broken with the death of the dwarf. Snow-White marries the prince and Rose-Red marries the prince's brother.

Cornplanter: Chief Warrior of the Allegany Senecas (The Iroquois and Their Neighbors). N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. known as Gai√§nt'wak√™ (Gyantwachia - ‚Ä≥the planter‚Ä≥) or Kaiiontwa'kon (Kaintwakon - \\"By What One Plants\\") in the Seneca language and thus generally known as Cornplanter, was a Dutch-Seneca war chief and diplomat of the Wolf clan. As a chief warrior, Cornplanter fought in the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. In both wars, the Seneca and three other Iroquois nations were allied with the British. After the war Cornplanter led negotiations with the United States and was a signatory of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784). He helped gain Iroquois neutrality during the Northwest Indian War. In the postwar years, Cornplanter worked to learn more about European-American ways and invited Quakers to establish schools in Seneca territory. Disillusioned by his people's poor reaction to European-American society, he had the schools closed and followed his half-brother Handsome Lake's movement returning to the traditional Seneca way and religion. The United States government granted him about 1500 acres of former Seneca territory in Pennsylvania in 1796 for \\"him and his heirs forever\\", which became known as the Cornplanter Tract. After Cornplanter's lineage died off, the tract was planned by the federal government to be flooded as the site of a man-made reservoir after 1965 by completion of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River. The remains of Cornplanter, his descendants, and an 1866 monument to him were relocated. Most of the remaining residents were forced to relocate to the Allegany Reservation of the federally recognized Seneca Nation of New York; they lost much of their fertile farmland. Early life Cornplanter was born between 1732 and 1746 at Canawaugus (now in the Town of Caledonia) on the Genesee River in present-day New York State. He was the son of a Seneca woman, Gah-hon-no-neh (She Who Goes to the River), and a Dutch trader, Johannes \\"John\\" Abeel II.Abler, Thomas. Cornplanter: Chief Warrior of the Allegany Senecas. Syracuse University Press, page 13. The Dutch had settled in the area generations before, and Cornplanter's father, an Albany fur trader, was part of an established family. The Abeel family name was sometimes Gaelicized to O'Bail and O'Beal or anglicized to Abeele. John Abeel II (1722‚Äì1794) was connected to the Schuyler family, leaders in business and politics. The grandfather after whom he was named, Johannes Abeel I (1667-1711), was a trader and merchant who built up links with the indigenous people along his trade routes, and who served as the second mayor of Albany, later the capital of New York. The younger John Abeel was a gunsmith and was gladly accepted into the Indian community to repair their guns. Cornplanter was raised by his mother among the Seneca. His Seneca name, Gai√§nt'wak√™ (often spelled Gyantwachia), means \\"the planter,\\" and another variation, Kaintwakon, means \\"by what one plants.\\" As the Seneca and other Iroquois nations had a matrilineal system of kinship, Cornplanter was considered a member of his mother's clan, the Wolf Clan, which included many leaders in the relations between settlers and Indians, and gained his status from them. Males of the Wolf clan had a traditional function as war chiefs. War chief Cornplanter first became known as war chief of the Seneca when they allied with the French against the English during the French and Indian War (part of the Seven Years' War between the European nations). He was present at Braddock's defeat. During the American Revolution, both Cornplanter and his uncle, Chief Guyasutha, wanted the Iroquois nations to remain neutral. He believed the Iroquois should stay out of the white man's war. \\"War is war,\\" he told other Iroquois. \\"Death is death. A fight is a hard business.\\" Both the British and the American Patriots had urged the Iroquois nations to stay neutral. Both sides initially told Indians that there was no need for their involvement. When the fighting between the Colonists and the British heated up, however; both sides tried to recruit the Iroquois as allies. The British offered large amounts of goods, specifically rum and other goods, and built on their long trading relationship. The Iroquois League met together at Oswego in July 1777, to vote on their decision. Although Guysutha and Cornplanter voted for neutrality, when the majority of chiefs voted to side with the British, they both honored the majority decision. Because of the status of the Seneca as war chiefs among the Iroquois, most of the Iroquois Confederacy followed suit. Still, bands often made their own decisions as the people were highly decentralized. The Iroquois named Sayenqueraghta and Cornplanter as war chiefs of the four nations that allied with the British: the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga and Cayuga. Cornplanter joined forces with the Loyalist Lt. Colonel John Butler and his rangers at the 1778 Battle of Wyoming Valley in present-day Pennsylvania. They killed many settlers and destroyed their properties, in what the rebel Americans called the Wyoming Massacre. Fighting on the frontier was fierce. Patriot forces under Colonel Thomas Hartley burned the Seneca village of Tioga. In reprisal, Cornplanter and Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant participated in the 1778 Loyalist-Iroquois attacks led by Captain Walter Butler and Butler's Rangers in Cherry Valley, New York. The Americans called these events the Cherry Valley Massacre. During this offensive many unarmed patriot civilians were killed or captured. During this campaign, Cornplanter's men happened to capture his father Johannes Abeel after burning his house. Cornplanter, who had once gone as a young man to see Abeel, recognized him and offered apology. He invited Abeel to return with the Seneca or to go back to his white family. When his father chose the latter, Cornplanter had Seneca warriors accompany him in safety. After the victories of the Loyalist and Iroquois forces, commander-in-chief General George Washington commissioned Major General John Sullivan to invade Six Nation territory throughout New York and destroy Iroquois villages. At the Battle of Newtown, Sullivan defeated Iroquois and British troops. But Sullivan and his army of 5,000 men caused greater damage in their scorched earth campaign. They methodically destroyed Iroquois villages, farms, stored crops and animals between May and September 1779 throughout the Iroquois homeland (upstate and western New York). Cornplanter, along with Brant, Old Smoke, and Lt. Colonel John Butler, fought a desperate delaying action in order to allow the escape of many refugees, both Native and non-Native, who went to Canada. Surviving Iroquois suffered terribly during the following months in what they called \\"the winter of the deep snow.\\" Many froze or starved to death. Cornplanter and Seneca warriors continued to fight with the British against the Patriots, hoping to expel the colonists from their territory. Post-Revolutionary War years With Britain's final defeat in the war, Cornplanter recognized the need for a positive diplomatic relationship with the fledgling government of what the Iroquois called the \\"Thirteen Fires.\\" He became a negotiator in disputes between the new \\"Americans\\" and the Seneca, as well as other indigenous tribes. He was a signatory of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), although this treaty was never ratified by the Iroquois. He also participated in later meetings with both presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. After the American Revolution, Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains mounted a resistance to the European-American settlers in the Northwest Indian War in Ohio and Indiana, hoping to repulse the Americans. Cornplanter kept the Iroquois neutral in this conflict. In addition, he tried to negotiate with the Shawnee on behalf of the U.S. In 1790, Cornplanter and his brother Half-Town (also a chief) traveled to Philadelphia to meet with President George Washington and Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin; they were protesting the current treatment of their people. Cornplanter and Half-Town extracted an agreement from Washington and Mifflin to protect Iroquois land. Cornplanter made many trips to the cities to strengthen relationships and talk with those who were interested in his people. He tried to learn the ways of the European Americans, as he saw it necessary for future relations between the Haudenosaunee and Americans. He was impressed by the beliefs and practice of the Quakers. He invited them to educate his son and develop schools in Seneca territory. He and his half-brother, the religious leader Handsome Lake, strongly opposed the use of liquor among the Seneca. During the War of 1812, Cornplanter supported the American cause, convincing his people to do so as well. At one point he offered to bring two hundred warriors to assist the U.S., but his offer was refused. He allowed Quakers into his village to help the Seneca learn new skills when they could no longer rely on hunting or the fur trade as a way of life. He also encouraged men to join the women working in the fields to help increase their farming economy. Quaker Run was developed as one of the first white settlements in Western New York; it is now abandoned and part of Allegany State Park. Eventually, Cornplanter became disillusioned with his relationship with the Americans. To help fight the drunkenness and despair suffered by many Indians, his half-brother Handsome Lake preached that the Iroquois must return to the traditional way of life and take part in religious ceremonies. Cornplanter felt his people were poorly treated by the Americans. He heeded Handsome Lake's prophecy that they should return to tradition and turn away from assimilation to white ways. He burned his military uniform, broke his sword, and destroyed his medals. He closed the schools but did not completely break relations with the Quakers; he retained a relationship of love and respect with them. Cornplanter also occasionally expressed his disdain for white men; upon taking a short ride on the first steamboat to navigate the upper Allegheny River, Cornplanter, while generally impressed with the boat, quipped that \\"white men will do anything to avoid using their muscles.\\"\\"State and Union: River-traffic dreams never realized at Olean Point\\". Olean Times Herald (May 22, 2016). Retrieved May 22, 2016. Cornplanter Tract In gratitude for his assistance to the state, the federal government gave Cornplanter a grant of in Pennsylvania in 1796 along the western bank of the Allegheny River (about three miles (5 km) below the southern boundary of New York state), allotting it to him and his heirs \\"forever\\". By 1798, 400 Seneca lived on the land, which was called the Cornplanter Tract or Cornplanter Grant (Cayuga: Gyon«´hsade:gƒôh ). In 1821 Warren County, Pennsylvania tried to force Cornplanter to pay taxes for his land, which he protested on the basis that the land had been \\"granted\\" to him by the U.S. government. After much talk, the state finally agreed that the Cornplanter Tract was exempt. Family Cornplanter was a younger half- brother to Handsome Lake (Sganyadai:yo, ca. 1735-1815), a Seneca religious leader of the Iroquois. He was uncle to Governor Blacksnake (Thaonawyuthe, ca. 1760-1859),Historic Seneca Leaders a Seneca war chief. Like Cornplanter, Thaonawyuthe had an exceptionally long life for a man of his times. Cornplanter married and had children. His son Henry Abeel (spelled Henry Abeele in federal documents) was an interpreter present at the Treaty of Canandaigua negotiations. In the winter of 1790, Cornplanter spent a year in Pennsylvania, during which he attended several Quaker gatherings. He was not converted by these gatherings, but he was impressed enough to send Henry and his other children to the Quaker school the following year. This sparked a continuing relationship between Cornplanter and the Quaker community. Cornplanter's descendants typically used the last name Abeel (or variants thereof) during his lifetime. By the 20th century they had generally begun using the surname Cornplanter and continued to be prominent members of the Seneca community. Much of the Abeel/Cornplanter family died as a result of the 1918 flu pandemic.Bulletin of the New York State Museum, 1920. Section: \\"Death of Chief Edward Cornplanter,\\" pages 104 and 105. Artist Jesse Cornplanter was his last known direct male descendant (1889‚Äì1957).Lester, Patrick D. The Biographical Directory of Native American Painters. Tulsa, OK: SIR Publications, 1995: 125 Cornplanter Monument Cornplanter died on his Tract in 1836. He requested a grave with no marker. In 1866 the State of Pennsylvania installed a monument over his grave, \\"believed to be first monument erected in honor of a Native American in the United States.\\" Hon. James Ross Snowden of Philadelphia gave the dedicatory address, saying in part: > He was a dauntless warrior and wisest statesman of his nation, the patriarch > of this tribe and the peacemaker of his race. He was a model man from > nature‚Äôs mould. Truth, temperance, justice and humanity, never had a nobler > incarnation or more earnest and consistent advocate then he. As we loved him > personally, and revere the nobel, manly character he bore, we erect this > tribute to his memory, that those who live after us may know and imitate his > virtues. Relocation of Cornplanter's cemetery after Kinzua Dam construction In 1965, the new federal Kinzua Dam at Warren, Pennsylvania was completed, soon permanently flooding all but a small corner of the Cornplanter Tract, as it created the Allegheny Reservoir for flood control. Cornplanter's grave, including the Cornplanter Monument, was subsequently moved to higher ground, at the Riverview-Corydon Cemetery, located in Elk Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania. \\"The grounds are located west of the north central Pennsylvania town of Bradford just about 100 yards from the New York state line. The cemetery contains what are believed to be the remains of Cornplanter\\", and some 300 of his descendants and followers. This property has eroded over the years, threatening the preservation of this important cemetery. The Seneca are reminded of their losses due to this damage. In 2009 the state made plans to try to protect the cemetery. The State of Pennsylvania erected an honorary marker at the site in 1966, after the original Cornplanter Tract was being submerged. Most of the Seneca were relocated to lands in the Allegany Reservation in New York.

A vessel of the same name and size traveled to the New World seventeen years prior as the flagship of the first expedition of Martin Pring. Swiftsure Speedwell was built in 1577, under the name Swiftsure, as part of English preparations for war against Spain. She participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada. During the Earl of Essex's 1596 Azores expedition she served as the ship of his second in command, Sir Gelli Meyrick. After hostilities with Spain ended, she was decommissioned in 1605, and renamed Speedwell. Speedwell The Embarkation of the Pilgrims, 1843, US Capitol Rotunda. The name of the ship, Speedwell, and 1620 are written in the foreground of the painting. The Leiden Separatist, a Captain Blossom, bought Speedwell in Holland, and embarked from Delfshaven on 22 July 1620.\\"The Voyage of the Mayflower & Speedwell\\", Pilgrim Hall Museum They then sailed under the command of Captain Reynolds to Southampton, England to meet the sister ship, Mayflower, which had been chartered by merchant investors (again Captain Blossom). In Southampton they joined with other Separatists and the additional colonists hired by the investors. Speedwell was already leaking. The ships lay at anchor in Southampton almost two weeks while Speedwell was being repaired and the group had to sell some of their belongings, food and stores, to cover costs and port fees.\\"Mayflower - the Southampton story\\", Southampton City Council The two ships began the voyage on 5 August 1620, but Speedwell was found to be taking on water, and the two ships put into Dartmouth for repairs. On the second attempt, Mayflower and Speedwell sailed about 100 leagues (about ) beyond Land's End in Cornwall, but Speedwell was again found to be taking on water. Both vessels returned to Dartmouth. The Separatists decided to go on to America on Mayflower. According to Bradford, Speedwell was sold at auction in London, and after being repaired made a number of successful voyages for her new owners. At least two of her passengers, Captain Thomas Blossom and a son, returned to Leiden. Prior to the voyage, Speedwell had been refitted in Delfshaven and had two masts. Nathaniel Philbrick theorizes that the crew used a mast that was too big for the ship, and that the added stress caused holes to form in the hull. William Bradford wrote that the \\"overmasting\\" strained the ship's hull, but attributes the main cause of her leaking to actions on the part of the crew. Passenger Robert Cushman wrote from Dartmouth in August 1620 that the leaking was caused by a loose board approximately two feet long. Eleven people from Speedwell boarded Mayflower, leaving 20 people to return to London (including Cushman) while a combined company of 102 continued the voyage. For a third time, Mayflower headed for the New World. She left Plymouth on 6 September 1620 and entered Cape Cod Bay on 11 November. Speedwell's replacement, Fortune, eventually followed, arriving at Plymouth Colony one year later on 9 November 1621. Philippe de Lannoy on Speedwell made the trip. Under the ownership of Captain John Thomas Chappell, the Speedwell sailed again on May 28, 1635 from Southampton, finally arriving in Virginia. The ship then returned to England and was then refitted and sold. Speedwell in art The reverse of the $10,000 bill shows a scene from Weir's painting of Speedwell. In 1837, Robert Walter Weir was commissioned by the United States Congress to paint an historical depiction of the Pilgrims. This painting was placed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Washington, D.C. in December 1843. Known as The Embarkation of the Pilgrims, the remarkable painting is a scene on board Speedwell while harbored in Delfs [or Delft] Haven, Holland. The historical event dramatized took place on July 22, 1620.http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/historic-rotunda-paintings/embarkation- pilgrims Weir would later paint another, much smaller oil on canvas that is now displayed in the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The paintings are similar except for lighting and a few minor changes. The 1857 work measures about . The Embarkation of the Pilgrims is depicted on the reverse of the 10,000 dollar bill (Federal Reserve Note) issued in 1918.http://www.pilgrimhallmuseum.org/ce_history_paintings.htm Only five examples of this bill are known, and \\"none exist outside of institutional collections.\\" Speedwell in fiction A fiction based on fact novel, A Spurious Brood outlines a possible explanation for the sabotage of Speedwell, based on the true story of Katherine More, whose children were sent to America on board Mayflower. In Hornblower and the Atropos, one of the C. S. Forester novels about fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower, a treasure ship named Speedwell has sunk in Turkey's Marmorice Bay, and Hornblower's mission is to recover the treasure from the bottom of the bay. Speedwell is also mentioned several times in battle-action scenes in the historical fiction novel, Armada: A Novel, written by Charles Gidley Wheeler and published in 1987.

Early life and education Hormel was born in Austin, Minnesota. He is the grandson of George A. Hormel, founder of Hormel Foods. Hormel's father, Jay Catherwood Hormel, later served as president of Hormel Foods. Hormel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Swarthmore College and a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School.  Career  After law school, Hormel served as the dean of students and director of admissions at the University of Chicago Law School. In 1981, he was one of the founders of the Human Rights Campaign. He was a member of the 1995 United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the 1996 U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, and the boards of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Hormel funded the creation of James C. Hormel Gay & Lesbian Center at the San Francisco Public Library in 1995. Hormel was appointed United States Ambassador to Luxembourg by President Bill Clinton in 1999. When he was appointed through a recess appointment, Hormel became the first openly gay man to represent the United States as an ambassador. Hormel participated in numerous events, including a conference organized in 2004 by Amnesty International in the frame of the Geneva Gay Pride. In 2010 he was given the Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award by San Francisco Pride Board of Directors for his LGBT activism over several decades. =Ambassadorship= In 1994, President Bill Clinton considered Hormel for the ambassadorship to Fiji, but did not put the nomination forward due to protests from Fijian government officials. At the time, gay male sexual acts were punishable with prison sentences in Fiji and Hormel's being open about his sexuality would stand in conflict with \\"Fijian culture\\". Instead Hormel was named as part of the United Nations delegation from the US to the Human Rights Commission in 1995, and in 1996 became an alternate for the United Nations General Assembly. In October 1997 Clinton nominated Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg, which had removed laws prohibiting consensual same‚Äìsex acts between adults in the 1800s. This appointment was the first nomination or appointment of an openly LGBT person from the US. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his nomination with only Republican and conservative Senators Jesse Helms and John Ashcroft opposed. Three other Republicans, James Inhofe, Tim Hutchinson, and Bob Smith, with the urging of religious and social conservatives campaigned vigorously against Hormel's nomination. Trent Lott, the Republican Majority Leader, worked to block the vote and publicly called homosexuality a sin and compared it to alcoholism and kleptomania. Christian‚Äìbased conservative groups like the Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) and the Family Research Council (FRC) publicly accused Hormel of being pro‚Äìpornography and anti‚ÄìCatholic and the Senators presented those charges to derail the nomination. They asserted that Hormel would be rejected in the largely Catholic Luxembourg. To support the pornography allegation, a list of materials in the Hormel collection at the San Francisco Public Library was compiled by the TVC; it was later pointed out that the same works were also in the Library of Congress. The anti‚ÄìCatholic allegation stemmed from a 1996 San Francisco Pride parade television interview where he was seen laughing at the same time the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group that pokes fun at religious conventions, walked by.Congressional Record‚ÄîSenate S979 1 February 2001. The Catholic League opposed his nomination because of his \\"embrace\\" of the Sisters which the League considers an anti‚ÄìCatholic group.http://www.catholicleague.org/white-house-lies-about-hormel/ Although it was unclear why he was laughing, Christian right conservative group FRC distributed video tapes to the entire Senate of the brief event. Concerns about Hormel's reception in Luxembourg were \\"blunted when officials of the country, which has laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation, indicated that he would be welcome.\\" Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York found the obstruction of the nomination an embarrassment and urged that Trent Lott bring the issue up for a vote. When Lott continued to stall, Clinton employed a recess appointment in May 1999. Hormel was sworn in as ambassador in June 1999. His partner at the time, Timothy Wu, held the Bible during the ceremony. Also in attendance were Hormel's former wife, his five children, and several of his grandchildren. Personal life Hormel's late brother, Geordie Hormel was a musician and recording studio proprietor. Hormel has five children, fourteen grandchildren, and five great‚Äìgrandchildren. He lives in San Francisco, California with his husband, Michael P. Nguyen. He is a member of the progressive donor group the Democracy Alliance.

A young male was sent to the Vincennes Zoo in 1937 where it was described by the French zoologist Achille Urbain and was declared the holotype. The kouprey has a tall, narrow body, long legs, a humped back and long horns. The kouprey has not been sighted since 1969-1970. A camera trapping survey in the region of these sightings failed to document it in 2011. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1996. Description Female and male in comparison to a middle-aged man. The kouprey is believed to be a close relative of the aurochs, gaur, and banteng. A very large ungulate, the kouprey can approach similar sizes to the wild Asian water buffalo. These bovids measure along the head and body, not counting a tail, and stand high at the shoulder. Their weight is reportedly from . (2011).Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Unverified reports of a body mass up to from Vietnam are considered dubious, since they far exceed other recorded weights for the species. Kouprey have tall, narrow, bodies, long legs and humped backs. They can be grey, dark brown or black. The horns of the female are lyre-shaped with antelope-like upward spirals. The horns of the male are wide and arch forward and upward; they begin to fray at the tips at about three years of age. Both sexes have notched nostrils and long tails. Habitat and distribution Historical distribution of this species included Cambodia, southern Laos, east Thailand, and western Vietnam. They are thought to be extinct in all areas outside of Cambodia. If still extant, it likely exists in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri Protected Forest, and/or Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary. Kouprey live in low, partially forested hills, where they eat mainly grasses. Their preferred habitat is open forest and savannas often near thick monsoon forests. They are diurnal, eating in the open at night and under the forest cover during the day. They usually travel up to 15 km in a night. They live in herds of up to 20 and are usually led by a single female. These herds generally consist of cows and calves, but have bulls during the dry season. Older males form bachelor herds. Many herds are known to break up and rejoin as they travel and have been found to be mixed in with herds of banteng or wild buffalo. Diet The Kouprey graze on grasses, including bamboo, ploong, and koom. They also spend a lot of time around salt licks and water holes. Status There are estimated to be fewer than 250 kouprey left in the world. There is some speculation on whether or not they are already extinct. These low numbers are attributed to uncontrolled hunting by locals and soldiers for meat, horns and skulls for use in traditional Chinese medicine, in conjunction with diseases introduced from cattle and loss of habitat due to agriculture and logging activity. Ongoing conservation efforts Kouprey are legally protected in all range states and may be present in some protected areas. Prince Sihanouk designated it as the national animal of Cambodia in the 1960s, partly due to its mystique. In 1988 an International Workshop on Kouprey Conservation was held in the University of Hanoi. This workshop worked towards the responsible government agencies and interested donors to agree upon a workable and realistic action plan to save the kouprey. The 2008 IUCN report lists the kouprey as critically endangered (possibly extinct). Timmins, R.J., Hedges, S. & Duckworth., J.W. 2008. Bos sauveli. In: IUCN 2008. 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 11 March 2009 Large mammal surveys continue to take place in Cambodia, hoping to rediscover living kouprey. Other surveys have been taking place in the kouprey's historical range as recently as 2011. These surveys were done to determine the regions in their range with the highest probability of the kouprey's persistence. This is based on the habitat type and survey effort to date. During the last decade, several searches for the animal have proven fruitless. No kouprey have been sighted since 1983. There is no captive population. The only individual in a western zoo was sent to the Vincennes Zoo at Paris in 1937; that was the individual designated as the holotype by Urbain.Urbain, A.: \\"Le kou-prey ou b≈ìuf gris cambodgien\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Zoologique de France 62 (5), 1937, pp. 305-307.

Relation to other species Research published by Northwestern University in London's Journal of Zoology indicated a comparison of mitochondrial sequences showed the kouprey might be a hybrid between a zebu and a banteng.Northwestern biologists demote Southeast Asia's 'forest ox' However, the authors of this study rescinded their conclusion.G.

Because a fossilized skull was found dating from the late Pleistocene or early Holocene epoch, they concluded the kouprey is not a hybrid.

In the United States, it was syndicated by Orion Television. Two seasons of the program were produced, although reruns continued to appear for many years afterwards. The first season featured a different instructor for each day of the week, Monday through Friday. Bess Motta, Arlaine Wright, Holly Butler, Nicole Nardini, and Anne Schumacher all had speaking roles. The second season featured only Bess and Arlaine as instructors. One selling point of the show was the young attractive women exercising in leotards. The exercise routines were demanding, high-impact aerobics, followed by a stretching section. Pulsating music from synthesizers played in the background. For the first season, music was performed by the group Shiva, while the second season featured music by the trio Jermyn/King/Ouillet. There are numerous websites hosted by fans that detail about the dancers, and include so-called screen- captures from the show.

Both springs are accessible via trails from U.S. Highway 12 and are popular tourist attractions, drawing visitors from Idaho and western Montana. Lewis and Clark travelled through the region in their journey westward in 1805-1804. Upon reaching Lolo Pass at the eastern edge of the forest on September 15, 1805, William Clark was quoted as saying, > From this mountain I could observe high rugged mountains in every direction > as far as I could see. The Clearwater National Forest was established on July 1, 1908 with from parts of Coeur d'Alene National Forest and Bitterroot National Forest. On October 31, 1934 part of Selway National Forest was added. A small part of the Selway- Bitterroot Wilderness lies within Clearwater National Forest, although the largest portion of the wilderness lies in either the neighboring Nez Perce National Forest, Bitterroot National Forest, or Lolo National Forest. alt=An overview map of Clearwater National Forest with ranger districts and surrounding forests labelled References External links * Nez Perce- Clearwater National Forests Category:National Forests of Idaho Category:Regions of Idaho Category:Protected areas established in 1908 Category:Protected areas of Idaho County, Idaho Category:Protected areas of Clearwater County, Idaho Category:Protected areas of Shoshone County, Idaho Category:1908 establishments in Idaho ","title":"Clearwater National Forest"},{"id":"919509","text":"Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry is a 2004 book about then U.S. Presidential candidate John Kerry by John O'Neill and Jerome Corsi published by Regnery Publishing. The book was released at the time that ads by Swift Vets and POWs for Truth were being aired on U.S. television. Content and criticism The book criticizes Kerry's judgment in battle, his truthfulness, his entitlement to certain medals, and his later anti-war activities. The book was based in part on interviews with veterans who served in or with Kerry's division, and also on biographies of Kerry. Several members of Kerry's crew stated that O'Neill failed to interview them. Neither O'Neill nor Corsi had any firsthand knowledge of Kerry's service. O'Neill served on the Swift boats after Kerry left Vietnam and Corsi never served in Vietnam. page 36 According to the Swiftboat skipper who served with Kerry, the book was \\"wrong.\\" Kerry's fellow sailors released a point-by-point rebuttal of the claims and stated that \\"The book's authors don't give Kerry's supporters the space or the credence that they warrant.\\" According to the Seattle Times, the government documents support Kerry's war awards and claims. Some veterans interviewed for the book complained that their statements were edited to strip out material favorable to Kerry. \\"Mr. Runyon said the edited version was stripped of all references to enemy combat, making it look like just another night in the Mekong Delta.\\" At the same time the book was being criticized, the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth group was being criticized because \\"None of those in the attack ad by the Swift Boat group actually served on Kerry's boat. And their statements are contrary to the accounts of Kerry and those who served under him.\\" After controversial statements made by Corsi became public, O'Neill denied Corsi's coauthorship of the book, saying that Corsi was \\"simply an editor and not really any sort of co- author.\\"‚ÄúScarborough Country,‚Äù MSNBC, 10 August 2004‚ÄúJohn O'Neill Interview with Wolf Blitzer,‚Äù CNN, 11 August 2004.

The name is derived from Greek Netta \\"duck\\". Unlike other diving ducks, the Netta species are reluctant to dive, and feed more like dabbling ducks. These are gregarious ducks, mainly found on fresh water. They are strong fliers; their broad, blunt-tipped wings require faster wing-beats than those of many ducks and they take off with some difficulty. They do not walk as well on land as the dabbling ducks because their legs tend to be placed further back on their bodies to help propel them when underwater. The probably extinct pink-headed duck, previously listed as Rhodonessa caryophyllacea, has recently been shown by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to the red-crested pochard, so has now been transferred to the same genus, as Netta caryophyllacea.

It was apparently designed as a low-cost alternative to Tandy's own TRS-80 Color Computer to compete with entry-level machines that had previously dominated the market, such as the Commodore VIC-20 and Sinclair ZX81. Due to its limited feature set, the MC-10 was of value primarily to hobbyists and as an introduction to computer programming. It was not a commercial success and was discontinued only a year after its introduction. A clone of the MC-10, the Alice, was marketed in France through a collaboration among Tandy, Matra and Hachette.  Description  About the size of a hardcover book, the MC-10 came equipped with four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of RAM, a Motorola MC6803 eight-bit microprocessor, a built-in serial port, and graphics capabilities similar to those of the original Color Computer (provided by the same MC6847 video display generator). Like most early home computers, the MC-10 included a BASIC interpreter in ROM and used regular audio cassettes for bulk storage. Text and graphics were displayed on a television set via a built-in RF modulator. Less common for machines in its class was the integrated RS-232 serial port, which allowed the MC-10 to use a wide variety of line printers and modems without additional hardware. Even so, at the time of its release in 1983, the MC-10's specifications were underwhelming. Disk drives, full-travel keyboards, medium- resolution graphics, and complete 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) memory banks were becoming popular features for home computers; the MC-10 offered none of these, severely limiting the functions it could perform and the range of users to which it could appeal. The MC-10 was discontinued in 1984, along with the 16 KB (16,384 bytes) memory upgrade and small amount of cassette-based software that had been released for it. It never achieved a wide following.

The RS-232C serial interface had extremely limited usefulness. Although the 6803 CPU conveniently includes a built-in UART, it was not connected to and did not assist the RS-232C interface in any manner. In part, this was because a single 3.58 MHz TV colorburst crystal was used to generate video and clock the CPU, and this clock rate did not correspond to any standard baud rate when divided for the UART. As a result, programs had to shift all bits individually into and out of the RS-232C interface, creating artificial and especially critical timing considerations. The cassette interface had similar difficulties, plus a few. Although Micro Color Basic included an undocumented CLOADM command for loading machine- language programs and an undocumented VARPTR function for manipulating variables as memory, there was no corresponding CSAVEM command (documented or otherwise) to permit machine language programs to be saved to tape.  Software  A limited amount of software was available on cassette for the MC-10, including Lunar Lander, Checkers, and a machine-language Pinball program. However, as most programs written in Basic for other TRS-80 models were compatible with the MC-10, many books with BASIC programs were available for the user who was willing to type in the code. Retrocomputing hobbyists have created many games that were improvements to those released officially.

Overview A parody advertisement should not be confused with a fictional brand name used in a program to avoid giving free advertising to an actual product, or to the use of a fictional brand name in an actual advertisement used for comparison, which is sometimes done as opposed to comparing the product to an actual competitor. (In some countries, Germany or Norway for example, it is illegal to make disparaging comments about a competitor's product in an advertisement, even if the statements are proven to be true.Germany's \\"Act against Unfair Competition\\" or \\"Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb\\" (UWG) of 3 July 2004, ¬ß 6 generally forbids the use of comparative advertising. Technically it is not \\"illegal\\" in that almost all actions under the law are based on private lawsuits, e.g. typically the company whose product is being mentioned sues, rather than the government prosecuting.) A parody advertisement can be one in which the advertisement appears to actually be a real ad for the false product, but then the advertisement is somehow exposed to be a parody and if it is an actual advertisement the actual brand becomes clear. If it is simply a parody it may or may not indicate that it is one. Notable examples =Candy= During the 1960s and 1970s, the Topps Chewing Gum Company released a product called Wacky Packages, in which stickers showing various products were shown in ridiculous scenes, such as * Hawaiian Punch fruit drink, was parodied as \\"Hawaiian Punks. Beats you to a fruit-juicy pulp.\\" * Eveready Batteries, with its image of a cat having 9 lives, was parodied as \\"NeveReady Batteries, has 0 lives,\\" and an image of a dead cat. =Film= *Tropic Thunder: In addition to Tropic Thunder's (in)famous fake movie trailers, the film has a parody ad for the fake products 'Booty Sweat' energy drink and 'Bust-A-Nut' candy bar. As part of the film's marketing 'Booty Sweat' has been made into a real life energy drink.Booty Sweat Energy DrinkBooty Sweat Energy Drink.com/x-281-Caffeine-Examiner~y2008m8d22-Tropic-Thunder-energy-drink- turns-real--and-doesnt-really-taste-like-Booty-Sweat Tropic Thunder energy drink turns real - and doesnt really taste like Booty Sweat *Bamboozled: Spike Lee's satire has fake ads for 'Da Bomb' malt liquor and a racistly named parody of Tommy Hilfiger. In addition to the appearance in Bamboozled, 'Da Bomb' makes appearances in three other Spike Lee films, Clockers, Inside Man, and Sucker Free City.Trivia for Inside Man *Grindhouse: The film Grindhouse has trailers for a number of fictional films. These include Machete, in which the FBI hires a mercenary rather than risk their own agents on a potential suicide mission; Werewolf Women of the SS about a group of women who run a nazi death camp; Don't, an exploitative horror film; Thanksgiving, a slasher film in the genre of the Halloween series; and Hobo With a Shotgun about a vigilante killer similar to the premise of the film Death Wish. The trailer for Machete was so well received it has actually been made into a full-length feature film as well as Hobo with a Shotgun. *RoboCop: Parody advertisements are seen throughout the RoboCop franchise for products such as the \\"6000 SUX\\", a parody of the low fuel economy of many American-made cars at that time, the game \\"NUKEM\\", a parody of Battleship, and \\"Magnavolt\\", a car security system designed to electrocute and kill would-be carjackers.RoboCop - A Few Words From the Future *UHF: The Weird Al Yankovic film UHF has a few fake ads within the film, such as \\"Spatula City\\", a store that sells nothing but spatulas, as well as promos for fake TV shows and movies like \\"Conan the Librarian\\" and \\"Gandhi II\\". *C—èazy People: The 1990 film C—èazy People is about an advertising executive who work in a psychiatric hospital with a number of patients to create \\"truthful\\" advertisements, often over-the-top and with explicit language, for mostly real-life products and brands. *The 2013 film Movie 43 featured a few parody ads such as \\"iBabe\\" spots, \\"Machine Kids\\" (a mock public service announcement), and a faux Tampax commercial. *C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America: The 2004 mockumentary about the history of how the fictional Confederate States of America rose to power after winning the American Civil War is presented as a documentary airing on Confederate television. As such, the movie has commercial parodies that are racialist and are aimed towards white slave-owning families. Many of the products advertised in the film actually existed in the past. =Television= *The American sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live produces fictional commercials on a regular basis, usually shown after the guest host's monologue as an \\"introductory commercial\\", prior to the beginning of the main show. While many of these ads parody actual TV commercials, they are simple comedic parodies of the style of the real advertisement rather than its product. *Likewise, many subsequent sketch comedy programs have utilized parody advertisements, including MAD TV, In Living Color and The Idiot Box. * Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! frequently featured surreal advertisements for products and services from an in-universe megacorporation known as Cinco. These commercials often advertised products of an outlandish, unappealing, or otherwise questionable nature, including badly-named toys such as the \\"B'owl\\" (a cross between a bat and owl) and \\"T'ird\\" (a cross between a bird and turtle), products based on outdated technology (such as the \\"Cinco-Fone\\" and \\"Cinco MIDI Organizer\\"), products related to urination and defecation, unusual body modifications (such as a \\"Food Tube\\", \\"Bro-oche\\", and \\"Eye Tanning System\\") that require the user's teeth be removed as part of installation, and a children's jukebox that generates hallucinatory \\"dance tones\\". Likewise, some sketches consisted of promos for equally-surreal programs on an in-universe television station. *Short Circuitz, an MTV sketch comedy show starring Nick Cannon, often featured parodies of popular advertisements. Its accompanying website, ShortCircuitz.mtv.com, allows users to upload their own parody advertisements to compete for a cash prize and a spot on the show. Fictional advertisements for real products *In the 1990s, the most famous series of parody advertisements were those for the Energizer battery. A parody itself of a Duracell battery commercial, in its initial commercial episode first shown in October 1989, a toy pink rabbit, is being filmed in a commercial. The toy, powered by the battery, escapes the studio and begins a rampage, pounding a drum and rolling through other commercials being made, including those for coffee, wine, a fictional upcoming TV series, long- distance service, breakfast cereal, and sinus medication. A total of 120 fictional commercials and 4 real ones (for Twinkies, Purina Cat Chow, Pepsi, and Duracell) in both English and Spanish involving the Energizer Bunny were made. *In 1991, Eveready Battery Company sued the Adolph Coors Company over an ad for Coors beer it was producing, which showed actor Leslie Nielsen in a full-size rabbit suit pounding a drum, which was parodying Eveready's Energizer Bunny commercials, which themselves are parodies of Duracell advertisements and television program previews. Eveready claimed Coors' ad constituted copyright and trademark infringement. The court ruled that Coors' ad was a valid parody of Eveready's, considering that Mr. Nielsen \\"is not a toy, and does not run on batteries.\\" Eveready Battery Co. v. Adolph Coors Co., 765 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ill. 1991). *The GEICO insurance company ran a series of television commercials in which a victim in a disadvantaged situation hears their fate from the antagonist, that they have good news, only the good news is for the antagonist (The antagonist will usually say as the punchline, \\"I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to GEICO\\"). Some examples involved a fictional congressional hearing where the witness (the victim) is being informed he is subject to criminal penalties while the chairman of the committee (the antagonist) has saved money on his car insurance, a home repair show reminiscent of Bob Vila showing a victim couple with a home badly in need of repair, a fictional news report on a volcanic eruption, and a fictional hair restoration commercial. Another example parodied advertisements for reality TV shows, by showing a couple getting married, and getting disgruntled at living in a tiny house (the punchline: a voiceover saying \\"The drama may be real, but it won't save you any money on car insurance\\", followed by the wife asking her spouse in their tiny hot tub \\"Why haven't you called GEICO?\\"). *The Coca-Cola company's lemon-lime soft drink Sprite ran a series of ads for other fictional drink products, which had actual or fictional celebrities endorsing the other product, with the implication that the fictional product was inadequate for quenching one's thirst. *The gimmick of characters from a commercial invading other spoof ads was first used by the British Lager brewers Carling Black Label. The advert featured a wild west outlaw being roped by a posse and dragging them off their horses and into adverts for a love compilation Album and Washing up powder. *\\"Poser Mobile\\" ran an advertising campaign for T-Mobile's pay-as-you-go cell phone plan featuring a racially diverse group of hip-hop posers. The group of five ambush the cell phone customer and explain that he has to pay hidden charges and fees. One customer in a commercial calls them \\"clowns\\". It is somewhat of a parody on Boost Mobile's \\"Where You At?\\" advertising campaign which features prominent hip-hop artists such as Ludacris, Kanye West, and The Game. =Magazines and print= Mad Magazine Mad Magazine was notorious for regularly running obviously fictional ads for nonexistent products. However, many of these nonexistent products were clearly intended to be parodies of specific well-known brands of real-world products; frequently, the fictional advertisement in Mad parodied a specific genuine ad campaign for a recognizable brand-name product. For example, in the 1960s (when cigarettes could still be advertised on television), Kent Cigarettes ran a commercial featuring a series of line drawings illustrating the lyrics of a catchy jingle titled \\"The Taste of Kent\\". Mad promptly ran a fake print ad, using drawings which parodied the style of the line art, illustrating verses about lung cancer and emphysema to a lyric that parodied Kent's jingle, now titled \\"The Taste of Death\\". According to Frank Jacobs's biography The Mad World of William M. Gaines, Mad's parodies of real advertisements generated so much attention that Mad publisher William Gaines received requests from the promotional departments of many real products, asking Mad to run parodies of their advertisements. Gaines's standard reply to such requests: \\"Come up with a really stupid ad campaign, and we'll be happy to make fun of it.\\" Hustler The most serious incident involving a fictional advertisement in a magazine caused a lawsuit which reached all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, when Hustler Magazine ran a parody of a liquor ad which would ask people about their \\"first time.\\" In the actual ad, what we are led to believe is that the person is being asked about their first sexual experience, when it turns out the question is about their first time they used the sponsor's product, a liqueur. In the parody advertisement in Hustler, the Reverend Jerry Falwell is supposedly quoted describing the first time he had sexual intercourse with his mother in an outhouse while intoxicated. Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and its publisher Larry Flynt for invasion of privacy, libel and emotional distress. The jury found for the magazine on the issue of libel (the fictional advertisement clearly indicated it was a parody), but awarded Mr. Falwell $350,000 in damages for the emotional distress and invasion of privacy claims. The Supreme Court ruled that, since the advertisement was so obviously a parody that no reasonable person could have believed it, Falwell was not libelled and thus is not entitled to damages for emotional distress, and he was not entitled to damages for invasion of privacy because he is a well-known public figure. Hustler Magazine, Inc. et al. v. Jerry Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, (1988). Other examples *The Adbusters Media Foundation's magazine Adbusters features advertisement parodies that are intended as sharp commentary on the social implications of either the product or the advertising campaign involved (also known as \\"Culture Jamming\\"). One example is a parody of the \\"Joe Camel\\" advertising campaign for Camel Cigarettes, with a pseudo Joe Camel in a hospital bed, his head bald and an intravenous drip bottle leading into his arm, with the legend \\"Joe Chemo\\" on the faux ad, implying that the many years of smoking cigarettes has left \\"Joe\\" with cancer and requiring chemotherapy treatment. *The Wrigley Company created fictional print ads for Juicy Fruit, such as boy bands, an upcoming fictional movie poster, and a phony handheld game system. *Games Magazine, a monthly publication featuring game- and puzzle-related material, through the 1980s carried a fake ad feature noted (without page number) in each issue's contents with the tagline, \\"Which of the pitches is full of hitches?\\" One featured item was an abacus simulator running on PCs made by the nonexistent Nat Soh Software Co. of Hong Kong. The challenge to readers was to scrutinize all of the ads to spot the fake. =Miscellaneous= *Superhero-themed rock band The Aquabats are notorious for styling their live shows after Saturday morning cartoons, including engaging in scripted onstage battles with costumed monsters and villains. Normally, when these villains crash the stage, the concert will \\"cut to commercial\\" and a video screen behind the band will project a pre-recorded advertisement for an outlandish (and obviously fake) toy or product before returning to the show. In 2012, The Aquabats produced their own television series, The Aquabats! Super Show!, which also regularly features such parody commercials. *An edited ad for a fictional Girl of the Year character wearing a track suit, bob haircut and wielding a semi-automatic pistol while defiantly violating face mask guidelines mandated due to the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic as a personification of the \\"Karen\\" stereotype, provoked criticism from Mattel subsidiary American Girl who took umbrage to the use of their name and trade dress, stating that they were \\"disgusted\\" by a post from brand strategist Adam Padilla under the online persona \\"Adam the Creator\\", and \\"are working with the appropriate teams at American Girl to ensure this copyright violation is handled appropriately.\\" Boing Boing however expressed doubts over the merits of American Girl's proposed legal action against the \\"Karen\\" parodies citing the Streisand effect, though it has also noted the debate on whether the satirical intent of the parody advertisement is protected by law.

In geology the term is more specifically applied to a ridge where a harder sedimentary rock overlies a softer layer, the whole being tilted somewhat from the horizontal. This results in a long and gentle backslope called a dip slope that conforms with the dip of resistant strata, called caprock. Where erosion has exposed the frontslope of this, a steep slope or escarpment occurs. The resulting terrain may be called scarpland. Definition In general usage, a cuesta is a hill or ridge with a gentle slope (backslope) on one side, and a steep slope (frontslope) on the other. The word is from Spanish: \\"flank or slope of a hill; hill, mount, sloping ground\\". In geology and geomorphology, cuesta refers specifically to an asymmetric ridge with a long and gentle backslope called a dip slope that conforms with the dip of a resistant stratum or strata, called caprock. The outcrop of the caprock forms a steeper or even cliff-like frontslope (escarpment), cutting through the dipping strata that comprise the cuesta.Cotton, CA (1952) Geomorphology An Introduction to the Study of Landforms.

American Geological Institute, Alexandria, Virginia. 800 pp. Formation Cuestas are the expression of extensive outcrops of gently dipping strata, typically sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl and hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. sandstone and limestone. The surfaces of the hard, erosion- resistant rock strata form the caprock of the backslope (dip-slope) of the cuesta, where erosion has preferentially removed the weaker strata. The frontslope of the cuesta consists of an escarpment that cuts across the bedding of the strata comprising it. Because of the gently dipping nature of the strata that forms a cuesta, a significant shift in horizontal location will take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion. Because the slope of a cuesta dips in the same direction as the sedimentary strata, the dip angle of this bedding (Œ∏) can be calculated by (v / h) = tan(Œ∏) where v is equal to the vertical distance and h is equal to the horizontal distance perpendicular to the strike of the beds. Cuestas, homoclinal ridges, and hogbacks comprise a sequence of landforms that form a gradational continuum. These landforms differ only on the steepness of their backslopes and the relative differences in the inclination of their backslopes and frontslopes. These differences depend upon whether the dip of the strata from which they have been eroded are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of the backslope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms occur in the scientific literature. It also can be difficult to sharply distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms because of their gradational nature. Examples Two well-known cuestas in western New York and southern Ontario are the Onondaga escarpment and the Niagara Escarpment, respectively. The dip of the Onondaga is about 40 feet per mile (about 7.6 m/km) to the south. The escarpment edge faces north, and in its most populated section, runs roughly parallel to the southern Lake Ontario shoreline. The Gulf Coastal Plain in Texas is punctuated by a series of cuestas that parallel the coast, as are most coastal plains. The Reynosa Plateau is the most coast-ward cuesta, which has surface expression with the Bordes-Oakville escarpment, on the northwest side and a low ridge on the eastern boundary, called the Reynosa Cuesta, where the deposits dip below later Pliocene-Pleistocene deposits of the Willis and Lissie Formations. Cuestas have less dramatic expression in the United Kingdom, with two notable examples being the northwest-facing escarpment of the Cretaceous chalk White Horse Hills and the similarly aligned escarpment of the Jurassic limestones in the Cotswolds, sometimes called the Cotswold Edge. In continental Europe, the Swabian Alb offers particularly good views of cuestas in Jurassic rock. In France, the term for a cuesta is the same as for a coastline: \\"c√¥te\\". Notable French cuestas are the wine-growing regions of C√¥te d'Or and C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne. The Machinchang Formation outcrops in the Langkawi islands off the coast of northwestern Malaysia. The formation is one of the oldest exposed rock units in Southeast Asia and has an extensive eroded anticline cuesta topography‚Äîdating back to Cambrian.

It integrates various ideas from parallel algorithms, and functional programming and array programming languages. The most important new ideas behind NESL are *Nested data parallelism: this feature offers the benefits of data parallelism, concise code that is easy to understand and debug, while being well suited for irregular algorithms, such as algorithms on trees, graphs or sparse matrices. *A language based performance model: this gives a formal way to calculate the work and depth of a program. These measures can be related to running time on parallel machines. The main design guideline for NESL was to make parallel programming easy and portable. Algorithms are typically significantly more concise in NESL than in most other parallel programming languages, and the code closely resembles high-level pseudocode. NESL supports nested data parallelism by using the flattening transform to convert nested data parallelism to flat data parallelism. This works by storing nested vectors as the nested data and a segment descriptor of vector lengths, separately. This flattening transform, however, can increase the asymptotic work and space complexity of the original program, leading to a much less efficient result. Influences NESL heavily influenced Data Parallel Haskell.

The all wood structure was built in 1886 at a cost of $7,000 by the International League baseball team the Toronto Baseball Club (renamed the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1902). It was initially known as the Toronto Baseball Grounds. It stood south of Queen Street East, west of Broadview Avenue, north of Eastern Avenue, on the east side of the Smith Estate near the Don River, and had seating for 2,200 spectators, including a 550-seat reserved section. The stadium's grand opening was held on May 22, 1886 for an afternoon game against the \\"Rochesters\\" of Rochester, New York. It came to be known as Sunlight Park after the Lever Brothers' Sunlight Soap Works was built south of Eastern Avenue. The stadium hosted the city‚Äôs first professional baseball championship in 1887. The team and league folded in 1890. The Torontos, called the Canucks of the Eastern League, played in the park until 1896 when new owners moved the team to their new Hanlan's Point Stadium. The park was used for local baseball, football, and lacrosse leagues until well into the 20th century (1913), when encroaching industrial uses predominated. Today the site is a block of condo lofts, a car dealership car- park and the Don Valley Parkway on ramp, Eastern Avenue diversion. The street Sunlight Park Road bears witness to the past, being the remnant Eastern Avenue bridge approach cut by the parkway. The site is bounded by the Don Valley Parkway and the industrial buildings of the former Lever Brothers.

Geography and history  The municipality is situated on the Alb-Pfinz Plateau in the northern Black Forest, 8 km east-southeast of Ettlingen, 13 km southeast of Karlsruhe, and 15 km west of Pforzheim. = Constituent villages = The municipality of Karlsbad consists of 5 previously independent single-village municipalities united by the municipality reform in 1971:http://www.karlsbad.de/website/de/gemeinde/ortsteile  Langensteinbach  { Langensteinbach The largest and central village in Karlsbad, where the main administration offices are situated. Whereas each village has its own primary school, all of Karlsbad's secondary schools (Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule) are located in Langensteinbach. Langensteinbach also counts with a famous hospital, a special school for disabled people and even public swimming pools. }  Auerbach  { Auerbach Although excavations proved that the area where Auerbach is located was already settled by 90 A.D., the village was first mentioned in documents in 1278. Auerbach is one of the minor villages of Karlsbad. As any of Karlsbad's districts, it has its own civic center with local administration offices dealing with topics regarding the village rather than the whole municipality. Furthermore it features a Kindergarten, a primary school, a big sports' and events' hall (a so-called \\"multi-purpose hall\\") and soccer fields for the local football club. }  Mutschelbach  { Mutschelbach Together with Auerbach, Mutschelbach is one of the smallest villages in Karlsbad. Its first documentary evidence can be dated back to 1278. In 1936 the previously independent, but almost merging, Waldensian villages Upper, Lower and Central Mutschelbach were united to a single municipality called Mutschelbach. In the context of the municipality reform Mutschelbach was then integrated into the newly created municipality Karlsbad. }  Spielberg  { Spielberg Although it was first mentioned in documents in 1281 settlers from Gr√ºnwettersbach, nowadays a district of Karlsruhe, are told to have set over to the village - back then still called Spilberc - in 1161. Having been part of W√ºrttemberg previously it was sold to Baden-Durlach in 1603. For the following 200 years politically it belonged to Langensteinbach until 1803. In 1971, in the context of the municipality reform, this union was refreshed as Spielberg was integrated into Karlsbad. }  Ittersbach  { Ittersbach The first documentary mention reaches back to 1232, although back then known as Uitilspur. Throughout the history Ittersbach switched ownsers several times until the Thirty Years' War when it became part of Baden once and for all times. In 1854 the first industries settled down in Ittersbach and after World War II the economic situation improved even more as modern industries supplying both the German and the international market arrived at the industrial park about 2 km outside of the village. Among the companies acting on global markets and located in Ittersbach's industrial park is Harman Becker (vehicle audio) and Herrmann Ultraschalltechnik. } = Neighbours =  Karlsruhe  Karlsruhe In the north Karlsbad borders to Karlsruhe and its neighbourhoods Stupferich and Palmbach. Both of these neighbourhoods form part of a group of neighbourhood known as Karlsruhe's Bergd√∂rfer (mountain villages). Most of Karlsruhe is situated within the Upper Rhine Plain, not so the Bergd√∂rfer: They are situated on the mountains of the northern Black Forest and the western Kraichgau.http://ka.stadtwiki.net/H√∂henstadtteil They share the autobahn exit Karlsbad, situated within their borders, with their neighbour municipality and are connected with it through the Landesstra√üen L609 and L623. * Stupferich Stupferich The village Stupferich is a southeastern neighbourhood of Karlsruhe. Until it was integrated into the city of Karlsruhe in 1972 it was an independent municipality. In 2000 the village celebrated its 900th anniversary. In December 2011 it had about 2,650 inhabitants.http://www.karlsruhe.de/b4/stadtteile/bergdoerfer/stupferich.de (German) * Palmbach Palmbach The village Palmbach is an eastern neighbourhood of Karlsruhe. Until it was integrated into the city of Karlsruhe in 1975 it formed part of the municipality Wetterbsbach composed of the villages Palmbach and Gr√ºnwettersbach.http://ka.stadtwiki.net/Wettersbach (German source) Palmbach was founded in 1701 by 28 Waldensian refugee families consisting of 111 people from La Balme in the French Alps on an area of 306 acres belonging to Gr√ºnwettersbach. They called their settlement La Balme, just like the place, they came from, which turned into the village's current name still during the 18th century.http://www.karlsruhe.de/b4/stadtteile/bergdoerfer/palmbach.de (German Source) In March 2012 Palmbach had about 1,800 inhabitants.  Waldbronn  Waldbronn The western frontier of Karlsbad leads to Waldbronn, a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe at the borders of the Alb-Pfinz Plateau and within the Alb Valley with some 12,500 inhabitants. Just like Karlsbad, this municipality is also product of the municipality reform in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Its current constituent villages and former independent municipalities joined the former single-village municipality Reichenbach: * Etzenrot and Neurod (joined in 1971) * Busenbach (joined in 1972) In 1974 the enlarged municipality Reichenbach was renamed and received the name Waldbronn  Marxzell  Marxzell The southwestern frontier of Karlsbad borders to Marxzell, a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe with about 5,300 inhabitants (as of December 2011) consisting of the former independent municipalities * Burbach: Burbach, Marxzell (also part of the other two former municipalities], Metzlinschwander Hof and the houses Fischweier and Weimersm√ºhle. * Pfaffenrot: Pfaffenrot and Gertrudenhof * Schielberg: Schielberg, \\"Bergschmiede, Hotel\\", Schlotterhof, Steinh√§usle and Frauenalb  Remchingen  Remchingen The municipality Remchingen in the Enz district borders to Karlsbad on the northeastern frontier of the last- mentioned. It is located within the Pfinz Valley, counts about 12,000 inhabitants and consists of the following former municipalities: * N√∂ttingen (bordering to Auerbach), * Wilferdingen * Singen Historic ties between Karlsbad and Remchingen become obvious comparing the coats of arms of the former municipalities.

It was erected in 1897 at Hanlan's Point on the Toronto Islands for the minor league Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club. It was destroyed by fire twice, in 1903, and again in 1909. Adjacent to the Hanlan's Point Amusement Park, the site was in use for various sports until the late 1930s. History Initially, a grandstand and bleachers were built on the site. When the Toronto Ferry Company acquired the Leafs, it moved the team from Sunlight Park near the mouth of the Don River on the mainland to the Hanlan's Point field on the islands. The Toronto Ferry Company built a new semi-circular grandstand, with the old grandstand converted to bleachers. The Maple Leafs played at the stadium until 1901, when they moved to Diamond Park on the mainland. The Hanlan's stadium and the adjacent bar, both managed by Lol Solman, were destroyed by a fire on September 8, 1903. The stadium was rebuilt and reopened on May 24, 1904 and it was reported that there were so many people on the reopening, that the ferries couldn't carry everyone to the Toronto Islands. A baseball game being played at the stadium. In 1908, the stadium was replaced with Maple Leaf Park, a new baseball stand and grounds at Hanlan's Point and the Maple Leafs returned. When it was built, Maple Leaf Park had 3,000 seats, covered bleachers that could accommodate another 4,500, and uncovered bleachers with room for about another 1,800. On opening day, May 12, 1908, the Leafs came from behind to defeat the Jersey City Skeeters in extra innings with paid attendance of 6,192. The stadium was destroyed by a fire on August 10, 1909 which also wiped out the amusement park at Hanlan's Point and Hanlan's Hotel, which was not rebuilt after the fire. For the rest of the season, the Maple Leafs had to return to the smaller Diamond Park. Aerial view of the airport site in 1937. Maple Leaf Stadium is near top center. Hanlan's Point Stadium is middle right. A new stadium was built on the site, opening in 1910 and described at the time as the largest in all of the minor leagues with over 17,000 seats. It was designed by Toronto-based architect Charles F. Wagner. Initial advertising referred to the site as Hanlan's Point Stadium. It was also sometimes called Island Stadium. The first baseball game at the stadium‚Äîbut not the first event in the building‚Äîtook place on May 9, 1910 with the Leafs rallying to defeat the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning in front of a paid crowd of 12,867. The stadium is notable for being the location of Babe Ruth's first professional home run on September 5, 1914. Ruth was playing for the visiting Providence Grays and pitched a one-hitter against the Leafs to go along with his three- run home run over the right-field wall in a 9-0 win for Providence. A historic plaque commemorates the occasion near the Hanlan's Point dock. The Maple Leafs left the Toronto Islands for Maple Leaf Stadium after the 1925 season. In March 1927, the parks commissioner of the City of Toronto requested tenders for the demolition of the bleachers. The city architect had deemed them to be unsafe. The field remained in use until the construction of the Toronto Island Airport in 1937, when the area surrounding the airfield (where the old terminal building is now located) was converted to parkland. Two markers were placed near the site along Lakeshore Avenue.

It is around from the center of Beijing, between the Fourth and Fifth ring roads, and has good public transport links including a station on Line 13 of the Beijing Subway. It became a commercial center in Haidian during the 1950s following the establishment of several universities.

Some may also refer to Wudaokou as Koreatown, for the large number of Koreans in the area. Location Wudaokou is close to a large number of universities and research institutes, including Tsinghua University, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beihang University, Peking University, China University of Geosciences, University of Science and Technology Beijing, and Beijing Forestry University, and as such has a large student population. Google's China office used to be located here. Wudaokou is also known for its large number of international students. Wudaokou's popularity as an international student area is reflected in its large number of bars and nightclubs (including Wu Club, Global Club, Sugar Shack, Lush, Sensation and Propaganda), which generally offer cheaper prices than many similar clubs in more central areas, such as Sanlitun. The Wudaokou area is also notable for its large number of Koreans, with many signs in Korean advertising businesses, restaurants and bars located within its vicinity. Korean students make up the largest foreign student population. While centrally located along Beijing's Line 13 subway, the 2-lane in each direction Chengfu Lu (Chengfu Road), which runs east-west under an elevated rapid transit line, suffers from severe traffic congestion problems regardless of rush hour primarily because of heavy foot traffic due to subway users, and because it is the only route connecting the Eastern and Western sides of Wudaokou across the railway corridor. Congestion has improved since the under- grounding of the heavy rail line as part of the Beijing‚ÄìZhangjiakou intercity railway project, which eliminated the level crossing from which Wudaokou draws its name.

Overview Set on a boat that beamed illegal television signals, Pirate TV consisted of skits and parodies of commercials and television programs, including Rastapiece Theater, a takeoff of Masterpiece Theatre with a dreadlocked, patois-speaking host, and \\"Reejok\\" (jockstraps with inflatable pouches, √† la Reebok's \\"Pump\\" sneaker, popular at the time). It was co-created by Dave Kolin and Steve Kerper. Originally airing as 13 one-hour episodes, they were later edited down to a half hour. Many of the concepts of the show, and indeed Rastapiece Theater itself, later transferred to Kerper and Kolin's HBO series Hardcore TV (1992-1993) The crew of the boat were played by, Boyd Hale (himself), James Rosenthal (himself), Gena Rositano (herself), Spruce Henry (himself) and Gregory Wolfe & James Wolfe as \\"the Wolfe Brothers.\\" Some episodes had a special guests such as Sgt.

Catgut makers usually use sheep or goat intestines, but occasionally use the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, or donkeys. Despite the name, catgut manufacturers do not use cat intestines. Etymology The word catgut may have been an abbreviation of the word \\"cattlegut\\". Alternatively, it may derive by folk etymology from kitgut or kitstring‚Äîthe word kit, meaning fiddle, having at some point been confused with the word kit for a young cat, the word \\"kit\\" being possibly derived from Welsh. Common uses =Stringed instruments= Catgut violin stringsFor a long time, catgut was the most common material for the strings of harps, lutes, violins, violas, cellos, and double basses, acoustic guitars and other stringed musical instruments, as well as older marching snare drums. Most musical instruments produced today use strings with cores made of other materials, generally steel or synthetic polymer. Gut strings are the natural choice for many classical and baroque string players, and gut strings are still most commonly preferred in concert- tension pedal/grand and some lever harps because they give a richer, darker sound as well as withstanding high tension within low alto, tenor, and high- bass ranges. Many acoustic guitarists moved away from gut strings in the early 1900s when the C. F. Martin & Company introduced steel strings, which gave greater volume to the guitar. \\"The demand for steel came from ensemble players, who couldn't make themselves heard clearly without it.\\"de Ste. Croix, Philip, editor. The Complete Guitar Encyclopedia, New York: Parragon Books, 2014, p. 14 Within a few years the majority of Martin guitars were made with steel strings to accommodate the demand. After World War II, most classical and flamenco guitarists switched from catgut to the new nylon strings for their greater smoothness, durability, and stability of intonation. Before 1900, the best strings for musical instruments were reputedly from Italy. Musicians believed the best were from Naples, though Rome and other Italian cities also produced excellent strings. Today high quality gut strings are produced mostly in Italy, Germany, and the United States. They are also made elsewhere, for example in India and Morocco, for local use. =Sutures= Catgut suture was once a widely used material in surgical settings. There is debate about whether to continue using catgut in a medical setting, since cotton is usually cheaper and wounds closed with either cotton or synthetic threads are less prone to infection. Catgut sutures remain in use in developing countries where they are locally less expensive and easier to obtain. Catgut treated with chromium salts, known as chromic catgut, is also used in surgery. =Tennis racquets= Natural gut is still used as a high- performance string in tennis racquets, although it had more popularity in the past and is being displaced by synthetic strings. Production To prepare catgut, workers clean the small intestines, free them from any fat, and steep them in water. Then they scrape off the external membrane with a blunt knife, and steep the intestines again for some time in potassium hydroxide. Then they smooth and equalize the intestines by drawing them out. Lean animals yield the toughest gut. Next, they twist the prepared gut strands together to make string. String diameter is determined by the thickness of the individual guts, and by the number used. A thin string, such as a violin E, uses only three or four guts, whereas a double bass string may use twenty or more. After twisting and drying, workers polish the strings to the required diameter. Before the twentieth century, the strings were simply rubbed with an abrasive to smooth them. Today they are generally ground down to the desired diameter using a centerless grinder. After drying and polishing, workers bleach and disinfect the strings using sulfur dioxide, dye them if necessary, and sort them into sizes. Catgut sutures are normally treated with a chromium salt solution to resist body enzymes, to slow the absorption process, and are called catgut chromic sutures‚Äîwhereas untreated catgut sutures are called catgut plain sutures.

Black Power and unions grew in the 1970s, and rapso grew along with them. The first recording was Blow Away by Lancelot Layne in 1970. Six years later, Cheryl Byron (founder of the New York City based Something Positive Dance Company) was scorned when she sang rapso at a calypso tent; she is now called the \\"Mother of Rapso\\". It has been described as \\"de power of de word in the riddim of de word\\". Though often described as a fusion of native soca and calypso with American hip hop, rapso is uniquely Trinidadian. History Rapso music is itself an evolution of the chantwell or griot tradition of African music in the diaspora. It is called \\"the poetry of Calypso\\" and \\"the Power of the Word in the rhythm of the Word\\". Rapso is the poetic \\"rap\\" form of Trinbagonian music‚Äîthe next evolutionary step of Calypso and Soca music. It also has origins in the oral tradition elements of the performances of traditional masquerade characters in Trinidad Carnival. Traditional masquerade characters, such as the Midnight Robber, Pierrot Grenade, and the Wild Indians, each have particular forms of poetic and musical speeches that echoed ancient African masking and poetic traditions. Rapso borrowed many of the rhythmic and performance elements of these forms. The first wave of rapso music occurred in the late 1960s with the invention of rapso by its pioneer Lancelot Layne. The second wave occurred in the late 1970s with Cheryl Byron who was the first woman to perform this brand of music in calypso tents, and mushroomed in the early '80s with the work of Brother Resistance and the Network Rhythm Band, alongside other artists such as Brother Cetewayo and Brother Book. This wave mainstreamed rapso music in Trinidad and Tobago and World Music. The third wave of rapso occurred with the advent of young groups including Kindred, Homefront and Boyz 'N The Road in the early 1990s. They were part of a musical movement entitled the \\"Kiskadee Karavan\\" that was led by millionaire Robert Amar, who invested his money in the unleashing of the young musical genius of Trinidad and Tobago. The Karavan revolutionised Trinidad‚Äôs music by taking \\"traditional\\" forms such as the rapso and giving it modern production and promotional methods to take the music to stadiums in the native Trinidad and Tobago. This opportunity uncovered many talents on the ground, and created a series of anthemic musical singles. The song \\"This Trini Could Flow\\" by super-group Kindred took Rapso into the 21st century and firmly entrenched the music as a form comparable to hip-hop and dancehall. Modern Rapso music can be described today as the Trinbagonian equivalent of what is known as American rap music as groups like Boyz 'N The Road and Khay (from Boyz 'N The Road) produce and chant to beats and rhythms more heavily influenced by the modern American hip-hop music culture fused with R&B; and Jazz, as opposed to the traditional or \\"Roots\\" rapso (with calypso and soca music). Nonetheless, traditional rapso continues to live on as super-group Kindred and 3 Canal maintain the balance with the calypso and soca music influences. Calypso influence on rap The basic elements of hip- hop‚Äîboasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and political commentary‚Äîwere all present in Trinidadian music as long ago as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 1930s. Calypso‚Äîlike other forms of music‚Äîcontinued to evolve through the 1950s and 1960s. When rock steady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso's example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved back and forth between the predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with 'slackness' and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, 'conscious' style. Terminology The term rapso was not invented until 1980, when the revolutionary Network Riddim Band with its two chantwells Brother Resistance and Brother Shortman released Busting Out. Initially dominated by the children of the Black Power movement, changes came in the 1990s with the younger artistes adopting the art form, most significantly the bands Kindred, Homefront, 3 Canal and Ataklan.

Career Marland began his career as an actor, appearing on the Irna Phillips series The Brighter Day and As the World Turns. He also did odd jobs on the side as a director for small theatre groups. On one such job, staging the DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson musical Good News!, he worked with Broadway dancer Edie Cowan and pianist Ethan Mordden, both of whom went on to professional careers as, respectively, choreographer and writer. Marland began his writing career by authoring some Nick Carter mysteries, under one of the publisher's standard pseudonyms. He first started writing scripts for soap operas in the 1970s, as a script writer for Harding Lemay on Another World. Soap operas = The Doctors= He was hired by NBC Daytime in 1976 after then head writer, Margaret DePriest, left The Doctors. Although Marland's writing received critical acclaim and the show received Daytime Emmys, ratings dropped. During his tenure on The Doctors, a variety of new acting talent were added to the program: Kathy Bates (Phyllis), Glenn Corbett (Jason Aldrich), Carol Potter (Betsy Match), Ted Danson (Mitch Pierson), and Jonathan Frakes (Tom Carroll), among other actors. Marland was instrumental in shifting the serial's focus away from Hope Memorial Hospital to the Powers and Aldrich families, as well as the Dancy family, introduced by previous head writers Robert Cenedella and Margaret DePriest. =General Hospital= After his job on The Doctors, he was hired by ABC Daytime in 1978 to work with Gloria Monty on their serial General Hospital. At that time, the show was near cancellation. Marland's writing, along with Monty's extensive production changes, helped the show rise in the ratings. Marland was instrumental in pairing the iconic of Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, as well as creating vixen nurse Bobbie Spencer, and the Quartermaine family. Although the changes at General Hospital were a success, Marland was not interested in moving to Los Angeles, where the show was produced, and didn't like the show's increased pacing by Monty. Marland left the show a year later. =As the World Turns and Guiding Light= Back in New York, he was asked by CBS Daytime to temporarily assume the head writing reins at As the World Turns, which he did for thirteen weeks. In 1979, he assumed the head writing reins of Guiding Light. Marland's run on GL produced popular storylines and characters. One character Marland introduced was Nola Reardon, played by Lisa Brown. The unconventional Nola started as a villainess and became the heroine of the show. Another story was an envelope-pushing story that featured the character of Carrie Todd Marler (played by Jane Elliot). Carrie was diagnosed with multiple personalities, and Marland had barely delved into her psychosis when Elliot's contract was abruptly terminated by Executive Producer Allen M. Potter in 1982; Marland resigned in protest. =Loving= Marland next teamed up with fellow writer Agnes Nixon to create Loving, which premiered in June 1983. He served as head writer for the show's first two years. The show was a critical but not commercial success during the time that he wrote it. =A New Day in Eden= During the 1982‚Äì1983 season, he co-wrote, with James Rosin , a show that he had created, A New Day in Eden for the cable channel Showtime. The show was hailed as TV's first \\"nude\\" serial, in which many cast members would perform their love scenes without clothes. The show thrived on the taboo, showcasing bodies and a perverse combination of sex and violence, including a deflowering in a barn, a sexual assault in a shower, and one story in which a woman seduced the rival for another man's affections in a lesbian storyline. Despite its controversy and the fact that the cast included Steve Carlson, Jane Elliot (fresh from her run as Tracy on GH & Carrie on GL), and Lara Parker (famous as the witch Angelique on the cult Dark Shadows) and that it was produced and sometimes directed by daytime veteran actress Susan Flannery, A New Day in Eden only lasted 66 episodes. =Return to As the World Turns= Marland was hired in 1985 to return to As the World Turns. Marland refocused the show and made the Hughes family central to the plot again. He utilized over 30 years of history to create new storylines for core characters Bob Hughes and Kim Hughes. (One story, where a child previously thought to be dead was found to be alive and living in England, was a dual role played by future Oscar-winning actress Julianne Moore.) He was also credited with bringing original cast members Helen Wagner and Don MacLaughlin back to the center the show as Nancy and Chris Hughes, after they'd been bumped to recurring status in 1982. When McLaughlin (and his character) died in 1986, Marland paired Nancy with Chief of Detectives Dan McClosky, and then chronicled McClosky's subsequent battle with Alzheimer's disease. He also reached back to Lisa McColl's 1965 stint on short-lived ATWT spinoff Our Private World, giving her a son, Scott Eldridge, hitherto unknown to viewers, who tracked her down as an adult. (He was said to have been born during the several-month-long lapse between when Private World ended and when Lisa resurfaced on ATWT in mid-1966.) He also introduced a new working-class family, the Snyders, into the storyline and added new dimensions to the wealthy Lucinda Walsh (Elizabeth Hubbard) by tying the Walshes and Snyders together. This resulted in the pairing of Lily Walsh (Martha Byrne) and Holden Snyder (Jon Hensley). It was also revealed that Iva Snyder (Lisa Brown) was the biological mother of Lucinda's adopted daughter Lily. The new Snyder family was based largely on Douglas Marland's own experiences; he grew up on a farm in West Sand Lake, NY. In several interviews, Marland remarked that the character of Seth Snyder was based largely on his own life. Seth was the oldest child, who had been taken on great responsibility in helping to raise his siblings following patriarch Harvey Snyder's death. This event was key to the formation of the Snyder family dynamic, in that Marland was allowed to write a strong and independent yet maternal figure in matriarch Emma Snyder (Kathleen Widdoes). Marland was also responsible for adding the first gay male character on an American soap opera to his story during his tenure, Hank Elliot (Brian Starcher). The story was short-lived (Hank was featured for about 18 months), but groundbreaking; the soap opera became a pioneer for others who wished to put gay male characters, heretofore unseen, on their respective shows. Although the story centered on Hank, it allowed viewers to see another side to long running characters, when those characters reacted to the news that Hank was gay. Hank was written off of the show to take care of his lover Charles, who was dying of AIDS. Starcher was nominated for a Soap Opera Digest Award in 1990. Marland diversified the previously white canvas of As the World Turns, introducing an Amerasian character as the child of a Vietnam vet, and also featuring a story of a mixed-race couple marrying and having a baby (and showing negative reactions to the marriage and birth). Another story featured town matriarch Nancy Hughes helping a young, illiterate African-American girl (played by singer/actress Lauryn Hill), learn to read. Marland also penned a story featuring the character of Ellie Snyder having an abortion; abortion is a rarity in daytime and this again allowed Marland to write about both sides of a controversial issue. = Illness, death and aftermath at ATWT = Marland wrote ATWT until his death from complications after abdominal surgery on March 6, 1993. His successors were Juliet Law Packer and Richard Backus.  Marland's Rules  During his tenure at As the World Turns, Marland gave an interview to a soap magazine with his rules on \\"how NOT to ruin a soap\\". In the years that followed, and since his death, the rules have been much discussed in the serial press and by Internet soap opera fans. The rules are: * Watch the show. * Learn the history of the show. You would be surprised at the ideas that you can get from the back story of your characters. * Read the fan mail. The very characters that are not thrilling to you may be the audience's favorites. * Be objective. When I came in to (the show), the first thing I said was, what is pleasing the audience? You have to put your own personal likes and dislikes aside and develop the characters that the audience wants to see. * Talk to everyone; writers and actors especially. There may be something in a character's history that will work beautifully for you, and who would know better than the actor who has been playing the role? * Don't change a core character. You can certainly give them edges they didn't have before, or give them a logical reason to change their behavior. But when the audience says, \\"He would never do that,\\" then you have failed. * Build new characters slowly. Everyone knows that it takes six months to a year for an audience to care about a new character. Tie them in to existing characters. Don't shove them down the viewers' throats. * If you feel staff changes are in order, look within the organization first. P&G; (Procter & Gamble) does a lot of promoting from within. Almost all of our producers worked their way up from staff positions, and that means they know the show. * Don't fire anyone for six months. I feel very deeply that you should look at the show's canvas before you do anything. * Good soap opera is good storytelling. It's very simple. Awards and nominations Marland won several Daytime Emmy Awards, including one in 1974-75 as the associate writer for \\"Another World,\\" and two as head writer for \\"Guiding Light.\\" He also earned several Emmy nominations as head writer for \\"As the World Turns\\" https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/07/nyregion/douglas-marland-58-a-recipient-of- emmies-for-television-writing.html Daytime Emmy Awards WINS *(1975; Best Writing; Another World) *(1981 & 1982; Best Writing; Guiding Light) *(1993; Lifetime Achievement Award, posthumous) NOMINATIONS *(1986, 1989, 1991 & 1993; Best Writing; As the World Turns) Writers Guild of America Award NOMINATIONS *(1990 season; As the World Turns) Head writing history References External links * New York Times, March 7, 1993, Obituaries, \\"Douglas Marland, 58, a Recipient of Emmies for Television Writing\\" Category:American male television writers Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:American soap opera writers Category:Daytime Emmy Award winners Category:1934 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Douglas Marland"},{"id":"919644","text":"Kieran Hebden (born September 1977), best known by the stage name Four Tet, is an English musician. Hebden first came to prominence as a member of the band Fridge before establishing himself as a solo artist. As Four Tet, Hebden has produced ten studio albums. He has remixed tracks by artists including Aphex Twin, Bicep, Explosions in the Sky, Super Furry Animals, Radiohead, Ellie Goulding, J Dilla, Lana Del Rey, Manic Street Preachers, Sia, Black Sabbath and Madvillain. As a producer, he has produced two albums by psychedelic improvisational group Sunburned Hand of the Man, and two albums by Syrian dabke singer Omar Souleyman. Hebden's recent output includes a number of improvisational works with jazz drummer Steve Reid and collaborations with Burial and Thom Yorke. He also wrote a miscellaneous song called Go Go Ninja Dinosaur for the charity album Colours Are Brighter, released in 2006. When writing this song he featured singer Princess Watermelon, who has not been active musically since collaborating on the song. Early life Kieran Hebden was born in Putney, London, England, to a South African-born Indian mother and a British sociology lecturer father. He attended Elliott School in Putney, where he formed the band Fridge with classmates Adem Ilhan and Sam Jeffers. The band signed a recording contract when Hebden was 15, and released their first album, Ceefax, on Trevor Jackson's Output Recordings label in March 1997. While working with Fridge, Hebden went on to earn a degree in maths and computer studies from Manchester University.Muggs, Joe. \\"Make It Funky, Make It Folky.\\" The Telegraph, Telegraph Media Group, 28 May 2005, www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3642767/Make-it-funky-make-it-folky.html. Career Hebden's first solo release was the 1997 single \\"Double Density\\", released on the Output label under the artist name 4T Recordings. He began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36 minute, 25 second single \\"Thirtysixtwentyfive\\". Later that year, he released another single, the jazz- influenced \\"Misnomer\\". 1999's Dialogue, again on Output, was Four Tet's first full-length album release and fused hip hop drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the double A-side single \\"Glasshead\\"/\\"Calamine\\", which was to be Four Tet's last release on Output. In late 1999, Warp Records released Warp 10 + 3: Remixes, a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks. Hebden contributed a remix of the opening track of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Volume II, which was considered to be his break-out release. In 2001, Four Tet's second album Pause was released on Domino Recording Company and found Hebden using more folk and electronic samples, which was quickly dubbed \\"folktronica\\" by the media and press in an attempt to label the style (often also applied to artists such as Isan and Gravenhurst). Rounds was released in May 2003. Three singles were released from the album: \\"She Moves She\\", \\"As Serious as Your Life\\" and \\"My Angel Rocks Back and Forth\\". This last single was released as an EP featuring remixes by electronica duo Icarus and Isambard Khroustaliov along with additional Four Tet tracks \\"I've Got Viking in Me\\" and \\"All the Chimers\\". An accompanying DVD featured all of Four Tet's videos to date. In addition, the closing track \\"Everything is Alright\\" was featured in a U.S. Nike commercial in 2001 and 2002. At the beginning of 2003, Four Tet opened for Radiohead on their European tour. A remix of the song \\"Scatterbrain\\" from Radiohead's sixth studio album Hail to the Thief was released in November 2003 as a B-side to the single \\"2 + 2 = 5\\" and later included on their 2004 EP COM LAG (2plus2isfive). Furthermore, Hebden was among the people thanked by Radiohead in the booklet accompanying their 2007 In Rainbows \\"discbox\\" release. Hebden performing at the Grog Shop in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004 A live album named Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004 was released in April 2004 as a limited edition, available exclusively from the Domino Records website. In March and April 2005, Four Tet performed two shows of improvisational music, in collaboration with jazz drummer Steve Reid, in Paris and London. He also appears on Steve Reid Ensemble 2005 album Spirit Walk. This collaboration was extended into a series of international tours, and the release of two albums, The Exchange Session Vol. 1 and The Exchange Session Vol. 2 over the course of 2005 and 2006. His fourth studio album Everything Ecstatic was released on Domino on 23 May 2005. The video for the lead single, \\"Smile Around the Face\\", features actor Mark Heap. On 7 November 2005, Domino released a DVD version of Everything Ecstatic featuring video clips for each track of the album plus a CD with new material, titled Everything Ecstatic Part 2, which was later made available as an individual EP.

A new EP, Ringer, was released on 21 April 2008. Hebden performing at Circulo de Bellas Artes in Madrid, Spain in 2008 In 2008, Hebden collaborated with composer David Arnold to write \\"Crawl, End Crawl\\", the song used for the end credits of the film Quantum of Solace. In 2009, Hebden worked on a secret collaboration with former schoolmate Burial. The two track 12\\" was released with a plain black cover with no liner notes or details contained on the vinyl, other than the artists' names and the track titles: \\"Moth\\" and \\"Wolf Cub\\". The release was universally critically acclaimed. In November 2009, details of the fifth full-length Four Tet album were released. Heavily influenced by a stint DJing at the Plastic People club in Shoreditch and entitled There Is Love in You, it was released on 25 January 2010. The album was preceded by a limited edition release of the 12\\" single \\"Love Cry\\". In 2010, Hebden collaborated with Laurie Anderson playing keyboards on the song Only an Expert from her Homeland album.

Having begun his career directing television commercials, Lyne is best known for directing Foxes, Fatal Attraction, 9¬Ω Weeks, Flashdance, Indecent Proposal, Jacob's Ladder and Unfaithful.  Early life  Lyne was born in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire and raised in London. He was educated at Highgate School in North London;Highgate School Register 7th Edn 1833‚Äì1988, Ed. Patrick Hughes & Ian F Davies 1989 together with his younger brother, Oliver Lyne (1944‚Äì2005), a classical scholar and academic at the University of Oxford. Their father was a teacher at the school.  Career  An avid moviegoer during his school days at Highgate, he was inspired to make his own films by the work of French New Wave directors like Jean Luc Godard, Fran√ßois Truffaut and Claude Chabrol. Lyne was among a generation of British directors in the 1970s, including Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson, who would begin their career making television commercials before going on to have major success in films. Their techniques in making commercials were admired and copied by major names in the film industry, with Lyne stating: \\"I remember making this advertisement up in Yorkshire when I got a message that Stanley Kubrick had called. He'd seen an ad I'd made for milk in which I'd used a particular type of graduated filter. He wanted to know exactly which filter I'd used.\\" Two of Lyne's early short films, The Table and Mr Smith, were entries in the London Film Festival. In his twenties he played trumpet with the jazz group The Colin Kellard Band. Lyne made his feature filmmaking debut in 1980 with Foxes, a look at the friendship of four teenage girls growing up in the San Fernando Valley, starring Jodie Foster. His next film, 1983's Flashdance, was an innovative blend of rock 'n' roll, new dance styles, and visual imagery. Lyne's visuals (reminiscent of his 1970s UK commercials for Brutus Jeans), wedded to Giorgio Moroder's score, propelled the story of an aspiring ballerina (Jennifer Beals, in her film debut) who works in a factory by day and dances in a club at night. The film generated over $200 million worldwide and was the third highest-grossing film of 1983. The film was also nominated for four Academy Awards, with the theme song, \\"What a Feeling\\", winning the Oscar for Best Song. In 1986, Lyne attracted controversy with 9¬Ω Weeks. Based on a novel by Elizabeth McNeill, the tale of a sexually obsessive relationship starred Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. Although considered too explicit by its American distributor, and cut for U.S. release, it became a huge hit abroad in its unedited version. Lyne's fourth film was the blockbuster Fatal Attraction, which generated over $320 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 1987. The story of a happily married lawyer (Michael Douglas) who tries to break off an affair with an attractive single woman (Glenn Close), only to have her become obsessed with him and endanger his family, the film struck a chord with audiences. Deemed \\"the zeitgeist hit of the decade\\" by Time magazine, Fatal Attraction earned six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Glenn Close), Best Supporting Actress (Anne Archer), Best Screenplay and Best Editing. In 1990, Lyne directed Jacob's Ladder. Written by Academy Award- winner Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost) and starring Tim Robbins, Elizabeth Pe√±a and Danny Aiello, the film took audiences on a ride through Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer's (Robbins) nightmarish world of reality and hallucinations to reveal a surprise twist ending. The film won Best Picture at the Avoriaz Film Festival. With Indecent Proposal, Lyne examined how the sexes look at relationships and money. Starring Robert Redford, Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore, Indecent Proposal, became a worldwide box office hit. Lyne's version of Lolita, based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and starring Jeremy Irons, was filmed for theatrical release in 1997, but American distributors shied away from it due to its controversial subject matter. The film premiered on Showtime and was so well-received that national theatrical distribution soon followed. His next film, Unfaithful, was loosely based on Claude Chabrol's La Femme Infid√®le. The movie stars Richard Gere and Diane Lane in a story of a marriage threatened by infidelity and murder. Lane received much praise for her performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Actress. He is directing the erotic thriller Deep Water, based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith.https://deadline.com/2019/08/adrian-lyne-deep-water-ben-affleck-ana- de-armas-patricia-highsmith-adaptation-new-regency-1202658671/ Disney's 20th Century Fox will release the film in US on 13 August 2021, making it Lyne's first directorial effort in 19 years, and the first erotic film released by Disney since Color of Night in 1994.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1994-04-03-ca-41618-story.htmlNew Regency Bringing Adrian Lyne Back To Directing With ‚ÄòDeep Water;‚Äô Ben Affleck, Ana de Armas In Talks For Patricia Highsmith Adaptation Filmography As director: * The Table (1973; short film; also writer) * Mr. Smith (1976; short film; also writer) * Foxes (1980) * Flashdance (1983) * 9¬Ω Weeks (1986) * Fatal Attraction (1987) * Jacob's Ladder (1990) * Indecent Proposal (1993) * Lolita (1997) * Unfaithful (2002; also producer) * Deep Water (2021) As writer: * Back Roads (2018) References External links * Adrian Lyne at the British Film Institute * * Category:1941 births Category:English film directors Category:English film producers Category:Living people Category:People educated at Highgate School Category:People from Peterborough Category:Television commercial directors ","title":"Adrian Lyne"},{"id":"919680","text":": See: United States Air Force Plant 42 for the United States Government use of the facility Palmdale Regional Airport is an airport in Palmdale, California, United States. The city of Palmdale took over the airport at the end of 2013, managing it via the Palmdale Airport Authority. Overview Palmdale Regional Airport has a small airline terminal and a hangar. The airport terminal is at the southwest corner of the airport and began civilian operations in 1971. The FAA's Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center is next to the facility. The airport is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service facility based on enplanements in 2008 (more than 10,000 per year). Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 10,392 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 82% more than the 5,712 in 2007. PMD has two main runways: 4/22 and 7/25, both over long. 7/25 was built to withstand an 8.3 Richter Scale earthquake, making it one of the world's strongest runways. Another smaller runway, 72/252, is used as an assault strip. PMD and Plant 42 are separate facilities that share a common runway at the site. The facility is located in the Antelope Valley, approximately 60 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Facilities LA/Palmdale Regional Airport terminal The airport covers 5,832 acres (2,360 ha) at an elevation of 2,543 feet (775 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways with concrete surfaces: 4/22 is 12,001 by 150 feet (3,658 x 46 m); 7/25 is 12,002 by 200 feet (3,658 x 61 m); 72/252 is 6,000 by 75 feet (1,829 x 23 m). During the 1990s, airlines operated out of the Palmdale Regional Airport, which consisted of the terminal and parking lot on leased land. The last airline pulled out in 1998. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) owns 17,000 acres east of Plant 42 that was acquired for an airport. The city of Los Angeles bought the land in the 1960s when it planned to build an airport in Palmdale, but the airport was never built. In March 2001 Los Angeles County hired Tri-Star Marketing to prepare the presentations needed to bring air- passenger service back to Palmdale Regional Airport. However, the regional transportation plans formulated by the Southern California Association of Governments focus on having airports in Burbank, Ontario, Irvine and El Toro to handle the excess air-passenger service for the Southern California region. =Airline service: 2007‚Äì2008= After several airlines were unable to sustain operations at Palmdale, the terminal was remodeled and reopened in May 2007. Convincing airlines of the marketability of the airport without subsidies has been difficult. Although Palmdale Airport offers airline passengers a quicker ground travel time northbound from Sherman Oaks than the LAX airport car trip southbound down the 405 freeway, it has not provided the range of destinations that would make passengers choose it over LAX and Bob Hope Airport. The communities around LAX and Burbank do not want the noise of additional flights, but most Antelope Valley residents support expanding service at Palmdale. AGL in 2007 In January 2007 subsidies valued at $4.6 million, with $2 million slated to underwrite losses incurred from providing airline service, were raised to restore commercial service to the airport. The incentive package included a $900,000 grant from the federal government to the city of Palmdale to develop regional airport service. In February 2007 the city of Palmdale and LAWA selected United Airlines to provide service between Palmdale and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). (The only other proposal was from Delta Air Lines to Salt Lake City). The United Express flights operated by SkyWest Airlines offered twice-daily, Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet service beginning on June 7, 2007. Between June 7 and December 31, 2007, the airport served 12,022 passengers, about 58 per day. On September 3, 2008, the San Francisco United Express service operated by SkyWest Airlines was increased from two 50-seat regional jets a day to four 30-seat Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprop flights per day. On its September 18 schedule update, United canceled all flights beginning December 7, 2008, the day after the expiration of the federal grant and 18 months after the beginning of the SFO-PMD services. The airport currently does not have any scheduled passenger airline service. Museums The Blackbird Airpark MuseumBlack Airpark Museum part of Air Force Flight Test Center Museum and the adjacent Palmdale Plant 42 Heritage Airpark (now \\"Joe Davies Heritage Airpark\\") have been opened on Plant 42 property along Avenue P, with displays of the SR-71, U-2, Century Series fighters and other aircraft designed, engineered, manufactured, and flight tested at its facilities. Both museums are free to the public. The Blackbird Airpark Museum is an extension of the AFFTC Museum at Edwards AFB, while the Heritage Airpark is operated by the city of Palmdale. Both are manned by retirees who had previously worked in the aerospace industry, some actually having worked on the aircraft displayed at the two parks. All of the aircraft have been carefully restored for public display. The two airparks are located at Avenue P and 25th Street East near Site 9.  FAA operations  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at its site near Plant 42 at Avenue P and 25th Street East. This center controls and tracks aircraft over much of the western United States, including parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and the Pacific Ocean. History Palmdale Airport in 1953, showing its World War II configuration The origins of Palmdale Regional Airport go to the early 1930s, when a small airstrip was built in the desert. It was listed in 1935 documentation as CAA Intermediate #5. It was established by the Bureau of Air Commerce (later the Civil Aeronautics Administration) who maintained a network of emergency landing fields. It provided a pilot in distress with a better alternative than landing on a public road or a farmer's field.California World War II airfield database =World War II= In 1940, Palmdale Army Airfield was activated as a United States Army Air Corps (later Air Forces) airfield for use as an emergency landing strip and for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber support training during World War II. It was one of many intermediate fields that were used as auxiliary fields or emergency landing fields by the AAF during World War II. Their dispersion along the air routes, their infrequent use, and their U.S. government ownership made them ideal for use by military aircraft. It acted as a sub-base for Muroc Army Airfield and Hammer Army Airfield. =Postwar use= Palmdale Army Airfield was declared a surplus facility in 1946 and was purchased by Los Angeles County for use as a municipal airport. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 caused the Air Force to reactivate the property for use in final assembly and flight testing of military jet aircraft. Both the Air Force and its aircraft contractors needed a location away from major population centers - due to sonic booms, other noises and security concerns - but close enough to the major centers of aircraft design and production, while having excellent flying weather the year around. The land that became Plant 42 fit these criteria. Consequently, the Air Force agreed to purchase the land from Los Angeles County in 1951. Lockheed assembled 250 new TriStar wide body jetliners at their manufacturing plant located at the airport from 1968 to 1984.http://airliners.net, photos of new L-1011 aircraft at the Lockheed plant at Palmdale Airport (KPMD) = Past airline service = Eastern TriStar at Palmdale Regional Airport in 1974. Palmdale was meant to become an alternative to LAX. From 1970 to 1983 the Los Angeles Department of Airports, now called Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), acquired about of land east and south of United States Air Force Plant 42 in unincorporated Los Angeles County to be developed into the future \\"Palmdale Intercontinental Airport,\\" an alternative to LAX. LAWA has not developed its Palmdale airport land beyond the small airport terminal. From the late 1960s and early 1980s, commuter air carriers Cable Commuter Airlines followed by successor Golden West Airlines operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop service from the airport with several nonstop flights a day to Los Angeles (LAX).http://www.timetableimages.com, June 1, 1968 Cable Commuter Airlines system timetablehttp://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), LAX-Palmdale schedules & April 26, 1981 Golden West Airlines system timetable By 1983, Mojave Airlines was operating several nonstop flights a day to LAX with Beechcraft C99 commuter turboprops.http://www.timetableimages.com, 1983 Mojave Airlines system timetable In 1989, LAWA and the U.S. Air Force came to an agreement concerning use of the Plant 42 complex's facilities and land for commercial use. The agreement allows a maximum of 400 flights per day. LAWA used Plant 42's facilities in past years for scheduled air carrier service. In 1990, America West Airlines was operating nonstop service to Las Vegas and Phoenix with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops.http://www.departedflights.com, Oct. 28, 1990 America West Airlines route map However, this America West service lasted less than a year.http://www.departedflights.com, Oct. 27, 1991 America West Airlines route map Also during the 1990s, several commuter airlines used the Palmdale Regional Airport passenger terminal sited on Plant 42. These air carriers included SkyWest Airlines operating as the Delta Connection flying Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets nonstop to LAX in the early 1990s and Mesa Airlines operating as United Express flying Beechcraft 1900C turboprops to LAX in the mid 1990s.http://www.departedflights.com, Oct. 1, 1991 & April 2, 1995 Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions, LAX-Palmdale schedules Both airlines operated up to six round trip flights a day between the airport and LAX before ceasing all service. This civilian terminal was unused from 1998 to 2004; on December 29, 2004, civilian use resumed when Scenic Airlines began scheduled service to North Las Vegas, Nevada, although that service officially terminated in January 2006. United Airlines regional airline affiliate United Express operated by SkyWest then began daily service to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in June 2007, first with Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets, which were then replaced with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops. However, United Express then suspended all flights on the SFO-PMD route in December 2008 upon the expiration of grants that subsidized this scheduled air service. In late 2008, the city of Palmdale expressed interest in assuming operations at Palmdale Airport, including management of the terminal, taxiways, and parking, from LAWA. LAWA indicated that it was receptive to transferring the lease. The city took over the airport at the end of 2013, managing it via the Palmdale Airport Authority.  Related incident  On February 1, 1991, SkyWest Flight 5569 departing to Palmdale Regional Airport collided at LAX with USAir Flight 1493 on the runway, which killed all 12 occupants onboard Skywest.

Usually, these theories fall into three distinct categories: political (usually involving allegations of control of government, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom), religious (usually involving allegations of anti-Christian or Satanic beliefs or practices), and cultural (usually involving popular entertainment). Many conspiracy theories have connected the Freemasons (and the Knights Templar) with worship of the devil;Robinson, John. A Pilgrim's Path: Freemasonry and the Religious Right. M. Evans, 1993. Freemasonry The worship of Lucifer, SATAN Part 1 of 5 The Masonic Fairy Tale Known As The Leo Taxil ConfessionFreemasonry: Midwife to an Occult Empire these ideas are based on different interpretations of the doctrines of those organizations. Of the claims that Freemasonry exerts control over politics, perhaps the best-known example is the New World Order theory, but there are others. These mainly involve aspects and agencies of the United States government, but actual events outside the US (such as the Propaganda Due scandal in Italy) are often used to lend credence to claims. Another set of theories has to do with Freemasonry and Religion, particularly that Freemasonry deals with \\"the occult\\".Here used to denote a particular range of the occult involving Satanic or anti-Christian beliefs. These theories have their beginnings in the Taxil hoax.S. Brent Morris, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Freemasonry (2006), pp. 171-172; Christopher Hodapp, Freemasons for Dummies (2005), pp. 160-161; 298-299; In addition to these, there are various theories that focus on the embedding of symbols in otherwise ordinary items, such as street patterns, national seals, corporate logos, etc. There are Masonic conspiracy theories dealing with every aspect of society. The majority of these theories are based on one or more of the following assumptions: *That Freemasonry is its own religion, requires belief in a unique Masonic god, and that belief in this Masonic god is contrary to the teachings of various mainstream religions (although usually noted in terms of being specifically contrary to Christian belief)See, for example, the claims made by William A. Whalen, in his essay The Masonic Religion, available on the ewtn.com website; or the claims made at evangelicaltruth.com. *That the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite is more than an honorary degree, coupled with the belief that most Freemasons are unaware of hidden or secretive ruling bodies within their organization that govern them, conduct occult ritual, or control various positions of governmental powerFreemasonry - Conspiracy Within *That there is a centralized worldwide body that controls all Masonic Grand Lodges, and thus, all of Freemasonry worldwide acts in a unified manner. List of conspiracy theories associated with Freemasonry Notable conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry include: =Political= * That the British judiciary is heavily infiltrated with Masons, who give fellow Masons \\"the benefit of the doubt\\" in court, subverting the legal system.Trial could force judges to declare that they are MasonsFreemasons - moral guardians or centre of corruption? * That Freemasonry overlaps with, or is controlled by, the Illuminati, especially in the higher degrees; Illuminati Freemasons secretly control many major aspects of society and government and are working to establish the New World Order.Why the NSA tried to recruit me by James Casbolt in St Ives, UK ‚Äì October 31, 2006\\"The Road to Heart Mountain? Rumors, FEMA and the Future\\"United States Presidents and The Illuminati / Masonic Power Structure United States Presidents and The Illuminati / Masonic Power Structure Pt.4 Some conspiracy theories involving the Freemasons and the Illuminati also include the Knights Templar and Jews as part of the supposed plan for universal control of society. This type of conspiracy theory was described as early as 1792 by multiple authors, beginning in France and Scotland. * That Freemasonry is a Jewish front for world domination or is at least controlled by Jews for this goal. An example of this is the anti-Semitic literary forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Adolf Hitler believed that Freemasonry was a tool of Jewish influence,Hitler, Adolf. Mein Kampf: Volume One - A Reckoning. Chapter XI: Nation and Race . 1924 (trans. 1943). - \\"Finally, the Jewish influence on economic affairs grows with terrifying speed through the stock exchange. He becomes the owner, or at least the controller, of the national labor force. To strengthen his political position he tries to tear down the racial and civil barriers which for a time continue to restrain him at every step. To this end he fights with all the tenacity innate in him for religious tolerance-and in Freemasonry, which has succumbed to him completely, he has an excellent instrument with which to fight for his aims and put them across. The governing circles and the higher strata of the political and economic bourgeoisie are brought into his nets by the strings of Freemasonry, and never need to suspect what is happening.\\" and outlawed Freemasonry and persecuted Freemasons partially for this reason.Hitler, Adolf. Mein Kampf Volume Two - The National Socialist Movement. \\"Chapter XIII: German Alliance Policy after the War\\", 1924, trans. 1943. - \\"The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry's three principal weapons, the profound reasons for which may not have been consciously understood (though I do not believe this myself) furnishes the best proof that the poison fangs of that Power which transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect way. The prohibition of Freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of the supernational Press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the steadily increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State ‚Äì all this will enable the Italian Government, in the course of some years, to advance more and more the interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the hissing of the Jewish world-hydra.\\" The covenant of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas claims that Freemasonry is a \\"secret society\\" founded as part of a Zionist plot to control the world.'The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS)-Palestine', articles seventeen, twenty-two and twenty-eight, 18 Aug 1988.

A fork typically consists of two blades which are joined at the top by a fork crown. The crown is often at the front. Most suspension forks have an arch connecting the two side of the lowers (the part connected to the axle.) It is often in front of the stanchions (shaft the lowers slide on) but not always. Above the crown, a steerer tube attaches the fork to the bicycle and the handlebars (via a stem) allowing the rider to steer the bicycle. The steerer tube of the fork interfaces with the frame via bearings called a headset mounted in the head tube. At the bottom of the fork, fork ends hold the wheel. Usually, either the axle is bolted to the fork, or a quick release skewer passes through a hollow axle, clamping the axle to the fork. The term fork is sometimes also used to describe the part of a bicycle that holds the rear wheel, which on 19th century ordinary or penny-farthing bicycles was also a bladed fork. On most modern bicycle designs the rear wheel is now attached to a rear triangle comprising the seat tube, a pair of seat stays, and a pair of chain stays, rather than an actual fork, but the rear fork usage persists. Dimensions The location of the fork on a bicycle Forks have several key dimensions which include: offset, length, width, steerer tube length, and steerer tube diameter. =Offset= Bicycle forks usually have an offset, or rake (not to be confused with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the fork ends forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the fork ends forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption. The purpose of this offset is to reduce 'trail', the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the point where the steering axis intersects the ground. Too much trail makes a bicycle feel difficult to turn. Road racing bicycle forks have an offset of 40-55mm. For touring bicycles and other designs, the frame's head angle and wheel size must be taken into account when determining offset, and there is a narrow range of acceptable offsets to give good handling characteristics. The general rule is that a slacker head angle requires a fork with more offset, and small wheels require less offset than large wheels. =Length= The length of the fork is usually measured parallel to the steerer tube from the bottom of the lower bearing race to the center of the front wheel axle. A 1996 survey of 13 700c road forks found a maximum length of 374.7 mm and a minimum of 363.5 mm. =Width= The width of the fork, also called spacing, is measured colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two fork ends. Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for through axles have 110 mm spacing. =Steerer tube length= The steerer tube is sized either to just accommodate the headset bearings, in the case of a threaded headset, or to contribute to the desired handlebar height, in the case of a threadless headset. =Steerer tube diameter= When sizing a fork to a frame, the diameter of the fork steerer or steer tube (1\\" or 1‚Öõ\\" or 1¬Ω\\") must not be larger than that of the frame, and the length of the steerer tube should be greater than but approximately equal to the head tube length plus the stack height of the headset. Adapter kits are available to enable use of a 1\\" fork in a frame designed for a 1‚Öõ\\" steerer tube or a 1‚Öõ\\" fork in a 1¬Ω\\" frame. Manufacturers of high-end bikes, both road and mountain, have started to use tapered steerer tubes. While there are purported advantages, there are not any standards yet developed, with each manufacturer following its own conventions. This makes replacement parts difficult to come by, only available from the original manufacturer. =General sizing issues= The blades must be the proper length to both accommodate the desired wheel and have the correct amount of rake to provide the approximate steering geometry intended by the frame designer. The functional length of the fork is typically expressed in terms of Axle-to-Crown race length (A-C). Also, the axle on the wheel must fit in the fork ends (usually either a 9mm solid or hollow axle, or a 20mm thru- axle). Some manufacturers have introduced forks and matching hubs with proprietary standards, such as Maverick's 24mm axle, Specialized 25mm thru- axle and Cannondale's Lefty system. =Threading= Fork steerer tubes may be threaded or unthreaded, depending on the headset used to attach the fork to the rest of the bicycle frame. An unthreaded steel steerer tube may be threaded with an appropriate die if necessary. The thread pitch is usually 24 threads per inch except for some old Raleighs which use 26. Suspension Trailing link suspension fork on a Bridgestone Cannondale Head Shok suspension fork On most mountain bicycles, the fork contains a set of shock absorbers, in which case the blades typically consist of upper and lower telescoping tubes and are called \\"legs.\\" The suspension travel and handling characteristics vary depending on the type of mountain biking the fork is designed for. For instance, manufacturers produce different forks for cross- country (XC), downhill, and freeride riding. Forks designed for XC racing are typically lighter, less robust and have less suspension travel than those designed for rougher terrain and more extreme conditions. Popular makers of suspension forks include Cannondale, Fox, SR Suntour, Manitou, Marzocchi, and RockShox. Suspension fork design has advanced in recent years with suspension forks becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse in design. The amount of suspension travel available has increased over time. When suspension forks were introduced, 80‚Äì100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. Typically this amount of travel is now used in XC disciplines, with downhill forks now offering 150 to 200 mm of travel for handling extreme terrain. This is not the limit of suspension fork travel; for example, the Marzocchi Super Monster T offers 300 mm (12 inches) of travel. Other advances in design include adjustable travel allowing riders to adapt the fork's travel to the specific terrain profile. Typically, less suspension travel is needed for uphill or flat terrain than for downhill terrain. Advanced designs also often feature the ability to lock out the fork to eliminate or drastically reduce the fork's travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. This lockout can sometimes be activated remotely by a cable and lever on the handlebars. The shock absorber usually consists of two parts: a spring and a damper or dashpot. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, an elastomer, or even compressed air. The choice of spring material has a fundamental effect on the characteristics of the fork as a whole. Coil spring forks are often heavier than designs which use compressed air springs, but they are more easily designed to exhibit a linear, Hookean response throughout their travel. Replacing steel coils with titanium coils in a design can decrease the weight of the design but leads to an increase in expense. Air springs utilize the thermodynamic property of gases that their pressures increase as they are compressed adiabatically. As the \\"spring\\" is provided by air rather than a coil of metal, forks with air springs are often lighter. This makes their use more common in XC designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring constant can be adjusted by adjusting the air pressure. This allows a fork to be tuned to a rider's weight. One disadvantage of this design is the difficulty in achieving a linear response, as pressure varies approximately inversely (not linearly) with volume in a gas. As the fork compresses, the effective spring constant of the fork increases. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring can reduce this effect, but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited, as it needs to be contained within the dimension of the fork blade. The damper usually forces oil to pass through one or more small openings or shim stacks in the suspension fork. On some models, the spring, the damper, or both may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components may be separated with the spring mechanism in one blade and the damper in the other. Variations There have been many fork design variations tried over the years. Several are still in use today. =Suspension= Some have employed linkages to provide the mechanical action instead of relying upon telescoping elements. Others, notably Cannondale use a single shock built into the steerer tube above the crown. Another notable recent development in fork technology is the Lauf Spring which utilises composite leaf springs to provide mechanical shock absorption and damping, whilst offering a sizable weight reduction compared to conventional designs =Single blade= Single-bladed fork on Graeme Obree's Old Faithful Dursley Pedersen bicycle circa 1910. Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with a single leg. Many of Cannondale's single bladed forks, called Lefty, are suspension forks, in either conventional or inverted configurations. These forks use linear needle roller bearings on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed suspension forks use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the fork end by means of a screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork. =Track bikes= Track forks traditionally have round- section blades rather than the oval section used on road bikes, partly because a round section is stiffer under the lateral forces imposed by frequent sprinting but mainly because track racing tyres are always narrow and do not require the additional clearance afforded by oval blades. Round blades necessitate a special fork crown with matching round sockets. Track forks may not be drilled for a front brake if the bicycle is intended to be used only on a velodrome. The clearance between the tyre and the underside of the fork crown is often less than 5mm. =Attachment to the frame= Not all forks steer on bearings installed in a head tube. The forks on Stridas and Pedersen bicycles pivot about an axis external to the fork, supported at two different points on the frame. A new trend in triathlon bikes is similar, called a bayonet or external-steerer fork, but the pivot bearings are at the top and bottom of something that still resembles a head tube. Materials Forks have been made from steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, and various combinations. For example, a fork may have carbon fiber blades with an aluminum crown, steerer tube, or fork ends. In rigid forks the material, shape, weight, and design of the forks can noticeably affect the feel and handling of the bicycle. Carbon fiber forks are popular in road bicycles because they are light, and also because they can be designed to lessen and absorb vibrations from the road surface. There have also been examples of wooden forks. However, these have not been common in the modern era. Attachment points Forks may have attachment points for brakes, racks, and fenders. These may be located in the crown, along the blades, and near the fork ends. These are often holes, threaded or not, and may be located on tabs that protrude.

It was founded in June 2003, shortly before the closure of Black Isle Studios, by ex-Black Isle employees Feargus Urquhart, Chris Avellone, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, and Chris Jones. Although they have created original intellectual property, many of their games are sequels based on licensed properties. Early projects included Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords and Neverwinter Nights 2, both sequels to BioWare- developed games. The team then developed their first original game, Alpha Protocol, in 2010. Other notable works from Obsidian include Fallout: New Vegas, Dungeon Siege III, and South Park: The Stick of Truth, all of which are also licensed properties. Throughout the studio's history, many projects‚Äîincluding Futureblight, Dwarfs, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands‚Äîwere cancelled. Due to having so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games based on the studio's own intellectual property, including a sequel to Pillars of Eternity. In November 2018, it was announced that the studio had been acquired by Microsoft and become part of Microsoft Studios (now known as Xbox Game Studios). Their latest release is the science fiction RPG The Outer Worlds. History =2003: Founding= Obsidian Entertainment was founded by Feargus Urquhart, Chris Avellone, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan and Chris Jones on June 12, 2003. Prior to the establishment of Obsidian, they worked for Interplay Entertainment's subsidiary Black Isle Studios. At Black Isle they created several role-playing games including Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 2, and collaborated with BioWare on Neverwinter Nights, Baldur's Gate, and Baldur's Gate II. Most of these games were critically and commercially successful, but Interplay's financial situation was poor and the studio lost its license to produce Dungeons & Dragons-based games. This led to the cancellation of Baldur's Gate III: The Black Hound. Urquhart and most of the staff members were dissatisfied and frustrated with the cancellation, as the game had already been under development for a year and a half. Urquhart became convinced that staying in Black Isle was no longer a \\"viable option\\" for the team, and decided to leave the company. He was in his early thirties at the time, and thought that if he did not start a new company soon, he may become too old to do so. Urquhart officially left Interplay in 2003 with Avellone, Parker, Monahan, and Jones, and founded Obsidian Entertainment with them the same year. At the time of the company's establishment there were seven employees, including the company's five founders. Parker, Urquhart, and Monahan invested $100,000 to $125,000 into their newly founded company. When choosing the name of the company, they had prepared a short list of names for them to choose. The list included \\"Scorched Earth\\" and \\"Three Clown Software\\". The team eventually chose \\"Obsidian Entertainment\\", which they thought was strong, memorable, and felt similar to name of their old studio, Black Isle. Upon its establishment, the studio needed more capital in order to keep its operation running, and thus needed to gain support from publishers. They approached Electronic Arts, but it did not result in a project. The studio also contacted Ubisoft looking to make a Might & Magic game, but Ubisoft instead ended up contracting with Arkane Studios on that project, which became Dark Messiah of Might & Magic. Obsidian pitched a game to Take-Two Interactive called Futureblight, which was described as a Fallout-style game powered by the Neverwinter Nights engine. Similar to the EA and Ubisoft projects, Futureblight was never made. =Late 2003‚Äì2008: The Sith Lords and Neverwinter Nights 2= Towards the end of 2003, the team was contacted by LucasArts president Simon Jeffrey, who requested that Obsidian make an action role-playing game set in the Star Wars universe. The team suggested a game concept which featured first-person lightsaber melee combat and that included established characters like R2-D2. Their idea was rejected, and Jeffrey instead asked Obsidian to create a follow-up to the BioWare-developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, as the team at Obsidian was familiar with the technology that the original game used. The partnership between the two companies finalized in late 2003, and development of the game, which became Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, began in October 2003. Obsidian was given 15 months to develop The Sith Lords. Originally set for a holiday 2004 release, LucasArts gave the studio an extension into 2005, before shifting the release date back to holiday 2004 following the Electronic Entertainment Expo. While LucasArts did dispatch members of its own staff to help get the game out on time, a number of features wound up being cut due to time constraints. Due to the moved deadline, Obsidian also did not have enough time to polish the game, and The Sith Lords suffered from crashes and other technical issues. Despite its issues, The Sith Lords was released to positive critical reception. The cut features were eventually restored by modders, who began their effort in 2009 and finished in 2012. From the beginning, the studio's goal was to be able to develop multiple projects simultaneously, and the decision led the company to expand very quickly. Soon after the development of The Sith Lords began, the team expanded to 20 employees. As of July 2004, it had expanded to 27, with 18 from Black Isle, and others from Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Taldren, Totally Games, Treyarch, and Troika. Prior to the launch of The Sith Lords, Obsidian was approached by Atari. Atari acquired the license to produce Dungeons & Dragons-based games, and wanted Obsidian to create a sequel to Neverwinter Nights, which became Neverwinter Nights 2. Development of the game began in July 2005 with a team of ten people. The development of the game was headed by Monahan and Avellone. Obsidian became the game's lead developer, while Neverwinter Nights creator BioWare provided technical assistance. While they were developing the game, the team's size grew to about 50 people. The team were given sufficient time for the game's development, and Atari was willing to delay the project's targeted release window from Christmas 2005 to October 31, 2006. Neverwinter Nights 2 received a generally positive critical reception. Two expansions, Mask of the Betrayer and Storm of Zehir, were released in 2007 and 2008. During Neverwinter Nights 2s development, the team approached other publishers to work on additional projects. Disney Interactive Studios commissioned Obsidian to develop a prequel to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves called Dwarfs, which was set to be a third-person action game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Work began in 2005, and the team developed a prototype and was a year into development when Bob Iger replaced Michael Eisner as CEO of The Walt Disney Company. As CEO, Iger led Disney to head in a completely different direction, which made the Snow White franchise \\"untouchable\\" and resulted in the cancellation of the project. According to Urquhart, the team loved the game and its cancellation was a \\"heartbreaking\\" experience for them. =2009‚Äì2011: Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, and Dungeon Siege III= With the development of Neverwinter Nights 2 coming to an end, Obsidian was contacted by three different publishers. Electronic Arts wanted Obsidian to develop a role-playing game to compete with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and another publisher was also interested in having Obsidian develop a fantasy RPG. The third publisher was Sega, who wanted the studio to develop an action role-playing game set within the Alien franchise. The game, titled Aliens: Crucible, was to feature base-building, dialogue choices, and character customization. In February 2009, Obsidian sent a prototype to Sega. Sega decided to cancel the game three weeks later without inspecting the demo. The cancellation was officially confirmed in June of that year. At around the same time, Atari again approached Obsidian, this time to revive Baldur's Gate III. Obsidian requested a large budget, which Atari could not afford, and the deal between the two companies fell apart when Atari Europe was sold to Namco Bandai Games. Despite the cancellation of Aliens: Crucible, Sega was still interested in working with Obsidian to develop another project. Instead of developing a sequel, they were asked to develop a role-playing game based on a new intellectual property. The team came up with an idea of a \\"spy RPG\\". Sega approved the idea and decided to help with the game's funding and serve as its publisher. The game would go on to become Alpha Protocol. The game's development was troubled; the team did not have a precise vision for Alpha Protocol and struggled to settle on what gameplay elements to include and what the target audience should be. As a result, it suffered from an identity crisis and featured elements from multiple genres. Sega, for its part, was also unable to make decisions quickly and the publisher cut features from the game after their completion. This resulted in numerous delays and excessively long production time; Alpha Protocol took four years to develop. It was finally released in June 2010. Their first original game, Alpha Protocol received mostly mixed reviews from critics. It was also a commercial failure for Sega, which led to their decision to put any plans for a sequel on hold. After the game's launch, Urquhart admitted that there was still room for improvements. Even though the game was a commercial failure, it was well received by the community, which has often demanded that Obsidian make a sequel. Urquhart responded by saying that the team hoped that they can develop Alpha Protocol 2, and \\"do better\\" with it. Avellone later added that they were unable to develop a sequel because the rights to the game were owned by Sega and crowdfunding would not be a suitable option. On February 11, 2010, Red Eagle Games and Obsidian announced that they would co-develop one or more games based on The Wheel of Time fantasy novel series by Robert Jordan. On April 25, 2014, however, Urquhart told Computer & Video Games that the agreement between the companies had dissolved after Red Eagle had failed to secure the necessary funding. At the same time that Alpha Protocol was in development, Obsidian was also working on Fallout: New Vegas. Prior to working on New Vegas, they were contacted by Bethesda Softworks about developing a Star Trek game, but the idea never gained traction. After Bethesda released Fallout 3 and began to shift its own focus back towards its Elder Scrolls series, it approached Obsidian with the idea of having the latter studio develop another game in the Fallout series, as several of Obsidian's founders had worked on the franchise while at Black Isle. In developing New Vegas, Obsidian looked at fan requests, which led to New Vegas giving a more prominent role to the in-game factions. When the concept was pitched to Bethesda, it was immediately approved. The development of New Vegas began soon after the cancellation of Aliens: Crucible, and it was released in October 2010. It received generally positive reviews, with some critics saying that the game's quality exceeded that of the critically acclaimed Fallout 3. As was the case with The Sith Lords, the development team did not thoroughly assess New Vegas for bugs and glitches before it was released. Some players were unable to play the game due to constant crashes. These problems were later patched and fixed. Obsidian considered New Vegas to be a learning experience; it was the studio's first AAA game, and it taught the studio how to manage quality assurance. Between The Sith Lords and New Vegas, Obsidian had built a reputation for creating games with technical problems. The team was determined to change this with future titles, and made improvements to their bug-tracking system, These improvements were applied to the studio's next project, Dungeon Siege III, a sequel to the Gas Powered Games-developed Dungeon Siege, published by Square Enix. The game received mixed reviews upon release in 2011, but it enjoyed a stable launch. Dungeon Siege III was the first game to use Obsidian's own in-house Onyx engine. In 2011, the company began working on a third-person open world game named \\"Stormlands\\". It was rumored that the game was being produced for the then-unannounced successor to the Xbox 360. The title was ultimately cancelled in 2012 by its publisher, Microsoft Studios, causing Obsidian to lay off between 20 and 30 people. Obsidian then transformed Stormlands into another game title called Fallen and then pitched it to other publishers including 2K Games and Ubisoft. Despite hearing no response from them, Fallen became the foundation for one of Obsidian's future games, Tyranny. =2012‚Äì2015: The Stick of Truth, financial troubles, and Pillars of Eternity= In October 2009, Obsidian was contacted by South Park Digital Studios to develop a game set within the South Park universe. The team originally thought the phone call from South Park Digital Studios was a prank carried out by another company located in the same building. Obsidian met with South Parks creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, with the two parties agreeing that it was critical that the game share the television show's construction paper-like visual aesthetic. Funding was originally provided by Viacom, the parent company of the television channel that South Park is broadcast on. In 2011, Viacom decided to let the video game publisher THQ take over as the game's publisher. Shortly after THQ took over, they entered into a financial crisis, eventually going bankrupt in late 2011. With THQ unable to continue its publishing and funding roles, an auction was held for other publishers to acquire their titles. Obsidian was worried that if the project was cancelled, they too would face severe financial difficulties. Eventually Ubisoft acquired the game, which was released as South Park: The Stick of Truth in March 2014. In mid 2014, the studio announced Armored Warfare, a tank game developed for My.com. It launched in open beta during 2015. Obsidian has also maintained a friendly relationship with inXile Entertainment. Like Obsidian, inXile was founded by former employees of Interplay Entertainment. The two companies signed an agreement to share their technology with each other. Obsidian assisted in the development of inXile's Wasteland 2 after its Kickstarter campaign raised $2.1 million, Wasteland 2 was released in late 2014 and received generally positive reviews upon release. While the studio managed to complete South Park: The Stick of Truth, the company faced a precarious financial position. The studio received only a small \\"kill fee\\" for their work on North Carolina. They also lost their bonus for Fallout: New Vegas, as the game failed to meet Bethesda's standard‚Äîan aggregate review score of 85 at Metacritic‚Äîby 1 point. The team lacked sufficient resources to keep the company's operation running. According to Adam Brennecke, an executive producer at Obsidian, if they failed to pitch a project to a publisher in time they would have exhausted their money and gone bankrupt. At that time, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter was growing popular and Josh Sawyer, creative director of New Vegas, proposed that the studio put their cancelled game on Kickstarter and attempt to secure funding for it there. Some team members were skeptical about the idea and feared that they may not even be able to raise $100,000 through the platform. The question of whether to pursue a Kickstarter campaign led to numerous debates between key members of the company. The debates ended when Double Fine Adventures campaign launched and saw huge success. Secure in the belief that Kickstarter was a viable funding option, the team decided to use it to fund the development of a game they wanted to make for a very long time: a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate. The Kickstarter campaign for Pillars of Eternity was launched in September 2012 under the working name \\"Project Eternity\\", with Obsidian requesting $1.1 million. The studio approached Kickstarter with the mindset that if their campaign was successful the game could eventually be turned into a franchise, while if they were unsuccessful, they would attempt to refine their ideas and try again with another campaign. Obsidian's campaign was hugely successful, raising $4 million and breaking the record set by Double Fine Adventure. Pillars of Eternity was released in March 2015 to a positive critical reception. Paradox Interactive served as the game's publisher. Obsidian planned an expansion pack, called The White March. It was divided into two different parts, one of which was released on August 25, 2015, and the other on February 16, 2016. A board game for Pillars of Eternity titled Pillars of Eternity: Lords of the Eastern Reach was announced on May 19, 2015. It was developed by Zero Radius Games with input provided by Obsidian. Like the main game, it was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, and it reached its funding goal within a day. In June 2015, studio co-founder Chris Avellone announced his departure from Obsidian. In August 2015, Obsidian partnered with inXile and Double Fine to launch a new funding website named Fig, with Urquhart serving as a member of the company's advising board. The new platform's aim is to offer \\"equity crowdfunding\\", and it will only focus exclusively on video game-related projects. Obsidian is set to use Fig as its future crowdfunding platform. =2016‚Äì2018: Tyranny, Pathfinder, and Pillars of Eternity II= It was announced in July 2015 that the company was working on the localization for Skyforge. On August 13, 2014, Obsidian announced that they had licensed the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game to make electronic games, starting with a tablet adaptation of it, which was released for iOS and Android devices in April 2016, with releases for other platforms to be announced. Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens also confirmed plans for an Obsidian- developed computer role-playing game. Urquhart had stated a desire to collaborate with BioWare again on a new Star Wars game. After the release of New Vegas, there is also a desire to work on another Fallout game. On March 15, 2016, Obsidian announced their new project called Tyranny, an isometric RPG set in a world where evil has already won. The game was announced for release in 2016 on Microsoft Windows, Mac and Linux, and was published by Paradox Interactive. The game was originally called Fury, whose concept was created in 2006, and is set in \\"a world that had been laid waste by a magical apocalypse\\". The concept later became Defiance, whose concept is similar to that of Tyranny. Defiance, along with ideas of Obsidian's other projects later became Stormlands. As Stormlands was cancelled, the company reconsidered the original idea of Defiance to make Tyranny. In April 2016, Leonard Boyarsky joined Obsidian, becoming the second Troika Games co-founder to work for the company. On January 27, 2017, Obsidian announced Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire and launched a crowdfunding campaign on Fig to raise additional development funds. The project achieved its funding goal in less than a day, and was released in May 2018. In February 2017, it was announced that Obsidian were leaving the development of Armored Warfare in the hands of the game's publisher to finish the project. =2018‚Äìpresent: Microsoft acquisition, The Outer Worlds, Grounded, and Avowed= On November 10, 2018, it was announced that the studio had been acquired by Microsoft and become part of its Microsoft Studios division. Following the announcement of the acquisition, during The Game Awards ceremony in December 2018, Obsidian announced a new intellectual property named The Outer Worlds, an action role-playing game set in an alternate future in which megacorporations began colonizing and terraforming alien planets. The game was released on October 25, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a Nintendo Switch release to come in 2020. In November 2019, Obsidian announced its next game, titled Grounded, describing it as a \\"survival adventure where you're the size of an ant\\". On July 23, 2020, at the Xbox Games Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment revealed a brand new RPG game called Avowed was currently in development for Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X. Philosophy Obsidian built its reputation making sequels in well-established franchises including Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Neverwinter Nights, Fallout, and Dungeon Siege. Urquhart has stated that the company is fine with developing sequels, as they are often fun to make since the studio can \\"get to go play in someone else's world\\" and further explore and expand upon the original games' ideas. The studio also believes that such licensed projects are easier to develop. Obsidian considered the making of these sequels as stepping stones towards eventually making original games based on their own intellectual property. The studio's focus did later shift towards developing their own games, which allowed Obsidian to maximize their creative freedom and escape the constraints imposed by publishers. The studio has used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter as an indicator to see whether a game or genre is popular or not. As an independent company prior to their 2018 acquisition by Microsoft, Obsidian believed that they must act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team were willing to try out projects that are smaller and are in different genres. The decision to develop Armored Warfare was one result of this strategy. A dungeon crawler game based on the story of the company's five founders was made. The game was housed in an arcade cabinet inside Obsidian.

He has spent more than 30 years researching orcas (or Killer whales) in British Columbia, and is credited with increasing public awareness of whaling, through his involvement with Greenpeace. Photo of Dr. Paul Spong taken on OrcaLab in September 2003 Early life Paul Spong was born in Whakatane, near the north-east coast of New Zealand, in 1939. He studied law at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. In 1963 Spong enrolled in the Brain Research Institute (BRI) at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) for post-graduate studies in psychology. His work at the BRI included analysis of human brain wave patterns and tracking information pathways. Spong's doctoral thesis was on sensory stimulation, perception, and human consciousness. Transfer to Vancouver In 1967 Dr. Murray Newman, of the Vancouver Aquarium, asked Dr. Patrick McGeer, head of the Neurological Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), to find a \\"whale scientist\\" to assist him at the aquarium. Dr. Spong was selected as the candidate to work at the Vancouver Aquarium with orca whales (Orcinus orca) after a successful interview and a recommendation from the head of the lab at UCLA. Dr. Spong arrived in Vancouver, with his wife Linda, in April 1967. This was two months after Skana, the orca that Paul would be working with, had been bought by the Vancouver Aquarium from The Pacific Northwest Boat Show. Whale Research Dr. Spong started his research on Skana by testing her eyesight. This was done by rewarding the whale (with a herring filet) every time she distinguished between one or two horizontal lines. However, Paul soon noticed that Skana's enthusiasm had waned and her success rate fell to 0%. After some research, Dr. Spong contemplated whether the whale was trying to communicate with him and giving him wrong answers on purpose. This was the first breakthrough Paul had in understanding orcas' complex communication system. In April 1968, a second orca, Hyak was captured and brought to the Aquarium. Hyak 2 was kept in a separate pool from Skana. Dr. Spong thought that Hyak was in deep depression after being captured, and thus tried to stimulate the orca by conductive experiments. Paul learned the importance of acoustics for orcas through these experiments. He noticed that when the two whales swam together in the same pool they vocalized and sang together. Thus Dr. Spong started experimenting with music and sound and noticed Hyak's recovery from lethargy. Dr. Paul Spong believed that his frequent interactions with the whales allowed him to communicate with them. He established this after an event involving Skana. The whale would brush her teeth against the Dr. Spong's feet repeatedly until he no longer pulled them out of the water. Dr. Spong considered this a conscious deconditioning of his fear by the whale. After this event Dr. Spong started freely swimming with the whales on a regular basis. =1968 Lecture= In a 1968, Dr. Paul Spong delivered a lecture at the University of British Columbia, describing his experience with the two whales at the Vancouver Aquarium. He described the whales as \\"highly intelligent, social animals\\" and advised that they should not be kept in captivity. He proposed transferring the whales to a semi-wild environment (such as Pearl Harbor) in order to study them in their natural habitat. Dr. Spong also mentioned that humans could someday communicate with whales. His comments from this lecture were published in local newspapers and interviews with radio stations were scheduled. However, the Dr. Newman from the Aquarium did not appreciate the fact that Dr. Spong's recommendation on freeing the whales. This pushed him to suspend the research project Dr. Spong was working on. =1969 Address= In June 1969 Spong gave an uninvited address to the Western Psychological Association. In this he discussed his belief that taking drugs helped him tune in to the killer whales space and that this could help with orca-human communications. ‚ÄúThe whale‚Äôs the highest creature. Believe you me, baby, and I‚Äôll prove it to you one of these days, see? I won‚Äôt prove it, excuse me Skana, I won‚Äôt prove it, the whale will prove it. Let me tell you, as soon as I can get some liquid crystals in my hand, the whale will start talking to us, talking to us in English. In words that we can see, like the I Ching‚Ä¶\\"https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0071537 KWOOF Killer Whale (Orcinus Orca) Foundation, or KWOOF was the foundation that Dr. Paul Spong created with his $4000 separation package from the University. The purpose of the foundation was to stop whale captures in British Columbia, Canada. In December 1969 Spong travelled to Pender Harbour, where fishermen had captured 12 whales. Of the 12 whales, only one whale, Corky, survived in captivity for more than 45 years. Spong spent over four decades trying to free her. Maplewood Mudflats and Hanson Island In 1972 Dr. Paul Spong was living in a hippie commune in North Vancouver, called the \\"Maplewood Mudflats\\". He was interviewed about the community in a film made for the NFB (National Film Board of Canada), by Robert Fresco and Kris Paterson, called \\"Mudflats Living\\". https://www.nfb.ca/film/mudflats_living/ In the summer of 1972, Dr. Paul Spong moved to Hanson Island and established the OrcaLab. The lab is located 200 miles northwest of Vancouver in a quiet bay where orcas retreat to in the summer to feed and give birth. Hanson Island was an ideal place to study orcas in their natural habitat. At the laboratory, Dr. Spong started to catalogue and transcribed the modulations and songs sung by the whales in order to decipher them. Dr. Paul Spong set up an online viewing portal of the orcas over several summers starting in 2000. While future plans for this project are under review, but microphones are still available. It included 3 microphones or \\"hydrophones\\" and one roving video link. Viewer could log in and chat to fellow orca enthusiasts. He also helped set up a sister site in Japan to watch turtles. Both programs run under the Nature network banner. See also *Whaling *Greenpeace *Orca References Weyler, R (2004). Greenpeace. Vancouver, BC: Raincoast Books.

It is approximately 4.5 miles (7 km) in length. Among some Berkeley residents, especially University of California students, Telegraph refers mainly to a four-block section just south of the university, from Bancroft Way (which borders the campus) to Dwight Way. As a center of campus and community life, this section of Telegraph Avenue is home to many restaurants, bookstores, and clothing shops, along with street vendors occupying its wide sidewalks. Here Telegraph Avenue attracts a diverse audience of visitors, including college students, tourists, artists, street punks, eccentrics, and the homeless. Origins Looking north on Telegraph from Downtown around the turn of the century. Telegraph Avenue originated from several separately named thoroughfares. In 1859, a telegraph line was constructed between Oakland and Martinez by the Alta Telegraph Company, and the existing roads which ran alongside it were then renamed \\"Telegraph Road\\". The segment of the Telegraph Road which ran from downtown Oakland out to the Peralta estate in Temescal was first known as the \\"Peralta Road\\". The segment which ran to and up Harwood's (now Claremont) Canyon was first known as \\"Harwood's Road\\", named for William Harwood William Harwood, Oakland LocalWiki, an early Oakland politician who leased grazing land in the canyon. The Telegraph Road followed the route of present-day Telegraph Avenue from Downtown Oakland to Temescal, then ran along what is now the route of Claremont Avenue up to the summit of the Berkeley Hills where it became Fish Ranch Road. In Berkeley, the trustees of the private College of California (the predecessor of the University of California) laid out a residential subdivision south of their new campus in order to finance its construction. The streets were named alphabetically from east to west; the third street was named \\"Choate Street\\", after Rufus Choate. Oakland subsequently extended a road to connect with Berkeley's Choate, but named it \\"Humboldt Avenue\\". Oakland's first horsecar line was built in 1869 and ran along Telegraph Road to 36th Street. It was extended to Temescal a year later, then to the university campus via Humboldt and Choate after the university relocated from Oakland in 1873. A business district grew up along Choate Street. The horsecar line was eventually replaced by a steam dummy line, and later by an electric streetcar line. This transportation corridor stimulated the development of neighborhoods along its route, as well as an amusement park, Idora Park, between 56th and 58th Streets. When the segment of the Telegraph Road leading up to Harwood's Canyon was renamed \\"Claremont\\" to suit the interests of a developer of the district (see Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California), the cities of Berkeley and Oakland opted to change Humboldt and Choate to Telegraph since Oakland's portion of the thoroughfare was already aligned with what remained of the old Telegraph Road between the new Claremont and downtown Oakland. The Town Trustees of Berkeley made the change by ordinance on October 10, 1892.Oakland Evening Tribune, Oct.11, 1892 The last segment of the old Telegraph Road, the portion that ran up the canyon to the summit of the Berkeley Hills, was renamed Claremont Road by the Oakland City Council on February 14, 1913, acting on a petition by the owners of the Claremont Hotel.San Francisco Call, February 15, 1913, p.22 Early-mid 20th century Fox Theatre is located on the southern end of Telegraph Avenue, in Downtown Oakland. In 1910, Sather Gate was built at the northern end of Telegraph Avenue. The university built Sproul Hall on Telegraph in the 1940s. In the 1950s the campus expanded south to Bancroft Way; Telegraph Avenue was shortened by 1¬Ω blocks and buildings were demolished to make room for Sproul Plaza and several other new buildings including the new student union building. The Berkeley end of Telegraph Avenue, along with Sproul Plaza, has been the site of numerous protests and riots beginning in the 1960s. In 1969, Telegraph was the site of massive confrontation between police and demonstrators during the conflict over People's Park. Alameda County Sheriff's deputies killed one man (James Rector) and permanently blinded another (Alan Blanchard) when they fired buckshot loaded shotguns at people sitting on the roof above Telegraph Ave. At one point, protesters were chased down Telegraph as far as Willard Junior High School (now Willard Middle School) at Derby Street, with Sheriff's deputies firing teargas canisters onto the school grounds. The 1960s also saw the construction of the Grove Shafter Freeway, which parallels Telegraph Avenue half a block west, between Downtown Oakland and 56th Street. The freeway created a wall between Telegraph Avenue and present day Martin Luther King Jr. Way (formerly Grove Street), and sliced the Temescal District in half. Post-Vietnam War era The events of the 1960s and 1970s had made Telegraph, as well as Berkeley, a symbol of the counterculture of the 1960s. Over the next couple of decades the Berkeley end of Telegraph became home to increasing numbers of homeless people and panhandlers, and by the 1990s had become a destination point for runaways from around the United States. The numbers of panhandlers have decreased since a series of police sweeps in the late 1990s. University students remain the largest daily population on Telegraph, which still serves as the anchor of food, culture and student life on the south side of campus. More recently, a Korean business district has emerged just south of Temescal along Telegraph Ave. Attempts to change the name of the area to Koreatown have led to controversy, as most residents of the surrounding neighborhoods do not identify as Korean or Korean-American. A large Ethiopian and Eritrean population has also resulted in a string of Ethiopian restaurants, cafes and social clubs, stretching along Telegraph from about 30th Street in Oakland all the way into Berkeley. As a result of heavy foot traffic and the narrow width of the street, the area near the Berkeley campus is designated as a one-way street by the city, and there have been talks of completely eliminating car access, a topic still hotly debated in the city council. A proposal by AC Transit to build a Bus rapid transit line on Telegraph has stirred up controversy, especially on the northern end where it might result in the elimination of parking and/or car access.

Life and career Simon Dubnow was born Shimon Meyerovich Dubnow (–®–∏–º–æ–Ω –ú–µ–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –î—É–±–Ω–æ–≤) to a large poor family in the Belarusian town of Mstsislaw (Mahilyow Voblast). A native Yiddish speaker, he received a traditional Jewish education in a heder and a yeshiva, where Hebrew was regularly spoken. Later Dubnow entered into a kazyonnoe yevreyskoe uchilishche (state Jewish school) where he learned Russian. In the midst of his education, the May Laws eliminated these Jewish institutions, and Dubnow was unable to graduate; Dubnow persevered, independently pursuing his interests in history, philosophy, and linguistics. He was particularly fascinated by Heinrich Graetz and the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement. In 1880 Dubnow used forged documents to move to St Petersburg, officially off-limits to Jews. Jews were generally restricted to small towns in the Pale of Settlement, unless they had been discharged from the military, were employed as doctors or dentists, or could prove they were 'cantonists', university graduates or merchants belonging to the 1st guild. Here he married Ida Friedlin.Koppel S. Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow: Historian and Political Philosopher\\" at 13-69, 11, in Simon Dubnow, Nationalism and History (Philadelphia 1958), edited by Pinson. In 1885 at Mstislavl, Belarus, their first child a daughter Sophia, was born. Soon after moving to St. Petersburg Dubnow's publications appeared in the press, including the leading Russian-Jewish magazine Voskhod. In 1890, the Jewish population was expelled from the capital city, and Dubnow too was forced to leave. He settled in Odessa and continued to publish studies of Jewish life and history, coming to be regarded as an authority in these areas. Throughout his active participation in the contemporary social and political life of the Russian Empire, Dubnow called for modernizing Jewish education, organizing Jewish self-defense against pogroms, and demanding equal rights for Russian Jews, including the right to vote. Living in Vilna, Lithuania, during the early months of 1905 Russian Revolution, he became active in organizing a Jewish political response to opportunities arising from the new civil rights which were being promised. In this effort he worked with a variety of Jewish opinion, e.g., those favouring diaspora autonomy, Zionism, socialism, and assimilation.Dubnow, \\"Jewish Rights between Red and Black\\" at 461-470, 462-464, in Lucy S. Davidowicz, editor, The Golden Tradition. Jewish Life and Thought in Eastern Europe (Boston: Beacon Press 1967).Cf., Ezra Mendelsohn, Zionism in Poland (Yale University 1981) at 32-33.Dubnow is the father-in-law of Henryk Ehrlich, a famous Bundist leader. In 1906 he was allowed back into St Petersburg, where he founded and directed the Jewish Literature and Historical-Ethnographic Society and edited the Jewish Encyclopedia. In the same year, he founded the Folkspartei (Jewish People's Party) with Israel Efrojkin, which successfully worked for the election of MPs and municipal councilors in interwar Lithuania and Poland. After 1917 Dubnow became a Professor of Jewish history at Petrograd University. He welcomed the first February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, regarding it, according to scholar Robert van Voren, as having \\"brought the long-anticipated liberation of the Jewish people\\", although he \\"felt uneasy about the increasing profile of Lenin\\".Voren, Robert van (2011). \\"Undigested Past: The Holocaust in Lithuania. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 40, note 128. . Dubnow did not consider such Bolsheviks as Trotsky (Bronstein) to be Jewish, stating: \\"They appear under Russian pseudonyms because they are ashamed of their Jewish origins (Trotsky, Zinoviev, others). But it would be better to say that their Jewish names are pseudonyms; they are not rooted in our people.\\"Quoted in van Voren (2011), p. 40.Dubnow, Speech given June 9, 1917, at St. Petersburg, redacted by his daughter Sophie Dubnow-Erlich, [biography of Dubnow (in Russian)] (New York 1950); Yiddish translation, Dos Lebn un shafn fun Shimen Dubnov (Mexico City 1952) at 212-213; passage from this Speech quoted by Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 26, in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958).Dubnow's three-volume History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (Philadelphia 1916-1920) does not cover either the February or the October Revolutions of 1917 in Russia. His narrative ceases on the eve of World War I. In 1922 Dubnow emigrated to Kaunas, Lithuania, and later to Berlin. His magnum opus was the ten-volume World History of the Jewish people, first published in German translation in 1925‚Äì1929. Of its significance, historian Koppel Pinson writes: > With this work Dubnow took over the mantle of Jewish national historian from > Graetz. Dubnow's Weltgeschichte may in truth be called the first secular and > purely scholarly synthesis of the entire course of Jewish history, free from > dogmatic and theological trappings, balanced in its evaluation of the > various epochs and regional groupings of Jewish historical development, > fully cognizant of social and economic currents and influences ...Pinson, > \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 30, in Simon Dubnow, Nationalism and History > (1958). During 1927 Dubnow initiated a search in Poland for pinkeysim (record books kept by Kehillot and other local Jewish groups) on behalf of the Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut (YIVO, Jewish Scientific Institute), while he was Chairman of its Historical Section. This spadework for the historian netted several hundred writings; one pinkes dated to 1601, that of the Kehillah of Opat√≥w.Lucjan Dobroszycki, \\"YIVO in Interwar Poland: Work in the Historical Sciences\\" at 494-518, 503-504, 512-513, in Gutman, Mendelsohn, Reinharz, Shmeruk, editors, The Jews of Poland between Two World Wars (Brandeis University 1989). Later YIVO's Historical Section published a volume in Yiddish devoted to Dubnow, edited by Elias Tcherikower et al., Simon Dubnov lekoved zayn finf um zibetsikstn yoyvl (Vilna 1937). Dobroszycki (1989) at 515 note. In August 1933, after Hitler came to power, Dubnow moved to Riga, Latvia. There his wife died, yet he continued his activities, also writing his autobiography Book of My Life. On the initiative of a Latvian Jewish refugee activist in Stockholm and with help from the local Jewish community in Sweden, Dubnow was granted a visa to Sweden in the summer of 1940 but for unknown reasons he never used it.Rudberg, Pontus, \\"‚ÄòA Record of Infamy‚Äô: the use and abuse of the image of the Swedish Jewish response to the Holocaust\\", Scandinavian Journal of History, Volume 36, Issue 5, Special Issue: The Histories and Memories of the Holocaust in Scandinavia (2011), p.546. Then in July 1941 Nazi troops occupied Riga. Dubnow was evicted, losing his entire library. With thousands of Jews, he was transferred to the Riga ghetto. According to the few remaining survivors, Dubnow repeated to ghetto inhabitants: Yidn, shraybt un farshraybt (, write and record\\"). He was among thousands of Jews to be rounded up there for the Rumbula massacre. Too sick to travel to the forest, he was murdered in the city on 8 December 1941. Several friends then buried Simon Dubnow in the old cemetery of the Riga ghetto.Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 34-39, in Simon Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958). Political ideals Dubnow was ambivalent toward Zionism, which he felt was an opiate for the spiritually feeble. Despite being sympathetic to the movement's ideas, he believed its ultimate goal, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine achieved with international support and substantial Jewish immigration, to be politically, socially, and economically impossible, calling it \\"a beautiful messianic dream\\".https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-1941-nazis-murder-a-historian- in-the-street-1.5470776 In 1898, he projected that by the year 2000, there would only be about 500,000 Jews living in Palestine.Dunbov, Shimon: Public Letters on Ancient and Modern Judaism (1897‚Äì1907), Sixth Letter (March 1898) Dubnow rejected assimilation. He believed that the future survival of the Jews as a nation depended on their spiritual and cultural strength, where they resided dispersed in the diaspora. Dubnow writes: \\"Jewish history [inspires] the conviction that Jewry at all times, even in the period of political independence, was pre-eminently a spiritual nation.\\"Dubnow, Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history in Voskhod (1893), reprinted by Pinson in his Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958) at 253-324, 322.\\"The most distinguishing characteristic of Jewish nationalism for Dubnow is its spiritual quality.\\" Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 43, in Dubnow (1958). His formulated ideology became known as Jewish Autonomism,Dubnow, \\"Letters on old and new Judaism\\" published over a decade in the journal Voskhod (St. Petersburg 1897-1906), collected in book form (St. Petersburg 1907, Tel Aviv 1937), and reprinted in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958) at 73-241, especially his Fourth Letter: \\"Autonomism, the Basis of the National Program\\" at 131-142 (originally in Voskhod of December 1901).Israel Friedlaender, Dubnow's Theory of Jewish Nationalism (New York: The Maccabaean Publishing Co. 1905). once widely popular in eastern Europe, being adopted in its various derivations by Jewish political parties such as the Bund and his Folkspartei. Autonomism involved a form of self-rule in the Jewish diaspora, which Dubnow called \\"the Jewish world-nation\\". The Treaty of Versailles (1919) adopted a version of it in the minority provisions of treaties signed with new east European states. Yet in early 20th-century Europe, many political currents began to trend against polities that accommodated a multiethnic pluralism, as grim monolithic nationalism or ideology emerged as centralizing principles. After the Holocaust, and the founding of Israel, for a while discussion of Autonomism seemed absent from Jewish politics.Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 35 (diaspora), 42 (Treaty of Versailles), in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958). Regional history Dubnow's political thought perhaps can better be understood in light of historical Jewish communal life in Eastern Europe. It flourished during the early period of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795), when it surpassed the Ottoman Empire and western Europe as a center of Judaism.Dubnow, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (1916-1920), at I: 66-67.\\"The Jews of Poland had once been the elect of world Jewry.\\" Howard Morley Sachar, The Course of Modern Jewish History (Cleveland: World Pub. Co. 1958; reprint by Dell) at 31. Regarding Jewish autonomy, at 25-27 (west Europe) and 31-33 (east Europe), Sachar describes it, commenting that the great superficial differences between Jewish self-government in east and west belies a fundamental similarity. Dubnow here describes the autonomous social-economic and religious organization developed by the Jewish people under the Commonwealth government: > Constituting an historical nationality, with an inner life of its own, the > Jews were segregated by the Government as a separate estate, an independent > social body. ... They formed an entirely independent class of citizens, and > as such were in need of independent agencies of self-government and > jurisdiction. The Jewish community constituted not only a national and > cultural, but also a civil, entity. It formed a Jewish city within a > Christian city, with its separate forms of life, its own religious, > administrative, judicial, and charitable institutions. The Government of a > country with sharply divided estates could not but legalize the autonomy of > the Jewish Kahal.\\" The Jews also did not speak Polish, but rather Yiddish, > an Hebraicized German. \\"The sphere of the Kahal's activity was very large.\\" > \\"The capstone of this Kahal organization were the so-called Waads, the > conferences or assemblies of rabbis and Kahal leaders. [They became] the > highest court of appeal.\\" Their activity \\"passed, by gradual expansion, from > the judicial sphere into that of administration and legislation.Dubnow, > History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (Philadelphia 1916) at I: 103, 107, > 108-109, 109. Each provincial council or Waad (Hebrew vaad: committee) eventually joined with others to form a central governing body which began to meet regularly. Its name became \\"ultimately fixed as the Council of the Four Lands (Waad Arba Aratzoth).\\" These four lands were: Wielkopolska (Posen), Malopolska (Cracow and Lubin), Ruthenia (Lvov (Lemberg)), and Volhynia (Ostrog and Kremenetz); the fifth land Lithuania (Brest and Grodno) withdrew to form its own high Waad. The 'Council of the Four Lands' consisted of the six \\"leading rabbis of Poland\\" and a delegate from the principal Kahalem selected by their elders, in all about thirty members. \\"As a rule, the Council assembled in Lublin in early spring, between Purim and Passover, and in Yaroslav (Galicia) at the end of summer, before high holidays.\\" Dubnow, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (Philadelphia 1916-1920) at I: 110. > The Council or Wadd Arba Aratzoth \\"reminded one of the Sanhedrin, which in > ancient days assembled... in the temple.

Poland and Its Jews in the Early Modern Period (Yale University 1991) provides another perspective on the tardy and then incomplete modernization, interrupted and defeated by the 18th-century partitions of Poland. Eventually, the Commonwealth was removed from the map of Europe by successive partitions perpetrated by her three neighboring states, each an autocracy, the third and extinguishing partition coming in 1795.E.g., cf., Brian M. Downing, The Military Revolution and Political Change. Origins of democracy and autocracy in early modern Europe (Princeton University 1992), chapter six \\"Poland\\" at 140-156. Following the Congress of Vienna (1815) the Russian Empire uneasily governed most of these Polish and Lithuanian lands, including the large Jewish populations long dwelling there.Several revolts against Russian Imperial rule (1830-1831, and 1863-1865) arose in Poland, which were supported by many Jews. Dubnow, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (1918) at II: 105-110, 178-183. \\"The whole year 1861 stood, at least as far as the Polish capital was concerned, under the sign of Polish-Jewish 'brotherhood'.\\" \\"On the day of the Jewish New Year prayers were offered up in the synagogues for the success of the Polish cause.\\" Dubnow (1918) at II: 180.Polish revolutionary slogans employed symbolism from the Bible. \\"References to the Maccabees, the very core of this mythology, can be found everywhere.\\" 1860s Warsaw was compared to ancient Jerusalem. Machabej \\"gradually come to denote a Jew sympathetic to or actually involved in the Polish insurrectionary movement.\\" Magdalena Opalski and Israel Bartel, Poles and Jews. A failed brotherhood (Brandeis University 1992) at 51-54, 123-127. After the second Polish revolt was crushed, however, more Jews began to see their future with the occupying powers. Not all were assimilators, e.g., the autonomist Simon Dubnow, who spoke Russian and maneuvered to enter St. Petersburg (see here \\"Life and career\\"), yet speaking Russian was state coerced as well as perhaps chosen. Also, Yiddish is a German idiom, with reference to the other two occupying powers: Imperial Germany, and the Austrian Empire.Subsequently in stateless Poland, the growing nationalist right (opposed by the multinational socialists) began to see the large, non- Polish-speaking Jewish communities as opponents of Polish independence. Czeslaw Milosz presents a nuanced and personally informed portrait of the Jews of interwar Poland in his Native Realm. A search for self-definition (New York: Doubleday 1968, reprint University of California 1981) at 91-107. The Russian Empire first restricted Jewish residence to their pre-existing Pale of Settlement, and later began to further confine Jewish liberties and curtail their self-government.Dubnow, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (1916-1920) at I: 314-318 (Pale of Settlement, 1786); at II: 59-66 (abolition of Jewish autonomy, 1844), at II: 190-198 (against Jewish separatism, 1871); at III: 7-39 (residence & business, propaganda). Under a 'liberal' Tzar (e.g., Alexander I or II), Russification might seem attractive to many Jews, who were managing to move from the Pale of Settlement into Russia proper. Cf., Dubnow (1916-1920) at II: 176-177, 206-212 (Russification). But there followed in the 1880s Russian 'judaeophobia' and pogroms. Jewish emigration out of Eastern Europe began to increase. Dubnow (1916-1920) at II: 324-335 (alternative Jewish strategies, e.g., relocation to America, Western Europe, also Palestine). Not only were their rights attacked, but several of the Tzars allowed the imperial government to propagate and to instigate a series of murderous pogroms against the Jewish people of the realm.Dubnow, History of the Jews in Russia and Poland (1916-1920), at II: 243-283, and at III: 113-120 (Russian pogroms: 1880s, 1905). Notorious for these events were the Tzars Alexander III and Nichols II. In the cruel atmosphere of this ongoing political crisis in the region, Simon Dubnow wrote his celebrated histories and played an active r√¥le in Jewish affairs. He supported the broad movements for change in the Russian Empire; yet in the main he sought to restore and to continue the Jewish autonomy, described above at its zenith under the old Commonwealth, into the 20th century.Dubnow, \\"Letters on old and new Judaism\\" published in the journal Voskhod (St. Petersburg 1897-1906), collected in book form (St. Petersburg 1907, Tel Aviv 1937), and reprinted in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958) at 73-241, specifically his \\"Fourth Letter: Autonomism, the Basis of the National Program\\" at 131-142. During his life various large and tragic events were to impact the region, which can be considered as the most horrific of places during the first half of the 20th century. Among these events, ranging from a few positive to news headlines to crimes against humanity, were: the pogroms, the co-opted 1905 Russian Revolution, the founding of the Folkspartei, the First World War, the February Revolution followed by the October Bolshevik,The Communist regime put an end to Jewish autonomy. \\"In the Soviet Russia all religious groups were treated with equal contempt and derision. ... As an entire generation of young people grew up in this rabidly atheistic environment, Jewish religious loyalties faded rapidly.\\" Although the Soviets instituted more than a dozen ethnic \\"republics\\" with figurative autonomy, a like request by the Jewish Bund was at first \\"rejected out of hand\\". Later the Jewish Autonomous Region, admittedly a failed project, was set up north of Manchuria in the Soviet far east, at Birobijan whose resources were useful but whose \\"climate was exceptionally harsh.\\" Few Jews ever relocated there.

The catastrophe of the genocide claimed the life of the aged historian.Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 39, in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958). National values Spiritual values were highly esteemed by Dubnow, who viewed the Jewish people as leaders in their advancement. In his Weltgeschichte he discusses the ancient rivalry between Sadducee and Pharisee, as a contest between the ideal of a political nation versus a spiritual nation. He favored the latter, and mounted a critique of the warlike policies of Alexander Jannaeus (r. 103-76 BCE), a king of the Jewish Hasmonean dynasty (167-63 BCE), which was founded by the Maccabees: > This was not the kind of state dreamed of by their predecessors, the > hasidim, when the independence of Judea was attained and when the star of > the Hasmoneans first began to gleam. Had Judea battled against the Syrian > yoke, sacrificed for a quarter of a century its material goods and the blood > of its best sons, only in order to become, after attaining independence, a > 'despotism' or warrior state after the fashion of its pagan neighbors? The > Pharisees believed that the Jewish nation was created for something better; > that in its political life it was not to strive for the ideal of brute force > but rather for the lofty ideal of inner social and spiritual > progress.Dubnow, Weltgeschichte des J√ºdischen Volkes (Berlin: J√ºdischer > Verlag 1925-1929) at II: 157; cf., 123-124, 143-147; as cited and quoted by > Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 44, in Dubnow, Nationalism and History > (1958). Not only is there the issue of inner purpose and drive of the communal life of a nation, but also of the ethics of nationalism, relations between nations. Dubnow writes: \\"There is absolutely no doubt that Jewish nationalism in its very essence has nothing in common with any tendency toward violence.\\" Because of the diaspora experience, \\"as a Jew, I utter the word 'national' with pride and conviction, because I know my people... is not able to aspire anywhere to primacy and dominance. My nationalism can be only a pure form....\\" The prophets \\"called Israel a 'light to the nations' [and taught] the spiritual mission of the people of Israel... to bring other peoples, that is, all 'mankind,' to spiritual perfection.\\" Thus, the nation inspired by Judaism, \\"the descendants of the Prophets,\\" will promote and inspire the social ethics of humanity, and will come to harmonize with its realization: \\"the equal worth of all nations in the family of mankind.\\" The \\"Jewish national idea, which can never become aggressive and warlike\\" will raise aloft its flag, which symbolizes the joining of the prophetic vision of \\"truth and justice with the noble dream of the unity of mankind.\\"Dubnow, \\"Letters on old and new Judaism\\" published in the journal Voskhod (St. Petersburg 1897-1906), collected in book form (1907, 1937), and reprinted in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958) at 73-241, 44, and \\"Third Letter\\" at 116-130, 126, 127-128, 130. Jewish History Earlier in a long and well-regarded essay, Dubnow wrote about the \\"two halves\\" of Jewish history. The first \\"seems to be but slightly different from the history of other nations.\\" But if we \\"pierce to its depths\\" we find a spiritual people. \\"The national development is based upon an all-pervasive religious tradition... embracing a luminous theory of life and an explicit code of morality and social converse.\\" Their history reveals that the Jewish people \\"has been called to guide the other nations toward sublime moral and religious principles, and to officiate for them, the laity as it were, in the capacity of priests.\\" \\"The Prophets were the real and appointed executors of the holy command enjoining the 'conversion' of all Jews into 'a kingdom of priests and a holy nation'.\\" After the close of the Tanakh era in Israel, this first half of their history, the \\"strength and fertility\\" of the Jews as a spiritual nation \\"reached a culminating point\\".Dubnow, \\"Chto takoye evreyskaya historiya? Opyt filozofskoy charakteristiki\\" in Voskhod (St. Petersburg 1893), translated as Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history (1903), reprinted in Nationalism and History (1958) at 253-324, 260-261, 262.Dubnow later distanced himself from the non-sociological approach of his essay Jewish History. Koppel S. Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow: Historian and political philosopher\\" at 13-69, 68, in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958). Yet then \\"the providence of history\\" changed everything and scattered them \\"to all ends of the earth\\". \\"State, territory, army, the external attributes of national power\\" became a \\"superfluous luxury\\" for the Jews, a hardy and persevering people. Already in the Biblical times, their \\"character had been sufficiently tempered\\", they had learned how to \\"bear the bitterest of hardships\\" and were \\"equipped with an inexhaustible store of energy\\", thus they could survive, \\"live for centuries, yea, for thousands of years\\" under challenging conditions in ethnic enclaves mostly in Southwest Asia and later throughout Europe, during their post-Biblical \\"second half\\".Dubnow, \\"Chto takoye evreyskaya historiya? Opyt filozofskoy charakteristiki\\" in Voskhod (St. Petersburg 1893), translated as Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history (1903), reprinted in Nationalism and History (1958) at 253-324, 262. \\"Uprooted from its political soil, national life displayed itself [in the] intellectual fields exclusively. 'To think and to suffer' became the watchword of the Jewish people.\\" They brought their \\"extraordinary mental energy\\" to the task. \\"The spiritual discipline of the school came to mean for the Jew what military discipline is for other nations.\\" Dubnow notes that the Jewish people without an army live as if in a future world where nations no longer rise up against each other in war. Hence, for the Jews, their history has become \\"spiritual strivings\\" and cultural contributions. \\"If the inner life and social and intellectual development of a people form the kernel of history, and politics and occasional wars are but its husk, then certainly the history of the Jewish Diaspora is all kernel.\\"Dubnow, Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history (1893, 1903), reprinted in Nationalism and History (1958) at 253-324, 262-263. \\"In spite of the noteworthy features that raise Jewish history above the level of the ordinary and assign it a peculiar place, it is nevertheless not isolated, not severed from the history of mankind.\\" These \\"pilgrim people scattered in all the countries\\" are \\"most intimately interwoven with world- affairs\\". On the negative, when \\"the powers of darkness and fanaticism held sway\\" the Jews were subject to \\"persecutions, infringement of the liberty of conscience, inquisitions, violence of every sort.\\" Yet when \\"enlightenment and humanity\\" prevailed in the neighborhood, the Jews were to benefit by \\"the intellectual and cultural stimulus proceeding from the peoples with whom they entered into close relations.\\" Across the centuries in our history, such tides seem to ebb and flow.Dubnow, Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history (1893, 1903), reprinted in Nationalism and History (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America 1958) at 253-324, \\"II. The Content of Jewish History\\" at 260-265, 263-264. > On its side, Jewry made its personality felt among the nations by its > independent, intellectual activity, its theory of life, its literature, by > the very fact indeed, of its ideal staunchness and tenacity, its peculiar > historical physiognomy.

Dubnow states that the Jewish people in the first Biblical half of its history \\"finally attained to so high a degree of spiritual perfection and fertility that the creation of a new religious theory of life, which eventually gained universal supremacy, neither exhausted its resources nor ended its activity.\\" In its second \\"lackland\\" half the Jews were \\"a people accepting misery and hardship with stoic calm, combining the characteristics of the thinker with those of the sufferer, and eking out existence under conditions which no other nation has found adequate.\\" For this people \\"the epithet 'peculiar' has been conceded\\" and Jewish history \\"presents a phenomenon of undeniable uniqueness.\\"Dubnow, Jewish History. An essay in the philosophy of history (1893, 1903), reprinted in Nationalism and History (1958) at 253-324, 264-265. Philosophy In a short article, Dubnow presented a memorable portrait of historical depth, and its presence in contemporary life: > Every generation in Israel carries within itself the remnants of worlds > created and destroyed during the course of the previous history of the > Jewish people. The generation, in turn, builds and destroys worlds in its > form and image, but in the long run continues to weave the thread that binds > all the links of the nation into the chain of generations. ... Thus each > generation in Israel is more the product of history than it is its creator. > ... We, the people of Israel living today, continue the long thread that > stretches from the days of Hammurabi and Abraham to the modern period. ... > We see further that during the course of thousands of years the nations of > the world have borrowed from our spiritual storehouse and added to their own > without depleting the source. ... The Jewish people goes its own way, > attracting and repelling, beating out for itself a unique path among the > routes of the nations of the world... .Dubnow, \\"The Survival of the Jewish > People\\" in Heatid IV: 111-120 (1912, 1922), reprinted in Simon Dubnow, > Nationalism and History (1958) at 325-335, 326-327. Another writer of Jewish history although from a younger generation, Lucy Dawidowicz, summarizes the personal evolution and resulting weltanschauung of Simon Dubnow: > Early in his intellectual life, Dubnow turned to history and in the study > and writing of Jewish history he found the surrogate for Judaism, the modern > means by which he could identify as a Jew, which would give him inner > satisfaction and keep him part of the Jewish community. ... Even in his > pioneering studies of hasidism, Dubnow's rationalism shines through. ... Yet > despite his rationalism, despite his modernity, Dubnow believed in a mystic > force--the Jewish will to live.Lucy Dawidowicz, The Golden Tradition. Jewish > Life and Thought in Eastern Europe (Boston: Beason Press 1967) at 232. Dubnow himself adumbrates his own philosophical and religious understanding: \\"I am agnostic in religion and in philosophy.... I myself have lost faith in personal immortality, yet history teaches me that there is a collective immortality and that the Jewish people can be considered as relatively eternal for its history coincides with the full span of world history.\\"Dubnow, Dos buch fun mayn lebn [autobiography] (1934-1935), translated excerpt \\"Under the Sign of Historicism\\" at 232-242, 232-233, in Dawidowicz, editor, The Golden Tradition (Boston 1967). \\"Dubnow with his profound historical approach, weaves into his automomist theories all the strands of Jewish past, present and future.\\"Pinson, \\"Simon Dubnow\\" at 13-69, 45, in Dubnow, Nationalism and History (1958). Dubnow Institute in Leipzig In honor of Simon Dubnow and as a center for undertaking research on Jewish culture, in 1995, the Leibniz Institute for Jewish History and Culture ‚Äì Simon Dubnow was founded.http://www.dubnow.de/1/institute/overview/ It is an interdisciplinary institute for the research of Jewish lived experience in Central and Eastern Europe from the Early Modern Period to the present day. The Dubnow Institute is dedicated to the secular tradition of its namesake. At the Dubnow Institute, Jewish history is always regarded in the context of its non-Jewish environs and as a seismograph of general historical developments. The institute is contributing courses to several degree programs of Leipzig University and offers a Ph.D. research scheme.

His mother was the daughter of a whaling captain based in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and his family returned there for their summer vacations.The boy who chose the brush over baseball Smithsonian, June 1992, pp. 58-70 He began drawing well before kindergarten, and his elementary‚Äìschool teachers often asked him to decorate their classroom blackboards at Thanksgiving and Christmas. At age 10, George took to athletics, and trained to be a baseball and basketball player. He became good enough at both sports to play semipro ball for years afterward. During his senior year, a baseball scout from the Indianapolis team made him an offer. He declined, opting to enroll at The Ohio State University (1901‚Äì1904). There he played for the baseball and basketball teams, and provided illustrations for the Makio, the school's student yearbook. He was encouraged to become a professional baseball player,. and he worked as a commercial illustrator while a student and continued to accept magazine assignments throughout his life. Despite these opportunities in athletics and commercial art, Bellows desired success as a painter.His pragmatic father strongly urged Bellows to abandon his painting dreams and become a builder, as his father was. He left Ohio State in 1904, just before he was to graduate, and moved to New York City to study art. Bellows was soon a student of Robert Henri, who at the time was teaching at the New York School of Art. While studying there, Bellows became associated with Henri's \\"The Eight\\" and the Ashcan School, a group of artists who advocated painting contemporary American society in all its forms. By 1906, Bellows and fellow art student Edward Keefe had set up a studio at 1947 Broadway.. New York Cliff Dwellers, (1913), Los Angeles County Museum of Art Bellows first achieved widespread notice in 1908, when he and other pupils of Henri organized an exhibition of mostly urban studies. While many critics considered these to be crudely painted, others found them welcomely audacious, a step beyond the work of his teacher. Bellows taught at the Art Students League of New York in 1909, although he was more interested in pursuing a career as a painter. His fame grew as he contributed to other nationally recognized juried shows. Bellows' urban New York scenes depicted the crudity and chaos of working-class people and neighborhoods, and satirized the upper classes. From 1907 through 1915, he executed a series of paintings depicting New York City under snowfall. In these paintings Bellows developed his strong sense of light and visual texture,George Bellows: Love of Winter Retrieved July 12, 2007 exhibiting a stark contrast between the blue and white expanses of snow and the rough and grimy surfaces of city structures, and creating an aesthetically ironic image of the equally rough and grimy men struggling to clear away the nuisance of the pure snow. However, Bellows' series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches were arguably his signature contribution to art history. They are characterized by dark atmospheres, through which the bright, roughly lain brushstrokes of the human figures vividly strike with a strong sense of motion and direction. Social and political themes A 1920 portrait painting of Waldo Peirce by George Bellows, on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco Blessed are the Peacemakers (1917), The Masses Growing prestige as a painter brought changes in his life and work. Though he continued his earlier themes, Bellows also began to receive portrait commissions, as well as social invitations, from New York's wealthy elite. Additionally, he followed Henri's lead and began to summer in Maine, painting seascapes on Monhegan and Matinicus islands. At the same time, the always socially conscious Bellows also associated with a group of radical artists and activists called \\"the Lyrical Left\\", who tended towards anarchism in their extreme advocacy of individual rights. He taught at the first Modern School in New York City (as did his mentor, Henri), and served on the editorial board of the socialist journal, The Masses, to which he contributed many drawings and prints beginning in 1911. However, he was often at odds with other contributors due to his belief that artistic freedom should trump any ideological editorial policy. Bellows also notably dissented from this circle in his very public support of U.S. intervention in World War I. In 1918, he created a series of lithographs and paintings that graphically depicted atrocities which the Allies said had been committed by Germany during its invasion of Belgium. Notable among these was The Germans Arrive, which gruesomely illustrated a German soldier restraining a Belgian teen whose hands had just been severed. However, his work was also highly critical of the domestic censorship and persecution of antiwar dissenters conducted by the U.S. government under the Espionage Act. He was also criticized for some of the liberties he took in capturing scenes of war. The artist Joseph Pennell argued that because Bellows had not witnessed the events he painted firsthand, he had no right to paint them. Bellows responded that he had not been aware that Leonardo da Vinci \\"had a ticket to paint the Last Supper\\". Later life Dempsey and Firpo (1924), Whitney Museum of American Art As Bellows' later oils focused more on domestic life, with his wife and daughters as beloved subjects, the paintings also displayed an increasingly programmatic and theoretical approach to color and design, a marked departure from the fluid muscularity of the early work. One of Bellows' central subjects was the sea, and he painted over 250 scenes of it during the course of his career. The Fisherman (1917), a significant late canvas focusing on the topic that he made while visiting Carmel, California, is in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. In addition to painting, Bellows made significant contributions to lithography, helping to expand the use of the medium as a fine art in the U.S. He installed a lithography press in his studio in 1916, and between 1921 and 1924 he collaborated with master printer Bolton Brown on more than a hundred images. The Amon Carter Museum of American Art holds one of the largest collections of Bellows' lithographs, a set of 220 prints acquired from the artist's estate in 1985. There are also large collections of his lithographs at the Boston Public Library and the Cleveland Museum of Art. Bellows also illustrated numerous books in his later career, including several by H.G. Wells. Bellows taught at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1919. In 1920, he began to spend nearly half of each year in Woodstock, New York, where he built a home for his family.Leaving the Country: George Bellows at Woodstock Retrieved July 12, 2007 He died on January 8, 1925 in New York City, of peritonitis, after failing to tend to a ruptured appendix. He was survived by his wife, Emma Story Bellows (married 1910), and daughters Anne and Jean. Bellows is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Paintings and prints by George Bellows are in the collections of many major and regional American art museums, including the Art Museum of Southeast Texas in Beaumont, Texas, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, and the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and The Hyde Collection, in Glens Falls, New York. The Columbus Museum of Art in Bellows' hometown also has a sizeable collection of both his portraits and New York street scenes. The White House acquired his 1919 painting Three Children in 2007, and it is now displayed in the Green Room. The Whitney Museum of American Art published a biography of Bellows by fellow artist George William Eggers as part of the American Artists Series. In 1992 it mounted an extensive exhibition of his art (the exhibition was a joint venture with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art). The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds his papers. Posthumous sales and exhibitions Men of the Docks, 1912 His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. In December 1999, Polo Crowd, a 1910 painting, sold for U.S.$27.5 million to billionaire Bill Gates. In November 2008, Bellows' Men of the Docks, a 1912 painting of the Brooklyn docks spanning the East River and depicting the Manhattan skyline in the background, was to be auctioned at Christie's in New York. It was expected to set the record for an American painting sold at auction with an estimate of $25‚Äì35 million. The painting's sale however was a source of controversy at Randolph College because it was the first masterpiece purchased for the Maier Museum of Art by students and locals who raised $2,500 to purchase it in 1920. Due to a series of lawsuits and the deflated art market, the painting remained unsold until 2014 when it became the first major American painting to be purchased by the British National Gallery in London. In 2001, Thomas French Fine Art became the exclusive agent of the George Bellows Family Trust. Randolph College was asked by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to lend Men of the Docks, for inclusion in a 2012 exhibition. A major Bellows retrospective was held at the Royal Academy in London in 2013. Men of the Docks is now in the National Gallery in London.

Photograph (1890) Wasp waist is a women's fashion silhouette, produced by a style of corset and girdle, that has experienced various periods of popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its primary feature is the abrupt transition from a natural- width rib cage to an exceedingly small waist, with the hips curving out below. It takes its name from its similarity to a wasp's segmented body. The sharply cinched waistline also exaggerates the hips and bust.  History  In the 19th century, while average corseted waist measurements varied between , wasp waist measurements of were uncommon and were not considered attractive. Ladies' magazines told of the side effects of tight lacing, proclaiming that \\"if a lady binds and girds herself in, until she be only twenty-three inches, and, in some cases, until she be only twenty-one inches, it must be done at the expense of comfort, health, and happiness.\\" Fashions instead created the illusion of a small waist, using proportion, stripe placement, and color. Retouching photographs was also method to give an illusion to having a wasp waist. Extreme tight lacing () was a fad during the late 1870s/'80s, ending in around 1887.  Health effects  Among the multitude of medical problems women suffered to achieve these drastic measurements were deformed ribs, weakened abdominal muscles, deformed and dislocated internal organs, and respiratory ailments.

Brighton Beach is bounded by Coney Island proper at Ocean Parkway to the west, Manhattan Beach at Corbin Place to the east, Sheepshead Bay at the Belt Parkway to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south along the beach and boardwalk. It is known for its high population of Russian- speaking immigrants, and as a summer destination for New York City residents due to its beaches along the Atlantic Ocean and its proximity to the amusement parks in Coney Island. Brighton Beach is part of Brooklyn Community District 13, and its primary ZIP Code is 11235. It is patrolled by the 60th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Brighton Beach is represented by the New York City Council's 48th District.Current City Council Districts for Kings County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History =Early development= Brighton Beach is included in an area from Sheepshead Bay to Sea Gate that was purchased from the Native Americans in 1645 for a gun, a blanket and a kettle. Brighton Beach was located on sandy terrain, and before development in the 1860s, had mostly farms. The area was part of the \\"Middle Division\\" of the town of Gravesend, which was the sole English settlement out of the original six towns in Kings County. By the mid-18th century, thirty-nine lots in the division had been distributed to the descendants of English colonists. In 1868, William A. Engeman built a resort in the area. The resort was given the name \\"Brighton Beach\\" in 1878 by Henry C. Murphy and a group of businessmen, who chose to name as an allusion to the English resort town of Brighton. With the help of Gravesend's surveyor William Stillwell, Engeman acquired all 39 lots for the relatively low cost of $20,000. This hotel, with rooms for up to 5,000 people nightly and meals for up to 20,000 people daily, was close to the then-rundown western Coney Island, so it was mostly the upper middle class that went to this hotel. The , double- decker Brighton Beach Bathing Pavilion was also built nearby and opened in 1878, with the capacity for 1,200 bathers. \\"Hotel Brighton\\", also known as the \\"Brighton Beach Hotel\\", was situated on the beach at what is now the foot of Coney Island Avenue. The Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway, the predecessor to the New York City Subway's present-day Brighton Line, opened on July 2, 1878, and provided access to the hotel. Adjacent to the hotel, Engeman built the Brighton Beach Race Course for thoroughbred horse racing. In December 1887, an extremely high tide washed over the area, creating a new, temporary connection between Sheepshead Bay and the ocean. Wrote the Brooklyn Daily Eagle: \\"Unless [Engeman] is very lucky the next races on the Brighton Beach track will be conducted by the white crested horses of Neptune.\\" After that extremely high tide, and a decade of beach erosion, the Brighton Beach Hotel, by then owned by the Railway, faced the possibility of being \\"undermined and carried away.\\" A plan termed \\"highly ingenious and novel\\" was initiated by the superintendent of the Railway, J.L. Morrow, and its Secretary, E.L. Langford, to elevate and move the building as a whole, 495 feet further inland. This was accomplished by lifting the estimated 5000 ton, building, using 13 hydraulic jacks, after which 24 lines of railroad track - a mile and a half length in total - were laid under it, and 112 railroad \\"platform cars\\" (flat cars) pulled by six steam locomotives were used to pull the hotel away from the sea. This careful engineering (by B.C. Miller) made the move successful; it began on April 2, 1888, and continued for the next nine days, and was the largest building move of the 19th century. Anton Seidl and the Metropolitan Opera brought their popular interpretations of Wagner to the Brighton Beach Music Hall, where John Philip Sousa was in residence, and the New Brighton Theater was a hotspot for vaudeville. Visitors for tea at Reisenweber's Brighton Beach Casino would be served by Japanese waitresses in full costume. At an enormous private club, the Brighton Beach Baths, members could swim, access a private beach, and play handball, mah-jongg, and cards. The village, along with the rest of Gravesend, was annexed into the 31st Ward of the City of Brooklyn in 1894. =Early 20th century= In 1905, Brighton Beach Park opened its own area of amusements, calling it Brighton Pike. Brighton Pike offered a boardwalk, games, live entertainment (including the Miller Brothers‚Äô wild-west show: 101 Ranch), and a huge steel roller coaster. The park was shut down in 1919 after it burned down. The actual beach remained popular, though. Brighton Beach was re-developed as a fairly dense residential community with the final rebuilding of the Brighton Beach railway to rapid transit standards, becoming the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)'s Brighton Line, which opened (the line is now served by the New York City Subway's ). The subway line within the neighborhood is above ground on an elevated structure. The opening of the BMT Brighton Line had conflicting consequences: although it made Brighton Beach viable as a year-round community, it was now much more feasible for visitors to return home in the evening rather than spend the night. This led to the closure of the Brighton Beach Hotel in 1924. The years just before and following the Great Depression brought with them a neighborhood consisting mostly of first- and second- generation Jewish-Americans and, later, Holocaust concentration camp survivors. Of the estimated 55,000 Holocaust survivors living in New York City as of 2011, most live in Brighton Beach. To meet the bursting cultural demands, the New Brighton Theater converted itself to the States' first Yiddish theater in 1919. =Late 20th century and Soviet immigration= The \\"Millennium Theater\\", now the \\"Master Theater\\" and NetCost supermarket After World War II, the quality of life in Brighton Beach decreased significantly as the poverty rate and the ratio of older residents to younger residents increased. Due to the 1970s fiscal crisis, government workers and the middle class had moved to suburban areas, while people subdivided houses into single room occupancy residences for the poor, the elderly, and the mentally ill. Brighton Beach suffered from arson as much as it did from constant drug trades. During the summer, however, people from all around the city went to Brighton Beach's beach next to the Atlantic Ocean. In the mid-1970s, Brighton Beach became a popular place to settle for the Soviet immigrants, mostly Jews from Russia and Ukraine. So many ex-Soviets immigrated to Brighton Beach that the area became known as \\"Little Odessa\\" (after the Ukrainian city on the Black Sea). The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent significant changes in the social and economic circumstances of post-Soviet states led thousands of former Soviet citizens to immigrate to the United States. Many more of the Soviet and post-Soviet immigrants, who primarily spoke Russian, chose Brighton Beach as a place to settle. There was also an influx of immigrants from the Caucasus, mostly from countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan. A large number of Russian-speaking, immigrant-oriented firms, shops, restaurants, clubs, offices, banks, schools, and children's play centers opened in the area. The value of real estate in Brighton Beach started to rise again, even though drugs remained a social issue in the area through the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, a high-income ocean-front condominium complex, the \\"Oceana\\", was constructed. This address has become the destination of wealthy businessmen, entertainers, and senior officials from the former Soviet Union, and with their purchase of units at the Oceana, area housing prices have risen. Since the early 2010s, a significant number of Central Asian immigrants have also chosen Brighton Beach as a place to settle. Culture The proximity of Brighton Beach to the city's beaches, Brighton Beach Avenue runs parallel to the Coney Island beach and boardwalk, and that the neighborhood is directly served by a subway station makes it a popular summer weekend destination for New York City residents.

As apartment buildings started to be built in large numbers in the 1930s, many of those who moved into the neighborhood were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, often by way of the Lower East Side. They came from many countries, but also set the stage for a later wave of immigration from the Soviet Union that started in the 1970s, when Brighton Beach became known as \\"Little Odessa,\\" and \\"Little Russia\\". An annual festival, the Brighton Jubilee, celebrates the area's Russian-speaking heritage. The area has also been called \\"the land of pelmeni, matryoshkas, tracksuits, and...vodka\\" due to its large population of Soviet immigrants. In 2006, Alec Brook-Krasny was elected for the 46th District of the New York State Assembly, which includes Brighton Beach, becoming the country's first elected Soviet-born politician. =Demographics= Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Brighton Beach was 35,547, an increase of 303 (0.9%) from the 35,244 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

Accessed June 14, 2016. , Brighton Beach had a middle class, mostly Jewish, older population. 27% of Brighton Beach was of age 62 or older, while the national average of persons aged 62 or older was 13.9%. Since the 1990s, however, the neighborhood's ethnic demographics have been changing, with a large influx of mainly Muslim immigrants from Central Asia, such as Uzbeks. In subsequent years, the proportion of whites leveled out, the proportion of the black population decreased significantly, and the proportion of the Asian population increased to 14% as of 2014. , increasing numbers of Muslim Central Asians were moving into Brighton Beach, and based on the historic Soviet influence over these area, these immigrants also speak Russian. According to the United States Census report of 2010, Brighton Beach and Coney Island, combined, had 111,063 residents as of 2009. In that year, the median age of residents of Brooklyn was 34.2 and in New York City as a whole, it was 36.0 years, while in the combined Brighton Beach and Coney Island area it was 47.9 years. hence, the area is distinguished by a higher median age of its population. As DiNapoli and Bleiwas note in a city report, \\"the number of residents aged 65 years and older in [this area] rose by 4.1 percent, so that senior citizens accounted for more than one-quarter of the area‚Äôs population\\" at that date. According to the census, the population density in Brighton Beach, per se (52,109 people per square mile), was almost twice the average population density of New York City (27,012 people per square mile), though the average household size was 2.1 people, lower than the city average of 2.6 people. The average income of households in the area was $36,574, while the average income in the whole city was $55,217, according to the 2010 census. In Brighton Beach, 21% of the population lives below the poverty line, compared to only 15.4% citywide. Most of the population of Brighton Beach are immigrants. Less than a quarter (23.3%) of Brighton Beach residents were born in the United States, and nearly three-quarters were born abroad (72.9%). Because of this, English language proficiency in Brighton Beach is lower than the city average. More than a third (36.1%) of the population of Brighton Beach does not speak or understand English, while citywide, only one in fourteen people (7.2%) cannot speak or understand English. =Theater= The Brighton Ballet Theater, established in 1987, is one of the most famous Russian ballet schools in the United States.

Brighton Beach is considered a hot spot for the \\"Russian Mafia\\", though public perception has been that organized crime \\"has largely gone away.\\" In the 1970s, the most notorious leg of the mafia was the Potato Bag Gang, which served as a robbery gang for larger Russian crime syndicates in New York City. Marat Balagula was a crime boss from Brighton Beach who denies having any connection to the American Mafia or the Russian-speaking Mafia. The major Russian criminal element in Brighton Beach was the international Russian mafia group, known as vor v zakone or \\"vory,\\" and the first vory crime boss in Brighton Beach was Evsei Agron, who controlled the area's crime during the 1970s and 1980s until his death in 1985. After the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, many ethnic Russian criminals illegally entered the United States, coming especially to Brighton Beach. The infamous vor Vyacheslav Ivankov, who dominated the Brighton Beach underworld until his arrest in 1995, arrived during this wave.

He has represented both Canada and the United States at the World Championships and the Olympics. He was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.  College years  As a teenager, Wetzel was on the Canadian Junior Cycling team; he only began rowing in the fall of 1997 at the University of California, Berkeley. His success was immediate and extraordinary. His collegiate boat was undefeated and won the freshman 8 event at the 1998 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship (IRA). That summer Wetzel tried out for and made the Canadian National team in the pair event (2-) and finished seventh at the World Championships in Cologne, Germany. In 1999, 2001, and 2002 he again competed for Berkeley where he was coached by Steve Gladstone, this time in the varsity 8. All three years his boats won the IRA and were de facto national champions. In 1999 and 2001, his boats were undefeated. In 2002, his boat suffered a single loss to the University of Washington, but beat Washington on several other occasions including the IRA.  International competitions  Internationally, Wetzel competed for the United States team in 1999 (Coxed Four (4+) gold medal at the World Championships in St. Catharines) and in 2000 (7th place with the Quad (4x) at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney). In 1999, Wetzel was one of the principal subjects in the Outside Magazine article \\"Blood in the Water\\" on the difficulties and internal competition involved in trying to make a national team boat. After a two-year pause because of a shoulder injury caused by a mountaineering accident, in 2003 Wetzel returned to the international rowing scene and he joined Team Canada. Wetzel made the coxless four (4-) and he won a gold medal at the 2003 world championships in Milan, Italy. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Wetzel's boat finished second by inches to Great Britain.

They are located close to the town of Katoomba and are one of the Blue Mountains' best known sites, towering above the Jamison Valley. Their names are Meehni (922 m), Wimlah (918 m), and Gunnedoo (906 m). Formation A view of The Three Sisters rock formation alongside Mount Solitary. The lighter coloured orange/yellow sections indicate fresh rock, exposed by recent erosion. The Three Sisters at sunset The Three Sisters were formed by land erosion around 200 million years ago during the Triassic period when the sandstone of the Blue Mountains was eroded over time by wind, rain and rivers, causing the cliffs surrounding the Jamison Valley to be slowly broken up. When the Blue Mountains were covered in seawater, the ocean carried large amounts of sediment that gradually sunk to the floor in crosswise layers. These layers later created rock beds and shales. Around 200 million years ago, volcanoes erupted through the coal, sandstone and shale layers, forming the ridges and the shape of the Three Sisters.The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains Sightseeing Tours Australia Aboriginal legend The commonly told legend of the Three Sisters is that three sisters, Meehni, Wimlah and Gunnedoo, lived in the Jamison Valley as members of the Katoomba tribe. They fell in love with three men from the neighbouring Nepean tribe, but marriage was forbidden by tribal law. The brothers were not happy to accept this law and so decided to capture the three sisters. A major tribal battle ensued, and the sisters were turned to stone by an elder to protect them, but he was killed in the fighting and no one else could turn them back. This legend is commonly claimed to be an Indigenous Australian Dreamtime legend. However, the legend as is commonly told may be traced back to non-indigenous schoolgirl Patricia Stone, who gave the formations their \\"indigenous\\" names. The Aboriginal traditional owners, the Gundungurra, have a different legend that includes the Sisters rock formation. Giant Stairway From nearby Echo Point, a bushwalking trail leads to the Three Sisters and down to the valley floor via more than 800 well-maintained steel and stone steps called \\"the Giant Stairway\\". Then a 1.5-hour walk on The Federal Pass trail leads to the base of Katoomba Falls and the Katoomba Scenic Railway. Walkers who don't wish to climb back to the top can take the Scenic Railway back to the plateau for a fee.

It is one of Japan's most important large- scale cultural treasures. Its gardens are considered a masterpiece of Japanese gardening, and the buildings are regarded among the greatest achievements of Japanese architecture. The palace includes a shoin (\\"drawing room\\"), tea houses, and a strolling garden. The palace belonged to the princes of the Hachij≈ç-no-miya (ÂÖ´Êù°ÂÆÆ) family. The Imperial Household Agency administers it, and accepts visitors by appointment. History The Katsura district of Kyoto has long been favored for villas, and in the Heian period, Fujiwara no Michinaga had a villa there. The members of the Heian court found it an elegant location for viewing the moon. Prince Hachij≈ç Toshihito (Êô∫‰ªÅ; 1579-1629), the founder of the Katsura Imperial Villa, was born on 13 February 1579. He was the sixth son of Prince Sanehito, and a descendant of Emperor Ogimachi. In 1586, Toshihito was adopted by Hideyoshi Toyotomi, but they separated in 1589 when Hideyoshi had his own son. He presented Toshihito with land that yielded 3000 koku (15,000 bushels of rice) and allowed him to establish a new house in the imperial line, which became the Hachijo family line.[1] From an early age, Prince Toshihito was very familiar with the Tales of Genji, the Poems of Past and Present, and the works of Po Chu-i.[2] He was incredibly fond of these works, and was said to copy passages from the works for leisure. One such passage, from the Tales of Genji, had written: When Toshihito obtained land along the south bank of the Katsura River, the location of the novel the Tales of Genji, he set out to construct a villa modeled on passages from it. However, because he lacked wealth and resources, the first constructed villa was similar to ‚Äúa teahouse in the melon patch‚Äù [4]. However, after the marriage of Tokugawa Kazuko to Emperor Go-Mizunoo, which Toshihito had been active in creating, construction of the villa began. As Prince Toshihito became a greater figure in public life, more guests came to visit the Katsura Imperial Villa. By 1624, he had devoted more of his resources to the expansion of the villa, and it was recorded that hills had been formed and a pond had been dug in the middle of the garden. A priest that visited Katsura in 1624 wrote that it had the ‚Äúfinest view in Japan‚Äù. By 1631, the villa was called a ‚Äúpalace‚Äù[5]. Prince Toshihito died in 1629, when his son Toshitada (also called Noritada) was ten years old. Because he was only a child, Toshitada made little use of the garden, and the villa was allowed to deteriorate badly. However, he shared the same interests as his father, and visited the villa by 1641. After marrying the daughter of Lord Kaga, which greatly increased his income, he set out to renovate the imperial villa. With the section of the villa his father built known as the ‚ÄúOld Shoin‚Äù, Toshitada constructed the main house, as well as several teahouses, and these became part of the section called the ‚ÄúMiddle Shoin‚Äù[6]. After these renovations, the fame of the Katsura villa grew. In 1654, Toshitada adopted Prince Sachi, one of the ex-Emperor Go-Mizunoo‚Äôs many sons, and a few years afterwards, Go- Mizunoo decided to visit. It is said that the New Palace, also called the ‚ÄúImperial-Visit Palace‚Äù[7], was built to accommodate the ex-Emperor while he was visiting. Prince Toshitada died in 1662, and his heir died a few years later. After this, the fourth and fifth generation princes died in their teens, making additions to the Katsura Imperial Villa impossible. However, the seventh generation prince, Prince Yakahito, visited the villa numerous times and made repairs to it, leaving most of the layout in its original form. The Hachij≈ç-no-miya house changed its name to Tokiwai-no-miya (Â∏∏Á£ê‰∫ïÂÆÆ), Ky≈çgoku-no- miya (‰∫¨Ê•µÂÆÆ), and finally Katsura-no-miya (Ê°ÇÂÆÆ), before the line died out in 1881. The Imperial Household Ministry took control of the Katsura Detached Palace in 1883, and since World War II, the Imperial Household Agency has been in control.  Connections to traditional Japanese and Buddhist ideas  The Katsura Imperial Villa is a good example of the essence of Japanese traditional design. The Villa combines principles usually used in early Shinto shrines and merges it with the esthetics and philosophy of Zen Buddhism.Michael Fazio and Marian Moffett and Lawrence Wodehouse, Buildings across Time: An Introduction to World Architecture (Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 2009) 94-103. Katsura Rikyu Villa incorporates many traditional Japanese ideas. One example of Katsura's use of traditional ideas is its use of raised floors with tatami mats covering them. Tatami are mats approximately 3 feet by 6 feet in length that are not only used as the floors of the villa, but are also used to define the dimensions of each individual room and the house as a whole. Sir Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method for the Student, Craftsman, and Amateur (London: B.T. Batsford, 1994) 634-651 ‚ÄúTatami,‚Äù JAANUS, accessed March 30, 2012.Fazio, Buildings across Time, 101. At Katsura, the mats are used to create the sprawling and pinwheel-like plan that it has today. The terraces and porches created by the arrangement of the tatami mats provide opportunities to view the landscape and link interior spaces with the outside world. The floors of each building of the site are also raised as well, which originally was derived from vernacular designs for granaries, as well as early imperial palaces. They serve the purpose of both keeping the floor dry while also giving hierarchy to the space. Another classic characteristic that the Katsura Imperial Villa utilizes is the use of screen walls (the sh≈çji and the fusuma). In traditional Japanese Architecture, the shoji and the fusuma are used to separate the spaces created by the tatami mat into the various rooms of the house. The shoji is the generic term for the white and translucent screen door or wall that is reinforced with wooden lattice and can either be stationary, hanging, or sliding. ‚ÄúShouji‚Äù JAANUS accessed March 30, 2012Kazuo Nishi and Kazuo Hozumi, What is Japanese Architecture, (New York: Kodansha USA, 1996) 74 The fusuma is a subcategory of the shoji and it is the white or painted moving screen partition used on the interior of the house. ‚ÄúFusuma‚Äù JAANUS accessed March 30, 2012Nishi What is Japanese Architecture, 74 By moving the fusuma, when in conjunction with a stationary shoji, the resident is able to create new rooms within the architecture. For instance by moving one fusuma wall, one could transform two rooms into one large room and a small storage closet. In the Katsura Imperial Villa, the fusuma allows the rooms to change and open up to the natural world with exterior decks becoming extensions of the interior and framing views of the landscape. An example of this type of transformation is the moon viewing platform connected to the Old Shoin.Fazio, Buildings across Time, 99. Besides these characteristics, there are many traditional Japanese ideas that are used in the Katsura Imperial Villa, like the decorative alcove (tokonoma), built-in desk (tsukeshoin) and square posts. Teahouse At the Katsura Imperial Villa, the teahouses are perfect examples of how Zen Buddhism has affected the architecture and landscape. The tea ceremony, performed at the pavilions, is a very important part of Japanese society because it is a spiritual ritual symbolizing detached perfection in the Zen tradition, and it has greatly affected the architecture and landscape around it to enhance the experience one receives while in the ceremony. The teahouses were constructed expressly to incorporate the qualities of concord, reverence, pureness, and isolation that are the very essence of the ritual. The five different teahouses are all separated from the main building and are isolated from everything except for the nature around them; to reach each building, one must take a path that doesn‚Äôt reveal the view of the pavilion until the very last moment. The teahouses also use rustic elements such as bark covered wooden supports or irregular shaped wooden pieces as extensions of the natural world, for the tea ceremony aims at fusing the spiritual and the natural. Additionally, the teahouses account for many experiences while you are inside of it. The windows and apertures in the pavilion are at eye level when sitting so that one can feel more in tune and closer to nature and so that one can ‚Äúadmire the cherry blossoms in the spring and the crimson leaves in the autumn‚Ä¶ while preparing tea and enjoying exquisite cuisine‚Äù.Nishi What is Japanese Architecture, 79 Finally, the interior of the buildings were planned so that the designers imparted their reverence for the materials and spatial harmony, which are intended to promote reflection that will achieve inward simplicity and tranquillity of the mind.Fazio, Buildings Across Time, 101-103  Buildings and gardens  The Old Shoin, Middle Shoin and New Palace are each in the shoin style, with irimoya kokerabuki (ÊüøËë∫) roofs. The Old Shoin was constructed by Prince Toshihito. It is composed of rooms with nine, ten, and fifteen tatami, and has ceilings supported by wooden slats. On the southern side, there is a room with a veranda attached, which shows elements of the sukiya style. A bamboo platform, created for moon- viewing, extends beyond the veranda.[8] The Old Shoin was most likely built to accommodate a large number of people at informal gatherings. Compared to the Old Shoin, The Middle Shoin appears stiff. It is arranged in an L-shape, and at one end there is a tokonoma, and to its right there is a chigaidana (a staggered group of ornamental shelves). The walls of the tokonoma and chigaidana are decorated with ink paintings of landscapes, as well as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.[9] The Middle Shoin is said to have been built as the prince‚Äôs living quarters, which is evidenced by a bath and toilet. A veranda ran along two sides of the Middle Shoin and faced the garden. The New Palace features a large hipped-and-gabled roof, as well as a veranda enclosed by wooden shutters. The design of the New Palace is more structured than the Old and Middle Shoin, and is composed of an eight-mat room, a six-mat room, and a three-mat area that are arranged into an L-shape. There is a coffered ceiling, and an alcove containing a large window. The Katsura Shelves are especially noteworthy, and are located in the corner opposite of the entrance. Other rooms in the New Palace are the imperial bedchamber, the consort‚Äôs dressing room, a pantry, a wardrobe, a bath, a toilet, and a washroom.[10] Within the garden, there were originally five teahouses.[1] Although currently there are only four standing, the pavilions were implemented for practicing the Japanese art of the tea ceremony. The small structures were built to incorporate qualities that are at the essence of the tea ritual, such as harmony, silence, and reverence. [2] Additionally, the tea rituals tried to incorporate the spiritual and natural world, therefore, the teahouses used natural elements such as wooden supports with bark, continuing the atmosphere of the garden.[3] The pond The Geppa-r≈ç, also known as the ‚ÄúMoon-wave Tower,‚Äù has a view overlooking the pond. Although it is only fifteen by twenty-four feet in area, it is known for its spatial effect due to its exposed ceiling and roof structure. The roof is supported by four slanting beams that rise from the corners of the building with a ridge pole that is further supported by a curving king pole resting on a tie beam. This creates a unique spatial effect as the roof has a decorated underside that exposes the beams and rafters. [4] Across the pond from the Geppa-r≈ç is the Sh≈çkin-tei, also known as the ‚ÄúPine-Lute Pavilion.‚Äù The pavilions contrast one another, as the Geppa-r≈ç is active and situated on higher ground looking down onto the pond whereas the Sh≈çkin-tei is less active and elevated not far above the water level. The site in which the Sh≈çkin-tei is located was initially the first point in which the visitors could view the pond. But through the development of the land, such as extending the pond to the southwest and reconstruction of the main house, the entire site developed into a tour garden rather than a view garden. It intends for one to walk through the space rather than just view it from the interior of a house. The most prominent and unusual aspect of the teahouse is the unfloored loggia. It is facing the pond with an open pantry in the center for tea ceremonies. This was very unusual to have in view of the tea drinkers and not in the back of the house. Additionally, three oak logs in their natural states support the extended eaves of the loggia. With the thatched roof, the roughness of the pavilion resembles a rustic kiosk. A prominent feature in the interior is the heavy papering with a blue-and-white checkered pattern on walls of the tokonoma and sliding doors between the First and Second rooms. [5] Inside the Sh≈çkin-tei Leaving the Sh≈çkin-tei, one follows up a ‚Äúmountain path‚Äù to the Sh≈çka-tei, which roughly means ‚ÄúFlower-Appreciation Pavilion,‚Äù as cherry trees surround it. It is a small teahouse that is situated at the highest point in the garden. It has the clearest view of the main house through the trees. The posts are barked logs, as the floor plan is made of only four tatami mats in a U-shaped pattern. Emphasizing the atmosphere of a mountain house, strips of dark blue and white cloth are hung on the front of the pavilion. As the path away from the Sh≈çka-tei splits, the right leads to the front lawn of the main house, while the left leads to the Onrin-d≈ç, a small ancestral shrine. Following this shrine, there is an open area leading to the Sh≈çiken. [6] It is also referred to as the ‚ÄúLaughing Thoughts Pavilion.‚Äù The upper wall of the entry room has uncharacteristic row of six round windows, giving the approaching visitor a feeling that the building is laughing at them. This particular pavilion is different from the others not in appearance but in the arrangement of rooms. From a processing of a narrow toilet to wider rooms to the kitchen and servant quarters, the pavilion appears to operate as an independent house. A small room with a shoin window overlooks the farmlands outside the grounds, connecting the viewer psychologically with the real world rather than the garden. [7]  Influence outside Japan  The buildings, and to a lesser extent the gardens, of Katsura became influential to a number of well known modernist architects in the 20th century via a book produced by Bruno Taut. Le Corbusier and especially Walter Gropius, who visited in 1953, found inspiration in the minimal and orthogonal design. Subsequently, Katsura become well known to a second wave of architects from Australia such as Philip Cox, Peter Muller and Neville Gruzman who visited in the late 1950s and 1960s. It was also a big influence of Irish architect Ronnie Tallon who described his many visits to the temple as \\"like going to Lourdes for a cure\\".https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-houses-that-ronnie- built-1.685415 Gallery Image:Main_gate_katsura.jpgMain gate of the Katsura Imperial Villa File:Katsura Rikyu (3263841671).jpgKatsura Imperial Villa File:Katsura Rikyu (3264689052).jpgView of the garden File:Katsura Rikyu (3263820577).jpgGarden path Image:Katsurarikyu01.jpgGarden of Katsura Imperial Villa File:Katsura Rikyu (3263844665).jpgPond Image:Shokin- tei_seen_from_the_Geppa-ro.jpgView of the Sh≈çkin-tei from the Geppa-r≈ç Pavilion Image:Shoin.jpgMain houses (shoin) File:Katsura Rikyu (3264681278).jpgGarden Image:Geppa-ro.jpgView of the pond from the Geppa-r≈ç Pavilion File:Katsura Rikyu (3264753682).jpgExterior wall made of bamboo Image:Geppa-ro_poteau.jpgAsymmetrical column of support at the Geppa-r≈ç Pavilion  See also  *Ma (negative space) *Japanese Art *Katsura-no-miya References Bibliography There are numerous works on Katsura; the following are the main ones recommended as sources for further information: * Walter Gropius, Kenzo Tange, Yasuhiro Ishimoto (photographs), Katsura: Tradition and Creation in Japanese Architecture (Yale University Press, New Haven, Zokeisha Publications, Tokyo, 1960) is a good (although early) work. * Teiji Itoh, Takeji Iwamiya, Imperial Gardens of Japan (Weatherill, New York, 1970) covers the gardens in great detail *Scott, Ted, \\"Imperial Gardens of Japan\\" (Amazon.com, 2008) describes and illustrates four imperial gardens in Kyoto. * Teiji Itoh, Tadashi Yokoyama, Eiji Musha, Makato Suzuki, and Masao Arai and Taisuke Ogawa (photographs), Katsura: A Quintessential Representative of the Sukiya Style of Architecture ( Shinkenchiku-Sha, Tokyo, 1983) gives much internal detail, learned during the refurbishment of 1976-1982. * Akira Naito, Takeshi Nishikawa (photographs), (translated Charles S.

Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182. Graphic art further includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs. History Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as hieroglyphics. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others. During the Middle Ages, scribes manually copied each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to insert drawings and decorations. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.McGuire-Lyle, Erin. Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999. Johannes Gutenberg invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the printing press in 1450, the first outside Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether. Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on typeface. Due to the development of larger fonts during the Industrial Revolution, posters became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services. The invention and popularity of film and television changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage. The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal computer was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known. The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way- finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.  Graphic design software  Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net. Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs to create the most appealing, up to date designs. Graphic art software includes applications such as: *Adobe Dreamweaver ‚Äì a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content *Adobe Illustrator ‚Äì a software application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics *Adobe InDesign ‚Äì desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation *Adobe Photoshop ‚Äì a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality *CorelDRAW ‚Äì similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool *PhotoImpact ‚Äì a digital photograph editor *QuarkXPress ‚Äì similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool =Free software= *Paint.net ‚Äì photograph editing capabilities with many plugins to expand use *GIMP ‚Äì similar to paint.net and Photoshop *Inkscape ‚Äì similar to Illustrator Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.  Careers  One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the World Wide Web, the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and logos to market the products or services of the client's business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance to successfully create a web page. The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

His main lines include Valentino, Valentino Garavani, Valentino Roma, and R.E.D. Valentino. Career =Early life and 1950s Paris years= Valentino was born in Voghera, in the province of Pavia, Lombardy, Italy. His mother named him after screen idol Rudolph Valentino. He became interested in fashion while in primary school in his native Voghera, Lombardy, northern Italy, when he apprenticed under his aunt Rosa and local designer Ernestina Salvadeo, an aunt of noted artist Aldo Giorgini. Valentino then moved to Paris to pursue this interest with the help of his mother Teresa de Biaggi and his father Mauro Garavani. There he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. His first choice for an apprenticeship, in Paris, was Jacques Fath, then Balenciaga. He found an apprenticeship with Jean Dess√®s where he helped Countess Jacqueline de Ribes sketch her dress ideas. He then joined Guy Laroche for two years. At Jean Dess√®s, Valentino sketched furiously, between helping with window dressing and greeting clients for the daily 2:30 pm private showings. Most of his early sketches were lost. However, at a Rome exhibition in 1991 a smattering of them went on display and then-current clients such as Marie- H√©l√®ne de Rothschild and Elizabeth Taylor marveled that the DNA of Valentino's style was already apparent in the layers of white pleats and animal prints.A wedding dress by Valentino After five years, Valentino left Jean Dess√®s over an incident about prolonging a vacation in Saint-Tropez that still makes him uncomfortable today. Rescued by his friend Guy Laroche, he joined his \\"tiny, tiny\\" fashion house. After discussions with his parents, he decided to return to Italy and set up in Rome in 1959,https://storage.googleapis.com/ferdinandi/images/20.jpg as pupil of Emilio Schuberth and then collaborated with Vincenzo Ferdinandi's atelier before opening his own fashion house. =Rome= Palazzo Gabrielli-Mignanelli, Valentino's Roman residence In 1960 Valentino left Paris and opened a fashion house in Rome on the posh Via Condotti with the backing of his father and an associate of his. More than an atelier, the premises resembled a real \\"maison de haute couture,\\" it being very much along the lines of what Valentino had seen in Paris. Everything was very grand and models flew in from Paris for his first show. Valentino became known for his red dresses, in the bright shade that became known in the fashion industry as \\"Valentino red.\\" On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Caf√© de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One of three children, Giammetti was in his second year of architecture school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also going there, so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino's business and life partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino's atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had spent so much money that his father's associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy. =Breakthrough in Florence (1962‚Äì67)= Valentino's international debut took place in 1962 in Florence, the Italian fashion capital of the time. At some point in 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy had seen Gloria Schiff, the twin sister of the Rome-based fashion editor of American Vogue and Valentino's friend Consuelo Crespi, wearing a two-piece ensemble in black organza at a gathering. It made such an impression that Kennedy contacted Ms. Schiff to learn the name of the ensemble's designer, which was Valentino. In September 1964, Valentino was to be in the United States to present a collection of his work at a charity ball at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Mrs. Kennedy wanted to view the collection but could not attend the event, so Valentino decided to send a model, sales representative and a selection of key pieces from his collection to Mrs. Kennedy's apartment on Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Kennedy ordered six of his haute couture dresses, all in black and white, and wore them during her year of mourning following President John F. Kennedy's assassination. From then on, she was a devoted client and would become a friend. Valentino would later design the white Valentino Gown worn by Kennedy at her wedding to Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis. In 1966 he moved his shows from Florence to Rome where two years later he produced an all-white collection that became famous for the \\"V\\" logo he designed. =1970s= A dress worn by Audrey Hepburn at The Proust Bal at Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res in 1971 Throughout the 1970s Valentino spent considerable time in New York City, where his presence was embraced by society personalities such as Vogue's editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland and the art icon Andy Warhol. =The Accademia Valentino= 1990 marked the opening of the Accademia Valentino, designed by architect Tommaso Ziffer, a cultural space located near Valentino's atelier in Rome, for the presentation of art exhibitions. The next year, encouraged by their friend Elizabeth Taylor, Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti created L.I.F.E., an association for the support of AIDS-related patients, which benefits from the activities of the Accademia Valentino. =From HdP group to Marzotto group= In 1998 Valentino and his partner Giancarlo Giammetti sold the company for approximately US$300 million to HdP, an Italian conglomerate controlled, in part, by the late Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat. In 2002, Valentino S.p.A., with revenues of more than $180 million, was sold by HdP to Marzotto Apparel, a Milan-based textile giant, for $210 million. Maison Valentino is controlled since 2012 by Mayhoola for Investments S.P.C., a holding company sustained by a group of private investors from Qatar. It is present in over 90 countries through 160 Valentino directly-operated boutiques and over 1300 points of sale. =Retirement= , Valentino's castle in Crespi√®res, near Paris On 4 September 2007, Valentino announced that he would retire fully in January 2008 from the world stage after his last haute couture show in Paris. He delivered his last women's ready-to-wear show in Paris on 4 October. His last haute couture show was presented in Paris at the Mus√©e Rodin on 23 January 2008. It was, however, somewhat marred by his criticism of fellow Italian design duo Dolce & Gabbana, and the death of Australian actor Heath Ledger although few allowed these things to detract from his final show, which received a standing ovation from the entire audience that included hundreds of notable names from all areas of show business. Many models returned to attend Valentino's last haute couture show; the audience included Eva Herzigov√°, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Nadja Auermann, Karol√≠na Kurkov√° and Karen Mulder. In 2012-2013 a major new exhibition opened at Somerset House in London celebrating the life and work of Valentino, showcasing over 130 exquisite haute couture designs.Somerset House In September 2007, Valentino decided to leave the Creative Direction of his brand. Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were first nominated Creative Directors of all accessories lines, and the following year, they were appointed Creative Directors of Valentino, guiding all collections, from Pr√™t-√†-Porter to Haute Couture. In June 2015 the Creative Directors were bestowed with the prestigious CFDA International Award, recognition that paid homage to the professional path and to the success of the Maison. On 7 July 2016 Maison Valentino nominated Pierpaolo Piccioli its sole Creative Director of the Maison. Movies Valentino's yacht moored in Porto Santo Stefano, Monte Argentario (Italy) In 2006 Valentino appeared in a cameo role, as himself, in the hit movie The Devil Wears Prada.

Produced and directed by Matt Tyrnauer, special correspondent for Vanity Fair magazine, the film follows Valentino and his inner circle throughout various events, including last year's anniversary show celebrating his 45-year career. During the movie's production from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage. \\"We were let in to the inner circle, but we had to stick it out for a long time, practically move in, to capture the truly great moments\\", says Tyrnauer. \\"Valentino is surrounded by a tight-knit family of friends and employees, but, eventually, their guard came down and they forgot there was a camera crew in the room.\\" The film had its North American premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on 18 March in New York City and selected cities.Tyrnauer, Matt, \\"My Fight with Valentino\\", thedailybeast.com, 7 December 2009, updated 14 July 2017.

The castle comprises 280-acre gardens designed by Wirtz International, a pigeonnier tower, a pavilion containing a shell grotto, a building housing the archives of Valentino Garavani Archives. The chateau stairway is flanked by stone dogs carved in the 17th century by the French artist Jacques Sarazin. Valentino stages always organizes a theme party at the castle during the fashion weeks in Paris. * Chalet Gifferhorn in Gstaad, Switzerland where he spends winter celebrations. The house has paintings of Arcimboldo and the famous sheep- shaped furniture by les Lalanne Valentino also spends half of his time in Giancarlo Giammetti's homes: * 18th-century Villa \\"La Vagnola\\" in Cetona, Tuscany which Giancarlo Giammetti purchased in 1986. Renowned Italian decorator Renzo Mongiardino created enchanted interiors inspired by the villa's classical gardens. For twenty-five years Giancarlo Giammetti and Valentino vacationed here to escape the pressures of Rome and their international jet set lifestyle. Portions of the property date back to the 16th-century but it was in 1750, on the occasion of his marriage to Maria Antonietta Vagnoli, that the nobleman Sallustio Terrosi started building the villa. The villa's decoration includes Empire pieces and Chinese wooden figurines which once adorned the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and Empire settee that belonged to Princess Mathilde, Napoleon's niece, 2,100 rare books that Giammetti miraculously returned to the villa, missing since the 1960s. The design of the spare all-white kitchen was given to one of Giammetti's friends, architect Tommaso Ziffer, a young decorator at the time. The \\"Sophia Loren\\" guest room was so named in honor of the room's inaugural guest, richly appointed in Old World style with a lacy ceiling designed by Mongiardino. Paolo Peyrone, a pupil of the English landscape designer Russell Page, assisted with the design of the landscaping around the house. The 18th-century stable, as it was photographed in the 1980s, became an orangery with an upstairs exercise room. The villa has a pool pavilion named \\"La Turkerie\\" standing in the middle of the garden was built by the Terrosi-Vagnoli family in 1837 in honor of a visiting pasha. * Penthouse on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris, decorated by Peter Marino with a collection of modern art including two Andy Warhol Lenin's, one red and one black, Rothko, Cy Twombly, Francis Bacon and George Dyer.

The apartment comprises a pair of Tang-dynasty horses, a gilt-bronze crocodile chair by les Lalanne, a sculpture by Anselm Kiefer. * Penthouse in Via Condotti, Rome Personal life In the film Valentino: The Last Emperor, Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti discuss how they met on 30 July 1960 in Via Veneto, the epicenter of Rome's Dolce Vita. They have been together ever since, for more than 50 years, although their love relationship ended in 1972. As told by Giancarlo in his private memoirs, in 1973 Valentino met nineteen- year-old Carlos Souza at the Hippopotamus club in Rio de Janeiro, dating him until Carlos married Brazilian socialite Charlene Shorto in 1983. Valentino and Giancarlo later became the godfathers of Charlene and Carlos' sons, Sean and Anthony. Carlos and Charlene worked as PR for the Maison Valentino even after their divorce in 1990, and have kept a close relationship ever since. As narrated in \\"Private\\" by Giancarlo Giammetti, Valentino in the early 1980s met his current boyfriend Bruce Hoeksema, who started as a model at Valentino to later become the vice president of the Maison. Giancarlo Giammetti said that he and Valentino together with Carlos, Charlene and Bruce form a real family. Part of this enlarged family called the \\"tribe\\" is also composed by Spanish Duchess Naty Abascal, French-Brazilian Princess Georgina Brandolini d'Adda and Valentino PR Daniela Giardina. Valentino's mother, Teresa, moved from Voghera to Rome to help with the business. Eventually he told both his parents that he was engaged to Italian actress Maril√π Tolo, the only woman he had ever truly loved and with whom he had wished to have children. Valentino and Giammetti's lifestyle has been considered flamboyant. John Fairchild, editor-at-large at Women's Wear Daily and W, told Vanity Fair, :Valentino and Giancarlo are the kings of high living. Every other designer looks and says, ‚ÄòHow do they live the way they do?‚Äô I don‚Äôt think they made the money that Valentino and Giancarlo did, because Giancarlo knows how to make money. If they did, they didn‚Äôt spend the money like Valentino. No other designer ever did. When the terrorism first started in Rome ‚Äì the period when the Red Brigades were kidnapping people ‚Äì Valentino was riding around in a bulletproof Mercedes. And do you know what color the Mercedes was? Red. My God, I thought, you must want to get blown up.Vanity Fair, August 2004. Valentino adores dogs to the point that he once named a second line of clothing after his late pug Oliver. Today Valentino owns six pugs: the mother, Molly; her sons, Milton and Monty; and her daughters, Margot, Maude and Maggie. When traveling on his 14-seat Challenger jet, three cars are needed to move Valentino and his entourage to the airport: one to move Valentino and Giammetti, another for the luggage and the staff, and a third to transport five of six Valentino's pugs as one of them, Maude, always travels with Valentino.

The head-and-body length is between . Wild banteng are typically larger and heavier than their domesticated counterparts, but are otherwise similar in appearance. The banteng shows extensive sexual dimorphism; adult bulls are generally dark brown to black, larger and more sturdily built than adult cows, which are thinner and usually pale brown or chestnut red. There is a big white patch on the rump. Horns are present on both sexes, and are typically long. Three subspecies are generally recognised. Banteng are active during the day as well as at night, though activity at night is more in areas frequented by humans. Herds comprise two to forty individuals, and generally a single bull. Herbivores, banteng feed on vegetation such as grasses, sedges, shoots, leaves, flowers and fruits. Banteng can survive without water for long during droughts, but drink regularly if possible, especially from standing water. Not much is known about the reproductive physiology of banteng, but it might be similar to that observed in taurine cattle. After a gestation of nearly 285 days (nine to ten months), a week longer than that typically observed in taurine cattle, a single calf is born. Banteng occur in a variety of habitats throughout their range, including open deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, lower montane forests, abandoned farms and grasslands. The largest populations of wild banteng occur in Cambodia, Java and possibly in Borneo (particularly Sabah) and Thailand. Domesticated banteng occur in Bali and many eastern Indonesian islands (such as Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba), Australia, Malaysia and New Guinea. Feral populations are found in East Kalimantan and the Northern Territory (Australia). Domesticated populations are primarily used for their highly demanded meat, and are used as draught animals to a lesser extent. The wild banteng is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and populations have decreased by more than 50% in the past few decades. Rampant poaching (for food, game, traditional medicine and horns), habitat loss and fragmentation and susceptibility to disease are major threats throughout the range. Banteng are legally protected in all countries in their range, and are largely restricted to protected areas (possibly barring Cambodia). The banteng is the second endangered species to be successfully cloned, and the first clone to survive beyond infancy. Taxonomy and phylogeny The banteng was first described by German naturalist Joseph Wilhelm Eduard d'Alton in 1823. \\"Banteng\\" derives from the Javanese name for the animal (ban·π≠√©ng). D'Alton based his description on two skulls from Java (Indonesia), a male and a female; while he described the male as a banteng, he referred to the female simply as a wild ox from Java. In 1956, Dirk Albert Hooijer of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (Leiden), where the skulls were first brought to from Java, noted that d'Alton used the name Bibos javanicus, or Bos (Bibos) javanicus if Bibos is considered a subgenus (as it is by some authors), to describe the male. Bos leucoprymnus was suggested as a synonym in 1830, but was pointed out to be a cross between a wild banteng and a domesticated individual; Hooijer wrote that he could not infer that this was the case from the original description, and, even if it were a cross, the name would not become invalid. Other names proposed for the banteng include Bos banteng and Bos bantinger. In a 1845 revision of d'Alton's description, the authors opined that both the specimens were wild oxen, referring to them as Bos sondaicus instead. They mistook the female for a young male, an error that continued in several publications by later authors. =Subspecies= A comparison between Indochinese (left) and Javan (right) banteng in facial features (Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1898) Three subspecies are generally recognised based on phenotypic differences, though some authors do not accept these, citing extensive breeding between the small remaining banteng populations and other sympatric cattle. The details of these subspecies are given below: * Javan banteng (B. j. javanicus) : Occurs in Java and possibly Bali. * Indochinese (or Burma) banteng (B. j. birmanicus) : Occurs on the Southeast Asian mainland. * Bornean banteng (B. j. lowi) : Occurs only in Borneo. A 2015 phylogenetic study obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of the Bornean banteng. It showed that the Bornean banteng is closer to the gaur (Bos gaurus) than it is to other banteng subspecies, having diverged from the gaur around . Moreover, the Bornean banteng is genetically distant from taurine cattle and zebu, indicating that the wild Bornean banteng could not have hybridised with them, and therefore might form a purebreeding line. These researchers suggested that the Bornean banteng could be an independent species. The phylogenetic relationships of the banteng subspecies with other closely related bovids, as obtained from this study, are shown in the following cladogram: Characteristics Banteng have a large white patch on the rump. The head of a banteng bull. The banteng is similar to taurine cattle, with head-and-body length between . Wild banteng are typically larger and heavier than their domesticated counterparts, but are otherwise similar in appearance. The mean shoulder height of wild Javan and Indochinese banteng is for cows and for bulls; Bornean banteng, the smallest subspecies, are shorter. Domesticated banteng cows reach at the shoulder, while the bulls are tall. In the wild cows weigh around , while bulls weigh around . Weights of domesticated individuals range from for females and from for males. The banteng shows extensive sexual dimorphism; adult bulls are generally dark brown to black, larger and more sturdily built than adult cows, that are thinner and usually pale brown or chestnut red. Females and juveniles additionally have a dark line running along their back. Some bulls may retain their brown colour, sometimes with white spots similar to those seen in deer. The coat of young bulls is reddish brown, and progressively attains the adult colouration starting from the front to the rear parts. Aged bulls may turn grey. The underparts are white to light brown. The face is lighter relative to the rest of the body, whitish or tawny grey at the forehead and around the eyes but darker near the black snout. There is a big white patch on the rump, poorly developed in the Indochinese banteng; the patch may serve as a guide for herds to stay together in the dark. The legs are white below the knees. The back is particularly elevated in bulls due to the unusual lengths of the thoracic vertebrae, giving the impression of a hump. Horns are typically long, and separated by thick skin at the base. Bulls have long, slender horns with sharp tips and a circular cross-section, and are smooth except for the wrinkled base. The horns of cows are short and tightly curved, pointing inward at the tips, while those of bulls arc upwards and slightly forward. The tail, measuring , ends in a black tuft. Ecology and behaviour Banteng are active during the day as well as at night, though activity at night is more in areas frequented by humans. They typically form herds of two to forty individuals consisting of a single bull. Older males form groups of two or three. Banteng are timid and reclusive, and tend to be highly alert, making approach difficult. Domestic individuals get stressed easily, and need to be handled with care. They rest and seek shelter for safety in dense forests. Banteng, particularly cows and calves, walk fast and manoeuvre easily through dense cover. The dhole (Asian wild dog) is a major predator. Banteng use their strong sense of smell to detect predators and as a means of communication within a herd. Their hearing is also highly developed. Vocalisations such as roars and bellows might be common during the breeding season; calves within seven months may produce soft eng sounds. High-pitched cries are used to raise alarm. =Diet and foraging= Banteng feed on vegetation such as grasses. Herbivores, banteng feed on vegetation such as grasses, sedges, shoots, leaves, flowers and fruits. They forage at night in open areas, taking breaks of two to three hours in between to ruminate and rest. They may move to forests at higher altitudes to forage during the rainy season. A study in Deramakot Forest Reserve (Sabah) showed the presence of several herbal seeds (such as Mimosa pudica and Paspalum conjugatum), bamboo (probably Dinochloa species) and tree bark in faecal samples. A study in West Java showed that banteng grazed mostly on the grasses Axonopus compressus, Cynodon dactylon, Ischaemum muticum and P. conjugatum, and the woody shrub Psychotria malayana. Banteng can survive without water for several days during droughts, but drink regularly if possible, especially from standing water. They frequent salt licks to satisfy their salt requirements; in the absence of licks they drink sea water instead. Banteng can drink highly saline water, and have been observed feeding on seaweed in northern Australia. =Reproduction and life cycle= A mother with her calf Not much is known about the reproductive physiology of banteng, but it might be similar to that observed in taurine cattle. Domestic banteng can become sexually mature at as early as 13 months of age, and breed after another three months. They conceive easily, with a conception rate of 80‚Äì90% recorded in northern Australia. Breeding has been observed throughout the year in captivity and in wild banteng in Myanmar, though wild individuals on Cobourg Peninsula mate mainly in October and November, and in Thailand mating peaks in May and June. After a gestation of nearly 285 days (nine to ten months), a week longer than that typically observed in taurine cattle, a single calf is born. Males weigh at birth, while females weigh . Young are suckled for as long as 16 months, though some cows may continue nursing till the birth of their next calf. A study of wild banteng on Cobourg Peninsula showed that males become sexually mature at three to four years and females at two to four years; males attain their full-grown size five to six years, while females grow completely by three to four years. Calf mortality is high in the first six months of life, and declines quickly thereafter with increasing body size. Banteng live for as long as 26 years. =Diseases and parasites= Banteng host several endoparasites such as liver flukes (that cause fasciolosis), intestinal worms (such as Strongyloides papillosus) and Paramphistomum species (that cause paramphistomiasis). Banteng are susceptible to bovine malignant catarrhal fever caused by ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2). Bali ziekte, a skin disease seen exclusively in banteng, begins with a dry eczema, worsening to necrosis and lacerated mucous membranes in the affected area. Other diseases blackleg and bovine viral diarrhoea, that have caused several deaths in captivity. Ectoparasites recorded in banteng include Amblyomma testudinarium, Haemaphysalis cornigera and Rhipicephalus species. Like water buffaloes, banteng have considerable immunity against ticks and tick-borne diseases. A study in northern Australia revealed a mutual symbiotic relationship between banteng and Torresian crows, that fed off ectoparasites (possibly ixodid ticks) from exposed parts of the banteng's body, mainly between the hind legs. This is especially notable because it is the first known relationship where a native bird shares such a relationship with a non-native wild mammal, and it took only 150 years to develop. Habitat and distribution Banteng occur in a variety of habitats throughout their range, including open deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, lower montane forests, abandoned farms and grasslands. They occur up to an elevation of above the sea level. The largest populations of wild banteng occur in Cambodia, Java and possibly in Borneo (particularly Sabah) and Thailand. They are also known to occur in Kalimantan (Borneo) and Myanmar; their presence is uncertain in Bali, Sarawak, China, Laos and Vietnam, and they are feared to have gone extinct in (if at all they were present in) Bangladesh, Brunei and India. Domesticated banteng occur in Bali and many eastern Indonesian islands (such as Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba), Australia, Malaysia and New Guinea. Feral populations are found in East Kalimantan, the Northern Territory in Australia, and possibly in Enggano and Sangihe in Indonesia. In the past banteng were widespread in the Southeast Asian mainland, including Yunnan Province (China) and extending to Borneo and Java through peninsular Malaysia; northeastern India and Bali were probably part of the range. Some researchers have excluded Bali from the historical range in the absence of fossil evidence, considering banteng to be an introduced species. However, in East Kalimantan cave art portraying a bovid, dating back to , has been suggested by some to be a depiction of banteng and led to speculation that the species might have reached up to the Wallace Line by that time. Dutch naturalist Andries Hoogerwerf notes that banteng possibly occurred since prehistoric times in Java, as indicated by remains dating back to discovered in the Sampung cave in Ponorogo Regency, Central Java. Interaction with humans Human association with banteng could date back several millennia, as suggested by animal remains and art discovered in caves. Hooijer opined that the earliest reference to the banteng was made by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in his 1800 account Outlines of the Globe, where he mentions a record of \\"wild oxen, of a reddish brown colour, with vast horns, and of a great size\\" in Java. However, Hoogerwerf pointed out that the banteng may have been mentioned in literature as old as the Nagarakretagama (1365 AD), an eulogy to the Javanese king Hayam Wuruk, which includes a description of a royal hunt of several animals including banteng. Moreover, records from the 18th century show that banteng were used as beasts of burden to carry several items such as coffee plants. =Domestication and uses= An Indonesian man feeding his banteng cows The banteng was domesticated in Java or the Southeast Asian mainland probably around 3,500 BC. The domesticated population consists of mainly the Bali cattle in Indonesia. As of 2016, Bali cattle comprise nearly 25% of the Indonesian cattle population (2.45 million out of the total 9.8 million). Domesticated banteng are docile and can tolerate hot, humid weather. Moreover, they can thrive and maintain their normal body weights even on poor quality fodder. They are primarily used for their highly demanded meat, that has been described as lean and soft. They are also used as draught animals to a limited extent; banteng are reportedly less efficient than zebu in dragging carts on roads, though they are suitable for agricultural work. However, banteng produce little milk; they lactate for only six to ten months, and the daily produce is just . They are also vulnerable to diseases such as bovine malignant catarrhal fever. In 1964, an outbreak of an unidentified disease, locally known as \\"jembrana\\", wiped out 10‚Äì60% of domesticated banteng populations in several areas in Bali; similar but less intense outbreaks have continued in the following years. The disease was later determined to be caused by a lentivirus. In Australia Domesticated banteng were first introduced to Australia in 1849 with the establishment of a British military outpost called Port Essington on Cobourg Peninsula. Twenty animals were taken to the western Arnhem Land, in present-day Northern Territory, as a source of meat. A year after the outpost's establishment, poor conditions including crop failure and tropical disease led to its abandonment. On the departure of British troops, the banteng were released from their grazing pastures and allowed to form a feral population. By the 1960s, researchers realised that a population of about 1,500 individuals had developed in the tropical forests of Cobourg Peninsula. As of 2007, around 8,000‚Äì10,000 feral banteng occur in Australia, mainly in Garig Gunak Barlu National Park (Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory). In a survey published in 1990, the population density in the forests was found to be around , close to that on their initial introduction 140 years ago. Australian banteng are considered a non-native vermin species, as they reportedly trample and destroy vegetation cover by overgrazing, and sometimes harm and kill people who may closely approach them. Moreover, banteng can transmit lethal diseases such as brucellosis to humans as well as other cattle. As such banteng are occasionally shot to bring down their numbers in Australia, but some have expressed concern about their conservation given the decline in banteng populations outside the country. In a study in the monsoon forests of Garig Gunak Barlu National Park, banteng were found to cause little damage by overgrazing, especially when compared with feral pigs in the region. Instead, grazing by banteng possibly minimises potential dry grass build-up, thus limiting encroachment of seasonal fires (hence postfire grassland) into monsoonal forest areas, and this may help with the dispersal and germination of seeds. A pair of Madura cattle Hybrids Domesticated banteng have been hybridised with other types of cattle. Madura cattle, found in Java, are fertile hybrids of banteng and zebu. A small breed, the bulls weigh between and the cows weigh . They are used in local traditional events such as bull racing and cow beauty contests. Other hybrids include Donggala, Galekan and Java Brebes (Jabres) cattle. While all hybrids with zebu are fertile, the male hybrids resulting from a cross with taurine cattle are sterile. A program to cross-breed domestic and wild banteng began in June 2011, resulting in five pregnancies. This was intended to help improve the quality and productivity of the domesticated breed. The wild bulls were transported from the Baluran National Park in Situbondo. = As symbol = Indonesian national emblem, with the banteng's head in top-left The banteng's head appears as one of the five emblems in the shield of Indonesia's coat-of-arms, \\"Garuda Pancasila\\". The emblem appears on the top-left of the shield, representing the fourth principle of the Indonesian five-point state philosophy (Pancasila), \\"Democracy that is Guided by the Inner Wisdom in the Unanimity Arising Out of Deliberations Amongst Representatives\\". A number of political parties in the country used the banteng's head as its symbol, including the Indonesian National Party (of President Sukarno), the Indonesian Democratic Party, and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (of Presidents Megawati Sukarnoputri and Joko Widodo). Certain elements in the Indonesian independent movements proposed it to be part of the Indonesian flag before the 1939 decided in favour of the plain red-and-white flag. =Threats and conservation= The wild banteng is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and populations have decreased by more than 50% in the past few decades. In 2008, the IUCN estimated the global banteng population at 5,000‚Äì8,000 individuals. Rampant poaching (for food, game, traditional medicine and horns), habitat loss and fragmentation and susceptibility to disease are major threats throughout the range. Most populations throughout the range are small and isolated. Banteng are legally protected in all countries in their range, and are largely restricted to protected areas (possibly barring Cambodia). A herd in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (Thailand) A survey in eastern Cambodia between 2009 and 2011 estimated the total population in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary at 1,980‚Äì5,170 individuals. Surveys in the following years (up to 2016) in these sanctuaries and adjacent areas (such as the Seima Protection Forest) give an approximate total of 4,600 individuals. Most other populations are small and fragmented, and many are on the decline. The only populations of more than 50 individuals in Thailand occur in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and possibly in the Kaeng Krachan National Park. A survey between 2000 and 2003 in Java identified four to five significant populations, with the highest numbers in the Ujung Kulon National Park (300‚Äì800 individuals), the Baluran National Park (206 individuals) and the Meru Betiri National Park (200 individuals). In East Java, a survey between 2011 and 2013 recorded rapid decline in populations in the Baluran National Park, though the numbers appeared to be stable in the Meru Betiri National Park; the researchers identified poaching, habitat disturbance, competition with other species, changes in vegetation cover and habitat loss as major threats. In Borneo numbers have fallen in areas like Kalimantan and Sabah, mainly due to poaching and human disturbance. The steepest decline (by more than 50%) took place between 1970 and 2000 due to deforestation and conversion of forests into plantations. Minor populations have been reported from areas such as Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, Deramakot Forest Reserve and Sipitang Forest Reserve during 2009‚Äì2015; individuals might still occur in the Belantikan Hulu region (Central Kalimantan), Kayan Mentarang National Park (North Kalimantan) and Kutai National Park (East Kalimantan). Threats to domesticated banteng Since a small founder event occurred in Australia with the introduction of only 20 previously domesticated banteng, a genetic bottleneck has inevitably occurred, causing all banteng presently in Australia to lack genetic diversity as a result of inbreeding. Genetic invariability can lead to inbreeding depression, resulting in harmful mutations and reduced immunity to diseases. This was proven by an analysis of 12 microsatellites, that recorded a high inbreeding coefficient of 0.58. Despite the limited genetic pool of this population, conservationists hope that populations at risk can be preserved. Some have proposed that a deliberate introduction of the endangered populations to the stable but non- native Australian variety would enable viable conservation, though how it would affect Northern Territory grazing ranges is unknown. Another possible threat is introgression with other cattle and similar bovids throughout their range where they coexist in the wild or due to crossbreeding programs, that may compromise the genetic integrity or purity of banteng populations. This, coupled with possibly low genetic diversity in small, isolated populations, is a major concern in Sabah, where water buffaloes might crossbreed with wild banteng. However, little genetic research has been done in this area to conclusively establish the impact of such crossbreeding on banteng survival. In a bid to protect the genetic purity of Bali cattle, Bali has banned other cattle varieties on the island. Cloning The banteng is the second endangered species to be successfully cloned, and the first clone to survive beyond infancy (the first was a gaur that died two days after birth). Scientists at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts extracted DNA from skin cells of a dead male banteng, that were preserved in the San Diego Zoo's Frozen Zoo facility, and transferred it into eggs from domestic banteng cows, a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. Thirty embryos were created and sent to Trans Ova Genetics, where they were implanted in domestic banteng cows. Two were carried to term and delivered by Caesarian section. The first was born on 1 April 2003, and the second two days later. The second was euthanised, apparently suffering from large offspring syndrome (an overgrowth disorder), but the first survived and lived for seven years at the San Diego Zoo, where it died in April 2010 after it broke a leg and was euthanised.

Formed during the mid-1960s, the group became inseparable with the revolution that occurred in the popular music of the country under the Popular Unity Government of Salvador Allende. Since its formation and during its forty-year history - both in Chile and during its lengthy period of exile in France - the group has seen modifications to its personnel lineup and the subject and content of its work. Controversy regarding irreconcilable differences with the current and former group directors led to the division into two distinctive Quilapay√∫n ensembles; one in Chile (Quilapay√∫n-Hist√≥rico) and one in France (Quilapay√∫n-France). History Official Quilapay√∫n logo Quilapay√∫n originated in 1965 when Julio Numhauser and the brothers Julio and Eduardo Carrasco formed a folk music trio, which they simply called \\"the three bearded men\\" (viz. Quila-Pay√∫n) in the Mapuche language (viz. Mapudungun ‚Äì the language of the people native to the region that is now the south of Chile, the Araucanians). Their first public performances were at the Universidad de Chile in Valpara√≠so, organized by their first musical director, √Ångel Parra (son of Violeta Parra). In 1966 the group won notice for its Andean music as well as the members' black ponchos, which became the group's trademark. During this time they won their first prize, La Guitarra de Oro (The Golden Guitar) in the Primer Festival Nacional del Folkore \\"Chile M√∫ltiple\\" (First National Festival of Folklore). They also made their first recording, appearing on one song of √Ångel Parra, \\"El Pueblo\\" (\\"The People\\"). At a 1966 performance in Valpara√≠so, the group met with V√≠ctor Jara, with whom the group maintained a close and productive artistic association for many years. At the request of the group, Jara became Quilapay√∫n's musical director and worked on the group's discipline and stage performances, and the style and content of the music. Jara presented them to the record label Odeon Records, where they recorded five LPs. Their first album, Quilapay√∫n, was basically an Andean music album, but included songs of √Ångel Parra, V√≠ctor Jara and new compositions of Eduardo Carrasco such as \\"La Paloma\\" and \\"El canto del cuculi\\". In 1967 Quilapay√∫n recorded an album together with V√≠ctor Jara, Canciones folkl√≥ricas de Am√©rica (Folk Songs of America). During this time Julio Numhauser left the group over disputes over the group's style of music, and was replaced by Guillermo \\"Willy\\" Odd√≥. During 1967 they also toured the USSR, Italy, France and other parts of Europe, and recorded an LP with the Chilean painter and poet Juan Capra. In 1968, Quilapay√∫n participated in the launch of a new record label of La Jota (Chile's Communist Party Youth Organization). To the surprise of many commercial record labels, their LP X Vietnam, which included songs from the Spanish Revolution, became a nationwide success. This album established the group's thematic and aesthetics, and created great interest and a following among progressive youth. From the success of this album the label DICAP (Discoteca del Cantar Popular) appeared, which became the springboard of the Nueva Canci√≥n Chilena (New Chilean Song) movement. DICAP recorded up to 60 musical productions until the military coup of September 11, 1973, which banned and literally destroyed the record label. During 1968 Julio Carrasco left the group for political differences, and was replaced by Hernan Gomez. At that time they performed at various universities, and made, with Victor Jara, their first two-hour show during two days in Santiago, which was a tremendous success. In 1969 they recorded the Basta LP, which included an eclectic and highly political collection of songs from different parts of the world, establishing the fundamental element of the New Chilean Song: its Internationalism. This album was released with a lengthy statement by the group about the nature of their work and their commitment to the socialist cause. Rodolfo Parada joined the group at this time. In 1969 they also appeared supporting V√≠ctor Jara on his album, Pongo en tus manos abiertas (Into your open hands) in songs such as \\"A Cochabamba Me Voy\\", \\"El Martillo\\" and \\"Movil Oil Special\\". They also joined Jara at the Primer Festival de la Nueva Cancion Chilena (First Festival of the New Chilean Song), where they jointly interpreted \\"Plegaria a un Labrador\\" (Prayer to a Laborer), which won the festival award. After three years V√≠ctor Jara and Quilapay√∫n took different paths, and Eduardo Carrasco became the group's director. Quilapay√∫n was forced into exile in France after the right-wing military coup of 1973. The group settled in the city of Colombes, France, for more than 15 years. Their major works include Santa Mar√≠a de Iquique (1970), an album of spoken history, songs, and instrumentals about a notorious massacre in the city of Iquique, and the song \\"El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido\\" (\\"The people, united, will never be defeated\\"), with lyrics by Quilapay√∫n and music by famed Chilean songwriter and playwright Sergio Ortega. Split Quilapay√∫n's path has been marked by internal issues over the years, with some members leaving and others taking their place. In 1987 Willy Oddo, its most charismatic member, decided to leave France to be closer to Chile. He chose to live in Argentina. In October 1988, Pinochet was overthrown by a referendum. After 15 years of exile Quilapayun could return to Chile and performed tours in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992. In 1989 Eduardo Carrasco returned to Chile while most of the group continued to live in France and perform around the world. In November 1991 Willy Oddo was murdered by an offender in Santiago. After Rodolfo Parada registered the name \\"Quilapay√∫n\\" without the authorization of the other members, other historic members refused to continue with Parada and Wang, resulting in the group splitting into two, both claiming the name and legacy of Quilapay√∫n, and leading to subsequent litigation. The Chile-based historic faction is celebrating the group's 40 year anniversary performing concerts in Chile, Latin America and Europe, together with the \\"historic\\" version of Inti-Illimani, another important Chilean group. These joint concerts have been advertised and promoted as Inti+Quila. The current \\"historic\\" lineup includes Eduardo Carrasco, Rub√©n Escudero, Ricardo Venegas, Guillermo Garc√≠a, Ismael Odd√≥ (son of Guillermo \\"Willy\\" Odd√≥), Hugo Lagos, Hern√°n G√≥mez, Carlos Quezada and Sebasti√°n Quezada (son of Carlos). On December 5, 2007, the Court of Appeal of Paris forbade Parada and Wang's group \\"from making use of the name QUILAPAY√öN, subject to a fine of 10 000 euros per infringement\\".http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr > Recherce simple > Juridiction d‚Äôappel/06/22447 This judgement was confirmed by the Highest Court of Appeal (Cour de Cassation de Paris) on June 11, 2009. http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr > Recherche simple > Juridiction de cassation/08-12063 In 2015 the band's career reached its fiftieth year and both factions celebrated this anniversary. Parada's group performed three big shows at the end August in Santiago, together with other well-known Chilean artists while the \\"historic\\" faction made a big concert in front of Palacio de la Moneda in Santiago and announced several other anniversary concerts in Chile, Colombia and Spain on its website. In November 2015, the Chilean trademark conflict ended, since the Instituto Nacional de Patentes Industriales (INAPI), after a thirteen years process gave the exclusive right for using the mark \\"Quilapayun\\" to the group headed by Carrasco.http://ion.inapi.cl:8080/Marca/BuscarMarca.aspx Register number: 1185441 Notable members * Eduardo Carrasco: wind instruments (quena, pincuyo, zampo√±a etc.); voice: bass * Carlos Quezada: percussion instruments, guitar; voice: tenor * Guillermo \\"Willy\\" Odd√≥: guitar, percussion instruments; voice: baritenor (died in 1991) * Hern√°n Gomez: guitar, charango; voice: bass-baritone. * Hugo Lagos: string instruments, quena, zampo√±a; voice: baritone * Guillermo Garc√≠a: guitar, percussion instruments; voice: baritone * Ricardo Venegas Carhart: bass guitar, quena, baritone * Victor Jara (murdered by Pinochet military, Sept. 16, 1973) Discography =Studio albums= * Quilapay√∫n (1966) * Canciones folkl√≥ricas de Am√©rica (1967) (Quilapay√∫n & V√≠ctor Jara) * X Vietnam (1968) * Quilapay√∫n Tres (1968) * Basta (1969) * Quilapay√∫n Cuatro (1970) * Cantata Santa Mar√≠a de Iquique (1970) (Quilapay√∫n & H√©ctor Duvauchelle) * Vivir como √©l (1971) * Quilapay√∫n Cinco (1972) * La Fragua (1973) (text and music by Sergio Ortega) * El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido (Yhten√§ist√§ Kansaa Ei Voi) (1974) * El Pueblo Unido Jam√°s Ser√° Vencido (1975) * Adelante (1975) * Patria (1976) * La marche et le drapeau (1977) * Hart voor Chili (various artists) (1977) * Cantata Santa Mar√≠a de Iquique (Nueva versi√≥n) (1978) (Quilapay√∫n & Jean-Louis Barrault) * Umbral (1979) * Darle al oto√±o un golpe de ventana...

Left for dead and unable to stand, she crawled over the next sixteen days to reach safety. After her kidnapping, Larcena was indirectly involved in several other incidents with Apache. Much of her family died during her life as a result of native attacks or from infectious disease on the frontier. Early life Born Larcena Ann Pennington, in Nashville, Tennessee, she was the daughter of Elias and Julia Ann Pennington. One of 12 children, she had seven sisters and four brothers. Her father, Elias, was the son of Elijah Pennington, a soldier who served under General George Washington at Valley Forge during the American Revolutionary War. Her mother Julia Ann Pennington died within a year after the birth of her twelfth child while her husband was away. After that, the father took the surviving Penningtons to an area near Keechi, Texas. = Leaves Texas = In 1857, in hopes of economic prosperity, the Pennington family traveled west, originally with the intention of settling in California. From Keechi they headed west with three wagons pulled by oxen and mules, and a herd of cattle. The wagon train forded the Pecos River, where several of the cows drowned; it continued to Paso del Norte. From there they followed the Rio Grande north to Mesilla and then moved west toward Tucson. They passed through several canyons where Apache were known to spring surprise attacks, including Doubtful Canyon, Apache Pass, and Cooke's Canyon. (A wagon train was later attacked there in the Battle of Cookes Canyon in 1861.) They passed through the San Simon Valley, Sulphur Springs Valley, the San Pedro and Dragoon Springs on their way west. In June 1857, the Penningtons temporarily stopped at Sonoita Creek, next to Fort Buchanan, because their animals were either exhausted, or had been stolen by Apache, and Larcena had contracted malaria. The men obtained a contract from the government to supply the fort with hay and the women sewed soldiers' uniforms for pay. When they completed the contract, the Penningtons moved west to Calabasas, along the Santa Cruz River. Before September 1859 they moved into the former residence of Governor Manuel Maria Gandara, who was displaced after the United States victory in the Mexican-American War. = Marriage and family = While at Fort Buchanan, Larcena met lumberjack John Hempstead Page and fell in love. The two married on December 24, 1859, becoming the first American citizens to be wed in Tucson. At that time, the settlement had fewer than one thousand people.  Kidnapped  right After they married, Larcena moved from the fort to Tucson, but her husband lived and worked at Canoa Ranch, south of present-day Green Valley. Canoa Ranch was owned by Bill Kirkland. Page lived there because it was only east of Madera Canyon and the Santa Rita Mountains, where he and his partner, William Randall, had a small lumber mill at the canyon. There they processed pine trees to transport to Tucson by wagon for sale. Larcena was employed as a teacher for Kirkland's eleven-year-old ward, Mercedes Sais Quiroz. Eventually Larcena moved to Canoa Ranch with Mercedes, but she became ill, possibly with malaria. Page decided to move his wife and Mercedes out of the desert and into a cabin near the \\"Big Rock\\" at the lumber mill. He thought that the higher elevation would help Larcena recover. On March 15, 1860, Page and Randall picked up Larcena, Mercedes and their dog for the trip to the cabin by wagon. They headed west through the Santa Rita foothills toward Madera Canyon. They had nearly reached their destination when they decided to stop and rest for the night. This site was south of the \\"Big Rock\\". They did not know that five Pinal Apache warriors were watching the camp from the surrounding hills. The next morning, Randall went out to hunt for breakfast and, at around 10:00 am, Page rode up the canyon to check on a load of lumber at the mill, leaving Larcena and Mercedes alone at camp. Larcena was alarmed by the dog barking and hearing Mercedes scream. The Apache first captured Mercedes and next entered Larcena's tent, removing her husband's revolver from her before she could shoot. The Apache were armed with lances and bows. Four were young men but the fifth was older and spoke a little Spanish. The older Apache told Mercedes that he had killed Page; and Larcena screamed after the girl told her. One of the Apache put his lance to Larcena and threatened to kill her if she didn't stop. After stealing \\"whatever they could\\" and cutting open the Pages' sacks of food, the Apache took the two women northeast, who walked roughly along the base of the Santa Rita Mountains, toward one of their strongholds along the San Pedro River. They stopped a short distance from the camp to take apart a feather bed they had been trying to carry off. Larcena screamed and again was told to be quiet or be killed. Robert H. Forbes, author of Penningtons: Pioneers of Early Arizona, wrote that up to that time, neither of the captives had been molested in any way, but Larcena later said that the Apache \\"pre-tended to ambush them from behind trees or play-fully pointed the captured pistol at them.\\" One of the Apache recounted that all the land in that area was once part of their domain until the white man came. The journey to the San Pedro was rough, but both Larcena and Mercedes tore off pieces of their clothing and bent twigs to make an easily recognizable trail. Forbes says, \\"One of the Apaches melted snow in his hands for them [the captives] to drink. Mrs. Page was pushed or pulled up steep places in the trail and Mercedes was carried pick-a-back. Their hats were restored to them from the plunder and fair progress was made....\\" = Left for dead = Page had not been killed and returned to camp to discover both his wife and Mercedes missing. He assumed they had been taken by Apache and gathered Randall and a few other men from the mill to help follow their trail. Just before sunset, when the Apache and women captives were about from the camp, east of the present day Helvetia, one of the Apache noticed Page's party approaching from behind. The Apache quickened their pace but Larcena could not keep up. While the group was standing atop a ridge, the Apache made Larcena remove her skirt and corset. As she turned to continue walking, one of the natives struck her in the back with a lance. She fell over the side of the ridge, about seventeen feet, becoming lodged against a pine tree. The Apache followed Larcena down the ridge, thrusting their spears into her and throwing rocks at her. One of the rocks hit Larcena in the face and she fell unconscious. The Apache dragged her body into a snow bank behind a tree to hide her body from the trail. They removed her boots and one of them put them on. Larcena woke up a short time later and could hear her husband's voice coming from the trail. She tried to call but was too weak for him to hear her. Because one of the Apache was wearing Larcena's boots, Page followed his trail and passed unknowing by his wife. He trailed the Apache to the Rincon Mountains and beyond the Catalina Mountains. Still unable to find his wife, Page went to Tucson and recruited a posse for a second attempt. Another posse also formed in Tubac but it was also unsuccessful. = Crawls to saw mill = Larcena remained in the snow bank for about three days before waking up in the middle of the night. First she ate some snow and looked after her wounds, for she had been \\"bruised with stones and cut with sixteen lance wounds in her back and arms.\\" She made her way down the ridge, sleeping again until sunrise. On the next morning, she began looking around trying to understand where she was. Knowing that the camp and the lumber mill were to the southeast, she looked in that direction and sighted a \\"small sharp-pointed hill.\\" Historians have identified this from her account as Huerfano Hill, about west of Helvetia. Because of her wounds and loss of blood, for the next several days Larcena crawled the back to camp. She survived on \\"seeds, herbage and wild onions, with snow water to drink.\\" According to Forbes, \\"Night by night (unable to lie on her back because of her wounds) she crouched upon her knees and arms on the ground and dreamed of food; but when in her sleep she reached out for the pot of beans before her, she awoke to find her hands clutching only gravel.\\" One day, Larcena came across a bear's nest and wanted to sleep there but she knew it was a bad idea and went away. Ten days after her \\"terrible journey\\" began, on March 26, she climbed to the top of a ridge and saw the road that leads to Madera Canyon and the camp. Hearing the sound of voices and wagon wheels, Larcena attached her petticoat to a stick to signal for help. She also screamed but the people in the wagon passed on without seeing or hearing anything. When Larcena reached the camp, two days later, she found a smoldering campfire, some flour and some coffee that was still on the ground from when the Apaches cut open the sacks of food. Using water from a nearby stream, and a piece of her clothing, Larcena prepared some bread on the fire, made some coffee, and then rested for the night. On the next morning, March 31, Larcena followed the road east to the Big Rock and the lumber mill. Forbes says that \\"as she drew near she was seen, but not at first recognized. With clotted hair and gaping wounds, nearly naked, emaciated and sunburned, she was at first mistaken for an unfortunate outcast squaw and the men ran for their guns.\\" It was only when Larcena called out her name that she was recognized. But even then, one man, named Smith, insisted that she was a ghost because he couldn't believe that a twenty-three- year-old woman could survive so long under such trying circumstances. One of the men took Larcena into a building and had her fed and washed while another man went to get a doctor in Tucson and inform John, who was preparing for a third expedition to find his wife. On April 2, Larcena was taken to Tucson where she fully recovered under the care of Dr. C.B. Hughes. The young Mexican girl, Mercedes, was later found by the United States Army and traded for Apache prisoners at Fort Buchanan. She later married Charles A. Shibell and had four children, but died at age 26. Later life William Fisher Scott, second husband of Larcena Pennington Page. In 1861 the American Civil War was about to begin and Larcena was worried that the Apaches would turn more violent with the absence of military personnel. Larcena and her family soon moved to Patagonia. Due to the Bascom Affair, Chief Cochise and Mangas Coloradas were attacking American settlements all across southern New Mexico Territory. In March or April 1861, her husband, John, was ambushed and killed by Apache north of Tucson while transporting a wagon load of goods to Old Camp Grant. John was buried where he died, \\"at the top of the hill beyond Samaniego's ranch, on the old road; and all that Mrs. Page ever saw of him was his handkerchief, his purse and a lock of his hair.\\" In the later part of August 1861, her brother, Jack, saved a fellow settler from Apaches during the Battle of Cookes Canyon. In September 1861, Larcena gave birth to her daughter, Mary Ann, and shortly thereafter she moved again, to Tubac and later to a stone house along the Santa Cruz, about a half-mile from the international border with Mexico. The stone house was located in a dangerous area, frequented by Apaches, and at one point Larcena had to flee to Mowry, a small, fortified, mining town. Constantly moving, by April 1864 the Penningtons had returned to Tubac and were its only residents, as everyone else had fled during the Apache attack in 1861. Larcena's young brothers carried very long guns, to protect the family from further attacks. In 1867 Larcena's sister died of malaria and in 1868 her brother, Jim Pennington, was killed during attacks against the Apache. In June 1869, her father and another brother were both murdered while working at a farm by Apaches. The remaining members of the Pennington family left for Tucson and then decided to move to California. About outside Tucson, they had to return when Larcena's sister Ellen became gravely ill with pneumonia. Despite seeking medical help, Ellen died. Larcena and her brother were the only two remaining family members. Jack moved to Texas and Larcena decided to remain in Tucson. = Marries again = In August 1870, she married William Fisher Scott, a Scottish lawyer and judge. Larcena and William had two children, William P. (born September 1871) and Georgie Hazel (born October 6, 1872).The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \\"International Genealogical Index (IGI)\\" database, FamilySearch William P Scott Retrieved September 16, 2015The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, \\"International Genealogical Index (IGI)\\" database, FamilySearch Gerogie H Scott Retrieved September 16, 2015 Larcena refused to leave Arizona, despite all the hardships she went through there. Larcena became a Christian and was one of the first members of the Congregational Church in Tucson. She was also named president of the Arizona Historical Society. Larcena lived a relatively quiet life from then until her death. Legacy Pennington Street in downtown Tucson is named after Larcena Pennington and her family. Scott Avenue is named for her second husband William F. Scott. In the early 2000s, a residential community named Stone House was built southeast of Sahuarita, Arizona. It was named after the Pennington's stone house along the Santa Cruz River.Leighton, David, \\"Pennington named for early family in territory,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Nov. 13, 2012 References Bibliography * External links * David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Downtown street named for miner (William F.

It is a Chinese Ministry of Education Double First Class Discipline University, with Double First Class status in certain disciplines. The school is tied to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and has a joint 8-year clinical medicine science program with Tsinghua University. Peking Union Medical College students in the 8-year clinical medicine program could receive a Peking Union Medical College diploma and degree signed by both the Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua presidents. It was merged with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in 1957 and operates as one single institution with two names directly under the Ministry of Health, now the National Health Commission. It is the first medical school in China to introduce the 8-year M.D. program.  History  The Peking Union Medical College was founded in 1906 by the American and British missionaries and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It remains one of the finest medical schools in China today. The Peking Union Medical College Hospital was founded in 1906. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the London Missionary Society, and later, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the Medical Missionary Association of London, together with the then-Chinese government cooperated in the foundation and development of the Medical College and maintained it until 1915. The Rockefeller Foundation was established in 1913 and in 1913-1914 the newly formed Foundation created a Commission, including Dr. Franklin C. McLean, to examine medical education in China. One of its recommendations was that the Foundation - through a subsidiary organization - should assume financial responsibility for the College. On July 1, 1915 the recently established China Medical Board assumed full support of the Union Medical College, having previously acquired the property. The Commission's members had included both William Welch, the first Dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and Simon Flexner. The China Medical Board modeled the school after Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine following the recommendations of the Flexner Report, which set the foundation of modern Medical Education in the United States and Canada. The PUMC was reorganized in 1917 and celebrated its 90th anniversary with a ceremony attended by the President of Johns Hopkins University, the Chair of the China Medical Board and representatives of the Rockefeller family and Rockefeller Brothers Fund. John Black Grant, M.D., M.P.H. was a founding faculty member of PUMC and served from 1921-1938 as Professor and Chair of its Department of Public Health. Dr. Grant is the father of James P. Grant, the third executive director of UNICEF. In January 1951, the new government nationalized PUMC, and the institution was accused of being an agent of American cultural imperialism. The Ministry of Health changed its name to China Union Medical College but did not radically alter the curriculum except to switch the language of instruction from English to Chinese. In 1952 the People's Liberation Army took charge of operations and remained in charge until 1956. The curriculum was militarized and shortened to one year in order to train army medical officers, and Soviet models were introduced. The basic orientation to Western medicine was maintained and the staff continued to do research and advanced surgeries. In 1956, autonomy was restored, but the college continued to be criticized for its elitism, cosmopolitanism, and failure to \\"serve the people\\" during periodic campaigns. During the Cultural Revolution, the Peking Union Medical College was closed, and the hospital was renamed the Beijing Anti-Imperialism Hospital (Âåó‰∫¨ÂèçÂ∏ùÈÜ´Èô¢). In 1979, it reopened as the \\"Capital University of Medical Sciences\\" then returned to Peking Union Medical College (ÂçèÂíåÂåªÁßëÂ§ßÂ≠¶) in 1985.\\"Peking Hospital Takes Back Pre-1949 Name,\\" New York Times, June 9, 1985  Current status Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University gate„ÄÇ Peking Union Medical College students traditionally attend Peking University biology department for their pre-meds portion of education. Since 2002, Tsinghua University has held a joint MD program in clinical medical science. Enrollment in the clinical medical science at PUMC is based on individual's performance in high school and National Exam score at graduation. The curriculum of clinical medical science is 8 years, accepts about 90 students each year and includes 2.5 years of pre-medical education in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University; the students have their pre-med studies at Tsinghua University and are considered as students of both PUMC and Tsinghua University. The college also has its independent Graduate School, which recruits from other medical schools around the country. The health care services at Peking Union Medical College Hospital are widely believed in mainland China to be among the most technically advanced. Many prominent political and social leaders in China have sought medical treatment at the PUMC Hospital.

In 2008, its official name of English version was changed to \\"Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology\\", together with the address of its official website. The data from a statistic in 2008 says that there are 7150 students including 6017 undergraduate students, 481 postgraduate students and 59 foreign students, some of whom have traveled from Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan. There are also students of other nationalities. This institute is composed of 5 schools (clothing design and engineering school, polymer materials and engineering school, art design school, business school, industry design and information technology school) and 2 departments (foreign language and painting). In the past, Beijing Institute of Clothing Technology named depended on clothing, but in 2007, the BIFT transformed the name to Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology. This college is the only one school that education based on the fashion and clothing design.

Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her orange hair, lavender heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname \\"Danger Prone Daphne\\". She has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo. Overview =Character description= The Daphne character was inspired by the sophisticated and money-hungry teen character Thalia Menninger, as played by Tuesday Weld, from the late 50s/early 60s American sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.Evanier, Mark. (July 10, 2002).Post on \\"News from Me\\" blog for Povonline.com. Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: \\"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on Maynard.\\" Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! shows her birthday to be December 25 to create a personal conflict for her regarding Christmas overshadowing her birthday. But \\"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\\" indicates her birthday is in the middle of September because the gang gets back together for her birthday ghost hunting trip and the harvest moon appears later in the episode. According to Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes, Daphne always wanted to be both a supermodel and a detective even as a child (the latter of which disappointed her parents). Her aspirations had an effect on her personal life as she was always late for dates whenever she went on mysteries with the gang; she and Fred deny the rumors that they are dating. Her father gave her and her friends the money to start off and, prior to buying the Mystery Machine, Daphne gave her parents gas money to drive them to where there were mysteries to be solved. Together with her other teenage companions, Fred Jones, Velma Dinkley, Shaggy Rogers, and Shaggy's Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful and enthusiastic but clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, \\"Danger-prone Daphne\\") who always follows her intuition. She serves as the damsel in distress and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, gagged, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character, who could take care of herself. During the series' fourth incarnation, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo, some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, \\"Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake\\", Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by the snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, \\"The Scary Sky Skeleton\\", Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy. In the episode, \\"I Left My Neck in San Francisco\\", Daphne becomes sick and she's unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampire of the Bay. Due to the vampire's look, Daphne's unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne's bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampire. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake with suspecting Daphne and she is feeling well again. When the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 80s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the \\"Whodunnit?\\" aspect returned to the series with The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries, Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo series. The youthful Daphne portrayed in A Pup Named Scooby-Doo would commonly call upon her butler, Jenkins, to do various tasks. The younger Daphne is shown (along with her parents) to not believe in ghost/monsters/supernatural (one of her catchphrases in that series was \\"There is no such thing as ghosts (monsters)!), a trait she lacks outside the A Pup Named Scooby-Doo series. In the movie Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Daphne as an adult, had a very successful investigative TV series called Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake on a fictional channel called \\"Americana\\", which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones. Throughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct- to-video movies and the TV series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of his feelings toward Daphne. In the first live-action Scooby-Doo movie, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, they are in a relationship. Performers * Stefanianna Christopherson (1969‚Äì1970; Scooby- Doo, Where Are You!

Mystery Incorporated series, Vanessa Marshall voiced Danica in the What's New, Scooby-Doo? series and Grey DeLisle voiced Shannon in the film Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster (direct-to-DVD). Welker also voiced George on A Pup Named Scooby-Doo. The late voice actor Don Messick voiced two of Daphne's uncles: Matthew \\"Matt\\" Blake on The Scooby-Doo Show and John Maxwell on Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. In other media Daphne was portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film Scooby-Doo and its sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed and voiced in the animated series Robot Chicken. Her husband Freddie Prinze Jr. played Fred in the same films. In these movies, Daphne and Fred began a relationship in the first that followed on through the second. Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar's version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.'s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar's widely recognized role of the title character in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Though in the first movie, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, she beats him in a fight at the end. Daphne is portrayed by Kate Melton in the third film Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins (released as a TV movie in 2009) and its sequel Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster (which premiered on October 16, 2010). These two movies are prequels to the first two live-action movies and show how the gang met while in high school. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in the school musical. It is also revealed that she is the actual owner of the Mystery Machine. Sarah Jeffery portrayed Daphne in the live-action film Daphne & Velma. This film provided a different origin to how Daphne met the rest of the gang. In this film, Daphne is shown to have met Velma first, and the two of them started solving mysteries before meeting Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby.

Chiseosan near Yangsan, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Tongdosa is one of the Three Jewels Temples and represents Gautama Buddha. (Haeinsa, also in South Gyeongsang Province, represents the dharma or Buddhist teachings; and Songgwangsa in South Jeolla Province represents the sangha or Buddhist community.) Tongdosa is famous because there are no statues outside of the Buddha at the temple because the \\"real shrines of the Buddha\\" (relics) are preserved at Tongdosa. Courtyards at the temple are arrayed around several pagodas that house the Buddha's relics. Origins Tongdosa was established by the monk Jajang-yulsa after returning from Tang China in 646 AD, during the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla. It thrived throughout the Later Silla and Goryeo periods (918-1392), when Buddhism was the state religion, and remained strong even during Joseon. Tongdosa is reputed to house several relics of the Buddha himself, including a robe, a begging bowl, and a bone from his skull, all relics that Jajang-yulsa brought back from the travels to Tang China he undertook in 636 to study with ten other monks. Only one building, the Mahavira Hall (main Dharma worship hall), survived the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) in the late 16th century; the other buildings were rebuilt later that period. In the mid 15th century at the height of its prosperity, Tongdosa is said to have had hundreds of buildings and thousands of monks. For over 1,300 years Tongdosa's Beopdeung (temple candle) has never gone out. =Legend= Legend has it that at the time of Tongdosa's founding there were nine evil dragons living in a big pond. Jajang-yulsa enjoined the dragons to leave by reciting a magic texts. They refused to leave so Jajang-yulsa inscribed the Chinese character for fire on a sheet of paper and tossed it skyward while using his long stick to splash the pond. The water began to boil. The dragons could not endure the heat so three tried to escape and flew off, became disoriented, and died by colliding into a cliff called Yonghyeolam (\\"dragon blood rock\\"). Five of the dragons flew southwest into a valley now called Oryonggok (\\"five dragon valley\\"). The last dragon, blinded by the heat, made a vow to Jajang-yulsa that if he spared his life and allowed him to stay in the pond forever, the blind dragon would always guard the temple. Jajang- yulsa granted the dragon's request and the dragon was allowed to stay as protector of the temple. Nine Dragons Pond, now called Guryongji, still stands beside the main temple hall. Temple today One of the Four Heavenly Kings, Vir≈´pƒÅk·π£a - King of the West, in the Tongdosa Guardian Gate Korea's largest temple, Tongdosa, is often called \\"the temple without a Buddha\\" because it contains no outdoor statues of the Buddha; rather it is arranged around several stupas which contain Jajang-yulsa's relics of the historical Buddha. The road that meanders up to the temple wanders through a forest called \\"Pine trees dancing in the wind\\". 65 buildings separately house a shrine for virtually every major Buddhist deity. The temple does not seem especially large because many of the buildings are dispersed throughout the surrounding mountainside. 13 hermitages can be found on the temple complex grounds. The buildings are varied in architectural style with many left unpainted or faded. One of the buildings contains a fine mural depicting a boat escorting the deceased into paradise. A museum on the temple grounds displays an excellent collection of artwork. Today at this temple there are 19 local treasures and 794 local cultural properties. Samseongbanwol or One Mind Bridge near entranceApproaching the entrance the first bridge one sees is Samseongbanwol ‚Äî Three Arch Bridge ‚Äî meaning three stars and a half moon, sometimes also called the One Mind Bridge. The Chinese character is composed of four strokes; when applying the strokes to the name of the bridge, the long stroke stands for a half moon and the others, three stars. The first gate to the temple, Iljumun, is called the One-Pillar Gate because when viewed from the side the gate appears to be supported by a single pillar. This symbolizes the support of the world and the one true path of enlightenment. Iljumun is the boundary between the spiritual world and the secular world. Purimun, the Gate of Non-Duality - South Gyeongsang Provincial Tangible Cultural Property #252. The following gate is the Gate of the Guardians of the Four Directions or Four Heavenly Kings, each of whom watches over one cardinal direction. They are the protectors of the world and fighters of evil, each able to command a legion of supernatural creatures to protect the Dharma (Buddhist teachings). Next comes the third gate of the temple, Purimun, known as the Gate of Non-Duality. The world across this gate is one of non-duality, where there is no distinction between the Buddha and human beings, being and non-being, good and evil, and fullness and emptiness. During Purimun's long history the gate has been rebuilt many times. The present Gate of Non-Duality was constructed in the late Joseon Dynasty and was built to line up straight with the One Pillar Gate, Guardian Gate, and Daeungjeon (main Dharma hall). The gate of Non- Duality is the left most structure in the first picture at the top of the page. Purimun, the Gate of Non-Duality, is designated South Gyeongsang Provincial Tangible Cultural Property #252. Geumgang Gyedan (Diamond Altar) behind Daeungjeon (main Dharma Hall) Tongdosa is one of five temples in Korea, known as Jeokmyeolbogung, which enshrine the relics of the Buddha that Jajang- yulsa returned from China. Tongdosa is the ‚ÄòBuddha Jewel Temple‚Äô because it enshrines Sari Jinsin (the Buddha‚Äôs relics) in the Geumgang Gyedan (Diamond Altar), a platform for the ceremony prevailing Buddhist precepts, behind Daeungjeon (main Dharma Hall). There is no image of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, as is typically found in a worship hall, in Tongdosa. Instead a Buddhist altar that spans east to west inside along the front with a window, in the place of a Buddha image, looks out on the Geumgang Gyedan (Diamond Altar). Tongdosa's Daeungjeon is National Treasure #290.

An acoustic cello can be fitted with a bridge or body mounted contact pickup providing an electric signal, or a built-in pickup can be installed. A few pickups work by other principles like magnetic coil guitar type needing steel strings to work, or by an unusual pickup system http://www.stringamp.com employing the string itself as a linear pickup element, thus avoiding any modification of tone-producing parts on an acoustic cello. Many electric cellos have bodies modeled after acoustic celloshttps://www.cellocentral.com/best-electric-cellos-review/, while others abandon the design completely, opting for a totally new body shape, or having little or no body at all.http://www.jordanmusic.com/cellos Most electric cellos feature a traditional endpin and knee supports, but some are supported in other ways, such as by an elongated pin for playing in the standing position, a tripod stand, strap, or strap system that allows mobility while playing the instrument. The major differentiating factor between electric cellos and acoustic cellos is that while the latter rely on an acoustically resonant soundbox, the former are amplified electronically and often have no resonant chamber at all.http://www.nedsteinberger.com/ Most electric cellos are driven by a piezo pickup system mounted in the bridge. Many also contain an on-board preamp, which allows the musician localized control over the sound. The number of piezo elements in use range from one to eight. The electric cello has several advantages over acoustic cellos. One of these advantages is its capacity for sound effects, such as distortion, wah, and chorus, which allows for the creation of a huge variety of sounds and possibilities matching that of the electric guitar, electric bass and electric violin. Also, five-string and six-string models (not generally available in acoustic cellos) allow for an extended range. An electric cello with no body can be played in the high positions more easily than an acoustic. Lastly, electric cellos without a resonant body have less of a tendency for feedback than amplified acoustic cellos. The electric cello has not yet achieved the status of the ubiquitous electric guitar, or even the widespread success of the electric violin.

History  Formed in 1998, the group participated in Bangalore IT.COM 1999 (now known as Bangalore IT.in), then India's largest technology event. The Government of Karnataka gave the BLUG an entire pavilion, where it exhibited Linux-based machines showing various applications, under the motto \\"Seeing is believing\\". Over the years, the BLUG participated in a number of technology events, and from 2001 to 2004 facilitated Linux Bangalore, a FOSS event with thousands of delegates from India and abroad. The current edition of the event is called FOSS.IN. In late 2000, the BLUG was registered as a not-for-profit society, under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act 1960. During 2004-2005, recognising that Linux and Open Source had become mainstream technologies and did not need generic advocacy, members of the group proposed creating smaller groups in Bangalore, leading to the formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs). Another outcome was regular Birds of a Feather (BOF) meet-ups every fortnight at locations across the city. In February 2005, the BLUG was named the \\"Most Popular Indian Linux User Group\\" at the Linux Asia conference in New Delhi. In mid-2005, the BLUG regrouped and resumed its activities, including meetings, while at the same time adopting the role of a staging platform for multiple FOSS activities, especially amongst students. From late 2005 onwards, the BLUG began an educational campaign at technical colleges, with members speaking about technical and non-technical FOSS topics at student-arranged events in colleges.

It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong separation of powers, such as in the United States, and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused. In the context of lawsuits, executive nonacquiescence in judicial decisions can lead to bizarre Kafkaesque situations where parties discover to their chagrin that their legal victory over the government is an empty one. Nonacquiescence can also possibly lead to a constitutional crisis, given certain critical situations and decisions. In the United States, certain federal agencies are notorious for practicing nonacquiescence (essentially, ignoring court decisions that go against them and refusing to accept their validity as binding precedent).Gregory C. Sisk, Litigation with the Federal Government (Philadelphia: American Law Institute, 2006), 418-425.Robert J. Hume, How Courts Impact Federal Administrative Behavior (New York: Routledge, 2009), 92-106. The Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service are particularly well known for such conduct.The SSA publishes Acquiescence Rulings and the IRS publishes Actions on Decisions, in which they state whether they will obey a particular court decision or not. Although executive nonacquiescence has been heavily criticized by the federal courts,See, e.g., Hutchison v. Chater, 99 F.3d 286, 287-88 (8th Cir. 1996); Johnson v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, 969 F.2d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB, 608 F.2d 965 (3d Cir. 1979); and Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir.), rev'd on other grounds sub nomine Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U.S. 1328 (1983). as well as the American Bar Association,Rhonda McMillion, \\"A Little Compliance Can't Hurt,\\" ABA Journal, August 1997, 96. the U.S. Congress has not yet been able to pass a bill formally prohibiting or punishing such behavior. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the term nonacquiescence in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide. This does not necessarily mean that the IRS will refuse to follow the ruling of the court on that particular case; rather it means that the IRS will not apply the ruling to other cases. In some cases of nonacquiesence, the IRS may follow the decision's precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.

He is a cowardly slacker and the long-time best friend of his equally cowardly Great Dane, Scooby-Doo. Like Scooby-Doo, Shaggy is more interested in eating than solving mysteries. Character description Shaggy has a characteristic speech pattern, marked by his frequent use of the filler word \\"like\\" and, when startled, his exclamations of \\"Zoinks!\\". His nickname derives from the shaggy style of his sandy-blond hair. He also sports a rough goatee. His signature attire consists of a green v-neck T-shirt and maroon or brown bell-bottom pants, both of which fit loosely. In The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo and early made-for-TV movies, he wore a red v-neck and blue jeans. Both Scooby and Shaggy are readily bribed with Scooby Snacks due to their mutual large appetites. Both display tendencies toward loafing and cowardice. Both justify their hunger by insisting that \\"Being in a constant state of terror makes us constantly hungry!\\" in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island. Shaggy's favorite dish is \\"extra cheese pizza with pickles\\" (as revealed in the TV movie Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo). In \\"Bedlam in the Big Top\\", he says he used to be in track and in \\"What a Night for a Knight\\", that he was a gymnast ‚Äì both of which hint at his uncanny skills in quickly evading villains and the reason he is invariably assigned the role of bait in Fred's traps. Due to being in track he has shown, in some instances, to be able to run even faster than Scooby, even when the latter is running on all fours. An early episode \\"A Clue for Scooby- Doo\\", from the inaugural series Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, reveals that his taste for unlikely food combinations (chocolate-covered hot dogs and liverwurst \\"a la mode\\", for example) is a consequence of an infant Shaggy receiving a garbage disposal unit for his first toy. In Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico, Fred states that the reason Shaggy eats so much (and maintains his slender physique) is his \\"high metabolism\\". However, in Scooby- Doo: Behind the Scenes, Fred states that the real reason Shaggy is so skinny is because he goes on a vegan diet (a reference to Casey Kasem's vegetarian lifestyle). Shaggy has shown himself capable of impressive feats of athleticism through fear alone; however, these abilities are invariably of a comic nature, with Shaggy only seeming capable of such feats when panicked. In Scooby-Doo! Camp Scare, in frustration at being trapped, he shakes the iron bars of an old-fashioned jail cell so hard they collapse. Shaggy's typical immediate reaction to experiences or perceptions of supposed supernatural occurrences is terror-struck cowardice. This was explained in the Legend of the Phantosaur as a possible type of panic disorder; in this instance, he was temporarily cured with hypnotherapy. Development The four teenage lead characters of Scooby-Doo were inspired by four of the main characters from the 1959‚Äì63 American sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, with Shaggy having been derived from the character Maynard G. Krebs, as played by Bob Denver. Maynard's beatnik-style goatee, general appearance, and use of the word \\"like\\" as a form of punctuation all found their way into the character of Shaggy, with the base personality of the character updated to make him a hippie rather than a beatnik.Shostak, Stu (February 5, 2012). \\"Interview with Joe Ruby and Ken Spears\\". Stu's Show. Retrieved March 18, 2013. Casey Kasem, the first voice actor for Shaggy, said that he originally felt uncomfortable after being assigned to Shaggy. Kasem stated that while he was \\"hip to what hippies were about\\", he had never before portrayed a hippie character. Kasem had wanted to portray Fred Jones, and Frank Welker had wanted to portray Shaggy. Instead, the CBS network assigned Kasem to Shaggy and Welker to Fred.Sigesmund, B.J. \\"The Inside Dope.\\" Newsweek. June 14, 2002. Available at Lexis-Nexis. Unsure of what the voice of a hippie would sound like, Kasem based his vocal style and mannerisms for Shaggy on those of Richard Crenna's character Walter Denton from the radio/television sitcom Our Miss Brooks.http://www.ncbuy.com/news/20030121/0-richard-crenna-shaggy- inspiration.html Kasem stated that as he continued to voice Shaggy, the character evolved. Kasem explained that the \\"voice dynamics\\" improved and that his laughs increasingly gained quality. Kasem added that Shaggy in 2002 is \\"more frightened today than he was at the beginning.\\" Kasem convinced the producers that Shaggy should be a vegetarian, like himself, in 2002. =Actors= Matthew Lillard, seen here in character in the 2002 film, portrayed Shaggy in two films and has provided Shaggy's voice since 2010. Nick Palatas as Shaggy in Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster. Radio disc-jockey, comedian, and actor Casey Kasem created the character's voice. Kasem voiced Shaggy for 28 years, from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1969 until the \\"Bravo Dooby-Doo\\" episode of Johnny Bravo in 1997. Starting with What's New, Scooby- Doo? in 2002 and Looney Tunes: Back in Action in 2003, Kasem resumed the role and continued to do so until his retirement in 2009. Billy West voiced the character in the film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998). Scott Innes (who has also voiced Scooby and Scrappy-Doo) voiced Shaggy in the 1999‚Äì2001 direct-to- video films, and in video games until 2009. Innes reprised Shaggy in Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, and a DirecTV commercial featuring the Scooby gang in 2008. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!. As of 2010, Matthew Lillard, who also played Shaggy in the 2002 and 2004 live- action films, took over the voice of Shaggy. Lillard also played Shaggy in Robot Chicken and MAD.

Shaggy's Showdown. Background In some of the Scooby-Doo series, Shaggy is born in Coolsville, Ohio. When he was old enough to go to school he adopted Scooby‚ÄìDoo from the Knittingham Puppy Farm. Later on, he met Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley. They became friends and they decided to be a team named Mystery Inc. (short for Mystery Incorporated). According to Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes, Shaggy was the one who bought the Mystery Machine and gave it its paint job; Fred wanted it painted red. According to Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes, Shaggy's old nickname was Buzz (named after his buzz haircut) until his tenth birthday. Fred reveals that Shaggy occasionally goes on a vegan diet, the real reason he is so skinny. Shaggy once had to battle an unhealthy habit of overeating the Scooby Snacks; Velma calculated that he once ate exactly forty-five percent of his body weight. This led to him dieting and starting a new hobby: collecting decorator belt buckles. Shaggy owns the largest collection of decorator belt buckles in the world and currently owns six hundred and fifty-three. Shaggy also states that he wears a different belt buckle for every mystery (the joke is that his baggy shirt always hides them). In Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, he is born in and is a citizen of Crystal Cove. His parents' names are Colton and Paula Rogers and appear to be quite well off, living in a mansion. He is a member of the new Mystery Incorporated. He also dates Velma for a short period during the first season. Shaggy and Scooby make a cameo appearance in the 2003 live-action/animated film Looney Tunes: Back in Action, where they berate Matthew Lillard over his portrayal of Shaggy in the 2002 live-action film and warn they might attack him if he plays Shaggy in Scooby- Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. Other appearances = Video games = Shaggy appears as a playable character, along with Scooby, in the crossover video game Lego Dimensions. Shaggy's character includes the Mystery Machine. Matthew Lillard reprises his role for the game. = Internet memes = Shaggy's appearance as a skilled brawler and daredevil while in a hypnotized state in Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur became the subject of an internet meme in 2017 when YouTube user Midya uploaded \\"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\\", juxtaposing a scene from the film where Shaggy singlehandedly defeated a biker gang with \\"Ky≈´kyoku no Battle\\" by Akira Kushida from the Dragon Ball Super soundtrack. This later spawned numerous fan art depictions of Shaggy as a superhuman being, as well as screenshots of behind-the-scenes interviews from the 2002 film with fake captions making it seem as if Matthew Lillard and the rest of the cast were attesting to Shaggy's \\"immense power\\" on set. The meme also led to a Change.org petition to add him as a DLC character in Mortal Kombat 11, which brought the attention of both Mortal Kombat series co-creator Ed Boon and Matthew Lillard. Controversy Some viewers of the original Scooby-Doo believed that Shaggy smoked marijuana due to his antics, mannerisms, vocabulary, general behavior and constant hunger. In a Newsweek article, Casey Kasem was asked if he had ever observed that subtext in the series and Kasem responded that \\"there wasn't anything like that at all\\", explaining \\"guess it's because, I don't know, it was a wholesome show from beginning to end\\" and was not aware of the fan viewpoint until the interviewer brought it up. Parodying the subtext, the makers of the Scooby-Doo film shot several scenes referring to Shaggy's supposed drug use, but few of those scenes were included in the final film. One scene in the film has a character tell Shaggy that her name is Mary Jane, a slang name for marijuana, and he responds, \\"Like, that is my favorite name\\". Matthew Lillard, the current voice of Shaggy, does not think he smokes marijuana: \\"He just seems like that. He acts a little goofy and high, he's lovable and scared ‚Äî and just happens to have the munchies.\\"Breznican, Anthony. \\"Are hidden meanings present in the 'Scooby-Doo' movie?, Filmmakers and cast members say some hints are there, but won't be understood by children.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer.

In addition, in an online radio interview with host Stu Shostak, series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears recalled that they never intended for Shaggy to be a smoker of marijuana, and \\"took umbrage\\" to the inclusion of allusions to such in the 2002 Scooby-Doo live-action feature film.

The act also excluded any possible future descendants of Edward from the line of succession. Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry his lover, Wallis Simpson, after facing opposition from the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions. Procedure and timing Although Edward VIII had signed a declaration of abdication the previous day‚Äî10 December 1936‚Äîhe remained king until giving Royal Assent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, which he did on 11 December, at 1.52 p.m., and the Act became immediately effective from that time.The Times, No. 47,556, Royal Edition, London Saturday 12 December 1936, p. 17: \\"Court Circular - BUCKINGHAM PALACE, 11 Dec.. The act was passed through the British Houses of Parliament in one day, with no amendments. As the Statute of Westminster 1931 stipulated that the line of succession must remain the same throughout the Crown's realms, the governments of some of the British Dominions‚ÄîCanada, Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand‚Äîrequested and gave their permission for the act to become part of the law of their respective realms. The Canadian parliament later passed the Succession to the Throne Act, 1937 to ratify changes to the rules of succession in Canada and ensure consistency with the changes in the rules then in place in the United Kingdom. South Africa passed His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act, 1937, which declared the abdication to have taken effect on 10 December 1936. Australia and New Zealand did not adopt the Statute of Westminster 1931 until the 1940s and did not pass their own legislation. In the Irish Free State, which had been independent from the United Kingdom as a dominion since December 1922, and in which the monarch still had some diplomatic functions, the Oireachtas (parliament) passed the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936, recognising George VI as king from 12 December 1936. Legal background The act was necessary for two main reasons. First, there was no provision in British law for a sovereign to abdicate. Parliament had to pass a bill to remove the king from the throne. Finally the king had to give royal assent to the legislation, which only then became a law. (This process had to be repeated in the parliaments of the Dominions which had enacted the Statute of Westminster 1931: Canada and South Africa.) Second, the act ensured that any descendants of Edward VIII would have no claim to the throne, and that the Royal Marriages Act 1772 would not apply to them. Upon the royal assent being communicated to Parliament on the king's behalf, the act came into effect and Edward VIII ceased to be king. The throne immediately passed to his brother, who was proclaimed King George VI the next day at St. James's Palace, London.

Friden mechanical calculator. The electronic computer word length of 36-bits was chosen, in part, to match its precision. Starting in the 1960s, but especially the 1970s, the introduction of 7-bit ASCII led to the move to machines using 8-bit words, notably the IBM System/360. By the mid-1970s the conversion was largely complete, and microprocessors quickly moved from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit over a period of a decade. The number of 36-bit machines rapidly fell during this period, offered largely for backward compatibility purposes running legacy programs. History Prior to the introduction of computers, the state of the art in precision scientific and engineering calculation was the ten-digit, electrically powered, mechanical calculator, such as those manufactured by Friden, Marchant and Monroe. These calculators had a column of keys for each digit, and operators were trained to use all their fingers when entering numbers, so while some specialized calculators had more columns, ten was a practical limit. Computers, as the new competitor, had to match that accuracy. Decimal computers sold in that era, such as the IBM 650 and the IBM 7070, had a word length of ten digits, as did ENIAC, one of the earliest computers. Early binary computers aimed at the same market therefore often used a 36-bit word length. This was long enough to represent positive and negative integers to an accuracy of ten decimal digits (35 bits would have been the minimum). It also allowed the storage of six alphanumeric characters encoded in a six-bit character code. Computers with 36-bit words included the MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2, the IBM 701/704/709/7090/7094, the UNIVAC 1103/1103A/1105 and 1100/2200 series, the General Electric GE-600/Honeywell 6000, the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-6/PDP-10 (as used in the DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20), and the Symbolics 3600 series. Smaller machines like the PDP-1/PDP-9/PDP-15 used 18-bit words, so a double word was 36 bits. These computers had addresses 12 to 18 bits in length. The addresses referred to 36-bit words, so the computers were limited to addressing between 4,096 and 262,144 words (24,576 to 1,572,864 six-bit characters). The older 36-bit computers were limited to a similar amount of physical memory as well. Architectures that survived evolved over time to support larger virtual address spaces using memory segmentation or other mechanisms. The common character packings included: * six 6-bit IBM BCD or Fieldata characters (ubiquitous in early usage) * six 6-bit ASCII characters, supporting the upper-case unaccented letters, digits, space, and most ASCII punctuation characters. It was used on the PDP-6 and PDP-10 under the name sixbit. * six DEC Radix-50 characters packed into 32 bits, plus four spare bits * five 7-bit characters and 1 unused bit (the usual PDP-6/10 convention, called five-seven ASCII) * four 8-bit characters (7-bit ASCII plus 1 spare bit, or 8-bit EBCDIC), plus four spare bits * four 9-bit characters Marshall Cline. \\"Would you please go over the rules about bytes, chars, and characters one more time?\\" : \\"A file transfer protocol\\" (the Multics convention). Characters were extracted from words either using machine code shift and mask operations or with special-purpose hardware supporting 6-bit, 9-bit, or variable-length characters. The Univac 1100/2200 used the partial word designator of the instruction, the \\"J\\" field, to access characters. The GE-600 used special indirect words to access 6- and 9-bit characters. the PDP-6/10 had special instructions to access arbitrary-length byte fields. The standard C programming language requires that the size of the \`char\` data type be at least 8 bits, and that all data types other than bitfields have a size that is a multiple of the character size, so standard C implementations on 36-bit machines would typically use 9-bit \`char\`s, although 12-bit, 18-bit, or 36-bit would also satisfy the requirements of the standard.

By the time IBM introduced System/360 with 32-bit full words, scientific calculations had largely shifted to floating point, where double-precision formats offered more than 10-digit accuracy. The 360s also included instructions for variable- length decimal arithmetic for commercial applications, so the practice of using word lengths that were a power of two quickly became commonplace, though at least one line of 36-bit computer systems are still sold , the Unisys ClearPath Dorado series, which is the continuation of the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series of mainframe computers.

This antelope has four horns, which distinguish it from most other bovids, which have two horns (sparing a few such as the Jacob sheep). The sole member of the genus Tetracerus, the species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. Three subspecies are recognised. The four-horned antelope stands nearly at the shoulder and weighs nearly . Slender with thin legs and a short tail, the four-horned antelope has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. One pair of horns is located between the ears, and the other on the forehead. The posterior horns are always longer than the anterior horns, which might be mere fur-covered studs. While the posterior horns measure , the anterior ones are long. The four-horned antelope is diurnal (active mainly during the day). Though solitary by nature, four-horned antelopes may form loose groups of three to five ‚Äìwith one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. This elusive antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed for the first few weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year. Four-horned antelopes tend to inhabit areas with significant grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the antelope now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers can be found in adjoining Nepal. The four-horned antelope is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. The four-horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Etymology The scientific name of the four-horned antelope is Tetracerus quadricornis. The generic name Tetracerus is the combination of two Greek words: tetra meaning \\"four\\" and keras meaning \\"horn\\". The specific name quadricornis is derived from two Latin words: quattuor meaning \\"four\\" and cornu \\"horn\\". The four-horned antelope is known by several vernacular names: chausingha, chowsingha, chousingha (Hindi for \\"four horns\\"), doda, ghutri (mainly in central India) (Hindi); kondu kuri (Kannada); chauka (Nepalese); nari komboo marn (Tamil). Taxonomy and phylogeny The four- horned antelope is the sole member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The four-horned antelope has only one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have horns with a keel on the front and lack rings as found in other antelope groups. The authority for Tetracerus is variously indicated according to interpretations of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The name was first published in an 1825 publication by English naturalist Thomas Hardwicke but cited the English zoologist William Elford Leach ‚Äì probably by an editor ‚Äì as the authority in a footnote at the end of the publication. Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas listed Hardwicke as the genus authority by virtue of his being the author of the publication. However, Leach is now identified as the appropriate authority based on Article 50.1.1 of the Zoological Code. A 1992 phylogenetic study showed a strong possibility of a clade consisting of Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Bovini consists of the genera Bubalus, Bos, Pseudoryx (saola), Syncerus (African buffalo), Bison and the extinct Pelorovis. Tragelaphini consists of two genera: Taurotragus (eland) and Tragelaphus. Boselaphini and Tragelaphini were predicted to be close; this was seconded by a similar study in 1999. The following cladogram is based on the 1992 study: Colin Groves (2003) recognizes three subspecies of the four-horned antelope on the basis of distribution and physical characteristics such as coat colour, body size and the number of horns: * T. q. iodes (Hodgson, 1847): distributed north of the Ganges in Nepal * T. q. quadricornis (de Blainville, 1816): distributed in peninsular India * T. q. subquadricornutus (Elliot, 1839) distributed in the Western Ghats and southern India Evolution Skull of the four-horned antelope Though Boselaphini has no African representation today, fossil evidence supports its presence in the continent during as early as the late Miocene ‚Äì the two living antelopes of this tribe, in fact, have been found to have a closer relationship with the earliest bovids (like Eotragus species) than do the other bovids. This tribe originated at least 8.9 Mya, in much the same area where the four-horned antelope occurs today, and may represent the most \\"primitive\\" of all living bovids, having changed the least since the origins of the family. The extant and extinct boselaphine forms show similar development of the horn cores (the central bony part of the horn). It is thought that ancestral bovids had a diploid chromosome number of 58 which has reduced in Tetracerus to 38 through a process of concatenation of some chromosomes. Fossils of Protragoceros labidotus and Sivoreas eremita dating back to the late Miocene have been discovered in the Ngorora formation (Kenya). fossils from the same period have also been excavated in the eastern Mediterranean region. Other Miocene fossils of boselaphines discovered are of Miotragocerus, Tragocerus and Tragoportax. Fossils of Miotragoceros are not apparent in Africa (only M. cyrenaicus has been reported from the continent), but have significant presence in the Shiwalik Hills in India and Pakistan, as do several Tragoportax species. A 2005 study suggested the migration of Miotragoceros to eastern Asia around 8 Mya. Alan W. Gentry of the Natural History Museum reported the presence of another boselaphine, Mesembriportax, from Langebaanweg (South Africa). Evidence of early humans hunting four-horned antelope during the Mesolithic period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago) have been found in the Kurnool caves of southern India and similar evidence has been found from the Chalcolithic period (3,000 years ago) in Orissa, eastern India. Description The four-horned antelope is one of the smallest Asian bovids. The number of its horns distinguishes it from most of the other bovids, that have two horns (sparing a few such as the Jacob sheep). The four-horned antelope stands at the shoulder and weighs ; the head-and-body length is typically between . Sexual dimorphism is not very notable, though only males possess horns. Slender with thin legs and a short tail, the four-horned antelope has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white. Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more like that of a deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches. One pair of horns is located between the ears, and the other on the forehead. The posterior horns are always longer than the anterior horns, which might be mere fur-covered studs. While the posterior horns each measures , the anterior ones measure . Horns emerge at 10 to 14 months. According to Groves, anterior horns show the poorest development in the subspecies T. q. subquadricornutus. These horns measure nearly in T. q. quadricornis, and nearly in T. q. iodes. The posterior horn lengths for the subspecies recorded by him were: for T. q. quadricornis, in T. q. iodes and in T. q. subquadricornutus. The four-horned antelope differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, is much smaller and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the four-horned antelope. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns. Ecology and behaviour The four-horned antelope is solitary by nature. The four-horned antelope is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary by nature, the four-horned antelope may form loose groups of three to five. Groups consist of one or more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season. The antelope is shy and elusive. When alarmed, it stands motionless and may nervously leap away from the danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself in tall grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls may be used to warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes. =Diet= Four-horned antelope prefer habitats with dense undergrowth and tall grasses. The four- horned antelope feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. A study in Mudumalai National Park (Tamil Nadu, India) showed that the antelope prefers grass species of the family Cyperaceae; genera Axonopus, Cynodon, Digitaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sehima and Sporobolus; and the species Imperata cylindrica, Ottochloa nodosa, Pseudanthistria umbellata and Themeda cymbaria. The shrub Grewia hirsuta is frequently eaten. Preferred herbs include Helichrysum, Indigofera and Tinospora species and Leucas aspera. The four-horned antelope feeds on the leaves of trees such as Cordia wallichii, Emblica officinalis, Randia dumetorum and Zizyphus xylopyrus. Grasses comprise nearly 29 percent of the diet, followed by foliage from trees (nearly nine percent). Grass and browse were consumed in nearly equal proportions. A study in the Panna National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) showed preference for Zizyphus mauritiana, Acacia nilotica, A. leucophloea and A. catechu. Babool flowers were frequently eaten. The antelope often associates with langurs under fruiting trees, just as chital frequently do. Interaction with chital, a sympatric species, was infrequent. The antelope is wary when feeding, often raising its head and looking about its vicinity. The four- horned antelope needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. =Reproduction= Breeding behaviour of the four-horned antelope has not been well studied. The age at which sexual maturity is gained is doubted; two captive females had their first parturition at less than two years. The breeding season in Panna National Park probably lasts from May to July, and from June to August in Mudumalai National Park. The male approaches the female in a relaxed gait, giving out low coughs. The two may kneel and push against each other with the necks intertwined. The male makes a few short mounting attempts; the female may be foraging all the while without any reaction. Gestation lasts about eight months, followed by the birth of one or two calves. The newborn has a head-and-body length of , and weighs . Juveniles are kept concealed for the first few weeks of birth. Births in Mudumalai National Park peak from February to April. Juveniles remain with their mothers for about a year. Habitat and distribution Male four-horned antelope in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Tamil Nadu, India) The four-horned antelope inhabits areas with significant cover from grasses or heavy undergrowth, and close to water bodies. It generally keeps away from human-inhabited areas. Though they are habitat generalists, four-horned antelopes mostly occur in open, dry, deciduous forests in hilly terrain. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers. Their numbers were estimated at slightly above 10,000 in 2001, and are feared to be decreasing. In Mudumalai National Park, the populations are low and scattered. Their numbers in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes in the same location put them a little above 1000. Densities of above 0.7 individuals per km2 have been considered as being healthy. Presently the four-horned antelope is confined to the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. The range in India covers a vast expanse, from the foothills of the Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations are in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepal. Threats and conservation The four-horned antelope is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four- horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. In India, the species is protected under Schedule I the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and the Nepalese population is listed in CITES Appendix III. The four- horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Major protected areas across India where four-horned antelopes occur include: Gir National Park (Gujarat); Bandhavgarh National Park, Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, Kanha National Park, Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, Panna Tiger Reserve, Pench Tiger Reserve, Sanjay National Park, Satpura National Park (Madhya Pradesh); Tadoba Andhari Reserve (Maharashtra); Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, Ranthambore National Park, Rangayyanadurga wildlife sanctuary (Karnataka), and Sariska Tiger Reserve (Rajasthan).

It caters mainly to tourists and expatriates. Soi Cowboy contains one of the three largest groups of foreign-oriented bars in Bangkok, the other two being Patpong and Soi Nana Tai. Description Soi Cowboy is near Sukhumvit Road, between Sukhumvit Soi 21 (also called Soi Asoke) and Soi 23, within walking distance from the BTS Skytrain's Asok Station and the Bangkok MRT's Sukhumvit Station. The Pullman Bangkok Grande Sukhumvit Hotel is nearby. The go-go bars follow the pattern common in Thailand: alcoholic drinks are served and women in bikinis dance on a stage. There is topless or even nude dancing. History Soi Cowboy during the day, with Fanny's, Dollhouse and Midnite Bar visible on the left The first bar opened in Soi Cowboy in the early 1970s, but it was not until 1977 that a second bar opened on the street by T. G. \\"Cowboy\\" Edwards, a retired American airman. Edwards got his nickname because he often wore a cowboy hat and the soi was given its name in reference to him by longtime nightlife columnist Bernard Trink. The number of bars grew to 31 by the end of the century, all located on the ground floor. When Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was elected in 2001, his government instituted a \\"social order\\" campaign. As part of this, all bars, nightclubs and restaurants had to close by 02:00, later changed to 01:00 for all areas not officially designated as \\"entertainment zones\\". (Unlike Patpong, Soi Cowboy and Nana Plaza were not so designated). A mandatory midnight closing time was even discussed. Over the years this policy has eased, and some Soi Cowboy bars stay open as late as 02:00. At their entrance, all go-go bars carry government-mandated signs in Thai and English. The sign reads: > NO-ONE INSIDE > UNDER 20 YEARS > DRUG-FREE In popular culture In 2000, the Norwegian group Getaway People released a song called \\"Soi Cowboy\\" about the area. The American rock band Sun City Girls included a song called \\"Soi Cowboy\\" on their 1996 album 330,003 Crossdressers From Beyond The Rig Veda. In the albums booklet it is said to be based on a traditional melody. Actor Hugh Grant visited Soi Cowboy in December 2003, while shooting the movie Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. The Tilac Bar and several Soi Cowboy bar girls are seen in the film. The Sun wrote on 23 December 2003 that Grant was chased by bar girls and had to flee, though this apparently was untrue.Hugh Grant story Two 1-hour episodes of the British comedy/drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet were shot in Bangkok in the summer of 2004, partly in Soi Cowboy. In August 2006, scenes were shot in Soi Cowboy for the film Bangkok Dangerous. In December 2010, scenes for the film The Hangover Part 2 were also shot here, with one of the bars being temporarily renamed for the film.

It was formed in 2002 from part of the Kaes≈èng Directly-Governed City. On 10 February 2016, it was temporarily closed by the South Korean government and all staff recalled by the Park Geun-hye administration, although the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, has signalled his desire to \\"reopen and expand\\" the region. Its most notable feature is the Kaes≈èng industrial park, which operated from 2004 to 2016 as a collaborative economic development with South Korea (ROK). The park is located ten kilometres (six miles) north of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, an hour's drive from Seoul, with direct road and rail access to South Korea. The park allows South Korean companies to employ cheap labour that is educated, skilled, and fluent in Korean, whilst providing North Korea with an important source of foreign currency. , 123 South Korean companies were employing approximately 53,000 DPRK workers and 800 ROK staff. Their wages, totalling $90 million each year, had been paid directly to the North Korean government. At times of tension between North and South Korea, southern access to the Industrial Park has been restricted. On 3 April 2013, during the 2013 Korean crisis, North Korea blocked access to the region to all South Korean citizens. On 8 April 2013, the North Korean government removed all 53,000 North Korean workers from the Kaes≈èng industrial park, which effectively shut down all activities. On 15 August 2013, both countries agreed that the industrial park should be reopened. On 10 February 2016, the South Korean Ministry of Unification announced that the industrial park would be \\"temporarily\\" closed down and all staff recalled, partly in protest over continued North Korean provocations, including a satellite launch and a claimed hydrogen bomb test in January 2016. The next day, the North announced it was expelling all South Korean workers and said it will freeze all South Korean assets and equipment at the jointly run factory park. All 280 South Korean workers present at Kaes≈èng left hours after the announcement by the North. Kaesong Industrial Park Construction started in June 2003, and in August 2003 North and South Korea ratified four tax and accountancy agreements to support investment.

Retrieved 2008-01-18. =Initial phase= In the park's initial phase, 15 South Korean companies constructed manufacturing facilities. Three of the companies started operations by March 2005. First phase plans envisaged participation by 250 South Korean companies from 2006, employing 100,000 people by 2007. =The planned final phase= The park was expected to be complete in 2012, covering 65 km2 and employing 700,000 people. The plan also called for a supporting zone, roughly a third the size of the industrial zone, that was meant for life-quality operations. Specifically, this meant the creation of residential areas, hospitals, shopping centers, and even a proposed theme park to attract tourists. =Organization= The Kaesong Industrial Park is run by a South Korean committee that has a 50-year lease that began in 2004.

Accessed 17 April 2013 On 26 April 2013, South Korea decided to withdraw all remaining staff, and on 4 May, the last seven South Koreans left the Kaesong Industrial Region, which thus was completely shut down. On 4 July, both countries agreed in principle that the Kaesong Industrial Park should be reopened, as tensions between the two began to cool. Six rounds of talks were held without reaching a concrete agreement, with South Korea's insistence on a provision to prevent North Korea from closing the complex again in the future. During the first week of August, North Korea reiterated that reopening the complex was in both nations' interest. On 13 August South Korea said it would start distributing insurance payments to businesses in the complex, but also said it was open to new wording on the issue of joint control of Kaes≈èng. The move, seen as precursor to formally closing the region, sparked a seventh round of talks which South Korea label as \\"final\\". An official agreement to reopen the complex was reached and signed on 15 August. The agreement included provisions designed to ensure against a similar shutdown in the future. A joint committee was formed to determine if compensation will be provided for economic losses caused by the shutdown. On 13 September, before the reopening of Kaes≈èng Industrial region, the two governments held a subcommittee meeting to iron out additional issues regarding entrance, legal stay, communication, customs and passing. This also discussed the resumption of tourism in the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region. On 16 September, Kaes≈èng was reopened after five months. All of the 123 companies operating in Kaes≈èng experienced losses equaling a combined ¬£575 million ($944 million). = 2016 closure = On 10 February 2016, in response to a rocket launch by the DPRK, South Korea announced that it would, for the first time, halt operations in the region commenting on the launch to be a disguised ballistic missile test. Seoul said all operations at the complex would halt, to stop the North using its investment \\"to fund its nuclear and missile development\\". The next day, the North announced it was expelling all South Korean workers and said it would freeze all South Korean assets and equipment at the jointly run factory park. All 280 South Korean workers present at Kaes≈èng left hours after the announcement by the North. On Thursday, 11 February, a few minutes before midnight, the South announced it had shut off the supply of electricity and water into Kaesong that supplied the factory zone. In South Korean domestic politics, there were two opposing viewpoints toward the 2016 closure ‚Äì while the Saenuri Party argued for the closure, stating that it was one and the only means to end North Korea's provocation, two other parties, The Minjoo Party and the People's Party, objecting to Saenuri, asserted that more communication is needed and that the closure would only escalate tensions in the Korean peninsula. The Saenuri Party, the ruling party at the time, said during the announcement of Kaes≈èng Industrial Region's closure, \\"North Korea conducted the 4th nuclear test and rocket launch regardless of persistent warnings from the South Korean government and the international society. Communication and persuasion, or the 'carrots,' do not work anymore. We need more powerful sanctions on North Korea.\\" Some people agree with the Saenuri Party, arguing that South Korea should have a more threatening and uncompromising attitudes toward North Korea so that it cannot conduct such tests again. On the other hand, The Minjoo Party and People's Party, which were the opposition parties, counter-argued that North Korea has never stopped its provocation even during its Arduous March, or the North Korean famine, emphasizing that a simple closure would never bar North Korea from testing nuclear weapons and launching missiles. They also say that the Kaes≈èng Industrial Region was the last hope for peaceful resolution to everlasting tensions between the South and the North, but now that it is closed, South Korean citizens' fear over national defense will intensify. In December 2017, an expert panel investigating the decision to close the park found that there was no evidence that North Korea had diverted wages to fund its nuclear program. The head of the panel Kim Jong-soo said, \\"The presidential office inserted the wage-diversion argument as major grounds, yet without concrete information, sufficient evidence and consultations with related agencies, mainly citing defector testimonies that lack objectivity and credibility. This impairs the decision's legitimacy and could constrain our ground over a future restart of the complex, while hampering the companies' rights to protect their assets due to the hasty pullout process.\\" A group of businesses who suffered losses of 250 billion won ($200 million) due to the closure demanded an apology and said, \\"Now that the wage-diversion claim has proved groundless, the government must apologize for abusing state power to suspend the complex and make utmost efforts to reopen it.\\" =2018 opening of Inter Korean Liaison Office= On 14 September 2018, the Inter-Korean Liaison Office located in the region officially opened. The office's purpose was to further communication between the two Koreas. On June 16, 2020, North Korea destroyed the building via explosion, amidst heightened tensions between the countries. =Restoration of Water Supply= On 10 October 2018, South Korea resumed supplying water to the region. On 11 October 2018, the local water treatment plant had been restored. Transport There are two modes of travel to Kaes≈èng, road and rail. =Rail= Kaes≈èng Industrial Region is served by Korean State Railway from Panmun Station through the Pyongbu Line. There is rail access to South Korea (operated by Korail) via the Gyeongui Line but it is not known what restrictions apply. An agreement to re-establish rail freight services was made in November 2007. The closest station in South Korea is Dorasan Station, from which road access can be taken. =Road= Limited road access is available for workers from South Korea via South Korea National Route 1 to the DMZ and then into Kaes≈èng via Asian Highway 1 in the North. The route between the two highways is a paved road and part of the AH1 network. There are no connecting roads en route and a turnaround is available only in the South before entering the North. Access to the road is closed if there are restrictions from checkpoints upon entering the DMZ. =Air= There is no option of air travel available from Kaes≈èng to the South. Sohung South Airport is the closest airport to Kaes≈èng in the North, but it serves no South Korea-bound flights. The closest airports in the South are Gimpo International Airport and Incheon International Airport, from which road access can be taken to the industrial region.

The Dinitz theorem is that given an n √ó n square array, a set of m symbols with m ‚â• n, and for each cell of the array an n-element set drawn from the pool of m symbols, it is possible to choose a way of labeling each cell with one of those elements in such a way that no row or column repeats a symbol. It can also be formulated as a result in graph theory, that the list chromatic index of the complete bipartite graph K_{n, n} equals n. That is, if each edge of the complete bipartite graph is assigned a set of n colors, it is possible to choose one of the assigned colors for each edge such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color. Galvin's proof generalizes to the statement that, for every bipartite multigraph, the list chromatic index equals its chromatic index. The more general edge list coloring conjecture states that the same holds not only for bipartite graphs, but also for any loopless multigraph. An even more general conjecture states that the list chromatic number of claw-free graphs always equals their chromatic number. The Dinitz theorem is also related to Rota's basis conjecture.

It is 6 miles south west of Ely. While nominally an agricultural village, many of the inhabitants work in Cambridge, Ely or London. History Burystead Wilburton is a parish of around 800 acres lying on the important medieval route from Earith to Stretham, and extending south to the River Great Ouse. As much of the land in the region is fenland, the village's position on the ridge between Stretham and Haddenham at the southern end of the Isle of Ely was important in its growth and success. Listed as Wilburhtun in 970 and Wilbertone in the Domesday Book, the name \\"Wilburton\\" means \\"Farmstead or village of a woman called Wilburh\\". The village contains a number of old buildings, and was described in the 19th century as \\"very neat and contains some excellent houses\\".R. Gardner, Dir. Cambs. (1851), 510 These include the Burystead (the former manor house, built c.1600), one of the few surviving half-timbered houses in the region, and the Victoria Place row of cottages. For the last few hundred years, the Pell family were the prominent local landowners, sponsoring the Ely and St Ives Railway in the late 19th century. Wilburton railway station, built in 1866, has been open for goods trains only since 1931. Church The parish church, dedicated to St Peter consists of a chancel, north vestry and organ chamber, a nave, north chapel, south porch, and west tower. The chancel arch and tower date from the 13th century and the extensive rebuilding in the second half of the 15th century produced the chancel, vestry, nave, and porch. The organ chamber and north chapel were added in the late 19th century. The three-storey tower contains five bells, all dating from the 17th century. Village life Their village is home to an Elizabethan manor house, a shop, and a garden centre. There is one public house, The King's Head. There is also a hall called St Peter's Hall that is used for events by the local community, such as school plays, wedding receptions, and after-school clubs. Adjoining St Peter's Hall is a social club. The village holds a fireworks display around Guy Fawkes night and two annual beer festivals. Wilburton is home to two amateur football teams, Wilburton Blades and Wilburton Albion. Wilburton Fc was formed in 2006 by two local residents after both previous teams folded. The club grew into having a first and reserve team with having over 50 players associated to the club. The club ran for over 6 years turning from bottom of the table to competing for the league and winning several Invitational cups and trophies during its 6 year history. Well known local football player William Ludbrooke made a big impact for the club scoring over 80 competitive goals and winning several awards along the way within the associated leagues. After enjoying several successes, the team also played at Carrow Rd, Norwich on 3 occasions and at MK Dons. In 2012 the club chairman and manager retied with the reserve manager leaving shortly after. Most of the first team players then moved over to Stretham with the club then coming to an end. However, opening in September 2018, Wilburton Football Academy will offer training to children aged 4 to 6 to take part in matches with other teams from the county. It will be located at the main recreational ground.

The very popular column helped the Mirrors readership to grow to the highest in its history during the 1950s. His columns were simply written, in keeping with his working class readership, and comprised slices of human life, including famous people, events and later a personal diary of his everyday life and thoughts ‚Äì though at times he could be controversial. He worked alongside cartoonist Philip Zec at the Daily Mirror and the pair courted controversy in 1942 with an illustration, captioned by Connor, which Winston Churchill and others perceived as an attack on government.Cassandra: Reflections in a Mirror by Robert Connor, Cassell (1969) Churchill complained to Cecil King, then a director of the company, of a writer (Connor) being \\"dominated by malevolence\\". Connor forgave Churchill though, and later wrote a moving obituary of the wartime Prime Minister (\\"Sword in the Scabbard,\\" 25 January 1965) and attended his funeral service at St. Paul's Cathedral.

Subjects ranged from the time he received wrong number calls intended for the local railway parcels service, to the mysterious person who sent him a fresh goose egg once a year. Connor was knighted in 1966. His final column ended with the words \\"Normal service in this column is temporarily interrupted while I learn to do what any babe can do with ease and what comes naturally to most men of good conscience ‚Äì to sleep easily o' nights.\\" He died aged 57 in hospital a month after fracturing his skull in a fall.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PO4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=058FAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6982%2C1359093 Since his death the column Cassandra in The Daily Mirror has continued to be sporadically published.

In Norse mythology, the Sons of Ivaldi are a group of dwarfs who fashion Skidbladnir, the ship of Freyr, and the Gungnir, the spear of Odin, as well as golden hair for Sif to replace what Loki had cut off. According to Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, after these objects were created Loki made a bet with a dwarf, Brokkr, that his brother Eitri (or Sindri) would not be able to craft items to match the quality of those displayed by the sons of Ivaldi. This contest resulted in the creation of the boar of Freyr (Gullinbursti), the ring of Odin (Draupnir) and the hammer of Thor (Mjolnir), which were judged by the gods to be even more wondrous than the others. Thus, Brokkr had won the bet. The account of this tale given in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l does not reveal the names of Ivaldi's sons, nor how many there were, and they remain conspicuously absent after their initial mention in the stanza. The passing mention made of them in Gr√≠mnism√°l 43, the creators of Skidbladnir, \\"the best of ships\\", likewise sheds no additional light. Thus, their identities are a matter of scholarly speculation. In the eddic poem Hrafnagaldur √ì√∞ins, stanza 6, Idunn is identified as an \\"elf\\" (alfar) and the \\"youngest of the elder children of Ivaldi\\". This implies that Ivaldi had two sets of children, probably by different mothers. Thus Idunn is a sister of the famous smiths, the Sons of Ivaldi. In the Old Norse sources, the giant √ûjazi is said to be the son of All-valdi [Harbardslj√≥d 19] or √ñl- valdi [Skaldskaparmal 42]. I-valdi may be another form of the name. √ûjazi is said to have two brothers, I√∞i and Gangr, or Idi and Egil. Thus, Gang is another name for Egil. Egil is also found as a companion of Thor and keeps his goats safe when he ventures into the land of the giants.

He helped found the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and was the first secretary-general of the OAU between 1964 and 1972. After serving as Minister of Justice in Guinea for four years he was executed by starvation by the regime of Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© at Camp Boiro in 1977. Early career Diallo Telli was born in 1925 in Por√©daka, Guinea. He was of Fulani origin. He studied at √âcole normale sup√©rieure William Ponty.Retour √† William-Ponty He studied for his baccalaur√©at at Dakar, and then went to the √âcole Nationale de la France d'Outre-Mer, in Paris, France. In 1951 he received his Licence en Droit, and in 1954 his Doctorate in Law. That year he was appointed Deputy of the Procureur (District Attorney) of the Republic at the Court of Thi√®s in Senegal. He was then appointed to the court in Cotonou, Benin (then Dahomey). In 1955, he became head of the Office of High Commissioner of French West Africa (AOF) in Dakar, which was the highest position held by an African in the French colonial period. He became Secretary General of the AOF in April 1957 and remained in that post for eighteen months. Diplomatic career After the referendum of 28 September 1958, in which Guinea chose independence from French West Africa, Telli was sent to the United States as Permanent Representative of Guinea at the United Nations. He held that position until June 1964 with a break between June 1960 and March 1961. He was also Ambassador to the United States from April 1959 to June 1961. When the Organization of African Unity was established in Addis Ababa, Telli was appointed the first Secretary General, holding that office for two terms from July 1964 until June 1972. The job was extremely challenging for him, as he expressed it involved negotiating a common viewpoint among the many leaders of African states, each of whom had divergent opinions. In an article published in the Fall of 1965, Telli acknowledged the difficulties and disputes but asserted that the organization had a flexible enough structure to deal with these problems, and asked what would have happened if there had been no OAU. At times Telli was criticized for his outspokenness. Some criticized him for pushing S√©kou Tour√©'s views too strongly. In July 1968 it was reported that he was unlikely to be appointed for a second term since he had not shown neutrality. A report on the OAU summit in Algiers in September 1968 covered Telli's position on the Nigerian Civil War. Although the members generally supported Federal Nigeria, some countries such as Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Zambia and Gabon recognized Biafra. Overall, Telli was a strong and respected spokesman for the OAU. Minister of Justice In June 1972, Telli was succeeded by Nzo Ekangaki of Cameroon as OAU Secretary-General. Telli returned to Guinea and was appointed Minister of Justice on 21 August 1972. His decision to return to Guinea was puzzling. He had many other offers from African heads of state and international organizations. He would also be in danger. Some people in Guinea even thought that S√©kou Tour√© had used occult means to lure him back. According to Andre Lewin, Tour√©'s biographer, Telli was the only person who could potentially challenge Tour√© in his Presidency. Therefore, Tour√© felt a special need to destroy him. As Minister of Justice, at a conference at the University of Conakry, he stated that justice was the key that opened all doors, and urged students to pursue legal studies. However, Telli obeyed party directives and was the author of the law of June 1973 that removed all independence from the judiciary, creating people's courts at the village and neighborhood levels. His technical counselor at the time said that Telli was \\"naive, very nervous, often super-exited, very careless in his words and actions, full of candor and disordered in his work.\\" After the reconciliation between France and Guinea in July 1975, S√©kou Tour√© suggested, at a meal celebrating the occasion, that Telli could be a suitable candidate to be Secretary-General of the United Nations. Death On 18 July 1976, Diallo Telli was arrested at his home and imprisoned at Camp Boiro. Mamadi Ke√Øta, the President's brother-in-law, was head of the commission of inquiry that condemned Telli. Telli was accused of leading a plot by Fulanis against the state of Guinea. He was subjected to intense interrogations, torture and an inadequate diet. After the second torture session, Telli was shattered and agreed to sign a \\"confession\\" of his treason. This was an incoherent document even after editing by the tribunal. In February 1977 five prominent prisoners were killed through the \\"black diet\\" (no food or water): Diallo Telli, ex-ministers Barry Alpha Oumar and Dram√© Alioune, and army officers Diallo Alhassana and Kouyate Lamin√©. The OAU did not react to the death of its former Secretary General. However, the disappearance of Telli, a widely respected international diplomat known for his dignity and good nature, did contribute to growing international awareness of the abuses of the Tour√© regime.

According to the Mayflower passenger list, just over a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Other passengers were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618.Donald F. Harris, PhD., The Mayflower Descendant (July 1994) vol. 44 no. 2 p. 111 Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council.R.C. Johnson, The Transportation of Vagrant Children from London to Virginia, 1618‚Äì1622, in H.S. Reinmuth (Ed.), Early Stuart Studies: Essays in Honor of David Harris Willson, Minneapolis, 1970.The Mayflower Descendant (July 2, 1994) vol. 44 no. 2 pp. 110, 111 For instance it was proven that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate.Donald F. Harris, The Mayflower Descendants vol 43 (July 1993), vol. 44 (July 1994). Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, but Richard lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (St. Martins Press, New York, 2002) Introduction The passengers mostly slept and lived in the low-ceilinged great cabins and on the main deck, which was 75 by 20 feet large (23 m √ó 6 m) at most. The cabins were thin-walled and extremely cramped, and the total area was 25 ft by 15 ft (7.6 m √ó 4.5 m) at its largest. Below decks, any person over five feet (150 cm) tall would be unable to stand up straight. The maximum possible space for each person would have been slightly less than the size of a standard single bed.Caffrey, Kate. The Mayflower. New York: Stein and Day, 1974 Passengers would pass the time by reading by candlelight or playing cards and games such as nine men's morris.Hodgson, Godfrey. A Great and Godly Adventure. Public Affairs: New York, 2006 Meals on board were cooked by the firebox, which was an iron tray with sand in it on which a fire was built. This was risky because it was kept in the waist of the ship. Passengers made their own meals from rations that were issued daily and food was cooked for a group at a time. Upon arrival in America, the harsh climate and scarcity of fresh food were exacerbated by the shortness of provisions due to the delay in departure. Living in these extremely close and crowded quarters, several passengers developed scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. At the time the use of lemons or limes to counter this disease was unknown, and the usual dietary sources of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables had been depleted, since these fresh foods could not be stored for long periods without their becoming rotten. Passengers who developed scurvy experienced symptoms such as bleeding gums, teeth falling out, and stinking breath. Passengers consumed large amounts of alcohol such as beer with meals. This was known to be safer than water, which often came from polluted sources causing diseases. All food and drink was stored in barrels known as \\"hogsheads\\". The passenger William Mullins brought 126 pairs of shoes and 13 pairs of boots in his luggage. Other items included oiled leather and canvas suits, stuff gowns and leather and stuff breeches, shirts, jerkins, doublets, neckcloths, hats and caps, hose, stockings, belts, piece goods, and haberdashery. At his death, his estate consisted of extensive footwear and other items of clothing, and made his daughter Priscilla and her husband John Alden quite prosperous.Charles Edward Banks, The English ancestry and homes of the Pilgrim Fathers who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, 2006), pp. 73‚Äì74 No cattle or beasts of draft or burden were brought on the journey, but there were pigs, goats, and poultry. Some passengers brought family pets such as cats and birds. Peter Browne took his large bitch mastiff, and John Goodman brought along his spaniel.  Mayflower officers and crew  According to author Charles Edward Banks, the Mayflower had 14 officers consisting of the master, four mates, four quartermasters, surgeon, carpenter, cooper, cook, boatswain, and gunner, plus about 36 men before the mast for a total of 50. More recent authors estimate a crew of about 30. The entire crew stayed with the Mayflower in Plymouth through the winter of 1620‚Äì21, and about half of them died. The surviving crew returned to London on the Mayflower on April 5, 1621.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore, MD: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 18‚Äì19Caleb H.

Nathaniel Philbrick estimates between 20 and 30 sailors in her crew whose names are unknown. Nick Bunker states that Mayflower had a crew of at least 17 and possibly as many as 30. Caleb Johnson states that the ship carried a crew of about 30 men, but the exact number is unknown.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who Came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and \\"Little James\\" in 1623,(orig. pub: 1929 reprint: 2006 by Genealogical Publishing Co.), pp. 18‚Äì19Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community and War, (Penguin Books 2006)Bunker, Nick.

About age 50, of Harwich, a seaport in Essex, England, which was also the port of his ship Mayflower. He and his ship were veterans of the European cargo business, often carrying wine to England, but neither had ever crossed the Atlantic. By June 1620, he and Mayflower had been hired for the Pilgrims voyage by their business agents in London, Thomas Weston of the Merchant Adventurers and Robert Cushman.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 19‚Äì20 Historical marker in London honoring Mayflower and Captain Jones Plymouth Rock, which commemorates the landing of Mayflower in 1620 * Masters Mate: John Clark (Clarke), Pilot. By age 45 in 1620, Clark already had greater adventures than most other mariners of that dangerous era. His piloting career began in England about 1609. In early 1611, he was pilot of a 300-ton ship on his first New World voyage, with a three-ship convoy sailing from London to the new settlement of Jamestown in Virginia. Two other ships were in that convoy, and the three ships brought 300 new settlers to Jamestown, going first to the Caribbean islands of Dominica and Nevis. While in Jamestown, Clark piloted ships in the area carrying various stores. During that time, he was taken prisoner in a confrontation with the Spanish; he was taken to Havana and held for two years, then transferred to Spain where he was in custody for five years. In 1616, he was finally freed in a prisoner exchange with England. In 1618, he was back in Jamestown as pilot of the ship Falcon. Shortly after his return to England, he was hired as pilot for Mayflower in 1620.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) p. 19 * Masters Mate: Robert Coppin, Pilot. Coppin had prior New World experience; he previously hunted whales in Newfoundland and sailed the coast of New England. He was an early investor in the Virginia Company, being named in the Second Virginia Charter of 1609. He was possibly from Harwich in Essex, the hometown of Captain Jones. * Masters Mate: Andrew Williamson * Masters Mate: John Parker * Surgeon: Doctor Giles Heale. The surgeon on board Mayflower was never mentioned by Bradford, but his identity was well established. He was essential in providing comfort to all who died or were made ill that first winter. He was a young man from Drury Lane in the parish of St. Giles in the Field, London who had completed his apprenticeship with the Barber-Surgeons in the previous year. On February 21, 1621, he was a witness to the death-bed will of William Mullins. He survived the first winter and returned to London on Mayflower in April 1621, where he began his medical practice and worked as a surgeon until his death in 1653.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 7‚Äì8, 19 * Cooper: John Alden. Alden was a 21-year-old from Harwich in Essex and a distant relative of Captain Jones. He hired on apparently while Mayflower was anchored at Southampton Waters. He was responsible for maintaining the ship's barrels, known as hogsheads, which were critical to the passengers' survival and held the only source of food and drink while at sea; tending them was a job which required a crew member's attention. Bradford noted that Alden was \\"left to his own liking to go or stay\\" in Plymouth rather than return with the ship to England. He decided to remain.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the \\"Mayflower\\" in 1620, the \\"Fortune\\" in 1621, and the \\"Anne\\" and the \\"Little James\\" in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.:Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 7, 19. 27‚Äì28 * Quartermaster: (names unknown), 4 men. These men were in charge of maintaining the ship's cargo hold, as well as the crew's hours for standing watch. Some of the ‚Äúbefore the mast\\" crewmen may also have been in this section. These quartermasters were also responsible for fishing and maintaining all fishing supplies and harpoons. The names of the quartermasters are unknown, but it is known that three of the four men died the first winter. * Cook: (Gorge Hurst). He was responsible for preparing the crew's meals and maintaining all food supplies and the cook room, which was typically located in the ship's forecastle (front end). The unnamed cook died the first winter. * Master Gunner: (name unknown). He was in charge of the ship's guns, ammunition, and powder. Some of those \\"before the mast\\" were likely in his charge. He is recorded as going on an exploration on December 6, 1620, and was \\"sick unto death and so remained all that day, and the next night\\". He died later that winter. * Boatswain: (name unknown). He was the person in charge of the ship's rigging and sails, the anchors, and the ship's longboat. The majority of the crew members \\"before the mast\\" were most likely under his supervision, working the sails and rigging. The operation of the ship's shallop was also probably under his control, a light open boat with oars or sails (see seaman Thomas English). William Bradford made this comment about the boatswain: \\"the boatswain... was a proud young man, who would often curse and scoff at the passengers, but when he grew weak they had compassion on him and helped him.\\" But despite such assistance, the unnamed boatswain died the first winter. * Carpenter: (name unknown). He was responsible for making sure that the hull was well-caulked and the masts were in good order. He was the person responsible for maintaining all areas of the ship in good condition and being a general repairman. He also maintained the tools and all necessary items to perform his carpentry tasks. His name is unknown, but his tasks were quite important to the safety and seaworthiness of the ship. * Swabber: (various crewmen). This was the lowliest position on the ship, responsible for cleaning (swabbing) the decks. The swabber usually had an assistant who was responsible for cleaning the ship's beakhead (extreme front end), which was also the crew's toilet.In the tradition of the sea, each Monday a crew member was appointed the \\"liar\\" or swabber assistant. This person was the first person caught telling a lie the previous week, and the crew would harass him around the main mast with calls of \\"liar, liar.\\" =Known Mayflower seamen= * John Allerton: A Mayflower seaman who was hired by the company as labor to help in the Colony during the first year, then to return to Leiden to help other church members seeking to travel to America. He signed the Mayflower Compact.

One reason for his hiring was his prior New World experience. He was one of those seamen to crew the shallop used in coastal trading. He returned to England with _____ Ely and others on the Fortune in December 1621. In 1623, Robert Cushman noted that Trevor reported to the Adventurers about what he saw in the New World.

In Mourt's Relation, Edward Winslow writes that a female English Mastiff and a small English Springer Spaniel came ashore on the first explorations of Provincetown. The ship was probably also carrying small domestic animals such as goats, pigs, and chickens. Larger domestic animals came later, such as cows and sheep.

Temin's parents raised their family to have values associated with social justice and independent thinking, which was evident throughout his life. For Temin's bar mitzvah, the family donated money that would have been spent on the party, to a local camp for displaced persons. Temin was also the valedictorian of his class and he devoted his speech to relevant issues at the time including the recent hydrogen bomb activity and the news of sending a man to the moon. Temin received his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College in 1955 majoring and minoring in biology in the honors program. He received his doctorate degree in animal virology from the California Institute of Technology in 1959. Career and research Temin's first exposure to experimental science was during his time at the California Institute of Technology as a graduate student in laboratory of Professor Renato Dulbecco. Temin originally studied embryology at Caltech, but after about a year and a half, he switched to animal virology. He became interested Dulbecco's lab after a chance run-in with Harry Rubin, a postdoctoral fellow in Dulbecco's lab. In the lab, Temin studied the Rous sarcoma virus, a tumor-causing virus that infects chickens. During his research on the virus, he observed that mutations in the virus yielded alterations in the structural characteristics of the infected cell ‚Äì thus, integration into the cell's genome was occurring. As part of his doctoral thesis, Temin stated that the Rous Sarcoma Virus has \\"some kind of close relationship with the genome of the infected cell\\". Following receiving his doctorate, Temin continued to work in Dulbecco's lab as a postdoctoral fellow. In 1960, the McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison recruited Temin as a virologist; a position that had been hard to fill because, at the time, virology was not considered pertinent to cancer research. Even though Temin knew he would be completely independent in Madison, because of the lack of research involving virology and oncology together, Temin stated that he was \\"supremely self- confident\\". When he first arrived in Madison in 1960, he found an unprepared laboratory in the basement of a rundown building with an office that could be considered a closet. Until a more suitable laboratory could be prepared, he continued his research with RSV at a friend's laboratory at the University of Illinois. Later that year, he returned to Madison, continued his RSV research in his own lab, and began his position as an assistant professor. While studying the Rous sarcoma virus at UW-Madison, Temin began to refer to the genetic material that the virus introduced to the cells, the \\"provirus\\". Using the antibiotic, actinomycin D, which inhibits the expression of DNA, he determined that the provirus was DNA or was located on the cell's DNA. These results implied that the infecting Rous sarcoma virus was somehow generating complementary double-stranded DNA. Temin's description of how tumor viruses act on the genetic material of the cell through reverse transcription was revolutionary. This upset the widely held belief at the time of a popularized version of the \\"Central Dogma\\" of molecular biology posited by Nobel laureate Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA (along with James Watson and Rosalind Franklin). Crick had claimed only that sequence information cannot flow out of protein into DNA or RNA, but he was commonly interpreted as saying that information flows exclusively from DNA to RNA to protein. Many highly respected scientists disregarded his work and declared it impossible. Despite the lack of support from the scientific community, Temin continued to search for evidence to support his idea. In 1969, Temin and a postdoctoral fellow, Satoshi Mizutani, began searching for the enzyme that was responsible for the phenomenon of viral RNA being transferred into proviral DNA. Later that year, Temin showed that certain tumor viruses carried the enzymatic ability to reverse the flow of information from RNA back to DNA using reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase was also independently and simultaneously discovered in association with the murine leukemia virus by David Baltimore at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1975, Baltimore and Temin shared the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine. Both scientists completed their initial work with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase with the Rous sarcoma virus. The discovery of reverse transcriptase is one of the most important of the modern era of medicine, as reverse transcriptase is the central enzyme in several widespread viral diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis B. Reverse transcriptase is also an important component of several important techniques in molecular biology, such as the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and diagnostic medicine. =Awards and honors= In 1992 Temin received the National Medal of Science. Temin was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1988. Following winning the Nobel Prize, Temin focused his research mainly on studying the viral sequences that control the packaging of viral RNA, developing a new vaccine for HIV, and studying the mechanisms of retroviral variation. Life and career post-Nobel Prize After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1975, Temin went from a rebel in the scientific community to a highly respected researcher. Temin began receiving international recognition for his work, and used his newly acquired fame to improve the world. An example of this was in October 1976; Temin helped scientists in the Soviet Union that were targeted by the KGB, the secret police in the Soviet Union. The Jewish Soviet scientists had been stripped of their jobs and oppressed after requesting visas to emigrate to Israel. Temin made it his mission to personally visit the scientists and their families. He gave them gifts that could be resold to help them financially, and he gave the scientists copies of scientific journals, which had been banned by the KGB.\\"Temin loses his audience to KGB.\\" The Capital Times. December 16, 1976. Howard Temin Papers, Archives, Steenbock Library, University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison. On one occasion, Howard Temin gave a lecture to some of the Jewish Soviet scientists in someone's home. The next morning, almost all of scientists that had attended the lecture were arrested. After they were released, Temin tape-recorded one of the scientist's account of the event and gave the tape to newspapers in the United States so that the situation that Jewish scientists were facing would be publicized. Another example of Temin trying to improve the world was at the Nobel Prize reception. After receiving the Nobel Prize from King Carl Gustav of Sweden; Temin addressed the smokers in the audience, which included the Queen of Denmark, saying he was \\"outraged that one major measure available to prevent much cancer, namely the cessation of smoking, had not been more widely adopted\\". He had also insisted that the ashtray located on the laureates' table be removed. After winning the Nobel Prize, Temin also became more active in the scientific community outside of research. He was involved in over 14 scientific journals. In 1979, he became an advisory member for the director of the National Institute of Health (NIH) and a member of the human gene therapy subgroup of the recombinant DNA advisory committee. He was also a member of the National Cancer Advisory Board, and the chairman of the AIDS subcommittee. At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), he was the chairman of a genetic variation advisory panel on the development of AIDS, and was a member of vaccine advisory board. In the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), he was a member of the Waksman Award committee and report review committee. In 1986, Temin became a member of the Institute of Medicine (IOM)/NAS committee for national strategy for public policy issues associated with AIDS. The last committee Temin served on was the World Health Organization Advisory Council. In 1981, Temin became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Death and legacy Temin taught and conducted research at UW-Madison until he died of lung cancer (despite being a non-smoker), on February 9, 1994. He was survived by his wife Rayla, a geneticist at UW-Madison, two daughters, and two brothers, Peter Temin, also an academic, and Michael Temin, a lawyer. A walking path along Lake Mendota at UW‚ÄìMadison was renamed in Temin's honor in 1998. The Howard M. Temin Path, also known as the Lakeshore Path, is a 1.6-mile path that extends from the limnology building near Memorial Union to Picnic Point. The path is used frequently by university students, faculty, and other residents of Madison. At the dedication ceremony, James Crow, a UW- Madison professor, said, \\"Howard loved to walk and bicycle along this path, and it is most fitting that it be dedicated to his memory.\\"Carlson, Tom. \\"Lakeshore path renamed to honor prof.\\" Badger Herald.

Vladimir Periƒá (; 28 December 1919 ‚Äì 5/6 April 1945), best known by the nom de guerre Valter, was a Yugoslav Partisan commander in German-occupied Sarajevo during World War II. Born in the Serbian town of Prijepolje, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in 1940. The following year, he joined the Partisans and was appointed deputy political commissar of a Partisan unit in eastern Bosnia in 1942. In 1943, Periƒá became secretary of the Sarajevo committee of the KPJ and took charge of anti-sabotage actions in the city in early 1945. While visiting a tobacco factory at midnight on 5‚Äì6 April, Periƒá was killed after a German soldier hurled a hand grenade at him. His death made him one of the last Sarajevans killed in World War II. Early life Vladimir Periƒá was born in the town of Prijepolje on 28 December 1919. He graduated from a trade school in his hometown and moved to Belgrade to attend business school. His school years were characterized by constant poverty and he struggled to find work to pay for his education. From 1938 to 1940, Periƒá worked at the Mortgage Bank () in Belgrade. In 1940, he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (; KPJ). Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to the bank's Sarajevo branch. World War II alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941‚Äì43 On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. After the invasion, Yugoslavia was dismembered, with the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Paveliƒá, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini's Italy, being appointed Poglavnik (leader) of an Usta≈°e-led Croatian state ‚Äì the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an \\"Italian-German quasi-protectorate.\\" NDH authorities, led by the Usta≈°e militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state. As a result, two resistance movements emerged ‚Äì the royalist and Serb Chetniks, led by Colonel Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, and the multi- ethnic, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito. Periƒá was only twenty-one years old when the war began. Having become a member of the KPJ before the war, he immediately joined the Partisans. In the spring of 1941, he and other members of the KPJ participated in planning underground resistance operations. Later that year, he and other members of the party appealed for wealthy citizens of Sarajevo to provide food and money to the city's beleaguered Jewish community. As the war progressed, Periƒá came to be known by the codename Valter. In 1942, Periƒá participated in actions against German forces in Zenica. That year, he was appointed deputy political commissar of a Partisan unit in eastern Bosnia, holding that position until the following year, when he participated in Partisan actions against German troops in the city of Tuzla. That year, regional leaders named him secretary of the Sarajevo committee of the KPJ, giving him the task of reconstituting the party's organization in the city. Periƒá responded by encouraging the Partisans to recruit in urban areas and reconstructed the KPJ to increase its support for the Partisans by providing further personnel, supplies and intelligence. In June 1944, Periƒá took on the role of directing the formation, training and deployment of Partisan strike groups (known as \\"fivesomes\\", or Petorke) operating in Sarajevo and its outskirts. =Death= Plaque in Sarajevo dedicated to Periƒá. The liberation of Sarajevo was organized by a powerful network of underground anti-German movements led by Periƒá. By early 1945 the Partisans engaged in a campaign against German saboteurs, with Periƒá being personally responsible for anti-sabotage actions in Sarajevo. In early April, he visited the city's main post office and electrical generating plant to ensure that they had not been sabotaged by withdrawing German forces. While visiting a tobacco factory at midnight on 5‚Äì6 April, Periƒá was killed after a German soldier hurtled a hand grenade at him. Periƒá's death made him one of the last Sarajevans killed in World War II. At around the same time as his death, most German soldiers in Sarajevo had either left the city or were captured by the Partisans. On 9 April the KPJ formed a new local committee in Sarajevo, appointing new members to take the places left behind by Periƒá and other operatives killed while fighting the Germans in the previous week. On April 9 Periƒá was buried in mass funeral for all the Partisans and Communist operatives killed in operations for the city liberation previous couple of days. Commemoration lasted for two whole days, continuing on April 10, one in honor of Valter attracted more than 15 thousand people. Legacy The Partisan film Walter Defends Sarajevo (), released in 1972, is a fictionalized portrayal of Periƒá's activities during World War II which ends with a statement in favour of unity when a SS officer realizes at the end of the movie that he was fighting not just a single partisan but an entire city (\\"You see that city? That's Walter!\\"). In 1992, anti-nationalist and anti-war demonstrators in Sarajevo evoked Periƒá's memory as a sign of inter-ethnic tolerance prior to the outbreak of the Bosnian War; demonstrators bore stickers that read \\"I am Walter\\" and one anti-war movement was even named after Periƒá. In the Bosnian hit television comedy series Konak kod Hilmije, Periƒá was portrayed in a comedic way by Serbian actor Bojan Periƒá.

Gerald had a brief but significant career as a painter. Gerald Murphy Gerald Clery Murphy (March 26, 1888 - October 17, 1964) was born in Boston to the family that owned the Mark Cross Company, sellers of fine leather goods. He was of an Irish American background. His father was Patrick Francis Murphy (1858-1931); he had 2 siblings, Esther Knesborough (1897-1962) and Patrick Timothy Murphy (1884-1924). Gerald Murphy, Genevieve Carpenter, Cole Porter and Sara Murphy in Venice, 1923 Gerald was an aesthete from his childhood. He was never comfortable in the boardrooms and clubs for which his father was grooming him. He failed the entrance exams at Yale three times before matriculating, although he performed respectably there. He joined DKE and the Skull and Bones society. He befriended a young freshman named Cole Porter (Yale class of 1913) and brought him into DKE. Murphy also introduced Porter to his friends, propelling him into writing music for Yale musicals. Sara Sherman Wiborg Sara Murphy wearing pearls at Cap d‚ÄôAntibes beach, 1923 Sara Sherman Wiborg (November 7, 1883 ‚Äì October 10, 1975) was born in Cincinnati, Ohio into the wealthy Wiborg family. Her father, manufacturing chemist and owner of his own printing ink and varnish company Frank Bestow Wiborg, was a self-made millionaire by the age of 40, and her mother was a member of the noted Sherman family, daughter of Hoyt Sherman and niece to Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman. Raised in Cincinnati, her family moved to Germany for several years when she was a teenager, so her father could concentrate on the European expansion of his company. The Wiborg family was easily accepted into the high society community of 20th-century Europe. While in Europe, Sara and her sisters Hoytie and Olga sang together at high-class assemblies. Upon returning to the United States, the Wiborgs spent most of their time in New York City, and later East Hampton, where they built the 30-room mansion \\"The Dunes\\" on 600 acres just west of the Maidstone Club in 1912. It was the largest estate in East Hampton up to that time. Wiborg Beach in East Hampton is named for the family.http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/General- Interest-EH/441893/LVIS-To-Unveil-Treasures-From-The-Dunes-At-Annual-Luncheon Marriage In East Hampton Sara Wiborg and Gerald Murphy met when they were both adolescents. Gerald was five years younger than Sara, and for many years they were more familiar companions than romantically attached; they became engaged in 1915, when Sara was 32 years old. Sara's parents did not approve of their daughter marrying someone \\"in trade,\\" and Gerald's parents were not much happier with the prospect, seemingly because his father found it difficult to approve anything that Gerald did.Allen, Brooke, \\"What a Swell Party It Was\\", New York Times, May 24, 1998 After marrying they lived at 50 West 11th Street in New York City, where they had three children. In 1921 they moved to Paris to escape the strictures of New York and their families' mutual dissatisfaction with their marriage. In Paris Gerald took up painting, and they began to make the acquaintances for which they became famous. Eventually they moved to the French Riviera, where they became the center of a large circle of artists and writers of later fame, especially Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Fernand L√©ger, Jean Cocteau, Pablo Picasso, Archibald MacLeish, John O'Hara, Cole Porter, Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley. Prior to their arrival on the French Riviera, the region was experiencing a period when the fashionable only wintered there, abandoning the region during the high summer months. However, the activities of the Murphys fueled the same renaissance in arts and letters as did the excitement of Paris, especially among the caf√©s of Montparnasse. In 1923 the Murphys convinced the Hotel du Cap to stay open for the summer so that they might entertain their friends, sparking a new era for the French Riviera as a summer haven. The Murphys eventually purchased a villa in Cap d'Antibes and named it Villa America, where they resided for many years. When the Murphys arrived on the Riviera, lying on the beach merely to enjoy the sun was not a common activity. Occasionally, someone went swimming, but the joys of being at the beach just for sun were still unknown at the time. The Murphys, with their long forays and picnics at La Garoupe, introduced sunbathing on the beach as a fashionable activity. They had three children, Baoth, Patrick, and Honoria. In 1929, Patrick was diagnosed with tuberculosis. They took him to Switzerland, and then returned to the U.S. in 1934, where Gerald stayed in Manhattan to run Mark Cross, serving as president of the company from 1934 to 1956; he never painted again.(Believe Murphy returned to the U.S. as Mark Cross was hard-hit by the Depression. Wasn't he instrumental in reversing the company's slide?) Sara settled in Saranac Lake, New York to nurse Patrick, and Baoth and Honoria were put in boarding schools. In 1935, Baoth died unexpectedly of meningitis as a complication of measles, and Patrick succumbed to TB in 1937.Taylor, Robert, America's Magic Mountain, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986. Archibald MacLeish based the main characters in his play J.B. on Gerald and Sara Murphy. Later they lived at The Dunes. By 1941, the house proved impossible to rent, sell or even maintain; the Murphys had it demolished, and they moved to the renovated dairy barn.Goodman, Wendy, \\"A South Fork Story\\", New York Magazine, July 12, 2006 Death and legacy Gerald died October 17, 1964 in East Hampton, two days after his friend Cole Porter. Sara died on October 10, 1975 in Arlington, Virginia. Nicole and Dick Diver of Tender Is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald are widely recognized as having been based on the Murphys, mainly from the marked physical similarities, although many of their friends, as well as the Murphys themselves, saw as much or more of Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald's relationship and personalities in the couple than those of the Murphys. Ernest Hemingway's couple in The Garden of Eden is not explicitly based on this pair, but given the similarities of the setting (Nice) and of the type of social group portrayed, there is clearly some basis for such an assumption. Guests of the Murphys often swam at Eden Roc, an event emulated in Hemingway's narrative. Calvin Tomkins's biography of Gerald and Sara Murphy Living Well Is the Best Revenge was published in The New Yorker in 1962, and Amanda Vaill documented their lives in the 1995 book Everybody Was So Young. Both accounts are balanced, unlike some of the portrayals in the memoirs and fictitious works by their friends, including Fitzgerald and Hemingway. In 1982, Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the Murphys' daughter, with Richard N. Billings, wrote Sara & Gerald: Villa America and After. On July 12, 2007, a play by Crispin Whittell entitled Villa America, based entirely on the relationships between Sara and Gerald Murphy and their friends, had its world premiere at the Williamstown Theatre Festival with Jennifer Mudge playing Sara Murphy. =Paintings by Gerald Murphy= Gerald only painted from 1921 until 1929; he is known for his hard-edged still life paintings in a Precisionist, Cubist style. During the 1920s Gerald Murphy, along with other American modernist painters in Europe, notably Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis, created paintings prefiguring the pop art movement that contained pop culture imagery, such as mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design.New Yorker article, accessed online August 28, 2007Wayne Craven, American Art: History and Culture, p.464.accessed online August 28, 2007 *Wasp and Pear, 1929 *Cocktail, 1927 *Watch, 1925 *Razor, 1924 Gerald Murphy‚Äôs jazz-rhythmed painting entitled Razor (1924) and the 6-by-6-foot Watch (1925) are part of the Dallas Museum‚Äôs permanent collection and are two of eight remaining paintings in Murphy‚Äôs 14-work oeuvre.An American Painter in Paris: Gerald Murphy.

He was the youngest son of George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen and his second wife, Harriet Douglas. His mother was the widow of Viscount Hamilton. Gordon was educated privately and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1849. After graduating in 1851, he worked as Assistant Private Secretary to the British Prime Minister (his father) between 1852 and 1855, and was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Beverley from 1854 to 1857. In 1875, the Fiji Islands were created a separate Colony, and Sir Arthur Gordon was appointed the first Governor and Commander- in-Chief of Fiji, until 1880. In connection with this he also received the appointment of Consul-General, and High Commissioner of the Western Pacific, but that gave little additional power. He held a number of colonial governorships: * Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, 1861‚Äì1866, securing New Brunswick's assent to Canadian Confederation * Governor of Trinidad, 1866‚Äì1870. * 11th Governor of Mauritius, 21 February 1871 ‚Äì 18 August 1874 * Governor of Fiji from 1875 to 1880.Paul Knaplund, \\"Sir Arthur Gordon and Fiji: Some Gordon-Gladstone Letters.\\" Historical Studies: Australia and New Zealand 8#31 (1958) pp 281‚Äì296. * Governor of New Zealand, 29 November 1880 ‚Äì 24 June 1882 * Governor of Ceylon, 1883‚Äì1890.

He also produced versions in print form.Bischoff, Ulrich, Edvard Munch: 1863-1944, p. 42, Taschen, 2000, , 9783822859711 The version owned by the Munch Museum of Oslo was stolen in 2004 but recovered two years later. Two other versions are owned by the National Gallery of Norway and the Kunsthalle Hamburg. Another one is owned by businessman Nelson Blitz, and one was bought in 1999 by Steven A. Cohen. The lithographic print of the composition is distinguished by a decorative border depicting wriggling sperm, with a fetus- like figure in its bottom left corner. The 1893 version of the painting had a frame with similar decoration, but it was later removed and lost. The print also exists in a number of different versions.  Title  Although it is a highly unusual representation, this painting might be of the Virgin Mary. Whether the painting is specifically intended as a representation of Mary is disputed. Munch used more than one title, including both Loving Woman and Madonna. Munch is not famous for religious artwork and was not known as a Christian. The affinity to Mary might as well be intended nevertheless, as an emphasis on the beauty and perfection of his friend Dagny Juel-Przybyszewska, the model for the work, and an expression of his worship of her as an ideal of womanhood.Cornelia Gerner, Die \\"Madonna\\" in Edvard Munchs Werk ‚Äì Frauenbilder und Frauenbild im ausgehenden 19. Jahrhundert Knut Brynhildsvoll, Literaturverlag Norden Mark Reinhard, Morsbach, 1993,  Interpretations  Color lithograph from Ohara Museum of Art. 1895‚Äì1902. . Werner Hofmann suggests that the painting is a \\"strange devotional picture glorifying decadent love. The cult of the strong woman who reduces man to subjection gives the figure of woman monumental proportions, but it also makes a demon of her.\\"Werner Hofmann, The Earthly Paradise: Art in the Nineteenth Century, G. Braziller, New York, 1961, p.351. Sigrun Rafter, an art historian at the Oslo National Gallery suggests that Munch intended to represent the woman in the life-making act of intercourse, with the sanctity and sensuality of the union captured by Munch. The usual golden halo of Mary has been replaced with a red halo symbolizing the love and pain duality. The viewer's viewpoint is that of the man who is making love with her. Even in this unusual pose, she embodies some of the key elements of canonical representations of the Virgin: she has a quietness and a calm confidence about her. Her eyes are closed, expressing modesty, but she is simultaneously lit from above; her body is seen, in fact, twisting away from the light so as to catch less of it, even while she faces it with her eyes. These elements suggest aspects of conventional representations of the Annunciation. Robert Melville states that the image portrays \\"ecstasy and pain in the act of love\\". Commenting on the lithograph version, he says that the \\"decorative border [is] composed of sperms trailing long wriggly filaments which meander round three sides of the image and end in a foetus-like pendant.\\"Melville, Robert, in J. M. Richards and Nikolaus Pevsner, eds., The Anti-Rationalists, 1973, p. 143. Feminist critic Carol Duncan is inclined to interpret the figure as a femme fatale, Other critics have also seen the portrayal of the woman as implicitly paradoxical. According to Peter Day, it is a potentially vampiric figure. Day identifies a \\"dichotomy\\" between the haunting image of a monstrous mother and of female subjectivity and self-sufficiency. Painting materials The painting in Munch Museum Oslo was investigated by British and Norwegian scientists.Brian Singer, Trond Aslaksby, Biljana Topalova-Casadiego and Eva Storevik Tveit, Investigation of Materials Used by Edvard Munch, Studies in Conservation 55, 2010, pp. 274-292.

Both paintings were recovered by the Oslo Police on 31 August 2006.

In Plymouth Colony, by virtue of his education and existing stature with those immigrating from the Netherlands, Brewster, a Brownist (or Puritan Separatist), became senior elder and the leader of the community. Life in England  William Brewster was born about 1564,Stratton, Eugene Aubrey (1986). Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, p. 251, Salt Lake City, UT, US: Ancestry Publishing. most probably in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire, England. He was the son of William Brewster and Mary (Smythe) (Simkinson) Brewster and he had a number of siblings, including James, Prudence, Henry, George, and Edward Brewster. His paternal grandparents were William Brewster (1510‚Äì1558), and Maud Mann (1513‚Äì1558), from Scotland.Merrick, Barbara Lambert [Ed., Comp.] (2000). William Brewster of the Mayflower and His Descendants for Four Generations, 3rd Rev. Edn., pp. 1‚Äì5, 30-35, Plymouth, MA, US: General Society of Mayflower Descendants.A genealogical profile of William Brewster (a collaboration between Plymouth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society) Their other children were: Fear, [vicar) Henry, Prudence and Thomas Brewster. Beginning in 1580, he studied briefly at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before entering the service of William Davison, ambassador to the Netherlands, in 1584, giving him opportunity to hear and see more of reformed religion. Brewster was the only Pilgrim with political and diplomatic experience. With his mentor in prison, Brewster had returned home to Scrooby for a time, where he took up his father's former position as postmaster in 1590.Philbrick, pp. 16-18. The historian Stephen Tomkins argues that William and Mary became puritans in the mid/late 1590s, judging by the names of their children, which became much more puritan after Jonathan. It appears their daughter Fear, born about 1606, was named after her great-aunt Fear Brewster, who died unmarried about two years after William's daughter Fear was born. left Following the campaign led by Archbishop Bancroft to force puritan ministers out of the Church of England, the Brewsters joined the Brownist church led by John Robinson and Richard Clifton, inviting them to meet in their manor house in Scrooby. Restrictions and pressures applied by the authorities convinced the congregation of a need to emigrate to the more sympathetic atmosphere of Holland, and Brewster organised the removal. Leaving England without permission was illegal at the time, so that departure was a complex matter. On its first attempt, in 1607, the group was arrested at Scotia Creek, but in 1608, Brewster and others were successful in leaving from The Humber.  Life in Holland  A rare 17th- century \\"Brewster Chair,\\" named after William Brewster Robinson's church lived for a year in Amsterdam, but in 1609 one of their fellow Brownist churches there, led by John Smyth, became the first Baptist church. In the controversy that followed, Robinson and Brewster decided to take their church to Leiden. William lived near St. Peter's church (Dutch: Pieterskerk) in Leiden with his wife and children. His son, Jonathan, was a ribbonweaver. William was chosen as assistant and later as an elder to Pastor John Robinson. He was still an elder when he traveled to Plymouth Colony in 1620. In Leiden, the group managed to make a living. Brewster had struggled for money in Amsterdam, but in Leiden he taught English to University students. In 1610‚Äì11, Robinson and Brewster acted as mediators when the Ancient Church, the oldest Brownist congregation in Amsterdam, split into two factions following Francis Johnson and Henry Ainsworth, but they failed to reconcile them. In 1616, partnered by Thomas Brewer and assisted at first by John Reynolds and then by Edward Winslow in late 1617, Brewster printed and published religious books for sale in England which were proscribed there. The press was prolific, printing \\"seven books against the regime of the Church of England in 1618 alone.\\" In 1618, Brewster's press published De regimine Ecclesianae Scoticanae, by the Scottish minister David Calderwood, which was highly critical of James VI and his government of the Kirk. They followed it up in April 1619 with Perth Assembly. King James ordered an international manhunt for the writer and printer, but when his men eventually discovered the culprits, Brewer was protected by Leiden University while Brewster and Calderwood both went underground. According to the historian Stephen Tomkins, Brewster handed himself over to the Dutch authorities, who refused to send him to his death in England and so told James that they had arrested the wrong person and let him go. He judges that Brewster's printing operation 'came close to ruining his church's plans for America'. Brewster, along with Robinson, was a prime mover in the decision to sail for North America, and a principal organiser, but once he was in hiding, the Separatists looked to their deacon John Carver and to Robert Cushman to carry on negotiations with the appropriate officials in London.Philbrick, p. 19. In 1620 when it came time for the Mayflower departure, Brewster returned to the Leiden congregation. He had been hiding out in Holland and perhaps even England for the last year. At the time of his return, Brewster was the highest-ranking layperson of the congregation and would be their designated spiritual leader in the New World.Philbrick, p. 25. Brewster joined the first group of Separatists aboard the Mayflower on the voyage to North America. Brewster was accompanied by his wife, Mary Brewster, and his sons: Love Brewster and Wrestling Brewster.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger amongst the Pilgrims (St. Martins Press, New York, 2002) p. 31  Mayflower voyage  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, 1899 Among the people boarding the Mayflower were four unaccompanied children from Shipton, Shropshire. They were placed as indentured servants with senior Separatists William Brewster, John Carver and Robert Cushman, on behalf of Samuel More, husband of the children's mother, Katherine More. The children were placed without their mother's permission after four rancorous years between the Mores over charges of adultery against Katherine and her longtime lover, the children's alleged father. Two children were placed with William and Mary Brewster.Donald F. Harris, PhD., the Mayflower Descendant (July 1994) vol. 44 no. 2 pp. 112‚Äì114. The Mayflower departed Plymouth in England in September 1620. The 100-foot vessel carried 102 passengers and a crew of 30 to 40 in extremely cramped conditions. During the voyage, the ship was buffeted by strong westerly gales. The caulking of its planks was failing to keep out sea water, and the passengers' berths were not always dry. On the journey there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger. After being blown off course by gales, the Mayflower made a landing at Cape Cod. Finding the area near Provincetown occupied by indigenous people, the ship's company decided to continue exploring along the nearby coast. The group arrived in the area near present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts on December 21, 1620. In the space of several months almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton.

Brewster under his motto - Hebel est omnis Adam When the passengers of the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Colony, Brewster became the senior elder, and so served as the religious leader of the colony; in the colony, he became a separatist leader and preacher,Philbrick, p. 46. and eventually, as an adviser to Governor William Bradford. Brewster's son Jonathan joined the family in November 1621, arriving at Plymouth on the ship Fortune, and daughters Patience and Fear arrived in July 1623 aboard the Anne.Philbrick, p. 125. Brewster Gardens, Plymouth, Massachusetts. The park covers the original garden plot that was granted to William Brewster in 1620. As the only university-educated member of the colony, Brewster took the part of the colony's religious leader until a pastor, Ralph Smith, arrived in 1629. Thereafter, he continued to preach irregularly until his death in April 1644. \\"He was tenderhearted and compassionate of such as were in misery,\\" Bradford wrote, \\"but especially of such as had been of good estate and rank and fallen unto want and poverty.\\" Brewster was granted land amongst the islands of Boston Harbor, and four of the outer islands (Great Brewster, Little Brewster, Middle Brewster and Outer Brewster) now bear his name. In 1632, Brewster received lands in nearby Duxbury and removed from Plymouth to create a farm there.Steele, Ashbel (1857). Chief of the Pilgrims: Or, The Life and Time of William Brewster, Ruling Elder of the Pilgrim Company That Founded New Plymouth, the Parent Colony of New England, in 1620, p. 353, Philadelphia, PA, US: J.B. Lippincott. In 1634, smallpox and influenza ravaged both the English and the Indians in the region. William Brewster, whose family had managed to survive the first terrible winter unscathed, lost two daughters, Fear and Patience, now married to Isaac Allerton and Thomas Prence, respectively.Philbrick, p. 172. Family and other charges Title page of a pamphlet published by William Brewster in Leiden =Marriage= About 1590 or 1592, William Brewster married a woman named Mary,Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore, MD.: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006) pp. 36, 37 whose surname is unknown, although researchers have proposed Wentworth and Wyrall, along with a handful of children -- all of which have been disproved with documentation, as summarized in the 2014 'silver' volume on William Brewster published by the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. No formal record of the marriage of William Brewster appears in the preserved marriage records of Nottinghamshire Archives.Bangs, Jeremy Dupertius (2012). The Mayflower Quarterly, vol. 78, no. 2 (June), p. 145. Clandestine marriages and marriages without banns or license before an officiant were not unknown in Nottinghamshire around 1590-96. Thus it is possible one of the following officiated at the marriage about 1590-92 of William Brewster: 1) his uncle Henry Brewster, vicar of Sutton-cum-Lound 1565-94; 2) John Naylor, who was vicar of North Clifton 1588-1626+ and was involved in a clandestine marriage 1 December 1591; and 3) Thomas Hancock, curate of Headon until 1592 when curate of West Retford, and who was presented in 1592 for marrying R. Southworth in Scrooby Chapel without banns or license while curate of Headon. The extensive search for further information on Mary continues, and the number of researchers includes Jeremy Bangs, Director of the American Pilgrim Museum in Leiden, Holland; Caleb Johnson; and Louise Throop. =Children= Their first surviving child, Jonathan, was born on 12 August 1593, according to \\"The Brewster Book\\" in the handwriting of Jonathan, and reproduced in the 2014 'silver' volume on William Brewster published by the General Society of Mayflower Descendants. The first three known children were born in Scrooby, Nottinghamshire. A more comprehensive list of children is as follows although there were possibly children born 1591, 1595, 1597, and 1602, who would have possibly died in the plague of the autumn of 1603 and the winter of 1603/4. Others born 1604 and 1608 may also have died young: # Jonathan Brewster (12 August 15937 August 1659) married Lucretia Oldham of Derby on 10 April 1624, and were the parents of 8 children. # Patience Brewster (c. 160012 December 1634) married Gov. Thomas Prence of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, 4 children. # Fear Brewster (c. 1606before 1634) apparently named after her great-aunt Fear Brewster. Married Isaac Allerton of London, 2 children. # Unnamed child was born, died and buried in 1609 in Leiden, Holland. # Love Brewster was born in Leiden, Holland, about 1611 and died between 6 October 1650 and 31 January 1650/1, at Duxbury, in Plymouth Colony. At the age of about 9, he traveled with his father, mother and brother, Wrestling, on the Mayflower to Plymouth Colony. There he married Sarah Collier on 15 May 1634. Love and Sarah were the parents of four children. # Wrestling Brewster was born in 1614 in Leiden, Holland; was living in 1627, died unmarried before the 1644 settlement of his father's estate. = Other charges = Coat of arms of William Brewster Three of the Mayflower pilgrims, including William Brewster, took responsibility for children of Samuel More, who accompanied him and others as indentured servants: * Mary More, age 4, assigned as a servant of William Brewster. She died sometime in the winter of 1620/1621. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been on Cole's Hill in Plymouth in an unmarked grave, as with so many others buried there that winter. As with her sister Ellen, she is recognized on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb in Plymouth, misidentified after her sister's name as \\"and a brother (children),\\" the mistake of calling her \\"a brother\\" arising from William Bradford's failing memory years after the event of her death. * Richard More, age 6, servant of William Brewster. He resided with the Brewster family until about mid-1627 when his term of indentureship expired. His name appears, at age 14, in a census as a member of the Brewster family, in what was called then \\"New Plimouth\\". By 1628, Richard was in the employ of Pilgrim Isaac Allerton, who was engaged in trans-Atlantic trading. In addition to these, Jasper More, age 7, was assigned to John Carver as a servant, but died of a \\"common infection\\" in Dec. 1620 while the Mayflower was in Cape Cod Harbor (several weeks after Elinor). He was buried ashore in the area of what is now Provincetown, where a memorial plaque bears his and the names of four others \\"who died at sea while the ship lay at Cape Cod Harbor\\" in Nov./Dec. 1620. Finally, Elinor More, age 8, was assigned to Edward Winslow as a servant, but died in November 1620 soon after the arrival of the Mayflower at Cape Cod Harbor. Her burial place is unknown, but may have been ashore on Cape Cod similar to her brother Jasper. With many others who died that winter, her name appears on the Pilgrim Memorial Tomb, Cole's Hill, Plymouth, Massachusetts.David Lindsay, Mayflower Bastard: A Stranger Amongst the Pilgrims (New York: St. Martins Press, 2002), pp 102‚Äì104 and pp. 25‚Äì27, 102‚Äì104, 150‚Äì152Harris, Donald F.

It was founded in 1908 to serve German families in Hungary. It now has a diverse student body with primarily children of the expatriate business and diplomatic communities. Considered to be one of the best schools of its kind, it was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad in 2012, but the certification was later removed after an audit in 2018.  History  The former Deutsche Schule Budapest was re-established as the continuation of, first, the 1908 Reichsdeutsche Schule Budapest, and later, the German Government School in Budapest. Its founders were the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg, the Federal Government of Germany, the City of Budapest and the Hungarian Government, in succession to a tradition of German schools in Hungary dating back to the late 19th century. Since then, it has evolved into a prestigious institution for about 500 students, with a Primary School from Grade 1 to 4 (Grundschule) and a Secondary School for Grades 5 to 12 (Gymnasium).  Academics  The German School of Budapest's philosophy is to serve as a platform fostering intercultural dialogue. It is committed to act as a bridge between the German and Hungarian society, culture and language. It has a rigorous bicultural academic curriculum evidenced by a graduation rate of virtually 100% and one of the highest university admission rates (95%) in the country. The primary language of instruction is German with some classes taught in Hungarian, depending on the student's academic program. Given the limited German knowledge of the majority of the Hungarian pupils, teaching is more and more moving into bilangual set-up. Given the multicultural student body, the emphasis is on nurturing independent thinking, tolerance and openness. The primary school encompasses Grades 1 to 4 and follows the national curriculum of Germany. Hungarian is offered as a regular language class for beginners, advanced and bilingual students. English is playfully introduced as a foreign language. The secondary school is split into a German and Hungarian section. The German section follows the German national curriculum for Gymnasiums with English (Grade 5), French (Grade 6) and Spanish (Grade 9) as the foreign languages and leads to the German Abitur. Students in the Hungarian section also follow the German national curriculum but have additional classes in Hungarian literature, Hungarian history and are taught biology and chemistry in Hungarian according to the Hungarian national curriculum. In Grade 5 the focus is on acquiring proficiency in German. Students may sit the German Abitur, as well as the Hungarian √âretts√©gi. The two sections are physically divided into separate classes up to Grade 9. After that, students of both sections are mixed so that Germans and Hungarians spend the majority of their time studying side by side. The school is especially known for its high level in mathematics, science and languages. Students frequently outperform their counterparts in standardized tests, successfully participate in international and national academic competitions, and have the possibility to earn language certificates due to cooperation with the Institut Fran√ßais and the Instituto Cervantes.  Faculty  Teachers at the school are generally recommended and appointed by the German Ministry for Education (Kultusministerkonferenz) and have to be confirmed by the school. The positions are highly competitive and are based on three year contracts with the possibility of extension. Unfortunately not many teacher stay the full 3 year term. For 2019 as example about 25% of teachers left the school. In some cases, especially for subjects taught in Hungarian, the school hires teachers directly from Hungary. Several years of experience at a highly reputable Hungarian secondary school is a minimum requirement.  Tuition  Tuition for the 2016-2017 school year is 1,162,500 HUF excluding additional fees for registration, materials, extracurriculars, lunch, class trips, excursions, and transportation. This makes the DSB one of the most expensive private schools in the country.  Student body  The flags of the European Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary are displayed in the Upper Yard.The school prides itself on its diversity, serving students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic and racial backgrounds. Albeit smaller than most other international schools in Budapest, it is proportionally more diverse and more focused on a cosmopolitan education with especially Grades 9-12 serving as examples of cross-cultural communication and understanding. The German School is considered to be the go-to institution for an increasing number of diplomat, expat and bilingual families, as well as the Hungarian elite. Due to the high tuition fees and rigorous admission process, it primarily caters to an exclusive group of families. With the shrinking number of German expats the composition of the classes in terms of nationality has changed over the recent years. The majority of pupils today has limited tie points to Germany and have Hungarian as their first language.  Facilities  The school has a large 35 hectare campus in the Buda hills overlooking the city and is conveniently accessible by public transport. A historic hunting lodge houses the primary school and the cafeteria. The secondary school and the administrative offices are located in a contemporary, purpose-built building. Apart from several specialty classrooms for the art and science classes, there is a computer room, a library with over 7,000 books, a gym and a professionally equipped theater. The outdoor facilities include a playground, a basketball and a soccer court, and a running track. All classrooms are equipped with Smart Boards. For class trips, project excursions and training camps the school owns a holiday house in G√°rdony, at the shore of Lake Velence. It can accommodate up to 36 people in en-suite rooms, has a fully equipped kitchen, a multipurpose room, and plenty of canoes and other sports equipment. Due to increasing number of students, a major expansion project designed by BH Architects has started in August 2016. Apart from a new building amendment which will house new classrooms, an additional gym, a larger cafeteria. The new two-decked parking lot has already been completed.  Extracurriculars  Each year the school offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities: from intramurals and club sports to arts, music and science. The drama and musical clubs put on plays suitable for different ages. In the past, famous Broadway productions such as Hair and Cats, as well as student-written pieces have been showcased. The Lego Robotics club has participated in national and international competitions. The DSB is one of currently nine Hungarian schools running the Model European Parliament project. Students have successfully advanced to the national and international rounds. The Class of '05 won the first prize at the German Competition of Political Education in 2003, and the school had regularly sends the finalists to the prestigious OKTV competition. The school has close links to the prestigious Europa-Kolleg, a two-weeks research scholarship program for annually twenty high school student, organised by the state foundation of Lower Saxony, the Stiftung Niedersachsen.  Athletics  The school soccer pitch, above the new school building, has an extraordinary view on the whole city and the Buda hillsFollowing the concept of a holistic education, the school emphasises the importance of athletics. Students participate in varsity sports competing in tournaments with local Hungarian schools. The basketball team has also had notable successes, not the least thanks to the annual student-teacher match on the last school day before Christmas break. The girls' volleyball team is one of the excelling school teams in the area, represented in almost every major high school level tournament. Club sports, such as hockey, four square (known as Tengo at the school) and dance are particularly popular with the lower grades.  Traditions  = Gombocz-Runde = Named after one-time school coach and PE teacher G√°bor Gombocz, the Gombocz-Runde is a 1,5 km cross country run on an area near the school with extreme inclines and uphill parts. As such, it is strenuous exercise even for generally fit students. Tradition has it that every student has to run it at least once a term to pass in PE, although this has recently been abandoned. The run itself nevertheless remains part of the PE curriculum. It is partly due to the tradition of the Gombocz-Runde that DSBlers are regularly seen at various city marathons and charity runs. Gombocz doesn't run with the students, he sits on a chair at the gate. = Adventsbasar = The Adventsbasar is co-organised by the Parents' Association that takes place in early December. It is a Christmas-themed event where most classes get a stall and sell pancakes, mulled wine, and various trinkets. The profit usually goes to the class accounts of the pupils. = Szalagavat√≥ = Once seniors have passed their first semester of finals and are admitted to the leaving examinations, they are allowed to wear a distinctive bright-blue ribbon on their coats. The Szalagavat√≥ is the ceremony when the ribbons are officially handed over to the students. The Szalagavat√≥ takes place in late November or early December marking the final stage of a student's school career. It is a white tie event taking place in the school, commonly presided over by the German Ambassador to Budapest or another high-ranking state officer and attended by the students¬¥ families, friends, diplomats and corporate leadership. = Ballag√°s (graduation ceremony) = Ballag√°s is the actual Graduation ceremony, on the last day of ordinary school schedules for the seniors. It takes place on the last Friday before the start of the preparatory and examination period, at the end of which the oral parts of the leaving examinations are taken. Seniors walk through classrooms decorated with flowers for this purpose, singing traditional commercium songs, such as Gaudeamus Igitur.

He co-founded the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) and was an early naturalist and conservationist. Early life and education =Childhood= William Brewster was born on July 5, 1851, in South Reading (now Wakefield), Massachusetts, the youngest of four children born to John Brewster, a successful Boston banker, and Rebecca Parker (Noyes). The couple settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1845. Brewster's sister and older brothers died in early childhood, inspiring Longfellow, a close neighbor, to write the poem The Open Window. Brewster attended Cambridge public schools, Washington Grammar School and Cambridge High School, taking a preparatory course to enter Harvard. He suffered eyesight problems as a youth and into adulthood. He was often unable to read or study, sometimes for extended periods. During his last year of high school, he was unable to read so his mother read his lessons to him. His vision problems prevented him from entering Harvard. =Early bird study= At about the age of 10, Brewster became close friends with a boy his age, Daniel French. French's father was a hunter and amateur taxidermist who displayed his skill in cases in his home. Brewster's father gave him a gun and taught him to shoot, providing a means of collecting birds to study. In the nineteenth century, shooting was the usual way of collecting specimens. Binoculars were not generally available until the early twentieth century. In his book, Birds of the Cambridge Region, Brewster himself wrote, \\"On January 1, 1862, my friend Mr. Daniel C. French called at our house to give me my first lesson in taxidermy, an art known in those days to but very few persons save the professional bird stuffers.\\" By 1865, Brewster had several cases of mounted birds and a collection of nests and eggs. A few years later, he learned to make skins and gave up mounting stuffed birds. Brewster kept detailed records of his observations and continued to do so for the rest of his life. To encourage his interests, his father presented him with the five volumes of Audubon's Ornithological Biography. Career and accomplishments thumb In 1880, he became assistant in charge of the collection of birds and mammals in the Boston Society of Natural History, and in 1885 became curator of mammals and birds at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, where he served until his death, though after 1900 he cared for birds alone, and he left his position at the Boston Society of Natural History in 1887. He also devoted substantial time to his own private museum of ornithology. Brewster was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1876 became president of the Nuttall Ornithological Club of Cambridge, of which he was the founder in 1873. He was a co-founder, with Elliott Coues and Joel Asaph Allen, of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1883 and served as its president from 1895 to 1898. Brewster served as the first president of Mass Audubon (Massachusetts Audubon Society) from 1896‚Äì1913, founded by Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (1858‚Äì1960) and Minna B. Hall, with a mandate to advance legislation to restrict the killing of birds and sale of their plumage. The group, with over half its officers being women, used its political power to have a Massachusetts law passed in 1897 outlawing trade in wild bird feathers and the 1900 Lacey Act, which prohibits interstate shipment of animals killed in violation of local laws. Published works Brewster published over 300 articles in the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, in the Annals of the New York Lyceum of Natural History, Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, The Auk, and other periodicals. He wrote: * Bird Migration (1886) * Birds of the Cape Regions of Lower California (1902) * Birds of the Cambridge Region of Massachusetts (1906) Unpublished works The Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University maintains an archive of Brewster's journals, diaries, field notebooks, correspondence, and photographs. Much of this material has been digitizedhttp://blogs.law.harvard.edu/ernstmayrlibrary/2014/05/30/transcribing- the-field-notes-of-william-brewster/ and is available through the Biodiversity Heritage Library.https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/search?searchTerm=william+brewster#/titles William Brewster Memorial Award In honor of Brewster, the AOU awards the William Brewster Memorial Award \\"to the author or co-authors (not previously so honored) of an exceptional body of work on birds of the Western Hemisphere.\\" The award, consisting of a medal and honorarium, was given every other year from 1921 through 1937 and then annually.

His parents, William White and his pregnant wife Susanna, with their son Resolved White and two servants, came on the Mayflower in 1620. Peregrine White was born while the Mayflower lay at anchor in the harbor at Cape Cod. In later life he became a person of note in Plymouth Colony, active in both military and government affairs.Johnson 2006, p. 247.Stratton 1986, pp. 79, 365, 370, 406, 408.A genealogical profile of William White (Peregrine)  English origins  Peregrine WhitePeregrine comes from the proper Latin form Peregrinus. This translates into English as Pilgrim. was the second son of Mayflower pilgrim William White and his wife Susanna White Winslow (maiden name Jackson). His mother Susanna was pregnant during the Mayflower voyage and gave birth to Peregrine in late November 1620 while the ship was anchored at Cape Cod, now Provincetown Harbor.Stratton 1986, p. 21. The Whites are believed to have boarded the Mayflower as part of the London merchant group, and not as members of the Leiden Holland religious movement. Evidence of the William White family coming to the Mayflower from England and not Holland comes from William Bradford's Mayflower passenger list which has \\"Mr. William White\\" in his section for London merchants along with Christopher Martin, William Mullins, Stephen Hopkins, Richard Warren and John Billington. It is believed that if William White had been a member of the Leiden congregation, his name would have appeared in Bradford's work for that section, but it does not. There is no evidence to associate William White and his family with Leiden, Holland. And regarding the various White family ancestries which erroneously place the William White family in them, the Mayflower Society states that \\"Little is known about William White.\\"Banks 2006, p. 94.  Mayflower voyage  The White family, as recalled by William Bradford in 1651: \\"Mr. William White, and Susana, his wife, and one son, called Resolved, and one borne a ship-bord, called Peregrine; and *2* servants, named William Holbeck and Edward Thomson.\\"Stratton 1986, p. 406. The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Allison Lassieur, Peter McDonnall The voyage of the Mayflower (Pub. Capstone Press, ¬©2006 Mankato, Minnesota) At some point along the journey, the first baby was born on the Mayflower, Oceanus Hopkins, to the passengers Stephen and Elizabeth Hopkins. On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.Stratton 1986, p. 413.Bowman 1920, photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document.  In Plymouth Colony  Peregrine White's father William White died on February 21, 1621. With her husband's death, Susanna, with her newborn son Peregrine and five-year-old Resolved, became the only surviving widow out of the many families who perished that first winter. On May 12, 1621 Peregrine's mother Susanna married widower Edward Winslow, a Mayflower and later a Plymouth colony notable with whom she had five children, one of whom was Josiah Winslow, future Plymouth governor.Philbrick 2006, pp. 89-90.Sherman 2006, p. 5. In the 1627 Division of Cattle, both Resolved (sic) and his brother Peregrine were listed in the Third Lot under Capt. Standish in the family of Edward Winslow, his wife Susanna and their sons Edward and John Winslow.Stratton 1986, pp. 421-422. In 1636, the family, now numbering 6 - Edward and Susanna, Resolved and Peregrine White, and the two children born to Edward and Susanna, Josias and Elizabeth Winslow - moved to the new settlement of Marshfield, north of Plymouth.Sherman 2006, p. 8. The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth (1914) By Jennie A. Brownscombe Peregrine served in the militia at age 16 and continued to serve, first as a lieutenant and then a captain. He was also a farmer. At some point he also served his community as a representative to the General Court.Pilgrim Hall Museum Peregrine White On October 23, 1643 Peregrine White at Marshfield sold to Mannasses Kempton of Plymouth, land at Eel River given to him the previous year by his stepfather Edward Winslow.Sherman 2006, p. 9. At the court on March 6, 1648/9, Peregrine White and Sarah his wife, both of Marshfield, were presented (fined) for fornication before marriage. Since records show their first child, Daniel, was born in 1649, they seemingly married after becoming pregnant.Stratton 1986, p. 193. Peregrine's in-laws, the Bassets, had a great deal of land in Marshfield and Peregrine and Sarah moved there, eventually buying several adjacent pieces of property as the years progressed. On June 3, 1651, Lt. Peregrine White was admitted as a Freeman. On June 3, 1652 William Bassett Sr. of Duxburrow gave his son-in-law Lt. Peregrine White 40 acres of upland. In 1655 he was granted land as the \\"first of the English that was borne in these ptes.\\"Stratton 1986, p. 371. On June 16, 1656 as written, William Bassett Sr. of Duxborrow (sic), now living at Bridgewater, gave his lands in Scituate to his sons Peregrine White and Nathaniel Bassett. On October 2, 1658 he was chosen to the council of war. On June 3, 1662 Peregrine was chosen deputy for Marshfield. On March 4, 1673/4 Lt. Peregrine White was granted 100 acres at Titicut.Young 1842, p. 148.Sherman 2006, pp. 8, 9, 10. On August 19, 1674 Peregrine White of Marshfield deeded son Daniel White, in consideration of his intended marriage, various buildings and lands in Marshfield from the time of his death, except if he died before his wife Sarah and Daniel was to pay monies to sister Sarah and Mercy when they became or married. On May 22, 1696 Capt. Peregrine White \\"the first born Child of New England born November 1620\\" was admitted into the Marshfield Church in his 78th year.

The condition was named by Friedrich Albert von Zenker. It is a hyaline degeneration of skeletal muscles such as rectus abdominis and diaphragm, and occurs in severe toxaemia as typhoid fever. It is also seen in electrical burns. Grossly the muscles appear pale and friable; microscopically, the muscle fibres are swollen, have a loss of cross striations, and show a hyaline appearance.

It is a pseudo diverticulum (not involving all layers of the esophageal wall). It was named in 1877 after German pathologist Friedrich Albert von Zenker.  Signs and symptoms  In simple words, when there is excessive pressure within the lower pharynx, the weakest portion of the pharyngeal wall balloons out, forming a diverticulum which may reach several centimetres in diameter. More precisely, while traction and pulsion mechanisms have long been deemed the main factors promoting development of a Zenker's diverticulum, current consensus considers occlusive mechanisms to be most important: uncoordinated swallowing, impaired relaxation and spasm of the cricopharyngeus muscle lead to an increase in pressure within the distal pharynx, so that its wall herniates through the point of least resistance (known as Killian's triangle, located superior to the cricopharyngeus muscle and inferior to the thyropharyngeus muscle. Thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus are the superior and inferior parts of inferior constrictor muscle of pharynx respectively). The result is an outpouching of the posterior pharyngeal wall, just above the esophagus. While it may be asymptomatic, Zenker diverticulum can present with the following symptoms: * Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and sense of a lump in the throat * Food might get trapped in the outpouching, leading to: ** Regurgitation, reappearance of ingested food in the mouth ** Cough, due to food regurgitated into the airway ** Halitosis, smelly breath, as stagnant food is digested by microorganisms ** Infection It rarely, if ever, causes any pain. Cervical webs are seen associated in 50% of patients with this condition. Rarer forms of cervical esophageal diverticula are the Killian's diverticulum and the Laimer's diverticulum. Killian's diverticulum is formed in the Killian-Jamiseon triangle (located inferior to the cricopharyngeus on both sides of this muscle's insertion into the cricoid cartilage). Laimer's diverticulum is formed in Laimer's triangle (located inferior to the cricopharyngeus in the posterior midline above the confluence of the longitudinal layer of esophageal muscle). Laimer's triangle is covered only by the circular layer of esophageal muscle.  Diagnosis  Lateral X-ray of a Zenker's diverticulum AP X-ray of a Zenker's diverticulum A combination of the simple barium swallow and a thorough endoscopy will normally confirm the diverticulum.  Treatment  If small and asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Larger, symptomatic cases of Zenker's diverticulum have been traditionally treated by neck surgery to resect the diverticulum and incise the cricopharyngeus muscle. However, in recent times non-surgical endoscopic techniques have gained more importance (as they allow for much faster recovery), and the currently preferred treatment is endoscopic stapling (i.e. diverticulotomy with staples ). This may be performed through a diverticuloscope. Other methods include fibreoptic diverticular repair. Other non-surgical treatment modalities also exist, such as endoscopic laser, which recent evidence suggests is less effective than stapling.  Epidemiology  Zenker's diverticulum mainly affects older adults. It has an incidence of 2 per 100,000 per year in the UK, but there is significant geographical variation around the world.

The condition was named after Friedrich Albert von Zenker. Peroneal nerve paralysis usually leads to neuromuscular disorder, peroneal nerve injury, or foot drop which can be symptoms of more serious disorders such as nerve compression. The origin of peroneal nerve palsy has been reported to be associated with musculoskeletal injury or isolated nerve traction and compression. Also it has been reported to be mass lesions and metabolic syndromes. Peroneal nerve is most commonly interrupted at the knee and possibly at the joint of hip and ankle. Most studies reported that about 30% of peroneal nerve palsy is followed from knee dislocations. Peroneal nerve injury occurs when the knee is exposed to various stress. It occurs when the posterolateral corner structure of knee is injured. Relatively tethered location around fibular head, tenuous vascular supply and epineural connective tissues are possible factors that cause damage on the common peroneal nerve. Treatment options for nerve palsy include both operative and non-operative techniques. Initial treatment includes physical therapy and ankle-foot orthosis. Physical therapy mainly focuses on preventing deformation by stretching the posterior ankle capsule. A special brace or splint worn inside the shoe (called an Ankle Foot Orthosis) holds the foot in the best position for walking. Orthosis stretches posterior ankle structures. Physical therapy can help patients to learn how to walk with a foot drop. Signs and symptoms Slapping gait makes a slapping noise at the joint of an ankle. Signs and symptoms of peroneal nerve palsy are related to mostly lower legs and foot which are the following: *Decreased sensation, numbness, or tingling in the top of the foot or the outer part of the upper or lower leg *Foot drops (unable to hold the foot straight across) *Toes drag while walking *Weakness of the ankles or feet *Prickling sensation *Pain in shin *Pins and needles sensation *Slapping gait (walking pattern in which each step makes a slapping noise) Patients may need pain relievers to control pain. Other medications that are used to reduce pain include gabapentin, carbamazepine, or tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline. Whenever if possible, patients need to avoid or limit the use of medication to reduce the risk of side effects. If the pain is severe, a pain specialist can help patients to explore all options to relieve the pain. Physical therapy exercises may help patients to maintain muscle strength. Also, orthopedic devices may improve patient's ability to walk and prevent contractures. Orthopedic devices may include braces, splints, orthopedic shoes, or other equipment. Vocational counseling, occupational therapy, or similar programs may help patients to maximize their mobility and independence. Causes Causing factors of peroneal nerve palsy are such as musculoskeletal or peroneal nerve injuries. Usually paralysis occurs at the outside of the leg and the top of the foot. Palsy causes decrease of muscle strength to lift the foot, twist ankle outside, and move toes around. Major cause of palsy is due to dislocation of knee. Other possible causing factors are metabolic dysfunction of lower part of knee or disorientation of hip or pelvis. Damages on peroneal nerves destroy the myelin sheath that covers the axon or the whole nerve cell. There might be a loss of feeling, muscle control, muscle tone, and eventual loss of muscle mass because the nerves aren't stimulating the muscles after they are damaged. Dysfunction of a single nerve such as the common peroneal nerve is called a mononeuropathy. Mononeuropathy means the nerve damage is occurred in one area. However, certain conditions may also cause single nerve injuries. Common causes of damage to the peroneal nerve include the following: *Traumatic injury on the knee *Fracture of the fibula *Using a tight plaster cast (or other long-term constriction) of the lower leg *Crossing the legs regularly *Regularly wearing high boots *Pressure to the knee from positions during deep sleep or coma *Long period of resting on bed *Broken leg bone Common peroneal nerve injury is more common in people: *Who are very thin (for example, from anorexia nervosa) *Who have conditions such as diabetic neuropathy or polyarteritis nodosa *Who are exposed to certain toxins that can damage the common peroneal nerve Prolonged pressure on nerve may occur because of: *Sitting position *Blood clots, tumors *Casts on lower leg due to tightnesshttp://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/common-peroneal- nerve-dysfunction/overview.html Diagnosis For partial nerve palsy, more than 80% of patients will recover completely. For complete nerve palsy, less than 40% of patients will have complete recovery. Peroneal nerve in continuity arises from defined cause will be recovered better than those arise from unknown causes.http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/12636 Examinations are required for following reasons: *Considering lumbar radiculopathy during the examination *Possibility of foot drop *Sensory loss that may be difficult to determine because of variable and small autonomous zone of sensation *Tinel's sign over the fibular neck that can help localize the site of nerve compression *Checking for direct compression that reproduces nerve symptoms =Electromyography= Electromyography is used to observe peroneal nerve palsy within one month of injuries. And if it is partial peroneal nerve palsy, patients have higher chance to recover fully from the palsy. More than 70 to 80 percent of patients with partial paralysis recovered completely, but those with complete paralysis have chances less than 30 percent to recover completely. If the symptom does not get any better in few months, surgery is required to decompress the nerve compression. =Nerve conduction velocity= Nerve conduction velocity is an important aspect of nerve conduction studies. It is the speed at which an electrochemical impulse propagates down a neural pathway. Conduction velocities are affected by a wide array of factors, including age, sex, and various medical conditions. Studies allow for better diagnoses of various neuropathies, especially demyelinating conditions as these conditions result in reduced or non-existent conduction velocities. To perform nerve conduction velocity, surface electrodes are placed onto the skin over nerves at various locations. Each patch sends electrical impulses which stimulate the nerve. Resulting electrical activity of nerve is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to determine the velocity of the nerve signals. Image of brain MRI. =MRI= An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the body. It does not use radiation. Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images. To locate nerve palsy, MRI is used by physicians to detect the position and location of damaged peroneal nerve.http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/specialty_areas/peripheral_nerve_surgery/conditions/foot_drop_injury.html Prevention Avoid putting long-term pressure on the back or side of the knee. Treat injuries to the leg or knee right away. If a cast, splint, dressing, or other pressure on the lower leg causes a tight feeling or numbness, call the health care provider. *Avoid crossing legs *Move around actively and frequently *Wear knee protections if working on knee *Alert physician if feeling numbness on leg when casted Treatments Precise knowledge about the length and exact localization of a damaged nerve segment is essential for surgical intervention. On one hand, certain preoperative information about the overall state of an injured nerve (state of the neural and perineural tissue) is important because exploratory inspection of a nerve itself may lead to additional inadvertent damage. If, on the other hand, the surgeon, during genicular ligament reconstruction, inspects a nerve at the site of most probable injury only (limited neurolysis), he or she may sometimes by chance expose an unaffected section of a nerve. Because of the mechanism of nerve injury during traction, however, a more proximal or distal segment of the nerve may be severely damaged. A limited nerve inspection without preoperative knowledge about the site of nerve injury may thus give the false impression of an unimpaired nerve and wrongly lead to conservative treatment of the nerve lesion. If no neurologic improvement is shown after 2‚Äì3 months from injuries, then operative decompression is indicated. Surgical operations such as grafting and tendon transfer are necessarily required. =Tendon transfer= Many different conditions can be treated by tendon transfer surgery. Tendon transfer surgery is necessary when a certain muscle function is lost because of a nerve injury. If a nerve is injured and cannot be repaired, then the nerve no longer sends signals to certain muscles. Those muscles are paralyzed and their muscle function is lost. Tendon transfer surgery can be used to attempt to replace that function. Common nerve injuries that are treated with tendon transfer surgery are spinal cord, radial nerve, ulnar nerve, or median nerve injury. Tendon transfers have higher chance to treat nerve palsy, and such transfers include posterior, anterior, and anteroposterior tibial tendon transfer. Peroneal nerve and its nerve branches need to be fixed from adherence to proximal fibula, which proximal fibula is about 3~5 cm. =Tendon graft= Grafting is a surgical procedure to move tissue from one site to another on the body, or from another person, without bringing its own blood supply with it. Instead, a new blood supply grows in after it is placed. A similar technique where tissue is transferred with the blood supply intact is called a flap. In some instances a grafting can be an artificially manufactured device. Examples of this are a tube to carry blood flow across a defect or from an artery to a vein for use in hemodialysis. =Arthroplasty= Arthroplasty on knee has been broadly used to treat knee and musculoskeletal joint dislocation. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis or some other type of trauma. However, there has been series of reports arthroplasty worsens condition of peroneal nerve, causing paralysis. Other forms of arthroplasty include resection (al) arthroplasty, resurfacing arthroplasty, mold arthroplasty, cup arthroplasty, silicone replacement arthroplasty, etc. History Friedrich Albert von Zenker Friedrich Albert von Zenker (1825‚Äì1898) was a German pathologist and physician, celebrated for his discovery of trichinosis. He was born in Dresden and was educated in Leipzig and Heidelberg. He worked in the city hospital of Dresden in 1851 and became a professor of pathological anatomy and general pathology in the surgico-medical academy of the city. In 1862 he became a professor of pathological anatomy and pharmacology at Erlangen. Three years later he assumed with Ziemssen the editorship of the Deutsches Archiv f√ºr klinische Medizin. In 1895 he retired from active service. His important discovery of the danger of trichine dates from 1860. In that year he published \\"√úber die Trichinenkrankheit des Menschen\\" (\\"On the trichine-illness of humans\\", in volume XVIII of Virchow's Archiv). Zenker also found Zenker's degeneration and Zenker's diverticulum.

Prince Williams royal yards are the highest and smallest yards on the ship, are made of wood, and are \\"lifting yards\\" that can be raised along a section of the mast. Here it is in the lowered position. A yard is a spar on a mast from which sails are set. It may be constructed of timber or steel or from more modern materials like aluminium or carbon fibre. Although some types of fore and aft rigs have yards, the term is usually used to describe the horizontal spars used on square rigged sails. In addition, for some decades after square sails were generally dispensed with, some yards were retained for deploying wireless (radio) aerials and signal flags.  Parts of the yard  Stavros S Niarchos's main-topgallant yard shortly after maintenance, clearly showing its various parts. On relatively \\"modern\\" late- nineteenth-century rigs like this, the quarters make up almost all of it. Click the picture for more details. ; Bunt : The short section of the yard between the slings that attach it to the mast. ; Quarters : The port and starboard quarters form the bulk of the yard, extending from the slings to the fittings for the lifts and braces. ; Yardarms : The outermost tips of the yard: outboard from the attachments for the lifts. Note that these terms refer to stretches of the same spar, not to separate component parts.  Controlling the yard  Stavros S Niarchos 's lower topsail yard. Click on the image to read the labels. The yards are mounted on the mast in such a fashion as to allow free movement under the control of lifts and braces. The sail on this yard is \\"in its gear\\" (see Setting section)--it is hanging below the yard but still folded up rather than spread to the wind. The yard can rotate around the mast to allow the direction of the vessel to be changed relative to the wind. When running directly downwind the yards are 'squared', pointing perpendicular to the ship's centre line. As the ship is steered closer to the wind the yards are braced round using the braces. When further rotation is obstructed by other bits of rigging (typically the shrouds), the yard is said to be braced \\"hard round\\" or \\"sharp up\\", as in \\"sharp up to port\\". This angle (normally about 60 degrees) limits how close to the wind a square rigged ship can sail. The yards represent a considerable weight high above the vessel's centre of gravity; to increase stability, especially in heavy weather, some means is normally provided to lower some of the yards when they are not being used to set sails. In nineteenth-century warships (where a large crew was available) this was generally by physically \\"sending down\\" the upper yards from the masts and storing them on deck--along with, in many cases, the upper sections of the mast itself. Merchant ships in the age of sail would also do this before sailing in the Southern Ocean. On modern tall ships the yards are not designed to be sent down on deck, but 'lifting yards' that can be raised and lowered along a short section of mast using a halyard are often used.  Going aloft  In order to set and stow the square sails, the crew must climb aloft and spread out along the yards. To do this, they stand in footropes suspended beneath the yard and balance themselves between that and the yard itself. The person working on the end of the yardarm has a separate footrope known as the flemish horse. Jackstays run along the top of the yard - the sail will be bent on to one of them, but a second one is often provided (particularly on larger yards) for the crew to hold on to. These are usually steel rods, but stiff cordage stretched between the yardarms was used in the past. Almost all ships used in modern times are fitted with steel safety wires (sometimes erroneously called jackstays) along the yards to which sailors attach themselves using a harness. This is a relatively recent innovation - cargo-carrying and naval sailing ships were not so equipped and falling from the yard represented a real (though less than commonly imagined) risk.  Setting square sails  The fore course is stowed neatly on top of its yard. On the Prince William this yard is made of steel, does not lift, and weighs around two tons. The two people higher up are working on the fore lower topsail yard. Here, the sails are bent only to the yards' quarters and the yardarms are very short. The yard exists to allow square sails to be set to drive the ship. The top edge of the sail is 'bent on' (attached) to the yard semi-permanently. Clewlines and buntlines are led along the yard and from there to the mast and down to the deck. These allow the bottom of the sail to be hoisted up to the yard, so the sail is effectively folded in two. In this state the sail is said to be \\"in its gear\\", that is ready for setting or stowing. To set the sail the clewlines and buntlines are let go, and the sheets (attached to the bottom corners - clews - of the sail) are adjusted to shape the sail to best catch the wind. A device called a \\"tye\\", a \\"tye chain\\", or a \\"tye rope\\" is used for lifting a given yard to the top of its travel to set the sail. To stop using (i.e., to \\"hand\\") the sail, the sheets are released and the clewlines and buntlines are pulled tight. The sail folds in half - back in its gear - and so no longer catches the wind. Unless the sail is to be used again very soon, the next step is to \\"stow\\" it. To do this, the crew must go out along the yard in order to bundle the sail up tightly and tie it down with gaskets.  Manning the yards  An 1847 illustration of men manning the yards aboard the United States Navy 74-gun ship-of-the-line When coming into port, especially during the Tall Ships' Races many modern square riggers will 'man the yards'. All the crew not required on deck to handle the ship will go aloft and spread out along the yards. This manoeuvre was originally used to display the whole crew to the harbour authorities and the other ships present, to show that the ship's guns were not manned and hence her intentions were peaceful.  Fore and aft yards  As well as the square-rig yard, the traditional lateen rig is a triangular sail rigged fore and aft from a long yard mounted at an angle (downward sloping forward) from the mast. As well, some smaller fore and aft rigs use a yard. The spar at the head of a lug sail ‚Äì a roughly square sail which is set fore-and-aft but requires different handling from a more modern gaff or Bermuda rig ‚Äì is known as a yard, and probably developed from the original square-rig yard. The spar at the head of a gunter-rigged sail serves the function of a running topmast, but is not given that name. Some would call it a 'gaff', while others would use the name 'yard'. \\"Sun over the yardarm\\" Ship Garthsnaid at sea This phrase is widely used, both afloat and ashore, to indicate that the time of day has been reached at which it is acceptable, variously, to have lunch or (more commonly) to have an alcoholic beverage. In modern parlance, the latter usage typically refers to early evening, but the phrase is thought originally to have referred to late morning and to the sun's ascent past a particular yard. The actual time that the sun would pass a particular yard would depend greatly on the ship's latitude and heading, as well as the height of her masts, but the phrase seems to have originated in the north Atlantic, where, in summer, this would have typically been at about 11 a.m.. This was the time at which, by custom and rule, the first rum \\"tot\\" of the day was issued to men (the senior rates had their tots neat, while the junior rates had theirs diluted with water), hence its connection with taking one's first alcoholic drink of the day. The earliest mention of this phrase collected by the OED is in Rudyard Kipling's From Sea to Sea in 1899, where it is used as a metaphor referring to drinking habits. However, the phrase was in use earlier, in the same context. One example is from the first volume of Life, from the issue of May 31, 1883.

He served as the 25th Governor of Pennsylvania from 1911 until 1915. A Republican, he had previously served as a U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 24th congressional district. During his baseball career, Tener played as a pitcher and outfielder for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, the Chicago White Stockings of the National League, and the Pittsburgh Burghers of the Players' League; after his playing career, he served as President of the National League. Biography John Tener was born in 1863 in County Tyrone, then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and now in Northern Ireland. His parents were George Evans Tener and Susan Wallis. In 1872, Tener's father died and the family moved the following year to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Tener attended public schools and later worked as a clerk for hardware manufacturer Oliver Iron and Steel Corporation from 1881‚Äì1885. In 1885, Tener, who was six-foot- four (1.93 meters), decided to try his hand at professional baseball. He joined the Haverhill, Massachusetts minor league baseball team in the New England League as a pitcher and outfielder and was a teammate of future Hall of Fame players Wilbert Robinson and Tommy McCarthy. Later that year, Tener made his Major League debut with the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, playing in a single game as an outfielder. While playing in Haverhill, Tener met his future wife, Harriet Day. They married in October 1889. After his brief appearance in Baltimore, Tener continued playing minor league ball, but also returned to the corporate world, working for the Chartiers Valley Gas Company in Pittsburgh and Chambers and McKee Glass Company. In 1888, Cap Anson, the manager of the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), noticed him pitching in Pittsburgh and signed Tener to a contract. Tener was a pitcher and an outfielder for two years in Chicago with moderate success. He notched a 7‚Äì5 record with a 2.74 ERA in 1888 and went 15‚Äì15 with a 3.64 ERA in 1889. After the 1888 season, Tener accompanied the team on a world tour of Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, France, Italy and England. While in England, Tener was chosen to help explain the game of baseball to the Prince of Wales, who would go on to become King Edward VII. Tener was elected as Secretary of the Brotherhood of Professional Players, an early players union and served under President John Montgomery Ward, a future member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1890, unhappy with baseball's reserve clause, Tener joined other players in jumping to the Players' League. Playing for the Pittsburgh Burghers, Tener compiled a poor 3‚Äì11 record. The league folded after one year and Tener decided to retire from professional baseball. He entered the banking business in Charleroi, Pennsylvania in 1891, becoming a cashier at the First National Bank of Charleroi. By 1897, he was the president of the bank. Over the years, Tener became a prominent business leader, founding the Charleroi Savings and Trust Company and the Mercantile Bridge Company. Political career In 1908, Tener, a Republican, was elected to serve in the 61st United States Congress from Pennsylvania's 24th congressional district. As a former ballplayer, Tener organized the first Congressional Baseball Game which is now an annual tradition on Capitol Hill. Governor Tener (center) with Governors John Dix and William Sulzer of New York Tener planned to run for re-election in 1910. Instead, the Republican Party nominated Tener as its candidate for Governor where he would face a divided electorate. Pennsylvania experienced a scandal during the construction of the new Pennsylvania State Capitol. State Treasurer William H. Berry had found that there had been an unappropriated cost for the building's construction of over $7.7 million ($ today), including a number of questionable charges. The scandal led to the conviction of the building architect and a former State Treasurer. Berry failed to get the Democratic nomination and broke away taking independent Republicans and Democrats to form his new Keystone Party. Tener won the election with 415,614 votes (41.7%) over Berry with 382,127 (38.2%) with the help of a 45,000-vote victory in the City of Philadelphia. The Democratic candidate, State Senator Webster Grim of Doylestown, Pennsylvania finished third with 13%. Governor Tener was the first Governor since the American Revolution to be born outside the United States and only the second in Pennsylvania's history to have been born outside of the state. Tener's initiatives as governor included reforming the state public school system and the highway system. With schools, Tener signed into law the School Code of 1911, which established a State Board of Education empowered to set minimum standards and minimum salaries. The Code also mandated that all children regardless of race or color between the ages of eight and sixteen would be required to attend school. The Governor also signed the Sproul Highway Bill into law, which gave the state responsibility over 9,000 public roads that counties and cities had previously maintained. Rebuffed by the voters for a bond issue to fund the program, Tener signed a bill designating fees from automobile registrations and drivers licenses to be used for road funding. In 1913, the Governor sign a bill requiring hunting licenses in Pennsylvania, using the fees generated by the licenses to fund conservation programs. Tener also signed in to action in 1913 a bill that would lead to the creation of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission (PHC), which years later would be merged to form the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC). This would allow funding to be allocated to the preserve and protect the Commonwealths heritage through the Pennsylvania Historic Markers Program and the transfer of historic properties to PHC.Nichols, Roy F. (1967). The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission; a History. Harrisburg: Pennsylvania Historical commission. OCLC 297517 Baseball executive Tener maintained his interest in baseball after retiring as a player. In 1912, Governor Tener spoke out against gambling in baseball, and informed district attorneys around the state that he believed existing laws could be used against illegal wagering. He also offered the influence and assistance of the state government to support any district attorney who chose to act against wagering. In 1913, Philadelphia Phillies owner William Baker proposed offering the position of National League president to Tener after the owners declined to extend the contract of president Thomas Lynch. Tener accepted the offer at a contract of $25,000 ($ today) per year, but was not paid until April 1915 when his term as Governor expired. Tener throwing out the first ball at Ebbets Field on April 14, 1914 Early in his administration, Tener had his hands full as league president, serving a double role as Governor of Pennsylvania. The Federal League declared itself a major league and began competing for players in 1914. A number of players began jumping to the new league including Joe Tinker. At the same time, Tener had to mediate a dispute between Chicago Cubs owner Charles Murphy and Cub manager and star player, Johnny Evers. Evers claimed that he had been fired by Murphy after a salary dispute. Murphy claimed in turn that the future hall-of-famer had resigned with the intent of jumping to the new Federal League. Murphy later attempted to broker a trade to the Boston Braves in which the Cubs would receive Boston star Bill Sweeney. The League originally ruled that Murphy had broken the terms of Evers's contract by not giving him ten days notice before the dismissal and that the punishment would be that Boston did not have to give the players to Chicago. This led to a protest by Murphy. At the time, Murphy was not a well-regarded owner by his peers and the League was afraid that Evers would go to the Federal League to join his former teammate, Joe Tinker. The dispute gave the owners the opportunity to rid themselves of Murphy. Tener arranged for newspaper publisher Charles P. Taft, who was a minority shareholder and had helped the league to force out Phillies owner Horace Fogel, to buy the team and force Murphy out. Tener later faced the prospect of players' strikes in 1914 and 1917. In 1914, the Baseball Players Fraternity, led by Dave Fultz threatened to strike over the transfer of Clarence Kraft to the minor leagues from the Brooklyn Robins. Brooklyn had tried to send Kraft to their minor league club in Newark, New Jersey, but the Nashville Vols claimed that they had the rights to Kraft. Going to Nashville would have cost Kraft $150 ($ today) in salary. When baseball's National Commission ruled that Kraft had to report to Nashville, he appealed to Fultz for help. Although American League President Ban Johnson sought a confrontation, Tener brokered a deal in which Brooklyn paid for Kraft's rights and sent him to Newark. Tener photographed by Charles M. Conlon. Tener ruled Benny Kauff ineligible to join the New York Giants baseball team in April 1915. Kauff played center field for the Giants on April 29, 1915. Tener said that Kauff, a member of the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League, was a jumper from organized baseball. In order to play for New York of the National League, he needed formal reinstatement.Giants Sign Kauff, Federal Deserter. April 30, 1915. New York Times. 10. In 1917, Fultz, emboldened by his efforts in the Kraft cash presented a list of demands to the National Commission to improve the playing conditions in the minor leagues. Tener rejected three of the demands as they were unrelated to Major League Baseball and only applied to minor league players. Tener also noted that the fourth demand, that injured players be paid their full salaries, had already been met in the 1917 contract. Fultz went on to threaten to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor and lead the players on a walkout if his demands were not met. Even though Tener himself had been a member of the Brotherhood of Professional Players in his playing days and, as part of the National Commission, initially certified the Player's Fraternity in 1914, he was not amused by the threats. On the labor side, AFL leader Samuel Gompers did not welcome the idea and many major leaguers were not interested in striking for the benefit of minor league players. The National Commission, immediately withdrew recognition from the Players' Fraternity. Afterwards, the Players' Fraternity membership declined and the organization ceased to exist. In November 1917, Tener accepted a one- year contract extension, but was troubled by the infighting between the National League's owners. In 1918, the league became embroiled in a dispute with the American League over the rights to pitcher Scott Perry. Tener believed that Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack had broken an agreement with both leagues by going to court in the matter. Tener demanded that the National League break off relations, which could have included cancelling the World Series. However, the owners did not support him and Tener resigned in August 1918. Later life After leaving baseball, Tener returned to his business interests in Pittsburgh. In 1926, he tried to gain the Republican nomination to run again for Governor but was unsuccessful, finishing third at the convention. In the 1930s, Tener was elected as a director of the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1935, Tener's wife Harriet died. In 1936, he married Leone Evans who died in 1937 after an illness. He engaged in the insurance business until his death, aged 82, in Pittsburgh in 1946. He was interred in Homewood Cemetery in Pittsburgh. Buildings named in his honor include a residence hall in the East Halls area of the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University and the Charleroi Public Library. In 1999, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker in Charleroi, noting Tener's historic importance.

New stadium Since 1896, Southampton had been tenants of Hampshire County Cricket Club at the County Ground, having vacated the Antelope Ground in the summer of 1896. The rent payable to the cricket club (¬£200 p.a.) was putting a strain on the football club's finances and, in an attempt to reduce this burden, the club had considered a merger with the Freemantle club and a move to their ground in Shirley. The merger proposals had fallen through, but at the Extraordinary general meeting in June 1897, the members were informed that \\"the committee had a ground in view\\". At a shareholders' meeting on 11 November 1897, the chairman stated: > . . . that all being well, by next season the company would be in possession > of its own ground which was at the present time in the hands of George > Thomas Esq. who was devoting his time to its early completion. Although the minutes do not record the location of the new ground, it was common knowledge within the town that the new ground was situated > . . . in the dell that is not far from the County Ground, and nearer West > Station and the town, and at the present time it is a narrow valley with a > stone culvert running along the bottom. It will not be a large ground, but > the natural banks on all sides will be a great help in arranging for the > convenience of the spectators. The site on which the ground was built was described in Philip Brannon's Picture of Southampton, published in 1850, as \\"a lovely dell with a gurgling stream and lofty aspens\\"; the stream is the Rollsbrook which flows out of Southampton Common, running parallel to Hill Lane before now disappearing under Commercial Road and the Central Station, from where it is conduited under Southampton Docks into Southampton Water. The land had been purchased in the 1880s by the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway to enable them to continue their line from Winchester via Twyford, Chandlers Ford, a tunnel at Chilworth and Shirley where it was to pass to the north-east of what is now St James' Park and St. James' Church. From here the line would have travelled south across Hill Lane to run through the dell and onto an embankment leading to a viaduct over Commercial Road and the London and South Western Railway line before terminating on the Western Esplanade, north of the Royal Pier.Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway\\", Sands, T.B. Deposited Plans Hampshire Record Office Collection DP/384/1 Didcot Newbury and Southampton Junction Railway: deposited plan 1881 The dell was stripped of vegetation and the stream channelled into a conduit with work started on the embankment, which survives behind property to the north of Commercial Road but was never used, and the viaduct which was part built but later demolished. The project was abandoned at this point and agreement reached to connect to the London and South Western Railway at Shawford Junction with running rights into Southampton. Construction George Thomas, a fish merchant who had been appointed as a director of the limited company when it was formed in the summer of 1896, who lived in Shirley, saw the potential of the cleared site and purchased the land from the D.N.S.R. By the beginning of the 1898‚Äì99 season, Thomas had incurred expenditure of between ¬£7,500 and ¬£9,000 on acquiring and clearing the site, and erecting the new stands and had agreed an initial three-year lease to the football club at a rental of ¬£250 p.a. The dell had been drained with 13,000 ft of pipe being laid, all draining into the central culvert formed from the Rollsbrook stream. The playing field had to be levelled and the ground made up and turfed ready for the opening of the new season. On completion, the stadium was described in the Southampton Observer: > . . . the rising staging on the north side of the ground will hold 5,500 > spectators, who have of course to stand up; the covered east and west stands > will seat 4,000 spectators comfortably, and the staging and sloping bank on > the south side will hold 15,000 spectators. This totals up to 24,500. At this stage, the new ground did not have an official name, with various names suggested including the \\"Fitzhugh Dell\\", the \\"Archer's Ground\\" and \\"Milton Park\\" but gradually the ground became known by default as \\"the Dell\\". Early days The stadium was opened in September 1898, with the inaugural match on 3 September being against Brighton United. The first goal at the stadium was scored by Watty Keay, with the others from Abe Hartley, Jim McKenzie and Tom Smith, as Southampton won 4‚Äì1. It hosted an international match in 1901, as England defeated Ireland 3-0 in the 1900‚Äì01 British Home Championship. Redevelopment In 1927, the original West Stand was demolished (together with the club secretary's house) and the new West Stand was built. This was designed by Archibald Leitch, one of the greatest football stand designers of the day, who had also designed stands at Fratton Park, Roker Park and at Goodison Park. A year later, on the last day of the 1928‚Äì29 season a dropped cigarette caused a fire which destroyed the East Stand. A replacement stand was built which mirrored the West Stand, increasing the ground capacity to approximately 30,000. Wartime incidents On 30 November 1940, a German bomb fell on the stadium during the Blitz, creating an 18-foot crater in the Milton Road penalty area. While the pitch was being restored, Southampton had to play their remaining fixtures in 1940‚Äì41 away, although in February 1941, they played a \\"home\\" War Cup tie with Brentford at Fratton Park, Portsmouth. In March 1941, an explosion of munitions stored at the ground caused a major fire in the West Stand although this was rebuilt soon afterwards. At the start of the 1941‚Äì42 season they played their home games at Dew Lane, Eastleigh, before the Dell was re-opened in October 1941. Post- war Inside the Dell (Southampton draw 0‚Äì0 against Leicester City, March 1997) In 1950, the Dell became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. The first game played under the lights was on 31 October 1950, in a friendly against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, followed a year later by the first \\"official\\" match under floodlights, a Football Combination (Reserve team) match against Tottenham Hotspur on 1 October 1951. During the post-war years, huge crowds packed into the Dell. The attendance record was broken on 8 October 1969, when 31,044 watched Southampton lose 3‚Äì0 to a Manchester United team which included George Best and Bobby Charlton. The stadium hosted First Division football for the first time in the 1966-67 season, and would do so for all but four of the 35 seasons leading up to its closure. During this time, Southampton won the FA Cup in 1976, and achieved their highest league finish of second place in 1984. Further redevelopment In the 1980s, there were several changes at the ground, with the makeshift chocolate boxes at the Milton Road end being replaced by a new stand used for family ticket holders a two level concrete structure. The standing areas under the East and West stands being fitted with bench seats, before the Dell became an all-seater stadium in the early 1990s in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, which obliged all clubs in the top two English divisions had all-seater stadiums. New stands were erected at both ends of the stadium, but by the 1993‚Äì94 season the stadium now had a capacity of just over 15,000, the smallest in the top level of English football. The Milton Road Stand was notable for its wedge-like appearance. Final days By this time, Southampton were looking for a new home. By the mid-1990s it seemed as if the search was over as the club announced plans to move to a new stadium at Monks Brook playing fields near the village of North Stoneham, Eastleigh. However, the club fell into a dispute with the local council about the lack of community facilities. Many people in Eastleigh were also unhappy with having another town's football club in their area. The dispute was resolved when the chairman, Rupert Lowe, declared new plans for the club to move to a new 32,000-seat stadium, for a cost of ¬£32 million, on Brittania Road on the banks of the River Itchen. The move was confirmed at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season (when Southampton achieved a late escape from relegation for the sixth time in eight seasons) and work began soon afterwards. The new St Mary's Stadium was ready for the 2001‚Äì02 season. On 4 April 2001, the first ever Football Aid event took place at the Dell (including former players Jimmy Case and Peter Rodrigues). The last confirmed hat-trick was scored during this game by Bryn Thomas. On 19 May 2001, midfielder Matthew Le Tissier (who retired from playing a year later) said goodbye to the stadium that had been host to his entire professional career by scoring a volley in the final minutes of the final league game securing a 3‚Äì2 win against Arsenal. Le Tissier thus has the distinction of scoring the last competitive goal at The Dell. On 26 May, the club's fans said goodbye to the Dell by stripping all of its seats, the pitch and even an advertising board after Southampton's last game at the stadium, a 1‚Äì0 victory in a friendly against Brighton and Hove Albion, the first and last opponents at the stadium. The last goal ever scored at the Dell was by Uwe R√∂sler.= Flats on the site of 'The Dell'. The Dell was demolished later, completed on Friday 13 July 2001 by Portsmouth-based demolition company, Hughes & Salvidge.https://www.hughesandsalvidge.co.uk/news/final-whistle- blows-dell/ A housing estate was later built on the site by Barratt Homes.

Werdohl was long administrated in the Amt Neuenrade, however at the end of the 19th century the population of Werdohl was higher than those of the other municipalities in the Amt together. On June 1, 1891 Werdohl left the Amt and became self-administrated, after it failed to get the seat of the Amt administration to be moved to Werdohl. On April 19, 1936 the municipality received city rights. Coat of arms Church St Michael The coat of arms of Werdohl shows a rose, which was already present in the seal of the church. To the right are three chain segments, the symbol of the family Neuhoff, a noble family which resided in the municipality in the past. The bottom part shows the red-white chequered bordure as the symbols of the counts of the Mark. The first attempt of Werdohl to receive a coat of arms was started in 1915, when they asked Dr. Hildebrandt of the editorial staff of the Deutscher Herold in Berlin to create a concept for a coat of arms. The draft already resembled the later coat of arms, only the rose was in silver on black ground. However the war and then the end of monarchy in Germany delayed for several years. In 1929 Otto Hupp created two drafts of the coat of arms, one of which was then accepted by the municipality council on August 29, 1929. It later turned out that the coat of arms need to be officially granted, which happened on January 16, 1935. In 1936 the Landrat of Westphalia lobbied to have the coat of arms changed. He requested a draft from the heraldic Waldemar Mallek, which showed a Zeppelin in the top part, the chain in bottom, separated by the chequered bordure. It was however not accepted by the mayor of Werdohl, and was not pursued further. Economy Amongst the biggest employers headquartered in Werdohl are Schaeffler Engineering, a company of Schaeffler Group, nickel alloy producer VDM Metals and the technology company Vossloh, market leader for rail fasteners and switch systems. International relations Werdohl is twinned with: Since April 6, 1975 Werdohl has a city partnership with the English district Derwentside. Since August 10, 1990 it has a partnership with the city Stavenhagen in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

He had a long involvement with the Scout Movement, and was Chief Scout of the British Empire from 1942 until his death, in succession to Robert Baden-Powell. Early life Somers was born in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, the eldest son of Herbert Haldane Somers-Cocks and the former Blanche Clogstoun. His godfather was Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Somers' father died when he was seven years old. He succeeded a distant relative as Baron Somers at the age of twelve. He attended Charterhouse School before going on to New College, Oxford. He was an able cricketer, and played 17 first-class games. In 1904, whilst a schoolboy at Charterhouse, he made 115 against Westminster,Obituaries, 1944. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1945. and two years later he made his first-class debut for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Worcestershire, scoring 0 and 13. He rarely had enough time to play cricket, but in the 1920s he made a further 16 first-class appearances for Worcestershire, his highest score being 52 against Essex in May 1925. In later life he became both a vice-president of Worcestershire County Cricket Club and, in 1936, President of the MCC. Military career In 1906, Somers joined the 1st Regiment of Life Guards of the British Army, later taking leave to farm in Canada before rejoining his regiment in 1914 at the start of the First World War. He commanded the 6th Battalion of the new Tank Corps in 1918. He was twice wounded, mentioned in despatches, awarded the Military Cross, the Distinguished Service Order, and appointed to the French Legion of Honour.Australian Dictionary of Biography article on Lord Somers Governor of Victoria Somers was appointed Governor of Victoria in 1926, in succession to Lord Stradbroke. Aged 39, he was (and remains) one of the youngest holders of the office.

Re-opened in 1915 in its open space area in the city's Civic Center, it is a Beaux-Arts monument to the City Beautiful movement that epitomized the high-minded American Renaissance of the 1880s to 1917. The structure's dome is taller than that of the United States Capitol by 42 feet. The present building replaced an earlier City Hall that was destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, which was two blocks from the present one. It was bounded by Larkin Street, McAllister Street, and City Hall Avenue (a street, now built over, which ran from the corner of Grove and Larkin to the corner of McAllister and Leavenworth), largely where the current public library and U.N. Plaza stand today. The principal architect was Arthur Brown, Jr., of Bakewell & Brown, whose attention to the finishing details extended to the doorknobs and the typeface to be used in signage. Brown's blueprints of the building are preserved at the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Brown also designed the San Francisco War Memorial Opera House, Veterans Building, Temple Emanuel, Coit Tower and the Federal office building at 50 United Nations Plaza. __TOC__ Architecture Interior stairs lead to the Board of Supervisor's meeting chamber The building's vast open space is more than and occupies two full city blocks. It is between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street, and between Grove and McAllister Streets. Its dome, which owes much to Mansart's Baroque domes of the Val-de-Gr√¢ce (church) and Les InvalidesRough Guides; Edwards, Nick; Hodgkins, Charles; & Keeling, Stephen (2014) The Rough Guide to California Rough Guides Limited. in Paris, rises above the Civic Center Historic District. It is higher than the United States Capitol, and has a diameter of , resting upon 4 x 50 ton (44.5 metric ton) and 4 x 20 ton (17.8 metric ton) girders, each deep and long. The building as a whole contains 7,900 tons (7,035 metric tons) of structural steel from the American Bridge Company of Ambridge, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. It is faced with Madera County granite on the exterior, and Indiana sandstone within, together with finish marbles from Alabama, Colorado, Vermont, and Italy. Much of the statuary is by Henri Crenier. The grand staircase is a popular place for wedding gatherings The Rotunda is a spectacular space and the upper levels are public and handicapped accessible. Opposite the grand staircase, on the second floor, is the office of the Mayor. Bronze busts of former Mayor George Moscone and his successor, Dianne Feinstein, stand nearby as tacit reminders of the Moscone assassination, which took place just a few yards from that spot in the smaller rotunda of the mayor's office entrance. A bust of former county supervisor Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in the building was unveiled on May 22, 2008. While hard to discern these days, the inscription that dominates the grand Rotunda and the entrance to the mayor's small rotunda, right below Father Time, reads: SAN ‚Ä¢ FRANCISCO O ‚Ä¢ GLORIOVS ‚Ä¢ CITY ‚Ä¢ OF ‚Ä¢ OVR HEARTS ‚Ä¢ THAT ‚Ä¢ HAST ‚Ä¢ BEEN TRIED ‚Ä¢ AND ‚Ä¢ NOT ‚Ä¢ FOVND WANTING ‚Ä¢ GO ‚Ä¢ THOV ‚Ä¢ WITH LIKE ‚Ä¢ SPIRIT ‚Ä¢ TO ‚Ä¢ MAKE THE ‚Ä¢ FVTVRE ‚Ä¢ THINE 1912 JAMES ROLPH JR. MAYOR 1931http://www.monkeyview.net/id/877/beccastephywed/P3090056.vhtml The words were written by the previous Mayor Edward Robeson Taylor, and dedicated by Mayor James Rolph. While plaques at the Mall entrance memorialize President George Washington's farewell address and President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, the primary themes of the statuary are to the past mayors, with the dates of their terms in office. The medallions in the vaults of the Rotunda are of Equality, Liberty, Strength, Learning and, as memorialized in the South Light Court display, Progress. History The current City Hall building is a replacement for the original building, which was designed by Augustus Laver and Thomas Stent and completed in 1899 after 27 years of planning and construction. The original city hall was a much larger building which also contained a smaller extension which contained the city's Hall of Records. Noted city planner and architect Daniel Burnham published a plan in 1905 to redesign the city, including a new Civic Center complex around City Hall, but the plans were shelved in the wake of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed the 1899 City Hall. Reconstruction plans following the earthquake for the Civic Center complex called for a neo-classical design as part of the city beautiful movement, as well as a desire to rebuild the city in time for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition. A bond was authorized for $8.8 million on March 28, 1912, of which the new City Hall was budgeted for $3.5 million to $4 million. After Arthur Brown Junior's design was selected from the competition, construction started in 1913 and was completed by 1915, in time for the Exposition. Civic Auditorium (L) and New City Hall (R) under construction (circa 1916), with Civic Center Plaza in the foreground Ground was broken for the new City Hall at Van Ness and Fulton on April 5, 1913, and the cornerstone was laid on October 25 of that year. Mayor Rolph moved into City Hall on December 28, 1915, the final stone was laid on March 31, 1916, and scaffolding was finally removed on July 28, officially marking the end of construction. The ruins of the old City Hall were sold shortly thereafter in August 1916 for , with removal to be completed within 40 days. The main rotunda served as the site where many prominent politicians and public servants laid in state. General Fredrick Funston, hero of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and the 1906 earthquake laid there in 1917. Former mayor and governor James Rolph laid in state in City Hall following his death in 1934. Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe were married at City Hall in January 1954. In May 1960, the main Rotunda was a site of a student protest against the House Un-American Activities Committee and a countering police action whereby students from UC Berkeley, Stanford, and other local colleges were fire hosed down the steps beneath the rotunda. This event was memorialized by students during the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley four years later. Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated at City Hall in 1978, by former Supervisor Dan White. The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 damaged the structure, and twisted the dome four inches (102 mm) on its base. Afterward, under the leadership of the San Francisco Bureau of Architecture in collaboration with Carey & Co. preservation architects, and Forell/Elsesser Engineers, work was completed to render the building earthquake resistant through a base isolation system,In an earthquake, the mass of the dome threatens to act as a pendulum, rocking the building's structure and tearing it apart, but the base isolation system of hundreds of rubber and stainless-steel insulators inserted into City Hall's underpinnings should have the effect of disrupting seismic waves before they can affect the structure. which would likely prevent total collapse of the building. City Hall reopened after its seismic upgrade in January 1999, and was the world's largest base-isolated structure at that time. The city hall has attempted to recruit peregrine falcons to nest in aeries outside the dome. Pigeon droppings have to be periodically cleaned from the pair of glass- covered light wells that were covered with concrete at the height of modernism. The new city hall in nearby San Jose has already drawn at least one pair of falcons, discovered by Mayor Ron Gonzales himself as he saw pigeon feathers descend past a window during a meeting. The original grand plaza has undergone several extensive renovations, with radical changes in its appearance and utility. Prior to the 1960s there were extensive brick plazas, few trees, and a few large, simple, raised, and circular ponds with central fountains, all in a style that discouraged loitering. The plaza was then extensively excavated for underground parking. At this time a central rectangular pond, with an extensive array of water vents (strangely, all in several strict rows and all pointing east, with identical arcs of water, and completely without sculptural embellishment), was added, with extensive groves of trees (again, in 60s modernist style, planted with absolute military precision on rectangular grids). In the 1990s, with the rise of the problem of homelessness, the plaza was once again remodeled to make it somewhat less habitable‚Äîalthough the most significant change, the replacement of the pond and pumps with a lawn, could be reasonably justified on the basis of energy and water conservation. Election Day Martha Cohen, director of Special Events, has added color changeable LED lighting to the outside of the Rotunda, and between the exterior columns. The colors change to coincide with different events happening in the city and elsewhere. In popular culture The beauty of City Hall has not been lost on filmmakers working in San Francisco; many films have shot scenes in and around the building. Ironically, what may be the best-known scene was set in Washington, DC but filmed at San Francisco City Hall: in Raiders of the Lost Ark a late addition to the production was filmed in the rotunda when it was decided that a coda was needed for Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood's relationship. The City Hall was also prominently featured throughout and famously at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Dirty Harry filmed a key scene in the Mayor's office itself. In the opening sequence of The Towering Inferno, the film's dedication is superimposed over a shot of City Hall, and the helicopter taking Paul Newman to the Glass Tower is shown flying over the building. Other films that feature City Hall include: * Foul Play (1978) * A View to a Kill (1985) * Milk (2008) The scene from A View to a Kill (the last James Bond film to star Roger Moore) is particularly memorable for the blaze which tore through the building as a result of an attempt to kill Bond and Stacey Sutton, however they managed to escape, stealing a fire truck in the process. The building is featured as a peaceable landmark in the 2003 video game SimCity 4 See also * List of San Francisco Designated Landmarks * List of tallest buildings in San Francisco * List of tallest domes References Informational notes Citations External links * San Francisco City Hall ‚Äì official site ** Virtual tour on the official site * Virtual Tour of City Hall and Dome An unofficial guide to items of historic, artistic and architectural interest. * 360 degree panoramic photographs of San Francisco's City Hall, from Don Bain's 360¬∞ Panoramas * San Francisco government City hall restoration project * Historic American Buildings Survey (Library of Congress): City Hall, Civic Center, San Francisco, San Francisco County, CA * Images of City Hall and Civic Center, 1912-1918 and The New City Hall, 1915, The Bancroft Library * 3D model (Google sketchup/earth) Category:Arthur Brown Jr. buildings Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in California Category:Buildings and structures burned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake Category:City halls in California .City Hall Category:Government buildings completed in 1915 Category:Government buildings with domes Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in the United States San Francisco City Hall City Hall Category:Terminating vistas in the United States City Hall ","title":"San Francisco City Hall"},{"id":"920311","text":"Plaque honoring Woolman at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Collett Everman Woolman (October 8, 1889 - September 11, 1966), commonly known as C.E. Woolman, was an airline entrepreneur who led Delta Air Lines from its beginnings as a small, pioneering crop-dusting company to the Jet Age. Delta Air Lines Shortly after graduating from college, Woolman became an Agricultural Extension Agent at Louisiana State University. At the time, the Southern United States was battling a cotton-destroying pest, the boll weevil. Woolman observed the work of entomologist B.R. Coad, at the United States Department of Agriculture lab in Tallulah, Louisiana. Coad and his team used airplanes and pilots on loan from the Army to develop improved methods of applying calcium arsenate to rid cotton plants of boll weevils. Huff-Daland Aero Corporation, an aircraft manufacturer, took notice of their experiments and decided to form a new subsidiary for crop dusting, founded on March 2, 1925 in Macon, Georgia. In May 1925, Woolman joined the new division, called Huff Daland Dusters, as chief entomologist responsible for selling this experimental service. That summer, the headquarters were moved to Monroe, Louisiana, and their fleet grew to 18 crop dusters, the largest private aircraft fleet at the time. The need for crop dusting dramatically decreased when the summer growing season ended. To compensate, Woolman expanded dusting operations in early 1927 to Peru where the seasons are reversed from the U.S. While in Peru, Woolman began passenger air service in 1928, utilizing a unique agreement with Peruvian Airways Corporation. Although the arrangement did not last long, Woolman took the experience back to Louisiana. Back in Monroe, the parent company, now known as Keystone Aircraft Corp. was seeking to sell off its subsidiary. Woolman and banker Travis Oliver led local investors to purchase Huff Daland Dusters assets. The new company was incorporated as Delta Air Service on December 3, 1928, named after the Mississippi Delta region it served. Woolman was vice president and general manager. Passenger service began on June 17, 1929, from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with stops at Shreveport and Monroe, Louisiana. By June 1930, service had expanded east to Atlanta and west to Fort Worth, Texas. Passenger operations ceased in October 1930 when the air mail contract for the route Delta had pioneered was awarded to another airline, which purchased the assets of Delta Air Service. Local banker Travis Oliver, acting as trustee, C.E. Woolman and other local investors purchased back the crop-dusting assets of Delta Air Service and incorporated as Delta Air Corporation on December 31, 1930. Woolman was a member of the board of directors for Delta Air Service, and again when Delta Air Corporation formed its board in 1930. Delta secured an air mail contract and returned to airline operations in 1934. Doing business as Delta Air Lines over Mail Route 24, stretching from Ft. Worth, Texas, to Charleston, South Carolina. The company name officially changed to Delta Air Lines in 1945. Although Delta Air Lines kept a crop-dusting division until 1966, by 1938 expanding airmail and passenger service operations begin earning more than crop-dusting profits. Over the next several decades, Woolman led Delta Air Lines as general manager, becoming president in 1945. He was named Delta's chairman and chief executive officer from November 1, 1965 until his death on September 11, 1966. A retired Delta pilot recalls one encounter with Woolman: > One additional gentleman and his wife were traveling in first class ATL- DCA > with a stop in CLT while I was a brand new Flight Engineer on a DC-7. After > landing in CLT, the agent came and told the Captain that we were oversold > and he had to take one passenger off.

After starting those big old Wright 3350's I leaned forward > and looked out of the Captain's window to see Mr. C. E. Woolman, Principal > Founder and President of Delta Air Lines, standing there waving goodbye to > us. Personal life Woolman was born in Bloomington, Indiana, United States but grew up in Urbana, Illinois, where he attended high school. Between college semesters in 1909, Woolman attended the world's first aviation meet in Rheims, France, where his passion for aviation began. He graduated from the University of Illinois, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in agriculture. Woolman married Helen H. Fairfield in 1916 with whom he had two daughters. By 1920, they had moved to Monroe in northeastern Louisiana. Death Woolman died, aged 76, on September 11, 1966, in Houston, Texas. Legacy Following his death, several memorials have been made in his honor. A reconditioned 1925 Huff Daland Duster was presented to the Smithsonian Institution by employees of Delta. Another memorial sits at the entrance to Delta's Technical Operations Center in Atlanta. In 1992 he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1994 he was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame. References * * Woolman, C. E. Woolman, C. E. Woolman, C. E. Woolman, C.E. Woolman, C.E.

Lowe was chairman of Southampton Football Club from 1996 to 2006 and then again from 2008 to 2009, when the company was placed into administration.  Early life and career  Born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, England\\"LOWE Rupert J G / HUINS\\" in Register of Births for Oxford Registration District, vol. 6b (1959), p. 1313 Rupert Lowe was educated at Radley College and the University of Reading before gaining a reputation working in the City of London for companies such as Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche Bank. He was also a board member of the London International Financial Futures Exchange. He founded Secure Retirements, a quoted care home provider, with Andrew Cowen, later the Southampton F.C. Vice-Chairman.  Football career  = Southampton Football Club = In the mid-1990s, the Saints board were looking to float the club on the London Stock Exchange, a long and costly procedure. Therefore, they attempted a reverse takeover as a way to reduce costs. They needed to find a company that had already floated and take it over while effectively being taken over themselves. Lowe's Secure Retirements, which ran nursing homes, was a perfect candidate. The resultant group was renamed Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC. After the deal was completed, Lowe became chairman of the football club. This was despite him being an avid rugby union watcher and hockey player, who had only seen his first professional football game six months previously. Southampton fans were initially undecided about Lowe. He had vast business expertise, a vital trait for any chairman of a football club, but he also knew hardly anything about the game. In contrast, clubs including Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers had recently been taken over by lifelong fans who had made their wealth in various industries before switching their investments to football. In the summer of 1997, manager Graeme Souness left after just one season in charge, as did director of football and former manager Lawrie McMenemy. Both men cited 'difficulties' with the new owners. This came as a huge shock to many fans and to the local press, who regarded McMenemy as 'Mr. Southampton'; he had previous managed the club from 1973 to 1985, guiding it to FA Cup glory in 1976 and finishing as high as second in the league in 1984. Lowe, however, did much to move the club forward. He guided the club from their old stadium into the 32,000-seater St Mary's Stadium, which opened in 2001, and the club continued to follow a long- standing policy of selling players to clubs for high prices. Dean Richards, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for ¬£8 million, and Kevin Davies, who was sold to Blackburn Rovers for ¬£7 million, are good examples. Davies was subsequently bought back by Southampton for a much smaller fee. James Beattie joined the club for ¬£1 million from Blackburn Rovers, enjoyed great form at Southampton, and later joined Everton for ¬£6 million. During his ownership of the club, the Saints managed to maintain their Premier League status into the 21st century, despite having been in regular relegation battles since the early 1990s and rarely finishing in the top half of the table. His timing of managerial decisions were somewhat alarming and inconsistent, however, as there were eight managers during his tenure, a very high turnover rate. Dave Jones was forced out in January 2000 when faced with a criminal investigation, even though Jones was later exonerated of all charges. Jones was succeeded by Glenn Hoddle, who left just over a year later to join Tottenham Hotspur, amid criticism from Southampton fans that he had turned his back on the club. Lowe then appointed a talented coach, Stuart Gray, but Gray was swiftly replaced by Gordon Strachan after a disastrous start to the 2001‚Äì02 season. Strachan guided the Saints to a secure 11th-place finish. In 2003, Saints went on to reach the FA Cup Final and qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time in nearly 20 years, also finishing eighth in the league ‚Äì their highest finish for well over a decade. In the following season they were lying fourth in the league at Christmas, but it soon emerged that Gordon Strachan was refusing to extend his contract citing \\"personal reasons\\". Strachan resigned in March 2004, and Lowe and the board took the decision to replace him with Paul Sturrock before the end of the season. Sturrock himself left the club by \\"mutual consent\\" within six months of being appointed, despite achieving good results during his time in charge. It is understood that Lowe attempted to interfere in team selection after consulting Rugby Union coach Sir Clive Woodward, who was being approached about a possible role at the club at the time. Lowe seemingly made the same mistake as he did with Stuart Gray by employing a good coach in (Steve Wigley), who seemed to lack the steely will needed for a manager to succeed at the highest level. Like the appointment of Gray three years earlier, Lowe appeared to be taking a huge gamble by employing another untested coach, and allegedly exploited his own influence by indulging himself more and more in team affairs, including the much documented \\"Delgado Affair\\". The appointment of Wigley also broke Premiership rules requiring all managers to have the relevant coaching qualifications. With the team's form deteriorating and relegation looking like a real possibility for the first time in three years, Lowe sacked Wigley in November of the same year. Wigley was replaced, to much furore, by former Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp. The appointment of an experienced manager in Redknapp led to expectations that results would improve, but they were actually worse in the second half of the season than in the first, and the club was relegated on the last day of the season after 27 years in the top flight of English football. With relegation, a 50% wage cut was imposed on most players and staff, after a mediocre start to the new season, Redknapp resigned as manager citing personal reasons and a wish for a break from football, but he quickly re-joined Southampton's rivals Portsmouth. George Burley was appointed as manager in December 2005, while former England rugby union coach Sir Clive Woodward, who had been brought into the club only a year beforehand, was promoted to the senior position of Director of Football. Although supporters approved of bringing in new techniques that had worked in other sports, this move was once again seen by many fans as gambling the club's status with another experiment. The club were unable to mount a push for promotion back to the Premiership. On 30 June 2006, Lowe resigned under huge pressure from club supporters, including the newly formed Saints Trust, following the club's failure to win promotion back to the Premiership. Michael Wilde, a new investor in Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC, led a new team of directors in taking over the club. The Saints were beaten in the 2006‚Äì07 Championship playoffs, and failed to mount a promotion challenge the following season. In July 2008, Lowe returned as Southampton Leisure Holdings plc chairman. At an AGM on 23 December 2008, Lowe received several calls to resign from former chairman Leon Crouch and from fans and shareholders at the meeting. Also, thirty silver coins were thrown in the direction of Lowe by fan Richard Chorley, who was thrown out of the meeting. After Lowe's return, protests took place against his role at the club. On 2 April 2009, Southampton Leisure Holdings PLC was put into administration, resulting in Lowe's resignation from the board. The club was relegated to League One shortly afterwards, but under its new owners reached the Premier League just three years afterwards. =Garforth Town= In December 2012, Lowe purchased Garforth Town of the Northern Premier League, along with the franchise operation of Socatots & Brazilian Soccer Schools linking up again with Simon Clifford, who had been employed as a Southampton coach in 2005. = Football powerbroker = Lowe has served as a member of the Football Association Board as a Premier League representative and as an FA Councillor.

Design The L.59 was the culmination of work done by Carlo Lualdi throughout the 1950s, and was an enlarged version of his earlier two-seat designs. The L.59 featured four seats accommodated in an extensively glazed cabin. Of conventional pod-and-boom design with skid landing gear, the aircraft had the slightly unusual feature of having its engine mounted in the nose, turning the main rotor by a long driveshaft that reached through the cabin. Production and operation Lualdi was able to interest Macchi in the design and two Macchi-built prototypes began flight tests in 1960. Civil certification was achieved in August the following year. Although faultless, the performance of the L.59 was not comparable with that of other helicopters on the market at the time. Macchi planned an initial production batch of 50 machines, but only a single example was sold - one of the prototypes was purchased by the Italian Army for evaluation purposes. No order resulted. The prototype was exhibited at the 1963 Paris Air Show, but again, no orders were obtained for the type.

He held these posts until his retirement in 1879. He was nicknamed Woody Fibre. Early life He was the son of Andrew Balfour, an Army Surgeon who had returned to Edinburgh to set up a printing and publishing business. Balfour was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh and then studied at St Andrews University and the University of Edinburgh, graduating with degrees of M.A. and then M.D., the latter in 1832. In Edinburgh, he became a notable member of the Plinian Society, where he encountered the phrenologist William A.F. Browne and entered the vigorous debates concerning natural history and theology. His original intention had been to seek ordination in the Church of Scotland but instead he started medical practice in Edinburgh in 1834 after studying abroad. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1835, aged only 26. He was one of their longest serving members. He was General Secretary 1860-1879 and Vice President 1881-3. Botany With an interest in botany, Balfour was prominent in the foundation of both the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1836 (serving as President in 1845‚Äì46) and the Edinburgh Botanical Club in 1838. In 1841 he began giving lectures in Edinburgh's extramural school on botany with some success. In 1842 he was appointed Professor of Botany at the University of Glasgow. In 1845, Balfour transferred to take the chair of Botany at the University of Edinburgh, a position he held until 1879. He was also nominated keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh and Her Majesty's Botanist. These appointments followed a protracted political struggle in which Balfour triumphed over his distinguished opponent, Joseph Dalton Hooker, a close associate of Charles Darwin. Balfour served for many years as dean of the faculty of medicine in the University of Edinburgh and he was an enormously successful teacher of botany, lacing his scientific lectures with theological asides, as he remained profoundly wedded to natural theology. In January 1862, he corresponded with Charles Darwin on botanical matters, recollecting their evenings together at the Plinian Society with his brother-in-law William A.F. Browne. He also corresponded with the extraordinary and irascible botanist Hewett Cottrell Watson, an early phrenologist, evolutionist and advocate of the differential development of the human cerebral hemispheres. Under Balfour's care the Royal Botanic Garden was enlarged and improved and a palm-house, arboretum, and teaching accommodation were built. His publications include botanical text- books such as Manual of Botany (1848), Class Book of Botany (1852), Outlines of Botany (1854), Elements of Botany for Schools (1869), Botanist's Companion (1860), Introduction to Palaeontological Botany (1872), and The Plants of Scripture. He also contributed to the article on botany in the 8th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Balfour retired from his academic post in 1879. His son, Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour (1853‚Äì1922), became a distinguished botanist in his own right, serving as Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford University from 1884 to 1888, before returning to his father's old Chair at Edinburgh. California's foxtail pine is named Pinus balfouriana Balf. after him. Later life From 1877 he lived in Inverleith House within the then newly extended Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh in his role there as Regius Keeper. He died in Inverleith House and was buried in Warriston Cemetery with his wife Marion Spottiswood Balfour. The grave lies on the north side of the main upper east- west path, towards its western end. Family He married Marion Spottiswood Bayley (1828-1879). Their sons were Cpt. Andrew Francis Balfour RN (1851‚Äì1906) and Isaac Bayley Balfour (1853‚Äì1922). Balfour's sister, Magdelene Balfour, married William A. F. Browne (1805‚Äì1885), the phrenologist and asylum reformer. Balfour was uncle to Sir Andrew Balfour specialist in tropical medicine who was the first Director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1923 and was a close friend of Sir Patrick Manson, founder of the School. According to Sir Andrew Balfour in a speech he made to the London Royal Free Hospital, School of Medicine for Women in 1928, John Hutton Balfour was often referred as 'Woody Fibre'. His great-great-granddaughter is actress Tilda Swinton.

His remarkable navigational skills and Pacific geographical knowledge were to be utilised by Lt. James Cook, R.N. when he took him aboard HMS Endeavour as guide on its voyage of exploration to Terra Australis Incognita. Tupaia travelled with Cook to New Zealand, acting as the expedition's interpreter to the Polynesian MƒÅori, and Australia. He died in December 1770 from a shipborne illness contracted when Endeavour was docked in Batavia for repairs ahead of its return journey to England. Early Life Tupaia was born at Ha'amanino Harbour on Ra'iatea around 1725 and became a leading ariori priest for the Taputapuatea marae. Tupaia was trained in the fare-'ai-ra'a-'upu, or schools of learning, about the origin of the cosmos, genealogies, the calendar, proverbs and histories. He was also taught how to be a star navigator. His memorized knowledge included island lists, including their size, reef and harbor locations, whether they were inhabited, and if so, the name of the chief and any food produced there. More importantly, his memory would include the bearing of each island, the time to get there, and the succession of stars and islands to follow to get there. These islands included the Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Cook Islands, plus Samoa, Tonga, Tokelau and Fiji. Bora Bora warriors invaded Ra'iatea around 1763, wounding Tupaia and forcing him to flee to Tahiti, where he sought protection from the Papara chief Amo and his wife Purea. Tupaia soon became their advisor and high priest, and eventually Purea's lover. Tupaia befriended Samuel Wallis during his observation of a solar eclipse, and then Joseph Banks during the 1769 Transit of Venus observed from Tahiti. After which, Tupaia \\"attached himself to the British,\\" according to Anne Salmond. Tupaia was also an artist, and ten watercolors of his survive.  Joining Endeavour  Tupaia joined Endeavour in July 1769 when it passed his home island of Ra'iatea in the outward voyage from Plymouth. He was welcomed aboard at the insistence of Sir Joseph Banks, the Cook expedition's official botanist, on the basis of his evident skill as a navigator and mapmaker: when asked for details of the region Tupaia drew a chart showing all 130 islands within a radius and was able to name 74 of them. Banks welcomed the Raiatean's interest in travelling with Endeavour to England where he could be presented as an anthropological curiosity. Australian academic Vanessa Smith has speculated that Banks also envisaged conversation, amusement and possibly a genuine friendship from Tupaia's company during the voyage. As Cook at first refused to allow Tupaia to join the expedition for financial reasons, Banks agreed to be responsible for the Raiatean's welfare and upkeep while on board.  Expedition and Tupaia's Map  Tupaia's map, c. 1769. As Cook intended to spend several weeks in the Society Islands before heading south, Tupaia assisted the expedition as an interlocutor and interpreter with local tribes. He also worked closely with Banks in compiling an account of Tahiti and its inhabitants. On August 15 1769, Tupaia began to work on a Chart of the Pacific Ocean in collaboration with Cook, Banks, and several of Cook's officers. Older research summarized by Joan Druett assumed that Tupaia's own voyaging experience was limited. It holds that Tupaia had navigated from Ra'iatea in short voyages to 13 islands shown on the resulting map. He had not visited western Polynesia, as since his grandfather‚Äôs time the extent of voyaging by Raiateans had diminished to the islands of eastern Polynesia. His grandfather and father had passed to Tupaia the knowledge as to the location of the major islands of western Polynesia and the navigation information necessary to voyage to Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. It was also assumed that Cook was less pleased than Banks with Tupaia's evident navigational skills, resolving instead to rely on his own exploration of the region. More recent research challenged the view that Tupaia's travels in the wider region were limited, and questioned Cook's failing appreciation of Tupaia as misinterpretations of the source material. In an extended reading of Tupaia's Map, Lars Eckstein and Anja Schwarz propose that Tupaia had detailed navigational knowledge which extended throughout the Polynesian triangle (with the probable exception of only Aotearoa New Zealand). The chart he drew for James Cook in August 1769 shows interconnected voyaging routes ranging from Rotuma west of Samoa, via Samoa and Tonga, the southern Cook Islands and the Austral Group, Mangareva and Pitcairn all the way to Rapa Nui. A second major composite route leads from Tahiti through the Tuamotu Group to the Marquesas Group and on to Oahu in Hawai'i. Tupaia invented a cartographic system for Cook and his men which located a northern bearing from any island he drew in the centre of his Chart (marked by the word 'avatea', this is '[the sun at] noon'). This allowed him to translate his own wayfinding knowledge for island- to-island voyages into the logic and terms of Cook's compass. The Admiralty manuscript of James Cook's journal indicates that Tupaia told Cook that he himself (or his ancestors) travelled to most islands drawn on the Chart excepting only Rotuma (north of Fiji) and Oahu in Hawai'i.

History of New Zealand , Penguin Books. Pages 103 & 106 It seems that they presented him with a precious dog-skin cloak. Many Maori people have tales including Tupaia and his lineage that remains in New Zealand today. The crew of Endeavour had developed a less favorable impression of their shipmate. One, midshipman Joseph Marra, recorded that: > \\" Toobia ... was a man of real genius, a priest of the first order, and an > excellent artist: he was, however, by no means beloved by the Endeavours > crew, being looked upon as proud and austere, extorting homage, which the > sailors who thought themselves degraded by bending to an Indian , were very > unwilling to pay, and preferring complaints against them on the most trivial > occasions.\\" Tupaia landed at Botany Bay, Australia, in late April 1770. Cook said of Tupaia, \\"...by means of Tupaia...you would always get people to direct you from Island to Island and would be sure of meeting with a friendly resception and refreshments at every Island you came to.\\"  Death in Batavia  A Maori man and Joseph Banks exchanging a crayfish for a piece of cloth, drawing by Tupaia, c. 1769 Tupaia died on 20 December 1770. This date is confirmed in the muster records of Endeavour. Other dates are suggested by the journals of Joseph Banks and James Cook. Joseph Banks‚Äôs journal has an entry for 11 November, in which he wrote ‚ÄúWe receivd the news of Tupias death‚Äù. However, Banks was ill for much of his time at Batavia, and wrote many entries later on, using incorrect dates. James Cook‚Äôs journal has an entry for 26 December, in which he wrote ‚Äúwe lost... Tupia‚Äù. However, this entry is a summary of several events that occurred during the stay in Batavia. Tupaia died from either dysentery or malaria, both of which were present aboard Endeavour during its berthing for repairs in Batavia. Cook recorded his passing in his journal: \\"He was a Shrewd, Sensible, Ingenious Man, but proud and obstinate which often made his situation on board both disagreeable to himself and those about him, and tended much to promote the deceases that put a period to his life.\\" Aftermath When Cook returned to New Zealand in 1773, the Maori approached his ship shouting \\"Tupaia! Tupaia!\\". As Cook noted, \\"...the Name of Tupia was at that time so popular among them that it would be no wonder if at this time it is known over the great part of New Zealand.\\" Notes Further reading * Druett, Joan (2011).

Sultan was born in Oxford, Mississippi, and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1907. He entered the United States Army Corps of Engineers and rose through the ranks, teaching engineering at West Point from 1912 to 1916, before travelling to the Philippines. He oversaw construction of fortifications on various islands, and eventually was in charge of all US Army fortification work in the Philippines. He then served on the War Department General Staff and the general staff of the American Expeditionary Forces until 1922. Sultan led the Nicaragua Canal Survey and commanded American troops in the country from 1929 to 1931, when he returned to the United States and wrote a report on the canal. Sultan next was district engineer in Chicago, leading construction of the Great Lakes to Mississippi Waterway to July 1934. He was then involved in various commissions in Washington DC, and served as engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia. In late 1938, he took command of the 2d Regiment of Engineers, and eventually rose to lead the Hawaiian Division in early 1941. Sultan had various other commands during early World War II, including the 38th Infantry Division and VII Corps. In 1943, he was made deputy commander of the China-Burma-India Theater, and assumed command of the Burma-India Theater in October 1944. In 1945, he was made Inspector General of the United States Army, and served in that position until his death in 1947. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal four times, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Sultan as a West Point cadet  Early life  Sultan was born on December 9, 1885 in Oxford, Mississippi, to a planter. After attending the University of Mississippi from 1901 to 1903, he attended the United States Military Academy from June 15, 1903 to June 14, 1907, becoming an All-American as a center in football. He graduated 9th in a class of 111.  Early military service  He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers upon graduation, and served in the Third Battalion of Engineers at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from September 14 to October 1, 1908. He then was stationed at the Washington Barracks from October 3, 1908, to August 24, 1912. While there, Sultan graduated from the Engineer School on February 23, 1910; was the secretary of school from September 7, 1909, to April 12, 1912; was adjutant of the First Battalion of Engineers from October 1, 1909, to April 12, 1912; was a member of the Board on Engineer Troops from March 1 to September 7, 1912; and was promoted to first lieutenant on February 27, 1911. Sultan taught at West Point in the department of engineering from August 24, 1912, to July 18, 1916, and was made a captain on February 27, 1914. In September 1916, he was sent to Fort Mills, on Corregidor Island in the Philippines, where he was in charge of the construction and maintenance of fortifications on Corregidor, Caballo and Grande Islands. While there, he was made a major on May 15, 1917 and a temporary lieutenant-colonel on August 5, 1917. Sultan served in that capacity until October 18, 1917, when he was moved to Manila and placed in charge of all Philippines fortification work on October 19. He left Manila on January 14, 1918, and returned to the United States. On January 21, he was assigned to the War Department General Staff, and served on the staff in Washington, D.C. from March 4, 1918, to June 1919, during which time he was made a colonel on July 13, 1918. Sultan was assigned to duty as general staff officer at the headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces in France from June 1919, to October 1919, when he returned to duty with the War Department General Staff at Washington, D. C.. He was relieved from duty as a general staff officer on January 20, 1922, but continued on with the general staff until August 1922. He had returned to the rank of major on 15, 1920. For his work as a general staff member, Sultan was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.  Later military service  Sultan was then at Fort Leavenworth as a student officer at the Command and General Staff School from August 1922 to July 1923, and graduated as a 'honor graduate'. He moved to Savannah, Georgia and was the district engineer, in charge of all river and harbor improvements and fortifications in the region, from August 1923 to August 1925. Sultan attended the Army War College from August 1925 to July 1926; and was then a resident member of Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors in Washington, DC from July 1926 to August 1929. = Nicaragua survey = Sultan traveled to Nicaragua from August 20 to 29, arriving in Corinto and making his way to Granada. He charge of the Nicaragua Canal Survey and commanding US Army troops in Nicaragua beginning in August 1929. The survey gradually made its way through the country, finishing its work in the summer of 1931. On March 31, 1931, Managua was hit by a devastating earthquake. Sultan organized a relief team of 34 soldiers, and was on an emergency committee for responding. He was charged with overseeing the restoration of railroads and water to the city, and chaired a food relief committee that provided 24,000 rations daily by April 24. While in Nicaragua, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on October 1, 1930, and was made a member of the Interoceanic Canal Board on March 31. Sultan's command ended in July 1931, and he soon returned to Washington, DC. Sultan then worked on a report about the survey from August 1931 to January 1932. He concluded in a document published as a congressional document that ‚ÄúA canal through Nicaragua will aid our national defense, will foster friendly relations with all Latin America, and will promote trade with Central and South America. It will provide a shorter route from port to port for about two-thirds of the traffic now using the Panama Canal.‚Äù He also published an article about the survey in National Geographic Magazine. Sultan was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his work in Nicaragua, particularly for his response to the earthquake. He was also awarded the Nicaraguan Congressional Medal of Distinction and Presidential Medal of Merit. = Commissioner = He was then made district engineer in Chicago, leading construction of the Great Lakes to Mississippi Waterway until July 1934, during which time he was also the administrator of the Civil Works Administration in Cook County, Illinois. From July to September 1934 he worked with the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. Sultan then worked as engineer commissioner of the District of Columbia, a member of the National Capital Park and Planning Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, the Unemployment Compensation Board, and chairman of the Zoning Commission until September 1938. He was made a colonel on October 1, 1935 and vice-chairman of committee that arranged the inauguration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in January 1937. = World War II = Sultan then commanded the 2d Regiment of Engineers from October to December 1, 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general on December 1. He commanded Fort Logan, Colorado until June 1939, and led the 22nd Infantry Brigade from July 1939 to February 1941. He led the Hawaiian Division from February 1941 to April 1941, and was promoted to major general on April 3, 1941. Sultan was in command of the 38th Infantry Division from May 1941 to April 1942, and led the VIII Corps until November 1943. He was then ordered to the China-Burma-India Theater in 1943 to act as deputy commander under General Joseph Stilwell. As deputy commander stationed in Allied-controlled New Delhi, Sultan focused largely on logistical issues, ensuring that sufficient supplies arrived in China, particularly by airlifting goods over the Himalayas and constructing the Ledo Road. He was promoted to lieutenant general on September 2, 1944 and on October 24 became commander of the India-Burma Theater. As commander, Sultan was under the authority of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command, and also served as commander of the Chinese Army in India. Sultan personally led a force of American, British and Chinese forces, known as the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC). In 1944, the Allies formulated a plan, known as Operation Capital, to retake Northern Burma and reopen a land route to China. In early 1945, the NCAC was split into the 30th, 38th, and 50th Chinese Divisions; the British 36th Division, on loan from the Fourteenth Army; and the recently activated American 5332d Brigade (Provisional). Sultan's troops traveled south, as part of the during the Burma campaign, from Myitkyina, forcing the Japanese Thirty-Third Army back. His forces took control of the Burma Road, reopening it in January 1945. For his service as commander, he was awarded a third oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal, and the Legion of Merit. Returning to the United States June 26, 1945, he was appointed Inspector General of the Army on July 9. Sultan died January 14, 1947 at Washington, D.C., while on active duty. Sultan was awarded his fourth oak leaf cluster to the Distinguished Service Medal as inspector general, the first army officer to do so. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (United Kingdom) and granted the Order of the Cloud and Banner with Special Grand Cordon. After his death he was awarded the Air Medal. Legacy The United States Navy transport ship was named in his honor.

It is the eighth-brightest member of Orion with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.77 and also the brightest member of the asterism known as Orion's Sword. It is a member of the NGC 1980 open cluster. From parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of roughly from the Sun. The system has three visible components designated Iota Orionis A, B and C. Iota Orionis A is itself a massive spectroscopic binary, with components Iota Orionis Aa (officially named Hatysa ) and Ab.  Nomenclature  Œπ Orionis (Latinised to Iota Orionis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the three constituents as Iota Orionis A, B and C, and those of A's components - Iota Orionis Aa and Ab - derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The system has the traditional name Nair al Saif, from the Arabic ŸÜŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸäŸÅ nayyir as- sayf \\"the Bright One of the Sword\\", though this is little used. Since Beƒçv√°≈ô's 1951 Atlas Coeli, it has borne the proper name Hatysa. Kunitzsch was unable to find an older source for the latter name. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Hatysa for the component Iota Orionis Aa on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU- approved Star Names. Iota Orionis B is a variable star and in 2011 it was given the variable star designation V2451 Orionis.  Distance  Œπ Orionis is the bright star to the right (south) of the Orion Nebula Iota Orionis has a parallax of in the Hipparcos new reduction, indicating a distance around . The previous published Hipparcos parallax was , suggesting a closer distance. Gaia Data Release 2 has individual parallaxes for the two fainter components of the Iota Orionis star system of and , indicating distances of and respectively, with margins of error of just a few parsecs. There is little doubt that all three stars are at the same distance. Iota Orionis is generally assumed to be associated with the open cluster NGC 1980, which is at a distance of around . However, they may not lie at exactly the same distance and Iota Orionis may have a complex history involving stellar encounters and runaway stars. NGC 1980 contains few bright stars other than Iota Orionis. Only eighteen other stars are considered members in a survey down to 14th magnitude, most of them around 9th magnitude but including the 5th magnitude stars HR 1886 and 1887.  Properties  Iota Orionis is dominated by Iota Orionis A whose two components are a stellar class O9 III star (blue giant) and a class B0.8 III/IV star about 2 magnitudes fainter. The combined spectral type has long been accepted as O9 III and it was listed as a standard star for that type. The collision of the stellar winds from this pair makes the system a strong X-ray source. Oddly, the two objects of this system appear to have different ages, with the secondary being about double the age of the primary. In combination with the high eccentricity (e=0.764) of their 29-day orbit, this suggests that the binary system was created through a capture, rather than by being formed together and undergoing a mass transfer. This capture may have occurred, for example, through an encounter between two binary systems, with one star being donated from each binary and two runaway stars being ejected. The primary component of Iota Orionis A is a class O giant star with a mass of about . It has a surface temperature of and radius of , resulting in a bolometric luminosity of . It is calculated to be around nine million years old. The secondary star of the spectroscopic binary pair is a class B giant or subgiant with a mass of about . It has a temperature of and radius of , resulting in it radiating over 8,000 times as much energy as the sun. Iota Orionis B is a B8 giant at 11\\" (approximately 5,000 AU) which has been shown to be variable, and likely to be a young stellar object. It is also a helium- weak chemically peculiar star. The fainter Iota Orionis C is an A0 star at 49\\".

Biography  Magnago was born in Merano, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on 5 February 1914. In 1936 he graduated from the grammar school of the Franciscans in Bolzano. He studied law at the University of Bologna and graduated with a JD in June 1940. Because of his rejection of Italian Fascism he chose to move to Germany in 1939, but remained first in South Tyrol, where he worked in Bolzano for a commission to estimate the assets of the Tyroleans following the South Tyrol Option Agreement. He was eventually called in the German Army as a lieutenant, and sent to the Eastern Front, where a severe injury lead to the amputation of his left leg. In the postwar period Magnago started his political activities in the municipal council of Bolzano as a member of the newly founded South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP). From 1948 to 1952 he acted as the city's vice-mayor. In 1948, he was also elected for the first time to the Landtag of South Tyrol and Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige, where he remained until 1988. Magnago became chairman (Obmann) of his party in 1957, and held that function until 1991. In 1957, Magnago was the central figure of a strategic turn of his party: Up to that year the South Tyrolean People's Party had unsuccessfully tried to gain some margins of self-governance via a soft policy of alliances with the governing Democrazia Cristiana. Under the new leader and new motto Los von Trient (i.e. away from Trento, with regard to the regional capital) the SVP started to take a harder line, in order to obtain a devolution of powers to the provincial level of administration. From 1960 to 1989 Magnago was the governor (Landeshauptmann) of the autonomous province of South Tyrol. His major political success was the commencement of the second Statute of Autonomy in 1972, which distinctly extended South Tyrol's legislative and executive competencies. Due to his long-time commitment to self-governance of his native province, he is widely regarded as the father of the South Tyrolean autonomy. After suffering from Parkinson's disease for several years, Magnago died in Bolzano on 25 May 2010.  Bibliography  * Hans Benedikter: Silvius Magnago: ein Leben f√ºr S√ºdtirol.

It lies on the west side of the confluence of the Bow Creek stretch of the Lea, and the River Thames. The neighbourhood consists of two small peninsulas, separated from the rest of Poplar by both the river and the remaining part of the East India Docks and became more seen as part of Canning Town. The northern peninsula lies in a hairpin meander and is named Goodluck Hope after one of the adjacent reaches of the Lea, while the other is known as Orchard Place. The area was long referred to locally as Bog Island, due to its inaccessibility and propensity to flood; however the building of the Thames Barrier and the artificial raising of the more vulnerable riverside land, means the nickname refers to a now much reduced threat. History This area of Poplar was traditionally the easternmost part of Middlesex. The area has never had its own Anglican church so for services such as road maintenance organised by a vestry and poor relief it relied upon its ecclesiastical parish (of All Saints) Poplar.Church of England Website Poplar ecclesiastical parish map Indeed, the whole Isle of Dogs was until the late 20th century referred to as being Poplar or the Poplar District.A Survey of London 1994, Hermione Hobhouse (Gen. Ed.) Orchard Place was the name of its manor house on the spit; this had become an eponymous public house from 1800-60\\\\. When the docks were constructed, the area became isolated, with the only access via the dock road, from Poplar. Residents were engaged at the glass works, the iron and engineering works, or the Samuda Brothers, Orchard House Yard and Thames Iron Works ship yards. When the Thames Plate Glass Works closed in 1874, many of the hands - who had migrated to the area from Tyneside and St Helens in the 1840s - followed the glassworks to New Albany, Indiana. To house the workers, there were about 100 small two-storied cottages - built from the 1820s and condemned in 1935.The cottages typically consisted of four rooms and a wash- house. There was the Bow Creek school (founded in 1865), but few shops, and The Crown, a public house, opened about 1840.Charles Lammin Memories of Orchard House (East London History Society, 1961) By the late 19th century the vicinity of Orchard Place had become a deprived area and was inhabited by rough and very poor people who were living in overcrowded conditions. In the late 1930s, all homes and shops were demolished in a slum clearing project with residents were moved out of the area.https://www.hidden- london.com/gazetteer/leamouth/amp/ The London City Island is a major redevelopment project by architects Glenn Howells that will provide 1,706 homes, stores, shops, restaurants, caf√©s, and arts facilities including the English National Ballet and London Film School. Geography One street, Orchard Place, runs through the former industrial area and the Lower Lea Crossing crosses the narrow strip of land between the two tongues. The northern part was principally occupied by Pura Foods Ltd vegetable oil refinery - on the site of the former Thames Plate Glass Works; and the south by engineering works, shipyards (Thames Iron Works and Orchard House Yard) and Trinity Buoy Wharf which contains London's only lighthouse. There are also live-work units, many in the form of the Container Cities. The \\"Jubilee\\" pedestrian bridge across the Lea links the area to the east bank of the Lea, and Canning Town station. Industry Warships being built at the eastern site in or slightly before 1902 Known as Leamouth Wharf, one of it most significant industries was the shipyard and iron works site called Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, which was based at the mouth of Bow Creek right at its confluence with the River Thames.Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44, Leamouth Wharf edited by Hermione Hobhouse, 1994 Little industry remains in Leamouth today. One of the last survivors, the Pura Foods edible oil works, in a loop of Bow Creek at Orchard Place, closed down in 2006. This site had once been occupied by the Thames Plate Glass Works. For many years the sugar firm Fowler's, a significant maker of treacle, was in Leamouth. Access The Leamouth Peninsula has historically had poor transport links compared to the rest of Poplar, today it is connected to it by a main road splitting its halves: the A1020 Lower Lea Crossing which is a local by-pass of the A13. Leamouth has been served by the London Buses network for the first time by the D3 to Bethnal Green which starts and ends on Orchard Place since 2017.Bus Services Changes 19 August to 8 October inclusive Transport for London The N550 between Canning Town station and Blackwall was rerouted via Leamouth to provide night links whenever access to Canning Town station is restricted;https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/buses/routes-d3-n550/ implemented in September 2018.https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/buses/permanent-bus-changes#on- this-page-3 References External links *Leamouth Road and Orchard Place: Historical development, Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 646-655 *A pedestrian and cycle bridge connecting Leamouth to Canning Town tube station, opened in 2006.

He also designed the leather catsuit worn by Marianne Faithfull in the 1968 film The Girl on a Motorcycle which may have been influenced by the style of The Avengers.https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/sep/11/john- sutcliffe-fetish-wear At one time he designed a boot suit, which comprised a pair of thigh-length boots, which carried on to join at the crotch, and then upwards to become an entire catsuit with a hood. He was also the publisher of the fetish magazine AtomAge, which featured many of his clothing designs. It had two sister publications, The Rubberist and Dressing For Pleasure, both of which are now published by Dave Watson of G&M; Fashions. AtomAge attracted a certain amount of attention when the police decided to prosecute the publisher, Sutcliffe, in the mid-1980s, for obscenity. Despite protest from both fetishists and defenders of civil liberties alike, Sutcliffe pleaded guilty. His stock and photos were seized and destroyed and the publications temporarily closed. The shame may well have contributed to his death. Sutcliffe's legacy is the booming fetish clothing industry in Britain, Germany, the USA and many other parts of the world, the wide range of fetish events, such as the yearly Rubber Ball in the UK, and the large numbers of people who enjoy dressing up in exciting ways without fear of prosecution. In his final years, Sutcliffe shared a workshop in West London. 2010 saw the publication of the first ever book about Sutcliffe and AtomAge - Dressing For Pleasure, a history of AtomAge is published by Fuel and edited by Jonny Trunk.

Development and design  The Ca.1 was a three-engine biplane of fabric- covered wooden construction. It had four crew members in an open central nacelle: two pilots, a front gunner, and rear gunner-mechanic, who manned upper machine guns, standing upon the central engine in a protective cage, just in front of the rear propeller. The Ca.1 had a tricycle landing gear. Italy and Russia were the first countries to start developing a heavy bomber capability before World War I. The first heavy bomber, designed by Gianni Caproni was a twin-boom biplane, featuring a layout that included three 67 kW (80 hp) Gnome rotary engines housed one behind the other in a central nacelle, the rearmost driving a pusher propeller, and the other two driving tractor propellers mounted on the fronts of the two booms. Referred to by Caproni as the Caproni 260 hp and retrospectively, after the war, as the Ca.30), this design flew in a slightly modified form (later called the Ca.31) in October 1914. Test flights revealed the power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable. Caproni altered the aircraft, retaining the pusher engine in its original location and moving the other two engines to the front of the booms, directly driving the propellers. With more powerful inline engines, the air arm of the Italian Army became interested in purchasing the Caproni 300 hp (later known as the Ca.32), which they designated the Ca.1. A total of 166 aircraft were delivered between August 1915 and December 1916. Some Ca.1s survived the war to be rebuilt as airliners, able to carry up to six passengers. This conversion became known as the Ca.56 in Caproni's postwar naming scheme. There is some variation in published sources over early Caproni designations. The confusion stems, in part, from three separate schemes used to designate these aircraft ‚Äì Caproni's in-house designations of the time, those used by the Italian Army, and designations created after the war by Caproni to refer to past designs. Operational history The Ca.1 entered service with the Italian Army in the middle of 1915 and first saw action on August 20, 1915, attacking the Austrian air base at Aisovizza. Fifteen bomber squadrons (1-15 Squadriglia) were eventually equipped with Ca.1, Ca.2, and Ca.3 bombers, bombing mostly targets in Austria-Hungary. The 12th squadron operated in Libya. In 1918 three squadrons (3, 14 and 15) operated in France.

Development The Ca.2 was a minor development of the Caproni Ca.1 twin-boom bomber of 1914. It had become evident early in the Ca.1's service life that the design could benefit from more power. Caproni therefore replaced the central, pusher engine of the aircraft with a more powerful one. Caproni referred to this as the Caproni 350 hp at the time, and the Italian Army dubbed it the Ca.2. No separate number seems to have been allocated to it in Caproni's postwar redesignation scheme. Only nine aircraft were built, supplied to the Italian Army alongside deliveries of Ca.1s between August 1915 and December 1916. The benefits of increased power encouraged Caproni to continue in this direction, leading to the definitive Caproni Ca.3. Description The Caproni Ca.2 was a trimotor biplane with an engine mounted on the rear of the central nacelle, and two others mounted on the front of twin booms, which held the tail. It was largely of wooden construction, covered with fabric. The crew of four were in an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, standing over the central engine in a protective \\"cage,\\" just in front of its propeller. It was fitted with tricycle landing gear.

Numerous searches have failed to provide any proof of continued existence. It has been suggested that it may exist in the inaccessible swamp regions of northern Myanmar and some sight reports from that region have led to its status being declared as \\"Critically Endangered\\" rather than extinct. The genus placement has been disputed and while some have suggested that it is close to the red- crested pochard (Netta rufina), others have placed it in a separate genus of its own. It is unique in the pink colouration of the head combined with a dark body. A prominent wing patch and the long slender neck are features shared with the common Indian spot-billed duck. The eggs have also been held as particularly peculiar in being nearly spherical. Description Male and female as illustrated by Henrik Gr√∂nvold The male pink-headed duck is unmistakable when a good view is had. Both sexes are 41‚Äì43 cm and long-billed with long necks and peaked heads. The male has a pink bill, head and neck while the female has a pale pinkish head and neck with a paler bill. The black of the body extends as a narrow strip on the front of the neck. Wings have a leading white edge. In flight it would not contrast as much as the syntopic white-winged duck. Wing does not have the dark trailing edge of the red- crested pochard. Confusion with male red-crested pochards stems mainly from observations of swimming birds, as the latter species also has a conspicuous red head (although the color is actually very different from the pink-headed duck). Indian spot-billed ducks, on the other hand, can look similar to female pink-headed ducks when in flight and seen from a distance, and if seen from behind, they could be mistaken for males too. The upper side of the wing is distinguishing, with dark green secondaries (speculum) and prominent white tertiaries in the spot-billed duck and a pinkish-beige speculum, much lighter than its surroundings, in the pink-headed duck. If the upper part of the wings cannot be reliably seen, they are all but indistinguishable except to expert observers in good visibility conditions. Young birds had a nearly whitish head without a trace of pink and a mellow two note call wugh-ah has been attributed to the species. Its breeding habitat is lowland marshes and pools in tall- grass jungle. The nest is built amongst grass. The eggs, six or seven in a clutch, are very spherical and creamy white. The eggs measure 1.71 to 1.82 inches long and 1.61 to 1.7 inches wide. They were believed to have been non- migratory and found singly or in pairs and very rarely in small groups. Pink- headed ducks are believed to have eaten water plants and molluscs. Like Netta species, they typically up-ended or dabbled for food and did not dive like a pochard. Distribution A defective illustration of the head which misses the nuchal crest. Allan Octavian Hume and Stuart Baker noted that the stronghold of the species was north of the Ganges and west of the Brahmaputra, mainly in Maldah, Purnea, Madhubani and Purulia districts of present-day Bihar. It was said to be commoner in Singhbum. Hume collected a specimen in Manipur which he noted was very rare, hiding among dense reeds in Loktak Lake. Edward Blyth claimed that it was found in the Arakan state of Burma. Brian Houghton Hodgson obtained specimens from Nepal. A few records were also noted from Delhi, Sindh and Punjab. Birds were also reported from the Oudh region some from very close to Lucknow. Specimens were shot at Najafgarh lake in the Delhi district. Jerdon obtained specimens of the bird from further south although he did not personally observe any in the wild until he visited Bengal. Taxonomy and systematics Lady Impey, circa 1777. This accurately records the colour of the legs. The pink-headed duck was described by John Latham in 1790 under the genus Anas. In describing the species, it is possible that he made of use of a painting in the collection of Lady Impey, wife of Sir Elijah Impey who was Chief Justice of court in Calcutta from 1774 to 1783. Mary Impey maintained a menagerie in Calcutta and commissioned Indian artists such as Bhawani Das from Patna to illustrate animals in the collection. The Impeys moved to England, and after the death of her husband, she sold these paintings at auction in 1810. Some of them were acquired by the 13th Earl of Derby. The swelling at the base of trachea in the male The genus Rhodonessa was originally created for this species alone. Jean Delacour and Ernst Mayr, in their 1945 revision of the family Anatidae considered it a somewhat abnormal member of the Anatini (or river-ducks) group because the hind toe is slightly lobed, display behaviour and the tendency to feed at the surface. The birds were observed in European aviaries and although they never bred, the males displayed often and this involved puffing the neck feathers, lowering the neck to rest on the back and then stretching up the neck while producing a wheezy whistle like a mallard. A study of its tracheal anatomy by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1875 suggested that it had a \\"slight fusiform dilatation\\" in the anterior syringeal region. The \\"bulba ossea\\" at the lower part of the male syrinx is peculiar in being swollen. The colour pattern has also been considered unique, lacking any of the metallic colours on the secondaries that are characteristic of the Anatini. The other unique feature being the somewhat large and nearly spherical shape of the eggs. All of these features supporting the retention of the species in a separate genus. Such mid-tracheal swellings were found only in Mergini and Aythyini and is extremely rare in the genus Anas. This tracheal bulla is rounded in Anas but angular with fenestrae in Netta and Aythya. Johnsgard considered Marmaronetta and Rhodonessa as intermediate in form. Based on the available morphological and behavioural evidence, especially the structure of the humerus and the structure of tracheal rings, Sidney Dillon Ripley suggested that it was undoubtedly in the Aythyini. A study found that Rhodonessa was closely allied to the red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) suggesting that the two species be placed in the same genus. Rhodonessa was described prior to Netta which would then make Rhodonessa rufina the name of choice, however these changes have not been widely accepted. The pink colour is derived from a carotenoid pigment which is unusual among ducks and known only from a few other species such as the pink- eared duck which are not closely related. Status Turnaround video of a specimen, Naturalis Biodiversity Center This duck formerly occurred in eastern India, Bangladesh and northern Myanmar, but is now probably extinct. It was always rare, and the last confirmed sighting, by C. M. Inglis, was from Darbhanga in June 1935, with reports from India persisting until the early 1960s. These include reports from Monghyr and from near Simla. Sidney Dillon Ripley considered it likely extinct in 1950. An 1847 illustration In 1988, Rory Nugent, an American birder, and Shankar Barua of Delhi, reported spotting the elusive bird on the banks of the Brahmaputra. The pair started their quest for the bird at Saikhoa ghat on the north-eastern end of the river on the Indian side of the border. After 29 days of sailing, Nugent said that he saw the pink-headed duck amidst a flock of other waterbirds. However, Nugent and Barua's claimed sighting has not been widely accepted. Reports of pink-headed ducks after the 1960s have been received from the largely unexplored Mali Hka and Chindwin Myit drainages in Northern Myanmar. While the area is not very well surveyed by scientists, searches have been inconclusive and confusion with the red-crested pochard and the Indian spot-billed duck has been a common source of supposed pink-headed duck sightings. A report on a survey in the Hu Kaung valley in November 2003 concluded that there is sufficient reason to believe that pink-headed ducks may still exist in Northern Myanmar's Kachin State, but a thorough survey of the Nat Kaung river between Kamaing and Shadusup in October 2005 failed to find this species; a number of interesting ducks were observed, but they turned out to be Indian spot-billed ducks or white-winged ducks. Suggestions have been made that it may be nocturnal. In 2017, an expedition to find the species by Global Wildlife Conservation also failed, with evidence indicating that the biodiversity in the general area around Indawgyi Lake and its surrounding areas was heavily declining due to habitat degradation. Anecdotes from residents in the area, however, indicate that the bird may have lived in the area far more recently than the last confirmed report from 1910, possibly as recently as 2010. One resident stated that a pink-headed duck was sighted in 1998, associating with a flock of gadwall and pintail. Another, more dubious report stated that shortly after a failed expedition in the area by Birdlife International ended, a local hunter caught a live male and a female or juvenile pink-headed duck, and contacted Myanmar's Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association to sell it to them for a fee. The offer was declined, and the hunter killed both ducks. Another hunter recalled that when the habitat was in good condition, pink-headed ducks were regulars in the area, possibly up to 2014. They were apparently most common during February, and he also could mimic their possible calls, though it is unknown whether these calls were truly by pink-headed ducks. The hunter also said that there were large, impassable ponds in the wetland's center that may still hold pink-headed ducks, but these could only be accessed with a drone, which are banned in the region. The reason for its disappearance was probably habitat destruction. It is not known why it was always considered rare, but the rarity is believed to be genuine (and not an artefact of insufficient fieldwork) as its erstwhile habitat was frequently scoured by hunters in Colonial times. The pink-headed duck was much sought after by hunters and later as an ornamental bird, mainly because of its unusual plumage. Like most diving ducks, it was not considered good eating, which should facilitate the survival of any remnant birds. The last specimen was obtained in 1935 in Darbhanga, Bihar, India, by C. M. Inglis. Some birds were also kept in the aviaries of Jean Th√©odore Delacour in Cl√®res (France) and Alfred Ezra at Foxwarren Park (England) where the last known birds lived in captivity. The only known photographs of the species were taken here and include one of a pair taken around 1925 by David Seth-Smith.

The lighthouse no longer functions, but is the home of various art projects such as Longplayer. It is sometimes known as Bow Creek Lighthouse. History In 1803, the site began to be used by the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, now known as Corporation of Trinity House. The seawall was reconstructed in 1822 by George Mundy of Old Ford. The site was used as a maintenance depot, and storage facility for the many buoys that aided navigation on the Thames; and the wharf for docking and repair of lightships. The original lighthouse was built by the engineer of Trinity House, James Walker, in 1852, and was demolished in the late 1920s. A second lighthouse, which survives, was built in 1864‚Äì66 by James Douglass for Trinity House. It was used to test lighting systems for Trinity House's lights around England and Wales. Michael Faraday carried out experiments there. Both lighthouses were also used for training prospective lighthouse keepers.Guide to English and Welsh Lights accessed 27 June 2007 Late 20th century and on In December 1988, Trinity House closed the wharf, and the area was acquired by the London Docklands Development Corporation. In 1998, the LDDC set up the Trinity Buoy Wharf Trust with a 125-year lease to hold the land for the people of London. Urban Space Holdings Ltd took control of the site on a long lease. The site has been, and continues to be, developed as \\"a centre for the arts and cultural activities\\". Enhancements include studio space (including unusual architecture based on used shipping containers) and exhibition space. Urban Space Holdings used the area to develop \\"Container City\\" in 2001, a studio and office complex made from recycled sea shipping containers. The original project was made from 80% recycled material.Container City website accessed 27 June 2007 \\"Container City 1\\" took 5 months to complete, taking 4 days to install. The Container City project proved very popular and in 2002 \\"Container City 2\\" was completed delivering a further 22 studios across 5 floors in with a brightly coloured ziggurat design. A further extension to the Container City Complex was the \\"Riverside Building\\" located next to the Thames facing The O2 dome. This was yet another architectural design providing an additional 22 studio spaces. In November 2005, the University of East London opened Fine Art studios at the wharf; and in September 2009 the university opened two dance studios at the Institute of Performing Arts Development in The Chainstore at the wharf. Faraday School, a not-for-profit primary school run by the New Model School Company Limited, opened in September 2009. The wharf is also the home of Thames Clippers who have offices and base all their boats on the pier there. In April 2013 the former Cory Environmental Thames Lighterage tug Swiftstone moved to Trinity Buoy Wharf from Greenwich, and the trust's volunteers began a full restoration of the vessel which can be seen underway at the year Thames Barge Driving event. In 2016 the trust acquired two historic tugboats, the Knocker White and the Varlet from the Museum of London Docklands. Both vessels are listed by National Historic Ships on the National Register of Historic Vessels. File:Cmglee Trinity Buoy Wharf entrance.jpgTrinity Buoy Wharf in September 2012.

Rheinmetall AG has a presence in two corporate sectors (automotive and defence) with six divisions, and is headquartered in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. In fiscal 2019, the company generated sales of ‚Ç¨6.255 billion. The Group's Defence segment had sales in fiscal 2019 of ‚Ç¨3.522 billion, while sales of its Automotive segment for the same period came to ‚Ç¨2.736 billion. Rheinmetall AG is listed on the German MDAX; its shares are traded on all German stock exchanges. Company history 1889‚Äì2000 After World War I Rheinmetall produced non-military items including office equipment. Share of the Rheinische Metallwaaren- und Maschinenfabrik, issued December 1928; renamed to Rheinmetall-Borsig AG On 13 April 1889, the H√∂rder Bergwerks- und H√ºttenverein under General Director Joseph Massenez founded the Rheinische Metallwaaren- und Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft, the now Rheinmetall AG to supply ammunition for the German Empire. The Thuringian engineer Heinrich Ehrhardt builds up the first Rheinmetall plant in D√ºsseldorf and runs it until 1920. In 1901 Dreysesche Gewehrfabrik, Munitions- und Waffenfabrik was acquired. After World War I, as a result of the limitations imposed upon Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, Rheinmetall produced non-military items including locomotives, steam ploughs and office equipment. The very first locomotive manufactured by Rheinmetall was a Prussian G 10, later renumbered . Rheinmetall would produce 302 engines from this series and some Prussian G 12 as well. Military production recommenced in 1921, and in 1925, the German government acquired a majority stake of the company. The railway locomotive manufacturer August Borsig GmbH was taken over in 1933; in 1936 the two merged to create Rheinmetall-Borsig AG. In 1938 the company headquarters moved from D√ºsseldorf to Berlin. In 1956 a majority stake in Rheinmetall-Borsig AG was acquired by the R√∂chling Group. Borsig AG was sold to Salzgitter AG and the company name changed from Rheinmetall-Borsig AG to Rheinmetall Berlin AG. Defence-related production would also start again in 1956, the first product being the MG 42. In 1958 diversification into the mechanical engineering and electronics fields occurred and during 1979‚Äì1981 these non-defence sectors were thoroughly restructured. Carburetor manufacturer Pierburg GmbH was taken over in 1986 and the current Automotive sector was created. In 1989 the takeover of MaK Systemgesellschaft, a manufacturer of armoured vehicles, occurred. In 1996 Rheinmetall Berlin AG changed its name to Rheinmetall AG. Company structure (Defence) Rheinmetall AG's Defence arm produces equipment and systems for government, security and military ground, air and naval forces. The defence arm was initially reorganised in 2012 when the then six divisions were restructured into three new divisions, Combat Systems, Electronic Solutions and Wheeled Vehicles. The three divisions were each headed by a member of the Executive Board of Rheinmetall Defence. Originally this was Armin Papperger representing the Combat Systems division. Representing the Electronic Solutions division was Bodo Garbe, while Pietro Borgo, then Managing Director of RMMV GmbH, represented the Wheeled Vehicles division. A more recent minor restructure resulted in the Weapons and Ammunition, Electronic Solutions and Vehicle Systems divisions, these now represented on the management board by Dr Alexander Sagel (Weapons And Ammunition), Susanne Wiegand (Electronic Solutions,) and Ben Hudson (Vehicle Systems). Armin Papperger is now Chairman of the Management Board Defence at Rheinmetall AG and CEO of Rheinmetall AG. Though based in Germany, Rheinmetall Defence has a global presence. The Weapons and Ammunitions division has 13 subsidiaries, the Electronic Solutions division has 17 subsidiaries, and the Vehicle Systems division has five subsidiaries. Along with international subsidiaries ‚Äì Rheinmetall Defence Australia Pty Ltd; Rheinmetall Defence UK Limited; Rheinmetall Eastern Markets GmbH and Rheinmetall Limited Liability Company, these 35 subsidiaries in the form of production plants and representative offices are spread throughout Germany and 21 other countries worldwide: Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Italy; Malaysia; Mexico; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Poland; Qatar; Russia; Saudi Arabia; South Africa; Singapore; Sweden; Switzerland; UAE; UK; USA. Rheinmetall has further shareholdings in ARTEC GmbH (Munich); PSM Projekt System & Management GmbH (Kassel), and Defense Munitions LLC (Wilmington USA). =Acquisitions, divestitures, mergers and joint ventures (from 2000)= * Rheinmetall Landsysteme GmbH was formed in 2000 when the hitherto independently operating companies Henschel Wehrtechnik, KUKA Wehrtechnik and MaK System Gesellschaft GmbH were merged to form it. * In 2002 and as part of the process of focusing on defence, Rheinmetall sold the Eurometaal Holding N.V. subsidiary Intergas B.V., a furnace and boiler manufacturer.

One of a pair of coasters built in Bow Creek, London in 1890, the ship was built for British owners, but spent most of her long working life on the Spanish coast as Maria. In 1974 she was purchased for restoration as Robin and is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building). She is situated in the Royal Victoria Dock in east London, opening as the SS Robin museum, theatre and educational centre in 2014. Specification As built, Robin was long, her beam is , her depth is and her tonnage is . She carried about 450 tons of cargo. The engine is a three- cylinder triple expansion steam engine, developing , and made in 1890 by Gourlay Brothers & Co of Dundee, Scotland. Her maximum speed was . In Lloyd's Register she was described as a \\"steel screw 3-masted schooner\\", and had indeed been provided with sails for all three masts when first built. History Robin was ordered from Mackenzie, MacAlpine & Co of Orchard House Yard, Hercules Wharf, Blackwall, London, situated in Bow Creek at the mouth of the River Lea, by London shipowner Robert Thomson, and launched on 16 September 1890. However, she and her sister Rook were completed by Thomson himself, though the reason is unknown. After fitting out in the East India Dock, Robin was towed to Dundee to have her engine, boiler and auxiliary machinery installed by Gourlay Brothers & Co. When completed she was registered in London with Official number 98185 and in the ownership of Arthur Ponsonby of Newport, then in Monmouthshire. =1890 to 1900= On 20 December 1890, Robin commenced her career in the British coastal service at Liverpool, with a crew of 12 signing the Articles for her maiden voyage. As a coaster her range was normally limited to the Home Trade limits (broadly from the Elbe to Brest. However, on her first voyage she went further, to Bayonne; the owners had to replace the Master's mate with another, who held the correct certificate, until the ship returned to Swansea on 10 January. Her second voyage began at Swansea on 14 January 1891, visiting Rouen, Northfleet on the River Thames, Eastham and Garston on the River Mersey, Plymouth, Deauville, Guernsey, London, Rochester, Newport, Swansea, Cherbourg arriving in Northfleet by 5 April 1891. This would be typical of her trading under the Red Ensign, carrying bulk cargoes of grain, iron ore, scrap steel, pit props, china clay, railway steel, general cargoes of casked and baled goods such as herring barrels, and even granite blocks for the Caledonian Canal. In 1892 Robin was sold to Andrew Forrester Blackater of Glasgow, where she was re- registered. =1900 to 1974= In 1900 Robin was sold and renamed Maria; for the next 74 years she had three different Spanish owners: * 1900-1913 Blanco Hermanos y Compa√±ia of Ribadesella. * 1913-1965 Hijos de Angel Perez y Compa√±ia of Santander. During World War I she carried iron slabs for the French government from the foundry at Santiago to Bayonne and Bordeaux, escorted by two destroyers to protect her from German U-boats. From 1935 to 1939 (the Spanish Civil War) the ship was laid up at San Esteban de Pravia. * 1965-1974 Eduardo de la Sota Poveda of Bilbao, working around Bilbao] and the north coast of Spain until 1974, carrying coal for the bunkering of liners. Until 1965, Marias structure stayed mainly unchanged; in 1966 she had a major refit with the whaleback (at the stern) and the mizzen mast removed, the foremast and the funnel shortened, and the forecastle extended. The coal-fired furnaces were modified for oil fuel. After this she resumed trading. =1974 to 2002= SS Robin, November 2005. Maria was discovered by the Maritime Trust in 1972. Following an inspection, it was decided that she was worth preserving, and in May 1974 she was purchased, on the brink of being sold to Spanish breakers. In June 1974 she came home to St Katharine Docks under her own steam and was renamed Robin. She was restored at a cost of ¬£250,000, with most work taking place in 1974 and 1975 at the Doust & Co shipyard at Rochester, Kent, and was subsequently moored in St Katharine Docks. She was moved to new moorings in 1991 at West India Quay but fell into disrepair. In 2000 David and Nishani Kampfner were looking for a unique space to be transformed into an area for innovation and learning. They bought Robin for ¬£1. In 2002, SS Robin Trust was created to bring awareness to the general public about the importance of the ship. With the help of many volunteers they began restoration on this coastal steamer. =2002 to 2008= Crossrail provided SS Robin Trust with a ¬£1.9 million loan to enable her to move to dry dock for restoration works to commence. Before she was able to be moved, her masts, funnel, lifeboats and davits were dismantled and removed by Cutty Sark Enterprises. She was then towed from West India Quay down the Canary Wharf locks to South Quay for temporary mooring. Around this time the Heritage Lottery Fund had also been approved and SS Robin Trust was awarded a grant of just under ¬£1 million. =2008 to 2010= In June 2008, Robin was to undergo her first seaward journey in 35 years from South Quay to Lowestoft for structural restoration using, so far as was practicable, the same craft skills with which she was built in 1890, conserving her Victorian technology. Once at Lowestoft a detailed examination revealed that after 118 years she was now considered too fragile to be able to float again. Initially it was thought that Robin would need a 40% steel replacement, but after the examination it showed that she would need an 80% steel replacement thereby essentially ruining her historical value. These new findings urged SS Robin Trust to find a less destructive approach maintaining Robin. It soon became clear that a pontoon would be the most innovative and least destructive method to keep her floating and to preserve and display her original riveted fabric. It also provided a wealth of more space. In 2010, Robin was lifted by two cranes and placed onto her new pontoon. She was then towed to Tilbury where she was moored for a year. =2010 to present= SS Robin, July 2014. After 3 years of conservation work in Tilbury, in July 2011 Robin returned to east London, where she was originally built, to undergo further internal restoration and preparation before opening as the SS Robin museum, theatre and educational centre in the Royal Victoria Dock in Newham borough in 2014, with the support of a grant of just over ¬£950,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. She was then subsequently moved to the Millennium Mills Dock, where she was temporarily berthed for further restoration and development before reopening to the public, at the western end of the Royal Victoria Dock (close to the Emirates Air Line (cable car)), in 2015. Arts & Education Centre and Museum In 2002, David and Nishani Kampfner bought Robin and founded the SS Robin Trust as a registered charity (Prince Philip is an honorary member, and Jim Fitzpatrick MP, and Channel 4 news reader Jon Snow are patrons). The Trust converted her into an educational centre and photographic gallery; in this restoration, the original beams, structures, fittings and engine were preserved and restored by her volunteer crew. She operated as a learning centre and photojournalism gallery from 2003, with an extensive programme of exhibitions, talks, seminars and workshops designed to build bridges between communities and interacting with local schools and businesses. The gallery, with a flexible classroom and exhibition area, was accommodated within the original cargo hold.

It stars Whoopi Goldberg as a lounge singer forced to join a convent after being placed in a witness protection program. It also features Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Mary Wickes, and Harvey Keitel. Sister Act was one of the most financially successful comedies of the early 1990s, grossing $231 million worldwide. The film spawned a franchise, which consists of a 1993 sequel, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, and a musical adaptation, which premiered in 2006. A remake of Sister Act is in the works. On December 7, 2018, it was confirmed that Regina Y. Hicks and Karin Gist were hired to write the script to Sister Act 3 to be released on Disney+. Plot In 1968, Deloris Wilson is a young Catholic school student, who is less than serious about her studies, much to the chagrin of her teacher nuns. In the present, the adult Deloris is a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada, performing as \\"Deloris Van Cartier\\". After Deloris witnesses her gangster boyfriend Vince LaRocca execute an informant, police lieutenant Eddie Souther places her in witness protection. She is brought to Saint Katherine's Convent in Saint Katherine's Parish, a parish located in a run-down San Francisco neighborhood. Deloris initially objects, but relents, and goes along with it. The Reverend Mother, the head nun of St. Katherine's, also objects to taking Deloris in, but Monsignor O'Hara, a senior-ranking Catholic cleric who is the local Parish Priest, convinces her to go along with it, as the police will pay the failing convent a good sum of money. Disguised as \\"Sister Mary Clarence\\", Deloris struggles with the simplistic and rigid convent life, but starts to befriend the other nuns, including the perky heavyset Sister Mary Patrick, the shy young Sister Mary Robert, and the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus. One night, after a poorly attended Sunday Mass, with a lackluster performance from the convent choir, led by Mary Lazarus, Deloris sneaks out to a bar, followed by Mary Patrick and Mary Robert. They are caught by the Reverend Mother, and Deloris is forced to join the struggling choir. With her singing experience, Deloris is elected their new director, and she works to transform the choir. At the next Sunday Mass, Deloris leads the much-improved choir in a traditional performance of \\"Hail Holy Queen\\", before shifting into a gospel and rock-and-roll interpretation. Although the Reverend Mother is infuriated, Monsignor O'Hara congratulates the choir's unorthodox performance for attracting new people to the service. Convinced by Deloris, he allows the nuns to clean up the church, and the neighborhood. Their singing, and efforts to revitalize the neighborhood attract media attention, and the parish starts to thrive. Souther chastises Deloris for nearly being exposed on national television, as Vince has placed a bounty on her head. Deloris assures him that she will try to keep a lower profile, and Souther attends a mass. The choir continues to amaze parishioners and visitors, especially with a rendition of \\"My Guy\\" ‚Äì rewritten as \\"My God\\". O'Hara informs the convent that Pope John Paul II, having heard of the choir‚Äôs success, will visit the church himself. Deloris tells the Reverend Mother that Vince‚Äôs upcoming trial means she will soon leave, and the Reverend Mother reveals she has resigned, believing she is no longer of use to the convent, as her authority was unintentionally undermined. Deloris tries to convince her to stay and keep things going, but the Reverend Mother believes herself too old-fashioned and uncapable to do so. Souther discovers a corrupt detective in his own department, who has given Deloris‚Äô location to Vince, and rushes to San Francisco to warn Deloris. She and Mary Robert are kidnapped by Vince‚Äôs men, but Delores helps her escape. Afterwards, the Reverend Mother reveals Deloris‚Äô identity to the nuns, and they decide to go to her rescue, requesting a helicopter pilot to fly them to Reno. There, Vince orders his men to kill Deloris, but they are reluctant to shoot her while she is dressed as a nun. Arriving at Vince's casino, the nuns find Deloris after she escapes from Vince‚Äôs men. They become trapped in the casino lounge, and Deloris prepares to sacrifice herself. Before Vince can shoot her, Souther arrives and arrests Vince and his men. Thanking Deloris for what she has done, the Reverend Mother decides to remain at the convent. Returning to San Francisco, the choir, led by Deloris, sing \\"I Will Follow Him\\" to a packed audience in a refurbished Saint Katherine's, receiving a standing ovation from all, including the Pope, O'Hara and Souther. Deloris continues to guide and coach the choir as a singing touring group.

Screenwriter Paul Rudnick pitched Sister Act to producer Scott Rudin in 1987, with Bette Midler in mind for the lead role. The script was then brought to Disney. However, Midler later turned down the role, fearing that her fans would not want to see her play a nun. Eventually, Whoopi Goldberg signed on to play the lead. As production commenced, the script was rewritten by a half dozen screenwriters, including Carrie Fisher, Robert Harling, and Nancy Meyers. With the movie no longer resembling his original script, Rudnick asked to be credited with a pseudonym in the film, deciding on \\"Joseph Howard.\\" The church in which Deloris takes sanctuary is St. Paul's Catholic Church, located at Valley and Church Streets in Noe Valley, an upper- middle-class neighborhood of San Francisco. The storefronts on the opposite side of the street were redressed to give the appearance of a run-down neighborhood. Though the order of the nuns in the film is hinted at being a Carmelite one by Sister Mary Patrick, their religious habit is similar in appearance to that of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis (minus the cross). Members of the real-life Order, however, no longer wear their traditional habit. Filming ran to . Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records on June 9, 1992 in conjunction with the film, and contained the musical numbers performed by actors in the film itself, pre-recorded songs that were used as part of the background music, and instrumental music composed by Marc Shaiman for the film. The soundtrack album debuted at #74 and eventually reached #40 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart where it charted for 54 weeks. The album received a Gold certification from the RIAA for shipment of 500,000 copies on January 13, 1993. # \\"The Lounge Medley\\" (\\"(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave\\"/\\"My Guy\\"/\\"I Will Follow Him\\") ‚Äî Deloris & The Ronelles # \\"The Murder\\" (instrumental) # \\"Getting Into the Habit\\" (instrumental) # \\"Rescue Me\\" ‚Äî Fontella Bass # \\"Hail Holy Queen\\" ‚Äî Deloris & The Sisters # \\"Roll With Me Henry\\" ‚Äî Etta James # \\"Gravy For My Mashed Potatoes\\" ‚Äî Dee Dee Sharp # \\"My Guy (My God)\\" ‚Äî Deloris & The Sisters # \\"Just a Touch Of Love (Everyday)\\" ‚Äî C+C Music Factory # \\"Deloris Is Kidnapped\\" (instrumental) # \\"Nuns to the Rescue\\" (instrumental) # \\"Finale: I Will Follow Him ('Chariot')\\" ‚Äî Deloris & The Sisters # \\"Shout\\" ‚Äî Deloris & The Sisters & The Ronelles # \\"If My Sister's in Trouble\\" ‚Äî Lady Soul * The singing voice for the character of \\"Mary Robert\\" was performed by vocalist Andrea Robinson. Reception The film received a generally positive reception from critics, holding a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Sister Act a mixed 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. He wrote that Goldberg and Wickes both offered humorous performances but the film overall \\"plays like a missed opportunity\\" due to slow pacing and trouble integrating the organized crime scenes into a comedy film.https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sister-act-1992 Metacritic gave the film a score of 51 based on the 23 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film received two Golden Globe nominations: * Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy * Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Comedy or Musical (Goldberg) American Film Institute recognition: * AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs‚ÄîNominated =Box office= The film was a box office success, grossing $139.6 million domestically and $92 million in foreign countries, effectively grossing $231.6 million worldwide, becoming the eighth- highest-grossing film worldwide in 1992. It sat at the #2 spot for four weeks, behind Lethal Weapon 3, Patriot Games and Batman Returns in succession. =Controversy and lawsuits= On June 10, 1993, actress Donna Douglas and her partner Curt Wilson in Associated Artists Entertainment, Inc., filed a $200 million lawsuit against Disney, Whoopi Goldberg, Bette Midler, their production companies, and Creative Artists Agency claiming the film was plagiarized from a book A Nun in the Closet owned by the partners. Douglas and Wilson claimed that in 1985 they had developed a screenplay for the book. The lawsuit claimed that there were over 100 similarities and plagiarisms between the movie and the book/screenplay owned by Douglas and Wilson. The lawsuit further claimed that the developed screenplay had been submitted to Disney, Goldberg, and Midler three times during 1987 and 1988. In 1994, Douglas and Wilson declined a $1 million offer in an attempt to win the case. The judge found in favor of Disney and the other defendants. Wilson stated at the time, ‚ÄúThey would have had to copy our stuff verbatim for us to prevail.‚Äù In November 2011, a nun named Delois Blakely filed a lawsuit against the Walt Disney Company and Sony Pictures claiming that The Harlem Street Nun, an autobiography she wrote in 1987, was the basis for the 1992 film. She alleged that a movie executive expressed an interest in the rights to the movie after she wrote a three-page synopsis. She sued for \\"breach of contract, misappropriation of likeness and unjust enrichment.\\" Blakely dropped the original lawsuit in January 2012 to serve a more robust lawsuit in late August 2012 with the New York Supreme Court, asking for $1 billion in damages from Disney. In early February 2013, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, awarding no damages to Blakely. Home media The Region 1 DVD was released on November 6, 2001; however, the disc has no anamorphic enhancement, similar to early DVDs from Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Special Features include the film's theatrical trailer; music videos for \\"I Will Follow Him\\" by Deloris and the Sisters, and \\"If My Sister's in Trouble\\" by Lady Soul, both of which contain clips from the film; and a featurette titled \\"Inside Sister Act: The Making Of\\". The all-region Blu-ray including both films was released on June 19, 2012, with both films presented in 1080p. The 3-disc set also includes both films on DVD with the same bonus features as previous releases.

History =Ancient times= Milliarium of Aiton, the oldest known epigraphical attestation of Potaissa ‚Äì a copy erected in June 1993 in front of the Turda Post Office There is evidence of human settlement in the area dating to the Middle Paleolithic, some 60,000 years ago. \\"Comuna primitivƒÉ\\" at the Turda City Hall site; accessed March 21, 2013 The Dacians established a town that Ptolemy in his Geography calls Patreuissa, which is probably a corruption of Patavissa or Potaissa, the latter being more common. It was conquered by the Romans, who kept the name Potaissa, between AD 101 and 106, during the rule of Trajan, together with parts of Decebal's Dacia. \\"Epoca dacicƒÉ\\" at the Turda City Hall site; accessed March 21, 2013 The name Potaissa is first recorded on a Roman milliarium discovered in 1758 in the nearby Aiton commune.Lazarovici et al. 1997, pp. 202‚Äì3 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs) Roman bath at Castra Potaissa Milliarium of Aiton is an ancient Roman milestone dating from 108 AD, shortly after the Roman conquest of Dacia, and showing the construction of the road from Potaissa to Napoca, by demand of the Emperor Trajan. It indicates the distance of (P.M.X.) to Potaissa. This is the first epigraphical attestation of the settlements of Potaissa and Napoca in Roman Dacia. The complete inscription is: \\"Imp(erator)/ Caesar Nerva/ Traianus Aug(ustus)/ Germ(anicus) Dacicus/ pontif(ex) maxim(us)/ (sic) pot(estate) XII co(n)s(ul) V/ imp(erator) VI p(ater) p(atriae) fecit/ per coh(ortem) I Fl(aviam) Vlp(iam)/ Hisp(anam) mil(liariam) c(ivium) R(omanorum) eq(uitatam)/ a Potaissa Napo/cam / m(ilia) p(assuum) X\\". It was recorded in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, vol.III, the 1627, Berlin, 1863. This milliarium is an attestation of the road known to be built by Cohors I Hispanorum miliaria. The castrum established was named Potaissa too and became a municipium, then a colonia. Potaissa was the basecamp of the Legio V Macedonica from 166 to 274. The Potaissa salt mines were worked in the area since prehistoric times. =Middle Ages= After the Hungarian conquest, the Turda salt mines were first mentioned in 1075. They were closed in 1932 but have recently been reopened for tourism. Saxons settled in the area in the 12th century. The town was destroyed during the Tartar invasion in 1241‚Äì1242. Andrew III of Hungary gave royal privileges to the settlement. These privileges were later confirmed by the Angevins of Hungary. The Hungarian Diet was held here in 1467, by Matthias Corvinus. Later, in the 16th century, Turda was often the residence of the Transylvanian Diet, too. After the Battle of Moh√°cs, the city became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and since 1570 the Principality of Transylvania. The 1558 Diet of Turda declared free practice of both the Catholic and Lutheran religions. In 1563 the Diet also accepted the Calvinist religion, and in 1568 it extended freedom to all religions, declaring that \\"It is not allowed to anybody to intimidate anybody with captivity or expelling for his religion\\" ‚Äì a freedom unusual in medieval Europe. This Edict of Turda is the first attempt at legislating general religious freedom in Christian Europe (though its legal effectiveness was limited). In 1609 Gabriel B√°thori granted new privileges to Turda. These were confirmed later by Gabriel Bethlen. In the battle of Turda, Ahmed Pasha defeated George II R√°k√≥czi in 1659. =Modern times= In 1711 the Grand Principality of Translyvania was formed which became in 1804 part of the Austrian Empire. In 1867, by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the city became again part of Hungary. After the First World War following the proclamation of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, Turda as well became part of Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. \\"Turda √Æn perioada interbelicƒÉ\\" at the Turda City Hall site; accessed June 3, 2013 In 1944, the Battle of Turda took place here, between German and Hungarian forces on one side and Soviet and Romanian forces on the other. It was the largest battle fought in Transylvania during World War II. From the late 1950s, Turda became a rather important industrial centre, housing factories for chemical, electrotechnical ceramics, cement, glass and steel cables. The nearby C√¢mpia Turzii town hosted a siderurgy (steel) plant. The city centre of Turda saw redevelopment in the late 1980s, including a House of Culture that hasn't been finished up to this date. Many houses in the historic center were demolished to create space for apartment buildings. The town's role of an industrial powerhouse has diminished from the 1990s onwards, but tourist attractions have kept the city in a good state up to today. Climate Turda has a continental climate, characterised by warm dry summers and cold winters. The climate is influenced by the city's proximity to the Apuseni Mountains, as well as by urbanisation. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F), even though they rarely drop below ‚àí10 ¬∞C (14 ¬∞F). On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter. In summer, the average temperature is approximately 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F) (the average for July and August), despite the fact that temperatures sometimes reach 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) to 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F) in mid-summer in the city centre. Although average precipitation and humidity during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between 13 ¬∞C (55 ¬∞F) to 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F), and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain. Demographics According to the last Romanian census from 2011 there were 47,744 people living within the city. Of this population, 84.7% are ethnic Romanians, while 8.98% are ethnic Hungarians, 6.03% ethnic Roma and 0.4% others.

Lower reaches The final miles of the river flowing to the River Irwell have been extensively modified. The river is culverted underneath the car park of the City of Manchester Stadium (the site of a former gasworks). It is visible under a bridge on Baring Street, close to Piccadilly station, before running again in a culvert beneath the former University of Manchester Institute of Science & Technology campus (London Road (A6) to Princess Street), then under Hulme Street, until it appears briefly at Gloucester Street before flowing under the former gasworks at Gaythorn, reappearing at City Road East. At the point where Deansgate and Chester Road (A56) meet (under the Bridgewater Viaduct) the river meets the Bridgewater Canal head on, where a sluice gate (a listed structure) allowed water to feed the canal, until the water quality of the Medlock became too polluted for canal use. Normally the level of the river is several feet below the level of the canal, and the river is carried in a tunnel under the Castlefield canal basin, reappearing at Potato Wharf, where it is supplemented by excess canal water draining into a circular weir. When the river is in spate the tunnel cannot cope and river water enters the canal, flows across the basin, and exits via the weir and manually operated gates. A quarter of a mile further on the Medlock enters the Irwell adjacent to the bottom gate of the disused Hulme Locks. Navigation In the latter part of the 18th century the river was navigable at least between the Bridgewater Canal (at Deansgate) and the site of India House (on Whitworth Street). At India House was the entrance to a tunnel used to carry coal to a wharf at Store Street (by Piccadilly station).N.B. India House was built more than a century laterGeoffrey Ashworth, The Lost Rivers of Manchester, Willow Publishing, Altrincham, 1987, . The tunnel mouth is still visible. The tunnel was rendered obsolete by silting of the river and the construction of the Rochdale Canal. Notable features The area just south of Oxford Road railway station enclosed by the railway line and the loop in the river was known as Little Ireland, and was described by Friedrich Engels as \\"the most horrible spot\\" of the area.Friedrich Engels, Condition of the Working Class in England, 1845 (multiple publishers; online edition). It is commemorated by a red plaque on the wall of 8 Great Marlborough Street, about half-way between New Wakefield Street and Hulme Street.Site of Little Ireland Large numbers of immigrant Irish workers lived here in appalling housing conditions Built c.1827 Vacated c.1847 Demolished c.1877Hartwell, Clare (2001); p. 179 About 0.3 mile west of the plaque, there stands the Statue of Friedrich Engels at Tony Wilson Place. The statue was moved from Ukraine after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and has the now-culverted flow of River Medlock between Anne Horniman Street and City Road East beneath. The telephone exchange name, and subsequent dialling code for the area around Strinesdale, Moorside, and Grains Bar, was Medlock Head, abbreviated to MED for dialling. This was so at the time of the introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialling to the area in the 1960s. The name owed less to local geography than to technology. The code MED was rendered as 633 on the telephone dial. MAI, the code for Oldham Main, was 624. Post Office Telecoms equipment of the day worked better when discrete local geographical areas, then with relatively few subscribers, had similar prefixes. These numbers, and others beginning with 6, remain in use in Greater Manchester, prefixed by 0161.

Owned and operated by Rogers Media since 2002, CJCL's studios are located at the Rogers Building at Bloor and Jarvis in downtown Toronto, while its transmitters are located near Grimsby atop the Niagara Escarpment. Programming on the station includes local sports talk radio shows during the day; CBS Sports Radio overnight; and live broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays baseball, Toronto Raptors basketball, Toronto Maple Leafs hockey, Buffalo Bisons baseball and Buffalo Bills football. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial, as well as its transmitter power and height, CJCL covers most of southern Ontario during the day. The station's signal is directional from north to south to protect various lower-powered radio stations east and west of the station. Despite not having clear-channel status, CJCL can be heard through a stretch of eastern Appalachia at night under ideal conditions. 590 The Fan is simulcast across Canada on Bell Satellite TV satellite channel 959. History The station first aired on February 21, 1951 as CKFH; operating at 1400 kHz, it was a news and sports station owned by legendary Canadian broadcaster Foster Hewitt (the \\"FH\\" of the call sign). The station moved to the 1430 AM frequency in 1960, increasing power first to 5,000, then 10,000 and finally 50,000 watts. CKFH would begin playing Top 40 music in 1966, then move to a country music format in 1975. Fan 1430 logo (1992‚Äì1995) Fan 590 logo (1995‚Äì January 2011) Logo from January to October 2011 The station was subsequently sold to Telemedia in 1981 when it adopted its current CJCL call sign and switched to an adult contemporary format. In 1983, the station briefly adopted talk radio programming, but returned to its music format within a few months, with increased emphasis on oldies. CJCL was the flagship of the Telemedia network, and as such broadcast Toronto Blue Jays baseball games (with Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling the action) followed by hours of talk after the game. The station has been flagship radio station of the Blue Jays for most of their history since their inception in 1977 (with exception of a hiatus when CHUM (AM) was the flagship from 1998 to 2002). As the 1980s progressed and the winning Blue Jays became more popular, the sports features became CJCL's profit centre. Encouraged by the newfound success of sports radio in the United States, in 1992, the year the Blue Jays won their first World Series, CJCL would drop non-sports programming altogether on September 4, and became \\"The Fan 1430\\", the first all-sports station in Canada. The station's nickname may have been inspired by WFAN in New York City, the first sports radio station in the world that led to the creation of sports radio stations everywhere. In 1994, Telemedia acquired CKYC from Rogers, and on February 6, 1995, at noon, the two stations switched frequencies, with \\"The Fan\\" moving to 590 AM (subsequently becoming \\"The Fan 590\\") and CKYC moving to 1430 AM (where it operates today as multilingual station CHKT). CJCL was itself acquired by Rogers Media in 2002. In January 2011, CJCL became known as \\"Sportsnet Radio The Fan 590\\", the move coming as part of a co-branding initiative with its television counterpart Rogers Sportsnet, amid indications that rival TSN was preparing to launch a competing sports radio station, TSN Radio 1050.\\"TSN Radio a reality\\". The Globe and Mail, January 21, 2011. The station's on air identity was then changed to \\"Sportsnet 590 The Fan\\" in October 2011. The station also supports sports news updates for all-news radio CFTR. =Live sports= The Fan 590 is the flagship station for the following teams' radio broadcasts: *Toronto Blue Jays (MLB baseball) *Toronto Raptors (NBA basketball)‚ô† *Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL hockey)‚ô† ‚ô†-In case of conflicts with other sports broadcasts, one of the games will air on another station in the Toronto area. As Rogers owns the Blue Jays outright but only shares ownership (through Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment) of the Raptors and Maple Leafs, the Blue Jays games have first priority on CJCL. TSN Radio 1050 shares rights to the other two teams, including all games that are played at the same time as the Blue Jays. In contrast, because of an exclusive CFL-wide multimedia deal with TSN that ensures all Toronto Argonauts games air on TSN 1050, any Raptors or Maple Leaf games that conflict with the Argonauts will air on CJCL. The two stations split the broadcasts of games that do not conflict with each other. Roughly 11 Buffalo Bisons games (as of 2018) air on evening dates between June and August that do not conflict with Blue Jays games. The Bisons are the Triple-A International League affiliate of the Blue Jays, and broadcasts originate from Buffalo-based WWKB. The Fan 590 also features live coverage of the following: *Buffalo Bills (NFL football) *NBA All-Star Game *Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio (Sunday nights, All- Star Game & postseason; when not conflicting with Blue Jays games & weekday afternoon sports talk radio programming) *Memorial Cup hockey (Championship game) *NFL Football (Sunday afternoons) Previous live sports events on CJCL included: *Toronto Argonauts (CFL football) (2000-2001, 2007-2010) *Toronto FC (MLS soccer) *Ice Hockey World Championships (Team Canada games) *IIHF World U20 Championship (Team Canada games) *Toronto Rock (NLL lacrosse) (2006) *OHL All-Star Classic (OHL hockey) (2007) *International Bowl (NCAA college football) (2007-2010) *Premier League (soccer) (Saturday mornings, 2007-2010) *Grey Cup (CFL football) (2007-2009) *Toronto Marlies (AHL hockey) (2008-2010) *2009 World Baseball Classic (All Canada national baseball team games and the final four) *Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Men's tournament (All Team Canada games, plus the quarter-final game determining Team Canada's semi- final opponent, both semi-finals, and both the bronze medal and gold medal games) * Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics ‚Äì Women's tournament (Gold medal game) Notable on-air staff =Current= * Shoaib Alli * David Amber * Kevin Barker * David Bastl * Jeff Blair * Justin Bourne * Joe Bowen (Maple Leafs) * Stephen Brunt * Hugh Burrill * JD Bunkis * Sam Cosentino * Richard Deitsch * Ben Ennis * Rob Faulds * Elliotte Friedman * Paul Jones * Roger Lajoie * Ian Leggatt * Scott MacArthur * Jeff Marek * Andy McNamara * Scott Metcalfe * Tim Micallef * Andrew Nie * Steven Rapp * Dan Riccio * George Rusic * Alex Seixeiro * Sid Seixeiro * Gord Stellick * Anthony Stewart * Dan Shulman (Blue Jays) * Eric Smith * Erik Tomas * Joey Vendetta * Mike Wilner (Blue Jays) * Ben Wagner (Blue Jays) * Rob Wong * Angelo Viola (Fish'n Canada Show) * Mike Zigomanis =Former= * Sandy Annunziata * Jack Armstrong * Alan Ashby (Blue Jays) * Bill Berg * Howard Berger * Dean Blundell * Greg Brady * Tom Cheek * Don Cherry * Ken Daniels * John Derringer * Barb DiGiulio * Ashley Docking * Dirk Hayhurst * Mike Hogan * Jerry Howarth (Blue Jays) * Jim Hunt * Rob Iarusci * Mike Inglis * Peter Irvine * Spider Jones * Jim Kelley * Andrew Krystal * Nick Kypreos * Don Landry * Jim Lang * Jeff Lumby * Pat Marsden * Pete Martin * Doug MacLean * Bob McCown * Daren Millard * Jack Morris (Blue Jays) * Steve Paikin * Dan Pollard * Elliott Price * Rick Ralph * Nigel Reed * Paul Rimstead * Jim Richards * Mike Richards * Norm Rumack * Greg Sansone * Chris Schultz * John Shannon * James Sharman * Joe Siddall (Blue Jays; moved to Sportsnet television coverage) * Steve Simmons * Chuck Swirsky * Mike Toth * Andrew Walker * John Wells * Brian Williams * Damien Cox * Ashley Docking * Ric Nattress * Mark Osborne * Elliott Price * Bob Weeks References External links  * \\"FAN 590 an experiment gone right\\" (Toronto Star article) * Fan 590 Toronto's YouTube channel * Jcl Jcl Jcl Category:Sport in Toronto Category:Radio stations established in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in Ontario Category:HD Radio stations Category:Buffalo Bills broadcasters Category:Toronto Blue Jays broadcasters Category:Toronto Maple Leafs broadcasters Category:Toronto Raptors broadcasters Category:Sportsnet ","title":"CJCL"},{"id":"920487","text":"The Norwegian warrior √ñrvar-Oddr bids a last farewell to his blood brother, the Swedish warrior Hjalmar, by M√•rten Eskil Winge (1866). Blood brother can refer to one of two things: a male related by birth, or two or more men not related by birth who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a blood oath, where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the forearm, and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's veins. The act may carry a risk due to blood-borne diseases. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant. Cultures =Scandinavia= The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood () involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in G√≠sla saga. In F√≥stbr√¶√∞ra saga, the bond of Thorgeir Havarsson (√ûorgeir H√°varsson) and Thormod Bersason (√ûorm√≥√∞ Bersason) is sealed by such ritual as well, the ritual being called a leikr. √ñrvar-Oddr's saga contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. √ñrvar-Oddr, after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior Hjalmar to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him In the mythology of northern Europe, Gunther and H√∂gni became the blood brothers of Sigurd when he married their sister Gudrun; in Wagner's Ring Cycle, the same occurs between Gunther and Wagner's version of Sigurd, Siegfried, which is marked by the \\"Blood Brotherhood Leitmotiv\\". Additionally, it is briefly stated in Lokasenna that Odin and Loki are blood brothers. =Scythia= Among the Scythians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship (Lucian, Toxaris). 4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single drinking horn (most notably in a gold appliqu√© from Kul-Oba) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.Caspar Meyer, Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity, OUP (2013), 246 (fig. 98b) \\"Gold relief appliqu√© showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn. From Kul-Oba (Inventory 2, K.12h). Rostoftzeff identified the scene with the Scythain sacred oath described in Herodotus 4.70. Fourth century BC. 5 √ó 3.7 cm, 28.35 gr.\\"; see also \\"Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine\\", Scythian gold statuette depicting the ritual of brotherhood. The Hungarian hajduks had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible. =East Asia= In Asian cultures, the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a tribal relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the Mongols and early Chinese. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother, the Oath of the Peach Garden, by sacrificing a black ox and a white horse and swearing faith; other blood oaths involving animal sacrifice were characteristic of rebel groups, such as the uprising led by Deng Maoqi in the 1440s, of criminal organizations, such as the triads or the pirates of Lin Daoqian, and of non-Han ethnic minorities such as the Mongols or Manchu. In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian. =Philippines= El Pacto de Sangre, a romanticized painting of the Sandugo blood compact ritual between the Spanish explorer Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna of Bohol, Philippines; by Juan Luna (1886) In the Philippines, blood compacts (sandugo or sanduguan, literally \\"one blood\\") were ancient rituals intended to seal a friendship or treaty, or to validate an agreement. They are described in the records of early Spanish and Portuguese explorers to the islands. The most well-known version of the ritual from the Visayan people involves mixing a drop of blood from both parties into a single cup of wine that is then drunk. Other versions also exist, like in Palawan which describes a ritual involving making a cut on the chest and then daubing the blood on the tongue and forehead.Sandugo Festival Bohol Philippines www.philippinecountry.com Retrieved December 2006. =Africa= The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. The British colonial administrator Lord Lugard is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the Kikuyu chieftain Waiyaki Wa Hinga. David Livingstone wrote of a similar practice called 'Kasendi'. =Southeastern Europe= Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient Southeastern Europe where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the Balkans during the Ottoman era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, Serbia, Republic of North Macedonia. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as , in the Eastern Orthodox churches; known as in the Roman Catholic church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers. Famous blood brothers = Historical = * The chiefs of the seven Hungarian tribes formed an alliance by drinking from each other's blood, while choosing √Ålmos as their leader in the 9th century AD. * The Mongol leaders Yes√ºkhei (the father of Genghis Khan) and Toghrul were blood brothers in the 12th century AD. * The Greek Nikolaos Kriezotis and the Serbian Vasos Mavrovouniotis in the Greek War of Independence * Tem√ºjin (Genghis Khan) and Jamukha were childhood friends and blood brothers, although Jamukha later betrayed Tem√ºjin, and was executed at the order of Tem√ºjin (At Jamukha's refusal of reconciliation). * Two Norman knights who took part in the Conquest of Britain in 1066, Robert d'Ouilly and Roger d'Ivry, were well known as blood brothers.

He is best known as the lead singer and primary lyricist of the rock band Tool, with whom he has released five studio albums, A Perfect Circle, with whom he has released four studio albums, and Puscifer, with whom he has released three studio albums. Originally from Ohio, Keenan spent his high school and college years in Michigan. He joined the Army after graduating from high school. After leaving the Army, he attended the Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction, and formed Tool with Adam Jones shortly thereafter. In addition to his music career, Keenan owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars in Arizona, where he resides. Since rising to fame, he has been noted as a recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes and for the occasional interview. He has also ventured into acting. Early life West Point Prep School yearbookalt=A man with his head turned left smiles slightly as his photograph is taken. Maynard James Keenan was born James Herbert Keenan in Ravenna, Ohio, on April 17, 1964, the only child of Southern Baptists Judith Marie (n√©e Dougherty; November 22, 1943June 18, 2003) and Michael Loren Keenan.Ohio Birth Index, 1908‚Äì2011Ohio, Death Index, 1908‚Äì1932, 1938‚Äì1944, and 1958‚Äì2007 He is of Irish and Italian descent. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father moved to Scottville, Michigan, and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an \\"intolerant and unworldly household\\" where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.. His mother suffered a paralyzing subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured cerebral aneurysm in 1976 when Keenan was 11, and this incident would later serve as the inspiration for songs such as Tool's \\"Jimmy\\" and \\"Wings for Marie\\" and A Perfect Circle's \\"Judith\\".. A few years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Scottville, which he considers \\"the best move [he] ever made\\". In 1982, he graduated from Mason County Central High School in Scottville, where he was a member of the wrestling team. His father was one of the coaches for the team and left coaching at the same time Keenan graduated in 1982. Inspired by Bill Murray's performance in the 1981 comedy film Stripes, Keenan joined the United States Army, with the intention of having the G.I. Bill fund his dream of attending art school. By this point, he had lived in Kansas, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas. He initially served in the Army as a forward observer before studying at West Point Prep School from 1983 to 1984. In addition to completing a rigorous math and English curriculum, Keenan wrestled, ran on the cross country team, and sang in the glee club. It was during his time in the military that he adopted the sobriquet \\"Maynard\\" on a whim, based on a fictional character he had created in high school. He was distinguished in basic and advanced training, but declined an appointment to West Point and instead chose to pursue a music career because of his disillusionment with his colleagues' values and because he knew West Point would not tolerate his dissidence. Music career =Early bands= Upon completing his term of prep school, Keenan studied art at Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. From there he moved to Somerville, Massachusetts, where his love of animals led him to practice interior design for a Boston-area pet store. He was transferred to a store in Los Angeles, before he was quickly fired and began working in set construction. During the 1980s, Keenan played bass guitar for TexA.N.S. and sang for Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, both independent bands. During this time, he wrote an early version of \\"Sober\\", later Tool's first successful single. He also (with future Tool bandmate Danny Carey) performed live and recorded with Green Jell√∂ between 1990 and 1993, playing guitar and performing backup vocals as the voice of one of the pigs on the band's hit song \\"Three Little Pigs\\" on their debut album Cereal Killer, and appearing in the music video for \\"Slave Boy\\" on the band's follow-up LP 333. Around this time he also struck up a friendship with Tom Morello, who has credited Keenan with introducing him to Drop D tuning. Keenan spent time jamming with Morello and Brad Wilk, as did Zack de la Rocha: Morello and Wilk considered Keenan and de la Rocha as candidates for the vocalist with what would become Rage Against the Machine before deciding to ask the latter. =Tool= After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met Adam Jones who had in college heard him singing on a demo. Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones suggested that they form a band. Reluctant, Keenan eventually agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones; his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey; and bassist Paul D'Amour, who would later be replaced by Justin Chancellor. alt=A man with a microphone stands on a major stage set. Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment in November 1991 and released the Opiate EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine. Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, Undertow, in the United States. It was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later. In 1994, the band released their single \\"Prison Sex\\" with a corresponding music video created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed \\"too graphic and offensive\\", and was withdrawn by MTV after a few airings due to \\"a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse\\". In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, √Ünima. The album was certified gold in ten weeks, achieved double platinum in ten months, and won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1998. After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label, Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records), over contract violations. Following this legal battle, which resulted in a new three-record deal, the members of Tool decided to take some time off. During the hiatus, Keenan went under the alias \\"Gaylord C.\\" while collaborating with Tim Alexander of Primus and Mike Bordin of Faith No More on \\"Choked\\", a track on the 1997 drumming compilation Flyin' Traps. The band members were outspokenly critical of peer-to-peer file sharing networks, due to the negative financial effect on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with NY Rock in 2000, Keenan stated, \\"I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.\\" Five years after the release of √Ünima, Tool announced a new album, Systema Enc√©phale, with a 12-song track list in January 2001. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his \\"dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists\\", Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he \\"doesn't cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past\\". In an interview with NY Rock, Keenan explained, \\"Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for \\"Schism\\" are nothing more than my interpretation of the music.\\" The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for \\"Schism\\". In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called \\"Fallen\\" with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band's self-titled debut album. alt=Musicians performing on stage in front of a crowd under many lights of different colors. 15 years after the band's formation, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of Revolver described as a devoted \\"cult\\" following, and in May 2006 the band released 10,000 Days, an album in which Keenan sang about more personal issues in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change. His mother, who inspired the song \\"Jimmy\\" on √Ünima, also served as the inspiration for \\"Jambi\\", and the two-part song \\"Wings for Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days (Wings for Marie, Pt 2)\\", which deals with her 2003 death after 27 years, or around 10,000 days, of suffering. The album sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was No. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts. However, 10,000 Days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor Lateralus had been.Metacritic calculated an average score of 68 for 10,000 Days compared to 75 for Lateralus. Following 10,000 Days, Tool had one album remaining to fulfill the obligation of its record contract. Over the course of the following years, the band slowly made progress towards its fifth studio release. Tool has worked around Keenan and his side projects since 1999, starting with the creation of A Perfect Circle, which has led to several years between projects. Regarding the future of Tool, Keenan stated in a 2007 interview with Spin, \\"We'll make music together until one of us is dead.\\" On March 24, 2009, a summer tour was announced on Tool's website, and in a March 26 press release Tool was confirmed as a headliner for the second annual Mile High Music Festival in Commerce City, Colorado, with Widespread Panic and The Fray. Tool also headlined Lollapalooza 2009 in Chicago, Illinois. On August 7, 2019, Tool released the title track for Fear Inoculum across all streaming services. =A Perfect Circle= During Tool's post-√Ünima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the √Ünima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve- step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"‚Äîa song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step‚Äîand \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMotion, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: alt=A group of musicians performing on stage in front of a crowd. When asked, in an interview for Spin that same month, about the possibility of another A Perfect Circle album, Keenan stated, \\"Maybe, someday, a song on a soundtrack. But an album? No.\\" A year later, on December 9, 2008, blabbermouth.net reported that Keenan had announced on The Pulse of Radio that he and Howerdel have been writing new music for A Perfect Circle. Keenan also said that the band has no plans to resume full-scale touring, or even to write and record a new album. Instead, they will focus on \\"one or two songs at a time\\", which will most likely be released via the Internet. However, in November 2010, the band returned from a nearly six-and-a-half-year hiatus with a 14-show tour in the western US. Touring resumed in May 2011 with a North American tour across the US and Canada that wrapped up at the end of August. The band performed only once in 2012 with a show of December 29 in Las Vegas, followed by a five-show Australian tour and a three-show South American tour in early 2013. =Puscifer= In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name \\"Puscifer\\" for the song \\"REV 22:20\\" on the Underworld film soundtrack. Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been \\"formed as a manifestation of [Keenan's] creative subconscious\\"‚Äî interpreted to mean that the name is now a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is \\"a premiere improvisational hardcore band\\", and his \\"catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc.\\" project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his \\"attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good.\\" In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating \\"that's the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good.\\" In 2006, Puscifer contributed the song \\"The Undertaker (Renholder Mix)\\" to the soundtrack of Underworld: Evolution, where \\"Renholder\\", a moniker for Danny Lohner created by the members of A Perfect Circle, is the reversal of \\"Re: D Lohner\\". Keenan financed and released the first studio album, \\"V\\" Is for Vagina, in October 2007. Created in a tour bus, in several hotel rooms, and in various studios around the country while Keenan toured with Tool, the album is a radical departure from Keenan's contributions in Tool and A Perfect Circle. Tim Alexander, best known as the drummer for rock band Primus, was a guest musician on the album. He called Puscifer \\"trancy and hypnotic\\" and a \\"total 180 from Tool\\". The album was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in Keenan's previous work. Puscifer is also a clothing line, with merchandise available for purchase on the band's website. On September 16, 2008, Keenan updated the puscifer.com blog, revealing that the first ever Puscifer store would be opening \\"hopefully\\" by October 1 in Jerome, Arizona. Occupying a small space above a tattoo parlor, the store opened on October 3, 2008. In addition to the merchandise available on the band's online store, Keenan has also made available locally roasted coffee, art, and limited edition collectibles. On February 13‚Äì15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so abstract it is not easily described. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated \\"we didn't really have any clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret.\\" Keenan‚Äîwho has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool‚Äîwent on to add that \\"you just can't really describe it, you just have to see it, then it makes sense.\\" Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance. alt=Musicians performing on stage. Puscifer continued to perform with a revolving lineup throughout 2009 at venues around the Southwest. However, in a November 2009 interview, Keenan stated: \\"Efforts to confine our beloved enigma to the Southwestern United States have been thwarted. We are compelled beyond all reason to bring the noise Eastward and share our special sauce. Although authorities suggest you be prepared for any and all possibilities, we simply suggest you arrive happy and hungry.\\" On October 18, 2011, Keenan released Puscifer's second album, Conditions of My Parole. The album received generally favorable reviews on Metacritic, a positive review from Allmusic's Gregory Heaney, who described it as \\"a fine piece of cold weather headphone music.\\" Keenan followed with the February 19, 2013, release of Donkey Punch the Night. This EP includes covers of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" by Queen and \\"Balls to the Wall\\" by Accept. It received mostly mixed reviews, resulting in a Metacritic rating of 62%. Writing and performance style Keenan with Snoop Dogg in 2001 A primary purpose of Keenan's lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level, encouraging them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection. Tool did not include lyrics with any releases until Fear Inoculum, as Keenan believes most people \\"don't get it\\" and it is not a priority of the band that people do. However, after each release Keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semi-official fansite, with the exception of \\"Lateralus\\", which was published on the official Tool website. Despite Maynard's aversion to promoting the lyrical content of Tool's work to its audience, lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in the lyrics to \\"Lateralus\\", wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers, and \\"Jambi\\", in which the metrical foot iamb is used. Keenan's lyrics on √Ünima and Lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality‚Äîspecific subjects range from evolution and Jungian psychology in \\"Forty-Six & 2\\" and transcendence in \\"Lateralus\\". In live performances with Tool, Keenan has often been situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage, without a spotlight, facing the backdrop rather than the audience. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video director, says that the dark spaces on stage \\"are mostly for Maynard\\". He explains, \\"a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows.\\" An exception, which surprised even devout Tool fans, occurred when a fan climbed on stage and attempted to hug Keenan during the band's performance of \\"Pushit\\". After dropping the fan to the ground with a gentle hip toss, Keenan, continuing to sing, wrapped himself around the man's back into a rear naked choke. He held the man without actually constricting his neck, allowing him to raise his fist in celebration. Keenan eventually turned the man to his stomach and sat on his back, where he stayed for \\"an uncomfortably long period of time.\\" His appearance with Tool has included the Mohawk hairstyle, wigs, Kabuki masks, bras, tights, and his entire body in blue paint. This is contrasted with a variety of long haired wigs while performing with or promoting A Perfect Circle. Describing Keenan's contribution to Tool and A Perfect Circle, The New York Times wrote that \\"both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity\\". He ranked No. 21 in Hit Parader's 2006 list of \\"Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists\\", and his style of singing has been considered influential to Pete Loeffler of Chevelle and Jared Leto of Thirty Seconds to Mars. Comedy and acting Keenan is featured in several segments of Mr. Show, most notably in the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season in which he plays the lead singer of the then- fictitious band \\"Puscifer\\". He also appears in episode 2.6, \\"The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop\\". Later, Keenan sang on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run, and appears in the \\"music video sex scene\\" on its DVD. Keenan appeared on the cover of the May/June 1999 issue of Pop Smear magazine, portraying Charles Manson as part of a photo essay, imitating a famous Life magazine portrait. He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, \\"Oh, Manson. He's a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there's so much gray area.\\" In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created \\"Free Frances Bean\\" tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances's mother, Courtney Love, had previously referred to Keenan as a \\"media whore\\" to which he responded, \\"Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love.\\" He said that after watching \\"the tornado that is her mother\\", he thought \\"Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?\\" Although it was started as a simple joke, the T-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan began giving them away. On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced, as an April Fools' Day prank, that \\"Maynard has found Jesus\\" and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently. Kurt Loder of MTV contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply \\"heh heh\\". On April 7, the official site revealed that it was a hoax. During an interview Keenan later stated, \\"It was April Fools'. If you fall for that on April Fools' Day, there's nothing I can do for you.\\" He has been part of other April Fools' pranks related to Tool, including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident. Keenan made a cameo in the 2009 film Crank: High Voltage. In May 2015, Keenan made a cameo in an episode of Comedy Bang! Bang! as fictional punk musician Barf Edwards. Winemaking and other endeavors alt=Two wine bottles, one showing the front label and the other showing the back label. In addition to a produce market in Cornville, Arizona;.Eisen, Benjy (January 21, 2009). \\"Tool's Maynard James Keenan Buys/Sells Organic Produce\\". Spinner.com. Retrieved December 16, 2010. Keenan, whose grandparents and great-uncle made wine in Northern Italy, owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Sedona, where he resides. While the winery is named after an ancient symbol for commerce (caduceus), the vineyard is named after a pubic wig (merkin). He is also a partner of Stronghold Vineyards, \\"an 80-acre site dedicated to producing affordable wines in the state\\", located in the small, unincorporated area known as Kansas Settlement in Sulfur Springs Valley, Arizona. Keenan's mother died in 2003, at the age of 59, due to complications from an aneurysm. Following her death, he scattered her ashes across one of his vineyards, and later named one of his wines after her, honoring her memory with his Cabernet Sauvignon \\"Nagual del Judith\\". Keenan released a statement in April 2009: His previous wines were named after relatives of the Chiricahua Apache chief Cochise who lived in the area where the vineyard is located, and were produced at Page Springs Cellars, owned by Keenan's business partner. While those wines used some fruits imported from California, \\"Nagual del Judith\\" was the first made entirely from Keenan's own vineyard. Keenan was also a part-owner of Cobras & Matadors, an LA restaurant run by Steven Arroyo until 2012. During the fall season of 2008, Keenan and his Stronghold Vineyards partner Eric Glomski promoted his wine with signing sessions at Whole Foods Markets in California and Nevada. The tour continued in 2009 with sessions in Texas kicking off in March, and appearances scheduled during Tool's 2009 summer tour in Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. In July 2009, Keenan opened an organic market which features a tasting room for his Arizona wines as well as a food court. Keenan is featured in Blood into Wine: The Arizona Stronghold, a documentary co-produced by Moog filmmakers Ryan Page and Christopher Pomerenk that chronicles Keenan and Glomski's winemaking in the desert conditions of Arizona's Verde Valley. The film, which includes appearances from Tim & Eric, Patton Oswalt, and Milla Jovovich, was shown at the Noise Pop Festival on February 25, 2010. The same festival also showed another documentary produced by Pomerenk, The Heart is a Drum Machine. It investigates why people create and listen to music, and features Keenan, Jason Schwartzman, Kurt Loder, Nic Harcourt, Juliette Lewis, and Elijah Wood. In a January 2013 interview with Phoenix New Times, Keenan announced work on an autobiography. Keenan's authorized biography, A Perfect Union of Contrary Things, was released on November 8, 2016. Philanthropy Keenan performed at a 1997 benefit concert for RAINN (the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) organized by Tori Amos (who had often referred to Keenan as an unofficial brother). He is one of the notable performers for Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization that brings musicians, fans of music, and grassroots political organizations together to fight for social justice. In 2004, Axis of Justice released Concert Series Volume 1. Included are two tracks featuring Keenan on vocals. The second track on the album, \\"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\\", was recorded live during Lollapalooza in Seattle, Washington on August 23, 2003. The first track, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", was recorded live during the Axis of Justice Concert Series at The Avalon in Hollywood on July 19, 2004. In February 2005, Keenan appeared as a surprise vocalist at a Seattle benefit concert for victims of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in southern Asia, performing with the partly reformed Alice in Chains, in place of the deceased vocalist Layne Staley, on the songs \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Man in the Box\\", and \\"Rooster\\". Personal life Keenan has a son, Devo, who sang backing vocals on A Perfect Circle's Thirteenth Step, and was later credited as the cellist on Ashes Divide's Keep Telling Myself It's Alright. He also gave a solo cello performance for Keenan's 50th birthday celebration concert, \\"Cinquanta\\". Two songs bear the name of Keenan's mother, Judith: \\"Wings for Marie (Pt. 1)\\" by Tool and \\"Judith\\" by A Perfect Circle. Keenan has a reputation for being reclusive and controlling of his public image. He dislikes the manner in which celebrities are worshipped, and at one point carried business cards with the name \\"Jesus H. Christ\\" printed on them. When dealing with stalkers, Keenan has resorted to using a paintball gun to run off trespassers from his property. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of Keenan's pursuits, and he studied under Rickson Gracie. It was announced in June 2010 that Keenan had proposed to girlfriend and Caduceus lab manager Lei Li. On September 10, 2012, Keenan wrote an article for the Phoenix New Times in which he made reference to his wife. On July 25, 2014, Keenan's wife gave birth to their daughter, Lei Li Agostina Maria.

It is the newest airport and, with LiepƒÅja International Airport and Riga International Airport, is one of the three notable airports in the country. Overview Ventspils Airport was founded in 1939. From 1940, it was used by Soviet Aircraft. Once 1975 an asphalt-concrete runway () and an apron () were built. At that time there was an air control dispatchers point at the aerodrome and 40-45 employees worked in the airport. The aerodrome was used by aircraft AN-24, AN-2, YAK-40, MI-2. The flight range was small and there were only two scheduled flights: Ventspils - Riga and Ventspils - Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). In addition to commercial traffic, state departments used the airport for various reasons. There were state border control flights, flights for oil pipeline control, forest patrols, traffic control, fishing inspection flights and others. Airport operation ceased in 1983 due to political decisions by the government. The possibility re-opening the airport was first discussed in the mid-1990s by which time Ventspils had become an important transport hub. The efficiency and importance of the re-opening of the Ventspils Airport was evaluated. The main conclusions of this research were that the rehabilitation of the airport would enhance the efficiency of transport corridors and foster economic activity in the region. The region possessed all the social and economic preconditions that indicate potential demand for air traffic. An operational Ventspils Airport would promote competitiveness of the Ventspils transport hub in the European and global markets. At the time the re-opening of the airport was being considered, people in the Ventspils region and corporate clients who wished to travel by air used the airport at Riga that was away from Ventspils. This added 6‚Äì8 hours of travel time to the airport in Riga and back by road. These opportunities did not satisfy the demand for air transport traffic. Work on the project \\"The rehabilitation of the Airport Ventspils\\" began in 1997. Implementation of the project began in 1999. It was developed within the National Transport Development Programme of the Republic of Latvia (1996-2010). At the start of 2001, all documentation for the airport exploitation was prepared and a modern security program was developed. The plan of safety improvements for security standards was followed by the equipping of the temporary passenger service building and establishing an electric security system. The most important result of the activities was the start of operation in 2000 upon receiving the certificate. The certificate confirmed that the aerodrome was suitable for exploitation and the first programs of flights were for conclusion that the first cycle of Ventspils Airport development was completed. On 11 April 2008, Latvian national airline airBaltic began the first regular service from the airport to Riga but ceased after few months due to low patronage.

Freestyle is performed individually or more commonly in groups, both competitively and recreationally. The Freestyle Players Association (FPA) is the governing body of freestyle, \\"dedicated to the growth of freestyle disc play as a lifetime recreation and competitive sport. The organization is involved in international tournaments and rankings as well as education grants and promotional activities. Every year, the FPA holds a world championship with divisions in Open Pairs, Mixed Pairs, Open Co-op, and Women‚Äôs Pairs. Competitive freestyle is usually judged on execution, difficulty, and artistic impression by a panel of players. History By the late 1960s and early 1970s, modern flying discs had become a popular pastime in the United States, developing into various disciplines such as double disc court, disc guts, ultimate, disc golf, and disc freestyle.[Frisbee by the Masters, Charles Tips 33] At the time, most disc players were overall players, participating in all the various disciplines. Freestyle began in the 1960s with a few players, like Victor Malafronte, John \\"Z\\" Weyand, Ken Westerfield, Kerry Kollmar and Dan Roddick trying to perform more complex trick catches and throws. Freestyle was introduced as its own competitive discipline, with the first Frisbee freestyle competitions occurring in 1974, at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships, Toronto, Ontario, and the Vancouver Open Frisbee Championships, Vancouver, BC. Freestyle in the beginning before the invention of the \\"nail delay\\" catching possibilities would depend on the throw you were given, it was always spontaneous and unpredictable. Play of this type of freestyle was performed with two players standing 30-40 yards apart, the throws were fast and varied and the catches were right off the throw, except for the occasional kick or slap-up and rarely a pause between the catch and the throw back. At advanced levels, the throws and catches would become a flow that was created once you mastered the basics. It was fast and fluid and visibly would resemble martial arts and dance. One of the earliest distinctly freestyle disc maneuver was the tip, the act of quickly pressing fingers on the bottom of the disc to maintain or alter its position without catching the disc or letting it fall to the ground.[Frisbee by the Masters, Charles Tips 34] Tipping first began in the early 70s, becoming more popular and refined by 1975.[Frisbee by the Masters, Charles Tips 34] The tip, according to some histories, eventually led to the nail delay,[Frisbee by the Masters, Charles Tips 125] considered by many to be the beginning of modern freestyle. The invention of the nail delay is disputed, but its first tournament appearance occurred when Freddie Haft performed the delay in the freestyle pairs event at the 1975 American Flying Disc Open (AFDO) in Rochester, NY.[The Origins and Early History of Freestyle Jim Palmieri, Unpublished] This was the first freestyle event held in the US. The nail delay involves balancing the disc on the fingernail while the disc continues to spin. This technique allows freestylers to change the flight path of the disc and perform numerous balletic and technical maneuvers such as restricted pulls, holds, turnovers, and shoots. The pinnacle of freestyle as a commercial and popular venture was in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Wham-O sponsored major tournament circuits culminating in the Rose Bowl,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kuo7UIcM38 an overall event with a prominent freestyle component.[DiscCast: Freestyle History with Roger Meier and Rob Fried] Experienced players would collect points in smaller tournaments to win a spot in the Rose Bowl.[DiscCast: Freestyle History with Skippy Jammer] Famous appearances include freestyle legends Johnny Dwork, Joey Hudoklin, Donnie Rhodes, Bill Wright, and Jens and Irwin Valasquez. By 1981, Wham-O changed management and pulled its funding from freestyle.[DiscCast: Freestyle History with Roger Meier and Rob Fried] Subsequently, the growth of freestyle severely declined, with play mostly limited to Americans introduced to the sport in its first two decades. By the late 1990s, freestyle seemed to be in decline as few new players began playing.The Ultimate Disc Golf Show By the mid-2000s, however, the sport experienced a resurgence of growth in Europe, South America, and Japan. The cause of this resurgence is debated, but most attribute the growth to Paganello (a large, Italian ultimate tournament that sponsored a popular freestyle event), the impact of touring American players like Jens and Irwin Valasquez as well as Tom Leitner and Sune Wentzel (as part of a Nike tour), and a popular Nike commercial featuring two leading American freestylers, Dave Murphy and Dave Lewis. Today freestyle has a renewed popularity in the United States, as jammers across the country seek to emulate prodigy Emma Kahle (aka M-Maw), as well as in Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Israel and Colombia. Getting started Freestyle is performed indoors and outdoors, on fields and on the beach. The style and technique of players often depend on the conditions they play in, especially the wind. Freestyle jams, as they are called, involve anywhere from 2 to 15 people, but most hover between 2-5. A jam with more than 4 or 5 is often called a \\"mob-op\\" as opposed to pairs (2 players) or co-op (3 players). Most competitive freestyle today centers around the nail-delay with many players using what are called delay-aids (plastic nails and silicone sprays). There is also a faster throw and catch version that can be played without the use of delay-aids. =Equipment and play= Freestyle is performed with a lighter, usually 160 gram disc. The disc can be sprayed with some kind of lubricant for facilitating the nail delay such as silicone spray. In freestyle competitions, most advanced players wear fake nails made out of acrylic, some organic materials like bones or antlers, and other plastics, which are glued onto fingernails during play, though they are not necessary. A faster throwing and catching version of freestyle (fast-freestyle) can be played without the use of equipment (nail-delay paraphernalia, sprays and plastic nails). Basic maneuvers =Tipping= Tipping is performed by poking the center of the disc with various body parts to cause the disc to \\"pop up,\\" usually maintaining the angle of the disc and its spin. Tipping is performed with finger tips, elbows, knees, feet, and even the top of the head. Joey Hudoklin's famous tipping combo is considered the epitome of this technique.1986 US Open: Joey Hudoklin =Brushing= Brushing involves swiping the disc tangentially with the rotation of the disc. Brushing is performed with the hands, knees, and feet. =Rolling= Ken Westerfield helped to popularize the flying disc as an alternative sport in the 1960s and 70s Rolling, first demonstrated by Ken Westerfield in 1975, is performed when the disc rolls across any part of the body. The most common roll is the chest or front roll, which is performed when the disc rolls from one hand, across the chest, to the second hand in order to be caught or released for more maneuvers. Experienced players often perform front, back, and leg rolls, with and against the spin, in creative combination. =Delaying= The nail delay involves balancing the disc on the nail (or occasionally teeth, feet, and elbows) in order to manipulate the disc‚Äôs position. The delay can be performed on the rim of the disc in vertical, angled, or centered/flat positions. Most players have a spin preference, preferring either clockwise or counterclockwise, but most players, especially advanced players can perform maneuvers with both spins. The delay is characteristic of more modern, technical freestyle, which uses the delay to perform more complicated maneuvers like turnovers and \\"against the spin\\" moves (manipulations that use angle and carefully applied friction to force the disc in a direction that its spin counteracts, a technique invented and mastered by Skippy Jammer). =Turnovers= A turnover is performed when the disc is changed from a right- side up position to an upside-down position. The turnover is a popular, technical aspect of the game that requires proper leverage, a pivot point, and usually a \\"spin change.\\" A spin change involves changing the disc from counterclockwise to clock or clock to counterclockwise. The physics of turnover requires that the disc change spin, relative to the player, unless the turnover is a \\"360\\" turnover involving two spin changes, arriving back at the original spin. =Catches= Freestyle catches are generally split into two overlapping categories: blind and restricted. Blind catches are ones where the player cannot see the disc entering the hand and include popular moves such as scarecrow and phlaud. Restricted catches involve positioning the hand around some part of the body, such as under the leg or behind the back. One of the most famous and iconic freestyle catches is called \\"gitis\\" and involves catching a disc with one hand over and around the opposite leg. Catches can also be performed between the legs or by resting on parts of the body such as the back. =Throws= Freestyles often incorporate different kinds of throws to add difficulty and style as well as create various kinds of spin and angles. Basic throws include backhand, sidearm (forehand), overhand wrist- flip, staker, and helicopter. More advanced throws include blind, restricted, and special MAC throws (any throw that involves hitting the top of the disc mid-flight with a free limb, like the opposite hand, foot, or elbow, to create extra spin, slow the velocity, and change the angle).

It is the first game in the Conker series and follows the story of Conker the Squirrel as he retrieves his stolen birthday presents and rescues his girlfriend Berri, who has been kidnaped by the Evil Acorn. The cartridge is dual-format, allowing it to also run on the original Game Boy with some gameplay differences. Gameplay Conker's Pocket Tales follows the story of Conker the Squirrel as he retrieves his birthday presents and rescues his girlfriend Berri after they were stolen and she was kidnaped by the Evil Acorn. The game is played from a top-down perspective, with Conker exploring large environments in an attempt to find all his stolen presents. By collecting a certain number of presents in each area and defeating a boss, players unlock access to the next one. In addition to standard running and jumping, Conker can perform a mid-air ground-pounding attack that can hit buttons to solve puzzles. Conker also has the ability to dig up patches of soft dirt, emerging at another predetermined patch to reach inaccessible areas, and uses a slingshot to defeat enemies or hit distant switches. Puzzles are also solved by pushing blocks into grooves in the floor. The game can be played on both Game Boy and Game Boy Color. However, the layout and some events in the game are different depending on the console it is played on. The game can be paused and saved anywhere when played on a Game Boy Color or later model, but can only be saved at specific save points when played on a non-color Game Boy. Development and release Conker's Pocket Tales is the first Game Boy Color game that was developed by Rare. The game was released in North America on 8 June 1999 and in Europe in August 1999. Reception Conker's Pocket Tales received generally mixed reviews from critics. In a very positive review, Planet Game Boy magazine praised the game's size and included minigames, stating that Pocket Tales is \\"a real grower\\" and that its lengthy lifespan of 20 hours \\"will fly by.\\" Similarly, N64 Magazine stated that the game is \\"far more engrossing than you'd expect it to be after [its] dismal start\\", highlighting its length, puzzles and exploration aspect. Although the magazine concluded that the game is nowhere near as good as The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX, it still considered it one of the best Game Boy Color games at the time of its release.

This can be done using a number of different techniques, from using a \\"media\\" type that traps particulates, but allows air to pass through to a venturi, to a membrane that only allows air to pass through.  Usage  It is now common to have various stages of filtration employed in a filter- regulator-lubricator form factor, usually with the different filter housings connected. Air filtration applications are diverse and include end-user sectors such as cleanroom environments, biomedical, analytical instrumentation, food processing, marine and aviation, agriculture, manufacturing, food and beverage packaging and a host of other uses.  Primary filters  Typical commercial pneumatic filters will remove particles as small as 5 micrometres from the air. The filters protect pneumatic devices from damage that would be caused by these contaminants. These contaminants include lubricant particles ejected by the compressor, dirt particles, small water droplets or aerosols.  Secondary filters & membrane air dryers  Secondary filters are used for a variety of applications and can remove particles as small as 50 nanometres in size. These secondary filters can remove fumes, odors, vapor, mist, moisture, oil, and tiny particles from the air stream. In addition, special \\"point-of-use\\" air drying devices (called membrane air dryers) may be used to depress the pressure dewpoint by selectively passing water vapor out of the compressed air stream as it passes through the inside hollows of a bundle of narrow, thinly-coated, membrane fibers. A small amount of \\"sweep air\\" must then be purged around the outside of the bundle of hollow fibers carrying the compressed air. Purge or \\"sweep\\" air is thus expanded (to atmospheric pressure) and subsequently vented to the atmosphere. The \\"dryer\\" purge air which is carried or swept along the outside of the hollow bundle of fibers creates a vapor pressure gradient between the \\"wet\\" compressed air on the inside the fibers and the \\"dryer\\" sweep air on the outside the bundle. This results in delivery of cleaner, dryer air before the compressed air is sent into any \\"moisture-sensitive\\" equipment(s). Membrane air dryers, however, may be easily damaged through any contact with liquid droplets (water or oil) so they should be protected with a high-efficiency coalescing (nano) air filter, positioned either immediately upstream (or integrated within) the membrane air dryer housing. Membrane dryers are primarily used with equipment's that are especially sensitive to water vapor such as paint booths, two-part mixing equipment (polyurethane sealants), polyurethane dispensers, PUR-applicators (edge-banding equipment), laser- cutting machinery, CMM's, industrial ink-jet printers, or even for laboratory use .

A part of its statistical urban area, called R√∂nninge, is in Salem Municipality. The population is 35,311 (2005). The Swedish krona banknotes are printed by Crane AB at Tumba Bruk, in Tumba. Tumba is situated half-way between Stockholm and S√∂dert√§lje and is considered a Stockholm suburb. In Tumba and R√∂nninge there are stations on the Stockholm commuter rail network. Tumba also has a High School (Tumba gymnasium) with almost 1.000 students. The Alfa Laval company was founded in Tumba by Gustaf de Laval and remains in the suburb, as does DeLaval, split from Alfa Laval in 1991. Tumba is diverse, with high-rise apartment buildings and single-family houses. Tumba also has a shopping mall, Tumba Centrum, near the railway station. The melodic death metal band Amon Amarth is from Tumba. Tumba railway station History of Tumba What makes Tumba different from the communities in northern Botkyrka is that it doesn‚Äôt stem from a big farm with historic roots. The people of prehistory preferred to live close to the shores. Tumba was an inland country. That‚Äôs why traces of human activity during prehistory are relatively rare. The big change took place during 1755 when the bank of Sweden bought a small farm and started a paper mill. Around the papermill came a community that developed with its own school and houses for the workers to live in. The next big step was taken when the railroad came in 1860. Soon afterwards a society started to grow around the stationhouse. This society had commerce, police, and a movie theatre. A few houses from that period are still left. In 1894 ‚ÄòSeparator‚Äô (DeLaval) bought Hamra Gard and transformed it into a farm specialized in milkprocessing. It soon became a big industry. From the beginning these three parts were separate but grew together. The communities of both the papermill and Hamra are well kept.http://www.botkyrka.se/kulturguiden/summaries/37260.html  Districts of Tumba  *Vretarna *Tuna *Nackdala *Tumba Park *Tumba centrum *Storvreten *L√∂vholmen *Sk√§cklinge *Kassmyra *Bro√§ngen *Solbo *Tumba Villastad *Segersj√∂ *Uttran  Tumba urban area { border -bgcolor=#dddddd !

Failure or disruption of mission critical factors will result in serious impact on business operations or upon an organization, and even can cause social turmoil and catastrophes.  Mission critical systems  A mission critical system is a system that is essential to the survival of a business or organization. When a mission critical system fails or is interrupted, business operations are significantly impacted. Mission essential equipment and mission critical application are also known as mission critical system. Examples of mission critical systems are: an online banking system, railway/aircraft operating and control systems, electric power systems, and many other computer systems that will adversely affect business and society when they fail. A good example of a mission critical system is a navigational system for a spacecraft. The difference between mission critical and business critical lies in the major adverse impact and the very real possibilities of loss of life, serious injury and/or financial loss. There are four different types of critical systems: mission critical, business critical, safety critical and security critical. The key difference between a safety critical system and mission critical system, is that safety critical system is a system that, if it fails, may result in serious environmental damage, injury, or loss of life, while mission critical system may result in failure in goal-directed activity. An example of a safety critical system is a chemical manufacturing plant control system. Mission critical system and business critical system are similar terms, but a business critical system fault can influence only a single company or an organization and can partially stop lifetime activity (hours or days). So it also can be used as a mission critical system in the business. Failure of it will cause very high cost loss for the business. Security critical system may lead to loss of sensitive data through theft or accidental loss. All these four systems are generalized as critical system. As a rule in crisis management, if a triage-type decision is made in which certain components must be eliminated or delayed, e.g. because of resource or personnel constraints, mission critical ones must not be among them.  Examples  Every business companies and organizations will have mission critical systems if they are functioning. A downed filtration system will cause the water filtration company to malfunction. In this case, the water filtration system is a mission critical system. If a gas system is downed, many restaurants and bakeries will have to shut down until the system functions well again. In this case, the gas system is a mission critical system. There are various other mission critical systems that, if they malfunction, will have serious impacts on other industries or organizations. = Navigating system of an aircraft = The aircraft is highly dependent on the navigating system. Air navigation is accomplished with many methods. Dead reckoning utilizes visual checkpoints along with distance and time calculations. The flight computer system aids the pilots to calculate the time and distance of the checkpoint that they set. The radio navigation aid (NAVAIDS) enables the pilots to navigate more accurately than dead reckoning alone, and in conditions of low visibility, radio navigation is handy. GPS is also used by pilots and uses 24 U.S. Department of Defence satellites to provide precise locational data, which includes speed, position, and track. If two-way radio communication malfunctions, the pilots have to follow the steps in the Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91. Pneumatic system failure, the associated loss of altitude, and various unfamiliar situations may cause stress and loss of situational awareness. In this case, pilot should use instruments such as navigators to seek more information about the situational data. In this case, the malfunction of the navigation system would be mission critical and would cause serious consequences. = Nuclear reactor safety system = Nuclear reactor is a system that controls and contains the sustained nuclear chain reaction. It is usually used for generating electricity, but can also be used for conducting research and producing medical isotopes. Nuclear reactors have been one of the most concerning systems for public safety worldwide because the malfunction of a nuclear reactor can cause a serious disaster. Controlling the nuclear reactor system is accomplished by stopping, decreasing, or increasing the chain reaction inside the nuclear reactor. Varying the water level in the vertical cylinder and moving adjuster rods are the methods of controlling the chain reaction when the reactor is operating. Temperatures, reactor power levels, and pressure are constantly monitored by the sensitive detectors.  History  The mission critical is a business's quintessence and if failed, will cause serious financial and reputational damages. Today, as the companies develop and world becomes more web-based community, the range of mission critical has extended. But the mission critical computing has been evolving since the pre- Web era (before 1995). In the entirely text-based pre-web internet, gopher was one of the ASCII-based end-user programs. The mission critical system was basically used in transactional applications during this era. A business process management software, ERP, and airline reservation systems were usually mission critical. These applications were run on dedicated system in the data center. There were limited number of end users and usually accessed via terminals and personal computers. After the pre-Web era, the Web era (1995 - 2010) rose. The range of mission critical increased to include electronic devices and web applications. More users were able to use to the internet and electronic devices, so larger number of end users were able to access increased mission critical applications. Therefore, the customers are expecting limitless availability and stronger security in the devices they are using. The businesses also start to become more web-based and this correspondingly increases the criminal associated with the money and fraud. This increase in range of mission critical made the security to become stronger and increased the security industries. Between 1995 and 2010, number of web users globally increased from 16 million to 1.7 billion. This shows increase in global reliance on web system. After the Web era, consumerization era (2010 and beyond) has risen. The range of mission critical is even more increased due to increase in social, mobile, and customer-facing applications. The consumerization of IT became greater, organizations increased and web and IT availabilities to the people increased. Social business, customer service, and customer support applications have increased greatly, so mission critical was expanded further. According to Gartner, native PC projects will be outnumbered by mobile development projects by the ratio of 4:1. Therefore, today's mission critical now encloses all subjects crucial for customer based service, business operation, employee productivity, and finance. The customers' expectations rose and small disruption can cause tremendous loss in the business. It was estimated that Amazon could have lost as much as $1,100 per second in net sales when it was suffering from an outage, and a five- minute outage of Google lost Google more than $545,000 . Failure in mission critical and even short time of outage can cause high price of downtime due to reputations damages. Longer periods of downtime of mission critical systems can result in even more serious problems to the industries or organizations.  Safety & Security  Mission critical systems should remain very secured in all industries or organization using it. Therefore, the industries are using various security systems to avoid mission critical failures. Mainframes or workstations based companies are all dependent on database and process control, so database and process control would be mission critical for them. Hospital patient recording, call centers, stock exchanges, data storage centers, flight control tower, and many other industries that are dependent on communication system and computer should be protected from the shutdown of the system and they are considered mission critical. All the companies and industries are unavoidable to the unexpected or extraordinary problems that can cause shutdown to the mission critical. To avoid this, using the safety systems is considered very important part in the business. = Transport Layer Security (TLS) = The Transport Layer Security (TLS; formerly, Secure Socket Layers, SSL) refers to the standard security technology of networking protocol that controls and manages client and server authentication, and encrypt communication. This is usually used in the online transaction websites such as PayPal and Bank of America, which if systems are downed or hacked, will cause serious problems to the society and the companies themselves. In TLS, public- key and symmetric-key (encryption) are used together to secure the connection between two machines. Usually it is utilized in mail services or client machines that communicates via internet. To use this technology, the web server requires a digital certificate and this can be obtained through completing several questions about the identity of the website and get public keys and private keys (cryptographic keys). The industries using this technology may be also required to pay certain amount of money annually. = Shutdown systems = Nuclear power plants need safety systems to avoid mission-critical failures. The worst possible consequence that can result is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission critical failures for nuclear power plants is shutdown system. It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When a problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control shutdown system drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.  Real time and mission critical  Real time and Mission critical are often confused by many people but they are not the same concept. = Real time = Real time is responsiveness of a computer that makes the computer to continually update on external processes, and should process the procedure or information in a specified time, or could result in serious consequences. The 3D computer games or movies are examples of real time since they are rendered by computer so rapidly, it is hard to notice the delay by the user. The speed of rendering graphics may vary according to the computer systems.  Types of real time systems  * Hard real-time system shouldn't miss the specified time or can result in serious consequences. It is non-negotiable in timing and it is \\"wrong answer\\" if the deadline is missed. The example of hard real time system is airbags for cars. * Soft real-time system has more loose deadline. The system can handle the problems and functions normally even though the deadline is missed, but their functionality depends on fast-paced processes. An example for soft-real time can be typing, which, if delayed, people will get annoyed, but answer still is correct. * Non real-time system doesn't have certain or absolute deadlines. However, the throughput of the activity of performance can still be very essential. = Differences = Real time is a software that if specific time is not met, it fails, but mission critical is a system if failed, will result in catastrophic consequences. Although they go hand-in- hand, since real time can be mission critical, they are not the same concepts. These two are often confused by many people, but they are different concepts, but associated with each other. Mission critical personnel and mission critical systems planning =Social survival= From the perspective of social function (i.e.: preserving society's life support structure, and overall structure intact), Mission Critical aspects of social function would necessitate the provision of Basic Needs for society. Such basic needs are often said to include Food (this includes food production and distribution), Water, Clothing (not an immediate need in an Emergency), Sanitation (Sewage is an immediate need, but Physical waste/garbage/rubbish disposal is not an immediate need in an Emergency), Housing/Shelter, Energy (not immediate) and Health Needs (not immediate in a healthy population). The prior list is not exhaustive. Longer term needs might include Communications/Transport needs in a developed population. This list of needs is associated with Mission Critical Personnel in a clear manner - Food Production requires Farmers, Food Distribution requires transportation personnel, Water requires Water- Infrastructure maintenance personnel (a long term requirement IF existing water infrastructure has been maintained to a high standard), Clothing tends to require individuals to maintain Clothes Production infrastructure, similarly for Sanitation. In emergencies, housing/shelter requires someone to build the shelter and maintain it over the long term if necessary. Health needs are met by Doctors, Nurses and Surgeons. Implicit use of infrastructure requires personnel to maintain that infrastructure also - so Food Transportation requires not only that there are drivers for food trucks, but also that (over the long term) there are Highways maintenance personnel who can maintain the roads, traffic infrastructure and signs for the roads, this in turn requires power supply personnel to provide power for traffic lights, etc... In this light, Mission Critical Systems (like other Mission Critical Systems) have a complex Dependency network which enables analysis of the level of interconnected Dependencies between different aspects of a Mission Critical System, which can be useful in planning, or just for gaining a truthful picture of how Mission Criticality is organised in Complex systems. This would enable the determination of 'choke points' in a Complex system, points at which a Mission Critical System (or set of systems) is vulnerable in one sense or another. Ideas that relate to Human resources and Human resources planning (making use of Gantt charts for Project Management, etc...) are also relevant. Mission Criticality depends upon the Timescale associated with Basic Needs or other deemed Mission Critical factors. Over the medium term (often taken to be 10 years) and the long term (which can go into 50-60 year timescales), the planning for Mission Critical Systems will clearly differ from short-term Mission Critical Systems planning. Mission Critical Personnel can be considered part of the Mission Critical Systems planning paradigm BUT require a different approach to technological or mechanical aspects of Mission Critical Systems (i.e.: they require Human resources planning). =Attributes of mission critical personnel= Psychometrics enables the determination and characterisation of various Psychological aspects of Mission Critical Personnel (e.g.: their IQ in the case of highly skilled work, such as Nuclear Physics, for example). Some jobs require Physical standards (for instance, in the army), or physical dexterity (e.g.: Surgeons). There exist methods and means of characterising the types of skills, qualities and other attributes that certain Mission Critical job roles require, and these can be used as benchmarks for determining whether certain individuals are well suited to a particular Mission Critical job role, or what assistance a less qualified (or even less capable) individual would need in performing a certain Mission Critical job role which might be beyond their abilities (such measures might have to be taken in emergency situations).

Albert was born in Hanover and showed early talent as a musician before embarking on the study of law in G√∂ttingen in 1803. Experience in the Harz mountains awakened an interest in mining and, in 1806, he was appointed to the Mining and Forestry Office in Clausthal. By 1836 he was directing the entire mining industry of the Harz region. In 1829, he observed, studied and reported the failure of iron mine hoist chains arising from repeated small loadings, the first recorded account of metal fatigue.

Below Bow Locks the creek forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets, in East London. Bow Creek at high tide with a view towards Balfron Tower and Canary Wharf History The River Lea rises in the town of Luton in Bedfordshire, and flows to the east and then the south to reach the River Thames at Leamouth. The final are known as Bow Creek, and follow a meandering route across a low-lying area formerly called Bromley Marsh, but now occupied by gas works and trading estates. The river is one of the oldest navigations in the country, but the creek is tidal, providing insufficient depth for navigation at low tide. Use of the river for navigation is recorded in documents dating from 1190 and, in 1424, it became the first river in Britain where improvements were authorised by an Act of Parliament. Another act of 1571 allowed the Lord Mayor to make cuts and improvements to the river and to construct towing paths on both sides of it. This work is thought to have included a new cut between Old Ford and Bow Locks, which is known as Bow River and, like Bow Creek, is not subject to tolls for those using it. During the great plague of 1665, bargemen on the river continued to supply food to the population of London and were granted permission to navigate the Thames without having to ask a Thames Lighterman for assistance, in recognition of the risks they had taken. Because of the importance of the river for navigation, the engineer John Smeaton was asked to survey it and to suggest how it could be improved in 1765. He produced a report in 1766, which recommended replacing the flash locks with more modern pound locks, and more significantly for Bow Creek, making a new cut from Bow tidal gates to the Thames at Limehouse. Although only a little further to the west, access at Limehouse avoided the long loop around the Isle of Dogs for traffic heading towards London. The cut was to be opened on 2 July 1770, but failure of a side wall delayed the event until September and a bridge collapsed into it in December. Traffic began to switch to the new cut, which was too narrow to allow barges to pass one another, and so a programme of widening it, which was completed in September 1777, was carried out. The channel now ends in Limehouse Basin. Access to the new navigation, now known as the Lee Navigation, was still by tidal gates at Bow. There had been gates at the site since at least 1307, as a structure was erected by Henry de Bedyk during the reign of Edward I of England. The gates were rebuilt in 1573 by the owners of the tide mill, but the City of London appointed a surveyor to inspect the plans and a committee to oversee the work. Documents from 1588 suggest that the gates opened automatically when the incoming tide reached a level with the river above them. Another rebuilding took place in 1721, again by the tide mill owners, and with the City of London appointing a surveyor to oversee the work. Smeaton, in 1766, suggested that the gates should be replaced by a conventional pound lock, but this was not carried out. However, in 1852 a lock was constructed, although the gates also remained in place. The lock was rebuilt and shortened in 1900, and a second lock constructed beside it in 1931. Higher floodgates and walls were added in 2000 to prevent the inundation of the Lee Navigation when the level of the tide in the creek exceeded the level in the navigation. Access from the creek to Bow Back Rivers was altered in the 1930s as part of an upgrade carried out to improve the waterways and to provide employment. The Prescott Channel was constructed to bypass the tide mills, and gave access from the creek to the Three Mills Wall River and the Waterworks River. The lock and sluice structure at the mouth of the new channel became disused in the 1960s and was subsequently removed, but a new structure capable of handling 350-tonne barges has been built as part of the upgrade to the waterways for the 2012 Summer Olympics, recreating a navigable connection been the creek and the Bow Back Rivers. The creek gave access to Abbey Creek and the Channelsea River, which connected to the old course of the River Lea near Hackney Marshes. Most of this waterway has since been culverted. Water also entered the creek through the sluices of the tide mills at Three Mills. Ships were built at the Orchard House Yard, in the southern reaches at Leamouth, and launched in the creek where they could travel north along the River Lee Navigation or south to the River Thames. In 1810, an iron bridge was built spanning the creek - just south of the modern A13 bridge. The abutments have been reused for the pedestrian Jubilee Bridge.

It rises to the east of Royton and runs west past Chadderton, Middleton and Blackley before merging with the River Irwell in Manchester city centre. History Historically, the Irk was also known as Iwrck or the Irke, names thought to have been derived from the Roebuck, suggesting that at one time it was a swift-running river. In medieval times, there was a mill by the Irk at which the tenants of the manor ground their corn and its fisheries were controlled by the lord of the manor. In the 16th century, throwing carrion and other offensive matter into the Irk was forbidden. Water for Manchester was drawn from the river before the Industrial Revolution. A bridge over the Irk was recorded in 1381. The river was noted for destructive floods. In 1480, the burgesses of Manchester described the highway between Manchester and Collyhurst which \\"the water of Irk had worn out\\". In 1816, of seven bridges over the Irk, six were liable to be flooded after heavy rain but the seventh, the Ducie Bridge completed in 1814 was above flood levels. According to The New Gazetteer of Lancashire (1830) the Irk had \\"more mill seats upon it than any other stream of its length in the Kingdom\\" and \\"the eels in this river were formerly remarkable for their fatness, which was attributed to the grease and oils expressed by the mills from the woollen cloths and mixed with the waters.\\" However, by the start of the 20th century the Irk Valley between Crumpsall and Blackley had been left a neglected river, \\"not only the blackest but the most sluggish of all rivers\\". Friedrich Engels described the banks of the Irk in Manchester at the height of the city's industrial excess.Friedrich Engels, The Condition of the Working Class in England, quote: \\"The south bank of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and thirty feet high. On this declivitous hillside there are planted three rows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while the front walls of the highest stand on the crest of the hill in Long Millgate. Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of construction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of Long Millgate. Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from the main street into numerous courts, and he who turns in thither gets into a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not to be found - especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which contain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet beheld. In one of these courts there stands directly at the entrance, at the end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement. This is the first court on the Irk above Ducie Bridge - in case any one should care to look into it. Below it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole neighbourhood with the stench of animal putrefaction. Below Ducie Bridge the only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth. The first court below Ducie Bridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the cholera that the sanitary police ordered it evacuated, swept and disinfected with chloride of lime. Dr. Kay gives a terrible description of the state of this court at that time. Since then, it seems to have been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from Ducie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of debris with some newer houses. The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed from mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is characteristic for the whole district. At the bottom flows, or rather stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of debris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank.\\" The river has since been culverted as it reaches the city centre. It disappears beneath Manchester Victoria railway station into a brick tunnel at Ducie Bridge and empties into the Irwell beneath a railway viaduct. On 15 August 1953, the front coach of a Manchester to Bury electric train fell from the viaduct over the River Irk after colliding with a local steam train. Ten people were killed and 58 injured in what became known as the Irk Valley Junction disaster.

Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers. The discovery of irrational numbers is said to have been shocking to the Pythagoreans, and Hippasus is supposed to have drowned at sea, apparently as a punishment from the gods for divulging this. However, the few ancient sources which describe this story either do not mention Hippasus by name (e.g. Pappus)http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/pappus/PappusBookX.pdf or alternatively tell that Hippasus drowned because he revealed how to construct a dodecahedron inside a sphere. The discovery of irrationality is not specifically ascribed to Hippasus by any ancient writer. Life Little is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC, about a century after the time of Pythagoras. Metapontum in Italy (Magna Graecia) is usually referred to as his birthplace,Simplicius, Physica 23.33Aetius I.5.5 (Dox. 292)Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 64.2 although according to Iamblichus some claim Metapontum to be his birthplace, while others the nearby city of Croton.Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 18 (81) Hippasus is recorded under the city of Sybaris in Iamblichus list of each city's Pythagoreans.Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 34 (267) He also states that Hippasus was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the Mathematici () in opposition to the Acusmatici ();Iamblichus, De Communi Mathematica Scientia, 76 but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the Acusmatici in opposition to the Mathematici.Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 18 (81); cf. Iamblichus, In Nic. 10.20; De anima ap. Stobaeus, i.49.32 Iamblichus says about the death of Hippasus :It is related to Hippasus that he was a Pythagorean, and that, owing to his being the first to publish and describe the sphere from the twelve pentagons, he perished at sea for his impiety, but he received credit for the discovery, though really it all belonged to HIM (for in this way they refer to Pythagoras, and they do not call him by his name). According to Iamblichus (ca. 245-325 AD, 1918 translation) in The life of Pythagoras, by Thomas Taylor :There were also two forms of philosophy, for the two genera of those that pursued it: the Acusmatici and the Mathematici. The latter are acknowledged to be Pythagoreans by the rest but the Mathematici do not admit that the Acusmatici derived their instructions from Pythagoras but from Hippasus. The philosophy of the Acusmatici consisted in auditions unaccompanied with demonstrations and a reasoning process; because it merely ordered a thing to be done in a certain way and that they should endeavor to preserve such other things as were said by him, as divine dogmas. Memory was the most valued faculty. All these auditions were of three kinds; some signifying what a thing is; others what it especially is, others what ought or ought not to be done. (p. 61) Doctrines Aristotle speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of fire to be the cause of all things; and Sextus Empiricus contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the arche to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number.Sextus Empiricus, ad Phys. i. 361 Diogenes La√´rtius tells us that Hippasus believed that \\"there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion.\\" According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings, according to another he was the author of the Mystic Discourse, written to bring Pythagoras into disrepute. A scholium on Plato's Phaedo notes him as an early experimenter in music theory, claiming that he made use of bronze disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.Scholium on Plato's Phaedo, 108d =Irrational numbers= Hippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of irrational numbers, following which he was drowned at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is confused. Pappus merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning.Pappus, Commentary on Book X of Euclid's Elements. A similar story is quoted in a Greek scholium to the tenth book. Iamblichus gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular dodecahedron in the sphere.Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 34 (246) In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself;Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 18 (88), De Communi Mathematica Scientia, 25 but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational.Iamblichus, Vita Pythagorica, 34 (247) Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the gods for impious behaviour. These stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain.Wilbur Richard Knorr (1975), The Evolution of the Euclidean Elements: A Study of the Theory of Incommensurable Magnitudes and its Significance for Early Greek Geometry, pages 21-2, 50-1. Springer. In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedrons. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the Golden ratio of the regular pentagon.Walter Burkert (1972), Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism, page 459. Harvard University Press Some scholars in the early 20th century credited Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of . Plato in his Theaetetus,Plato, Theaetetus, 147d ff describes how Theodorus of Cyrene (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of , , etc. up to , which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of .Thomas Heath (1921) A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid, p. 155. Aristotle referred to the method for a proof of the irrationality of ,Aristotle, Prior Analytics, I-23 and a full proof along these same lines is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of Euclid's Book X,Thomas Heath (1921) A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid, p. 157. which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient.Thomas Heath (1921) A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid, p. 168. The method is a proof by contradiction, or reductio ad absurdum, which shows that, if the diagonal of a square is assumed to be commensurable with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even. In the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard;Morris Kline (1990), Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, page 32. Oxford University Press while one writer even has Pythagoras himself \\"to his eternal shame\\" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing \\"that is an irrational number.\\"Simon Singh (1998), Fermat's Enigma, p. 50 See also *Incommensurable magnitudes References External links *Hippasus of Metapontum at scienceworld.wolfram.com * Category:5th-century BC Greek people Category:5th-century BC philosophers Category:Ancient Greek mathematicians Category:Ancient Greek physicists Category:Ancient Metapontines Category:Irrational numbers Category:Pythagoreans of Magna Graecia Category:Pythagoreans ","title":"Hippasus"},{"id":"920576","text":"Ed is a locality and the seat of Dals-Ed Municipality in V√§stra G√∂taland County, Sweden.

This frequently involves the virtual placement of sound sources anywhere in three-dimensional space, including behind, above or below the listener. 3-D audio (processing) is the spatial domain convolution of sound waves using Head-related transfer functions. It is the phenomenon of transforming sound waves (using head-related transfer function or HRTF filters and cross talk cancellation techniques) to mimic natural sounds waves, which emanate from a point in a 3-D space. It allows trickery of the brain using the ears and auditory nerves, pretending to place different sounds in different 3-D locations upon hearing the sounds, even though the sounds may just be produced from just 2 speakers (dissimilar to surround sound). Complete 3D positional audio A sound is placed in the horizontal plane by processing the sound with recorded head-related impulse responses. Using head-related transfer functions and reverberation, the changes of sound on its way from the source (including reflections from walls and floors) to the listener's ear can be simulated. These effects include localization of sound sources behind, above and below the listener. Some 3D technologies also convert binaural recordings to stereo recordings.

After graduating, John immediately began working in his field of choice, touring the college circuit performing at more than 80 shows each year. By that time, he was already a seasoned comic with more than four years of experience. The college audience related to his type of humor, which talked about his days in college, the retro music that he and his classmates listened to and the Pop Rocks candy he played with as a kid. This material made him a hit on college campuses, where he recorded his first comedy CD Kid With A Cape. By the age of 25, John was a successful headlining comedian who decided to also put his degrees in communications and psychology to work by taking a job as radio sidekick to Danny Bonaduce (later replaced by Steve Cochran) on the highly-rated Q95-5 Detroit radio morning show. He worked in Detroit for five years before making his way back to Los Angeles, making his home in Hollywood. John has made numerous television appearances including NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, CBS's The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn, two Comedy Central Presents specials, and two seasons of Last Comic Standing. He won the title of Last Comic Standing in season 2. In addition, John has performed at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festivals in Montreal and Bermuda, as well as the HBO Comedy Festival in Aspen. Also an entrepreneur, John‚Äîalong with partner Joel Zimmer‚ÄîHeffron released a board game, That Guy Game, which puts girls on a scavenger hunt for guys. According to InStyle, Entertainment Weekly and Glamour magazines, it became an immediate hit when Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore and SNL's Rachel Dratch were spotted buying the game. Entrepreneur magazine featured John and Joel in its 2001 \\"Hot 100\\" issue. John took the idea a step further by developing a television pilot based on the concept, which received a significant amount of industry attention. He also was a regular on a number of VH1 television series including My Coolest Years: My First Time and I Love The 80s. He toured with Charlie Murphy and Joe Rogan on the Real Men of Comedy tour in the fall of 2006 sponsored by Maxim and Bud Light.Real Men of Comedy His DVD Middle Class Funny was released in 2009. John continues to tour the US performing stand-up. Personal life John Heffron was born on July 19, 1970 in New York City and was raised in South Lyon, Michigan. He graduated in 1988 from South Lyon High School and in 1993 from Eastern Michigan University. In 2004, he married Sherry Rie Glenny, who participated (as Rie Heffron) in the first season of reality show America's Toughest Jobs (2008). John filed for divorce in October, 2018.

Course Rising on Chelburn Moor (south of Todmorden in the Pennines), the river flows south through Littleborough towards Rochdale where it is joined by the River Beal at Belfield, and the River Spodden from Whitworth. Turning west it runs past Heywood and Bury before meeting the River Irwell just to the east of Radcliffe. History The Domesday Book records the name of Rochdale as Recedham, formed from Old English reced \\"hall\\", and ham \\"homestead\\". The name of the river is a back-formation from this Old English name. With time, the town's name changed to Rachedale and eventually Rochdale.Mills, A.D.: A Dictionary of English Place Names, 2nd Edition, page 289, s.n. Rochdale. Oxford University Press, 1998 The name of the river Roch is , with a long o. The name of the town, however, is pronounced , with a short o. The river has been culverted in Rochdale town centre since the early 20th century. This was built by the joining together of seven bridges to form one large bridge, making it one of the widest bridges in the world. Maintenance work was carried out on the bridge in the 1990s and the river was uncovered temporarily. In 2015 work began on opening the bridge again in a multimillion-pound project. On Boxing Day 2015, following heavy rain, the Roch burst its banks causing flooding in the town centre.

The film was directed by John Lasseter from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, and Jorgen Klubien and a story by Lasseter, Ranft, and Klubien, and was the final film independently produced by Pixar after its purchase by Disney in January 2006. Set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic talking cars and other vehicles, the film stars the voices of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman (in his final acting role), Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, John Ratzenberger and Richard Petty, while race car drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. (as \\"Junior\\"), Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay Leno (as \\"Jay Limo\\") voice themselves. Cars premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and was theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2006 to generally positive reviews and also received commercial success, grossing $462 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Animated Feature, but lost to Happy Feet (but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film). The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One Man Band for its theatrical and home media releases. Merchandise based on the film (including scale models of several of the cars) broke records for retail sales of merchandise based on a Disney/Pixar film, bringing an estimated $10 billion for 5 years after the film's release. The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, the film's co-director and co-writer, who died in a car crash during the film's production. A sequel titled Cars 2 was released on June 24, 2011 and a spin-off film titled Planes, produced by Disneytoon Studios, was released on August 9, 2013, which was followed by its own sequel Planes: Fire & Rescue on July 18, 2014. A series of short animated films titled Cars Toons debuted in 2008 on Disney Channel and Disney XD. A second sequel, titled Cars 3, was released on June 16, 2017.  Plot  In a world populated by anthropomorphic talking vehicles, the final race of the Piston Cup season ends in a three-way tie for first place between retiring veteran Strip \\"The King\\" Weathers, frequent runner-up Chick Hicks, and brash rookie sensation Lightning McQueen; the tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway. McQueen is desperate to win the race, not only to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup, but also because it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and take The King's place on the prestigious and lucrative Dinoco team. However, he struggles to work with others due to his selfishness, which has caused him to fire three crew chiefs and having his pit crew quit after the race. Eager to get to California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack nods off and is startled awake, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes up in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway in search of Mack, but instead ends up in the rundown desert town of Radiator Springs, where he inadvertently damages the pavement of the main road. The next day, McQueen is ordered by the town judge and medical doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately, but the local lawyer, Sally, requests that McQueen should instead be assigned community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. Still in a rush to leave town, McQueen repaves the road shoddily, and is ordered to repave it again. During this time, he begins to warm to the town, and befriends several of its residents. He learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stop along U.S. Route 66 until it was bypassed with the construction of Interstate 40 and mostly forgotten, and that Doc was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, a three-time Piston Cup champion whose career ended from a devastating crash in 1954. He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in Los Angeles to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map. McQueen finishes repaving the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media descend on the town. McQueen reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race while Sally expresses her disappointment with Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to McQueen's whereabouts. At the race, McQueen races distractedly and soon falls into last place. He is then surprised to discover that Doc, having a change of heart, has taken over as his crew chief and several of his other friends from Radiator Springs are helping in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen vaults into the lead. On the final lap, Chick sideswipes and sends The King into a dangerous crash. Recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, handing Chick the victory, and drives back to push The King over the finish line. As a result, the angered crowd and media condemn Chick's victory but praise McQueen's sportsmanship. McQueen is offered the Dinoco sponsorship, but declines and insists on staying with Rust-Eze out of loyalty for their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen reunites with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters there, putting Radiator Springs back on the map. In a post-credits scene, Minny and Van, a couple who were trying to find the Interstate, are shown lost in the middle of the desert.

Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Dave Foley reprise their vocal roles from previous Pixar films during an end- credits sequence featuring automobile spoofs of Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life. Cars was the final Pixar film worked on by Joe Ranft who died in a crash a year before the film's release, aged 45. The film was the second to be dedicated to his memory, after Corpse Bride. The memorial showed the roles he had done in the other films directed by John Lasseter during the credits. This is also the last (non-documentary) movie for Paul Newman before his retirement in 2007 and his death in 2008. It turned out to be the highest- grossing film of his career. Production =Development= The genesis of the film came in 1998 as Pixar began wrapping up production on A Bug's Life. At that time, Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, which was about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world inspired by The Ugly Duckling, an idea triggered by the poor reception his fellow countrymen gave the Mini-El car. Some of the original drawings and characters were developed in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars could be the next Pixar film after A Bug's Life and be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, like giving Mater, Doc and a few other characters bigger parts. John Lasseter said that inspiration for the film's story came after he took a cross-country road trip with his wife and five sons in 2000. When he returned to the studio after vacation, he contacted Michael Wallis, a Route 66 historian. Wallis then led eleven Pixar animators in rented white Cadillacs on two different road trips across the route to research the film. In 2001, the film's working title was Route 66 (after U.S. Route 66), but the title was changed to Cars in order to avoid confusion with the 1960s television series of the same name. In addition, Lightning McQueen's racing number was originally going to be 57 (a reference to 1957, Lasseter's birth year), but was changed to 95 (a reference to 1995, the year Pixar's first film Toy Story was released). In 2006, Lasseter spoke about the inspiration for the film, saying: \\"I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life‚Äîcars and animation‚Äîwas irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis.\\" Years later in 2013, Klubien said the film was both his best and most bitter experience because he was fired before it premiered and because he feels Lasseter wrote him out of the story of how the film got made. =Animation= A rendered frame from the development of the film. For the cars themselves, Lasseter also visited the design studios of the Big Three Detroit automakers, particularly J Mays of Ford Motor Company. Lasseter learned how real cars were designed. In 2006, Lasseter spoke about how they worked hard to make the animation believable, saying: \\"It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator to be able to put some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way.\\" Unlike most anthropomorphic cars, the eyes of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, \\"From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at the front end of the car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik. In 2006, supervising animator on the film Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: \\"Getting a full range of performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, but we can lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have.\\" Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: \\"It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right.\\" John Lasseter co-wrote and directed the film. Lasseter also explained that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: \\"Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins.\\" Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: \\"John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge thing for him. He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, they need to have that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy to the point where the audience might see them as rubber toys.\\" According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, \\"Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do.\\" Character shading supervisor on the film Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges on the film, saying: \\"Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning as much as we could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality that might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone.\\" Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: \\"Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we‚Äôve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we‚Äôve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar.\\" Rendering lead Jessica McMackin spoke about the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: \\"In addition to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and you want to get a feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall.\\" Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground‚Äìlocking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: \\"The ground-locking system is one of the things I‚Äôm most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it.\\" Technical director Lisa Forsell explained that to enhance the richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: \\"Digital matte paintings are a way to get a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It‚Äôs subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you‚Äôll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away.\\" Computers used in the development of the film were four times faster than those used in The Incredibles and 1,000 times faster than those used in Toy Story. To build the cars, the animators used computer platforms similar to those used in the design of real-world automobiles. Soundtrack The Cars soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on June 6, 2006. Nine tracks on the soundtrack are by popular artists, while the remaining eleven are score cues by Randy Newman. It has two versions of the classic Bobby Troup jazz standard \\"Route 66\\" (popularized by Nat King Cole), one by Chuck Berry and a new version recorded specifically for the film's credits performed by John Mayer. Brad Paisley contributed two of the nine tracks to the album, one being \\"Find Yourself\\" used for the end credits. Release Cars was originally going to be released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was moved to June 9, 2006. Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios or they were buying time to see what happened with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney. When Pixar's chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule with DVD sales occurring during the holiday shopping season. =Home media= Cars was released on DVD, in wide- and full-screen editions, on November 7, 2006 in the United States and Canada. This DVD was also released on October 25, 2006 in Australia and New Zealand and on November 27, 2006 in the United Kingdom. The release includes the DVD-exclusive short film Mater and the Ghostlight and the film's theatrical short One Man Band as well as a 16-minute-long documentary about the film entitled Inspiration for Cars, which features director John Lasseter. A VHS was released on February 19, 2007 to members of Disney's home video clubs.What‚Äôs the Greatest Automotive VHS Release Ever?. The Drive. July 24, 2016. According to the Walt Disney Company, fivemillion copies of the DVD were sold the first two days it was available. The first week, it sold 6,250,856 units and 15,370,791 in total ($246,198,859). Unlike previous Pixar DVD releases, there is no two-disc special edition, and no plans to release one in the future. According to Sara Maher, DVD Production Manager at Pixar, John Lasseter and Pixar were preoccupied with productions like Ratatouille. In the US and Canada, there were bonus discs available with the purchase of the film at Wal-Mart and at Target. The former featured a Geared-Up Bonus DVD Disc that focused on the music of the film, including the music video to \\"Life Is A Highway\\", The Making of \\"Life Is A Highway\\", Cars: The Making of the Music, and Under The Hood, a special that originally aired on the ABC Family cable channel. The latter's bonus was a Rev'd Up DVD Disc that featured material mostly already released as part of the official Cars podcast and focused on the inspiration and production of the movie. Cars was also released on Blu-ray Disc on November 6, 2007, one year after the DVD release. It was the first Pixar film to be released on Blu-ray (alongside Ratatouille and Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1), and was released as a Blu-ray Disc and DVD combo pack and DVD only edition in April 2011. The film was released for the first time in 3D on October 29, 2013, as part of Cars: Ultimate Collector's Edition, which included the releases on Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D, and DVD. Cars was released on 4K Blu-ray on September 10, 2019. Reception =Box office= In its opening weekend, Cars earned $60,119,509 in 3,985 theaters in the United States, ranking number one at the box office. In the United States, the film held onto the number one spot for two weeks before being surpassed by Click and then by Superman Returns the following weekend. It went on to gross $462,216,280 worldwide (ranking number six in 2006 films) and $244,082,982 in the United States (the third highest-grossing film of 2006 in the country, behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Night at the Museum). It was the second highest-grossing film released by Walt Disney Pictures, behind Dead Man's Chest and was the second highest-grossing computer-animated film of 2006 in the United States after Ice Age: The Meltdown. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 202 reviews and an average rating of 6.91/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Cars offers visual treats that more than compensate for its somewhat thinly written story, adding up to a satisfying diversion for younger viewers.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100 based on 39 critics reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised it as \\"one of Pixar's most imaginative and thoroughly appealing movies ever\\" and Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it \\"a work of American art as classic as it is modern.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying that it \\"tells a bright and cheery story, and then has a little something profound lurking around the edges.

Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it.\\" Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying \\"There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says.\\" =Accolades= Cars had a highly successful run during the 2006 awards season. Many film critic associations such as the Broadcast Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review named it the best Animated Feature Film of 2006. Cars also received the title of Best Reviewed Animated Feature of 2006 from Rotten Tomatoes. Randy Newman and James Taylor received a Grammy Award for the song \\"Our Town,\\" which later went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song (an award it lost to \\"I Need to Wake Up\\" from An Inconvenient Truth). The film also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature alongside Monster House, but it lost to Happy Feet. Cars was also selected as the Favorite Family Movie at the 33rd People's Choice Awards. The most prestigious award that Cars received was the inaugural Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. Cars also won the highest award for animation in 2006, the Best Animated Feature Annie Award. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list. Video game A video game of the same name was released on June 6, 2006, for Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox. It was also released on October 23, 2006, for Xbox 360 and November 16, 2006, for Wii. Much like the film, the video game got mainly positive reviews. GameSpot gave 7.0 out of 10 for Xbox 360 and Wii versions, for PlayStation 2, 7.6 out of 10 for the GameCube and Xbox versions, and 7.4 out of 10 for the PSP version. Metacritic gave 65 out of 100 for the Wii version, 54 out of 100 for the DS version, 73 out of 100 for the PC version, 71 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version, and 70 out of 100 for the PSP version. Similar films Marco Aur√©lio Can√¥nico of Folha de S.Paulo described The Little Cars series (Os Carrinhos in Portuguese), a Brazilian computer graphics film series, as a derivative of Cars. Can√¥nico discussed whether lawsuits from Pixar would appear. The Brazilian Ministry of Culture posted Marcus Aurelius Can√¥nico's article on its website. It has also been noted that the plot of Cars mirrors that of Doc Hollywood, a 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor who eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values and falls in love with a local law student as result of being sentenced to work at the town hospital after causing a traffic collision in a small town. Some have gone so far as to say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.  Literature  * 2006: CARS: The Junior Novelization, RH/Disney, Sequels A sequel to the film, titled Cars 2, was released on June 24, 2011. It was directed again by John Lasseter, who was inspired for the film while traveling around the world promoting the first film. In the sequel, Lightning McQueen and Mater head to Japan and Europe to compete in the World Grand Prix, but Mater becomes sidetracked with international espionage. The film failed to meet or exceed the critical success of its predecessor, but was still a box office success. A second sequel, titled Cars 3, was released on June 16, 2017. Lasseter didn't return to direct so Brian Fee took over the director's chair (though Lasseter was still involved as executive producer). The film again concerns Lightning McQueen, now a veteran racer, who received instruction from a young race car, Cruz Ramirez, to help him to cope with an increasingly high- tech world. The film also received positive reviews from critics, who praised it as an improvement on its predecessor. See also * Mandeville-Anthony v.

The island is also known for jazz, most notably including Eddie Bullen, a pianist, songwriter and record producer currently residing in Canada. Kingsley Etienne, a keyboardist, while the Grenadan-American Joe Country & the Islanders have made a name in country music. African dances brought to Grenada survive in an evolved form, as have European quadrilles and picquets. Some of the most popular recent styles of these dances include \\"Heel-and-Toe\\" and \\"Carriacou Big Drum and Quadrille\\", with popular dancers including Willie Redhead, Thelma Phillips, Renalph Gebon and the Beewee Ballet. Independence in 1974 launched a Grenadian national identity which was exemplified in the calypso of the time, which tended to be intensely patriotic. More modern calypso performers have experimented, using political commentary and poetry to expand the possibilities of Grenadian calypso. Indian influences have also changed the sound of Grenadian calypso.  Popular music  Popular music of Grenada are Calypso music, Soca music and to a lesser extent Reggae and Dancehall. Soca produced in Grenada has a distinct style taking on the name of 'jab jab' soca.  Carriacou  Many years of domination by the British and the French have left behind influences in Carriacou, in songs like lullabies and reels, cantique, chanteys and quadrilles. Carriacou is an island north of Grenada, best known for the Big Drum Afro-Caribbean song-style and Quadrille. Big Drum dates back to at least the late 18th century. Carriacou's Afro-Caribbean population is divided into nations, each of which has a distinct rhythm that identifies it; Big Drum glorifies the ancestors of these nations, which include the Manding, Chamba, Temne, Moko, Igbo, Banda, Arada, Kongo and Cromanti. The Cromanti, being the biggest nation, begins the Big Drum ceremony with a song called \\"Cromanti Cudjo\\" (or \\"Beg Pardon\\"); this is followed by the other nations' songs, all of which are based on short, declamatory phrases with choruses, accompanied by two boula drums and a single, higher-pitched cut drum, both of which are made from rum barrels. Big Drum music is used to honor the memory of the dead if the deceased's family is not able to have the traditional Tombstone Feast. Quadrille was developed in France during the 18th century as a court dance for Napoleon, the Quadrille was brought to England, and then introduced to the colonial Caribbean during the early 19th century, providing entertainment on social occasions for planters. Slaves were forbidden to practice their culture, as the planters realized their music and dance were used to communicate, and to plan their release strategies. However, to save on the expenses of bringing musicians from England, slaves were engaged to provide music for planters‚Äô parties. Forbidden to practice their own dances, African musicians and house workers learned the dance of the English planters, taking it into their camps and altering it. Slaves used the Quadrille to mock the planters but more importantly used this newly approved dancing time to secretly formulate uprisings to hasten their freedom. Carriacou versions of the Quadrille feature four men and four women, forming a square and are accompanied by tambourine, bass drum, violin and triangle. Dance styles can be either formal, with couples gliding rigidly in turn, or a more free style where all couples dance at the same time with unfettered movements and improvisations. This dance surpasses the Big Drum in rhythm but does not have the variety and the significance of the African Nation Dance. You can view these dances at cultural celebrations. The funeral music of Carriacou is a major part of the island's folk music; Carriacouan religion centers on reverence for the \\"Old Parents\\", the apocryphal founders of the island's society. The saraca funerary rite, practiced on Carriacou and throughout the Grenadines, involves music, storytelling and feasting; saraca songs include both European and African lyrics. African elements, such as the call-and-response style, are often present.  References  \\"Grenada Music Spot\\". Promoting Grenada Music Internationally Since.

Originally a hexadecimal encoding, subsequent versions of BinHex are more similar to uuencode, but combined both \\"forks\\" of the Mac file system together along with extended file information. BinHexed files take up more space than the original files, but will not be corrupted by non-\\"8-bit clean\\" software. History =TRS-80 BinHex (.hex)= BinHex was originally written in 1981 by Tim Mann for the TRS-80, as a stand-alone version of an encoding scheme originally built into a popular terminal emulator, ST80-III by Lance Micklus. BinHex was used for sending files via major online services such as CompuServe, which were not \\"8-bit clean\\" and required ASCII armoring to survive. Not everyone used ST-80, however, so Mann wrote BinHex to allow users of other emulators to use the format. The original ST-80 system worked by converting the binary file contents to hexadecimal numbers, which were themselves encoded as ASCII digits and letters. It then added a newline after every 60 characters. The system became very popular after Mann uploaded it to Compuserve's TRS-80 files area. The system quickly gained the addition of a checksum at the end of every line to check for errors. Bill Stockwell converted that version to the BASIC/S compiler, which ran much faster than Mann's interpreted version. BinHex files of the era were typically given the file extension . Ports soon appeared for other popular platforms of the era, including the Apple II. CompuServe later added support for 8-bit transfers, and the format quickly disappeared. =Mac BinHex (.hex)= The file upload problem still existed on CompuServe when the Mac was first released in 1984. In April 1984, William Davis ported BinHex to the Mac using Microsoft BASIC to produce a version that was largely identical to the TRS-80 versions of the same era. This version only supported encoding of the \\"data fork\\", ignoring the resource fork, which meant it could only be used for data files. The rise in use of Internet e-mail coincided roughly with the release of the Macintosh, and Davis's version was posted on the Info-Mac mailing list by Joel Heller in June 1984. Several newer versions were published during 1984, resulting in BinHex 3 that could encode both forks. Yves Lempereur, author of the first assembler for the Mac, MacASM, found that in order to upload his files to CompuServe he had to use BinHex. The BASIC version was very slow, so Lempereur ported BinHex 3 to assembler and released it as BinHex 1.0. The program was roughly a hundred times as fast as the BASIC version, and soon upgrade requests were flooding in. =Compact BinHex (.hcx)= The original BinHex was a fairly simple format, one that was not very efficient because it expanded every byte of input into two, as required by the hexadecimal representation‚Äîan 8-to-4 bit encoding. For BinHex 2.0, Lempereur used a new 8-to-6 encoding that decreased file size by 50%. He also took the opportunity to expand the checksum from 8 to 16-bits. This new encoding used the first 64 ASCII printing characters, including the space, to represent the data,For example, the source code of the CWI version of \`hexbin\` included in macutils, in \`hecx.c\` line 187, uses the expression \`((c)-0x20) & 0x3f\` to obtain the numerical value of an HCX digit with the ASCII value \`c\`. similarly to uuencode. Even though the new encoding was no longer hexadecimal in nature, the established name of the program was retained. The smaller files were incompatible with the older ones, so the extension became .hcx, c for compact. The new version replaced the earlier ones \\"overnight\\". =BinHex 4 (.hqx)= Lempereur had concerns about some of the features of BinHex, notably its use of a checksum instead of a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and the fact that the metadata information in the header was in plain text and thus could be corrupted in the same way as the data. In order to solve all of these problems, Lempereur released BinHex 4.0 in 1985, skipping 3.0 to avoid confusion with the now long-dead BASIC version. 4.0 first combined the data fork, resource fork and file metadata into a common 8-bit format, ran run length encoding (RLE) on the result to provide some compression, and then ran the 8->6 conversion on the result and protected everything with multiple CRCs. The resulting \`.hqx\` files were roughly the same size of the \`.hcx\`'s, but much more robust. =BinHex 5= At about the time BinHex 4 was released, most online services started supporting robust 8-bit file transfer protocols such as ZMODEM, and the need for ASCII armoring went away. This left a problem on the Mac, however, as there was still the need to encode the two forks into one. A team effort among Macintosh communications programmers, including Lempereur, resulted in MacBinary. This left the contents of the forks in their original 8-bit format and added a simple header for combining them on reception. MacBinary files were thus much smaller than BinHex. Lempereur released BinHex 5.0, almost identical to 4.0 with the exception that it used MacBinary to combine the forks before running the 8-to-6 encoding, but it saw little use, as he expected. On the Internet, e-mail was still the primary method of moving files. At the time relatively few people had full access to the Internet, and services like FTPmail were the only way many users could download files. Years later when he first got onto the Internet, Lempereur was surprised to find that BinHex 4.0 was still extremely popular. The same ends could be achieved by first using MacBinary or AppleSingle to combine the forks, and then using Uuencode or Base64 on the resulting file, but none of these solutions ever became popular and BinHex 4.0 survived well into the late 1990s. File archives of classic Mac OS software are still filled with BinHexed files. BinHex 4 file format Looking at the contents of a BinHex file, one will notice that it has a message usually on the first line identifying it as BinHex, followed by many 64-character lines made up of seemingly random letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Here is a sample of what BinHex actually looks like: (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0) :$f*TEQKPH#jdCA0d,R0TG!\\"6594%8dP8)3#3\\"!&m;!*!%EMa6593K!!%!!!&mFNa; KG3,r!*!$&[rr$3d,BQPZD'9i,R4PFh3!RQ+!!\\"AV#J#3!i!!N!@QKUjrU!#3'[q 3\\"&4&@&483N)f!3#Xaj6bV-H8mJ!!!B3!N!0\\"!*!$[3#3!cR@iiY)!*!'[I%4!!J Fp$X%X3@J!mZE6!GRiKUi$HGKMf0U61S46%i1\\"AB!TI,fLl!d1X3RDDE8ALfTCbM 8UP9p4iUqY-0k4krHpk9XK@\`rbj2Ti'U@5rGH@+[fr-i4T6-qXpfl26,k!H5$Nml TIkI'(l3GI4)f8mII&01CNEbC2LrNLBeaZ1HG@$G8!Z6\\"k)hh,q9p\\"r6FC*!!Se\\" (ic,Pd(4(b\`pflKC\`H1&JN5;)GVX3mREdH55[l\`%\`Yhp%q092c\`A(hPV)!83Dr&f4; $$L#I1aM-\\"VjqV-q$34KQq6$M$f8#,Zc,i),!(\`*ZN!$K$rS!LA%3cL+dYi\\"@,K( Z\\"\`#3!fKi!!!: There must be a text line, which is used by users and tools to recognize BinHex versions: \`(This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)\`.

The rest of the file consists of three parts, a header (containing file name, size etc.), a data fork (containing the file data) and a resource fork. Each has a two-byte CRC checksum. Everything except the \`(This file\`... line is then seen as an area of binary data, which is encoded to ASCII characters. The encoding algorithm says that three bytes input are divided into four 6-bit values, in a way similar to the way in which Base64 does.

I. F. Armstrong), was a British writer, poet and compiler of anthologies, both of poetry and of short stories. He also used the pseudonym Orpheus Scrannel (alludes to Milton's Lycidas). He became the king of the unrecognized micronation of Redonda in 1947 and became known as King Juan I. Early life Armstrong grew up in Colville Gardens, Notting Hill, and at number 40 Royal Crescent, Holland Park, London.Richard Tames, The Notting Hill & Holland Park Book Past and Present, Historical Publications, 2004.

Career As a very young man he moved in London literary circles championing traditional verse and writing as opposed to modernism. He ran the Twyn Barlwm Press, a small press publishing some well- known poets, its title inspired by the mountain Twyn Barlwm in South Wales, beloved by one of his literary idols Arthur Machen. Machen was one of the surviving writers of the 1890s he admired and befriended. Gawsworth's longest piece of written work was a biography of Machen, but he could find no publisher for it in the thirties. It was finally published by Tartarus Press in 2005.John Gawsworth, THE LIFE OF ARTHUR MACHEN. Review reprinted from Times Literary Supplement. Other writers Gawsworth admired were Edgar Jepson and M. P. Shiel, whose literary executor he would later become. In 1931 he had the poem In Winter by W. H. Davies privately printed in a limited edition of 290 numbered copies, illustrated by Edward Carrick and all individually signed by Davies. A further special limited edition of 15 were printed on handmade paper and also hand-coloured by Carrick.Harlow, S. (1993), W. H. Davies ‚Äì a Bibliography, Winchester: Oak Knoll Books, St. Paul's Bibliographies. . Three companion titles appeared in similar editions at the same time: In Spring by Edith Sitwell, In Summer by Edmund Blunden and In Autumn by Herbert Palmer. He gave Hugh MacDiarmid a roof over his head in London in 1934 (MacDiarmid returned the compliment in When the Rat-Race Is Over; an essay in honour of the fiftieth birthday of John Gawsworth (1962)). At this time he was very much involved in compiling story collections, generally of the fiction of the supernatural. Poetry collections of this time were Lyrics to Kingcup (1932), Mishka and Madeleine. A Poem Sequence for Marcia (1932), Poems 1930‚Äì1932 (1936), New Poems 1939. Later he published through the Richards Press. He met and befriended the young Lawrence Durrell in 1932, when Gawsworth was living in Denmark Street. He made friends as well as enemies (Dylan Thomas, George Woodcock) throughout literary London. =WW2= During World War II, he served in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftsman in North Africa. As one of the Cairo poets, he made a more serious name for himself, being part of the Salamander group. Later he returned to a picturesque eccentricity as a Fitzrovian. His Collected Poems appeared in 1949. A later volume is Toreros (1990). The Known Signatures anthology (reactionary, quite literally) was prompted by the Michael Roberts New Country collection. The Edwardian Poetry Book One (1936) (edited anonymously) and Neo-Georgian Poetry 1936‚Äì1937 (edited anonymously by Gawsworth Rogers, Timothy, editor. Georgian Poetry 1911-1922: The Critical Heritage (London, Henley and Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1977), p.11) are extraordinary for their retrospective vision. =King of Redonda= As literary executor to M.

In 1846 the Amt Meinerzhagen was formed, covering both Meinerzhagen and the municipality of Valbert. On September 19, 1964 Meinerzhagen received city rights again. In the communal reform of the district Altena in 1969, Meinerzhagen was merged with Valbert, the Amt Meinerzhagen was dissolved. The family name of the British World War I officer Richard Meinertzhagen recalls an ancestor who came from this town. Coat of arms The coat of arms of Meinerzhagen shows a red lion as the symbol of the duchy Berg, placed on a blue St. Andrew's cross on yellow ground, referring to the family von Badinghagen, which became extinct in the 17th century. The bottom part of the coat of arms shows the red-and-white-chequered bordure as the symbol of the Mark. A yellow horn is placed on top of the bordure, taken from the coat of arms of the municipality of Valbert. The coat of arms was granted on June 14, 1975. Before the merging of Meinerzhagen and Valbert, the two towns as well as the Amt Meinerzhagen had their individual coats of arms. The coat of arms of Meinerzhagen dates back to at least 1857, as the town hall, built in 1857, already showed the coat of arms above its entrance. The coat of arms had a green bottom part, top left Saint Mary on a throne, holding a scepter, with Jesus as an infant, and top right a building with three towers and red roofs, and the sun and two stars above. The coat of arms of the municipality of Valbert showed both the chequered bordure as well as the black cross of Cologne in the bottom part, as the municipality consisted of parts of the Mark as well as of the Electorate of Cologne. The top part shows a hunter, which, similar to the coat of arms of the neighboring municipality of Herscheid refers to the hunting privilege granted by duke Johann III of Cleves, the heir of the duke of Mark. The coat of arms was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on October 27, 1935. The coat of arms of the Amt Meinerzhagen combined symbols of the three historic states of the area. The bottom part shows the black cross of Cologne, the middle part the chequered bordure of the Mark, and the top the lion of Berg.  Persons with relations to Meinerzhagen  Meinerzhagen was the birthplace and home of several professional soccer players. Nuri ≈ûahin and Lars Labonte all played for the soccer team of Meinerzhagen before joining professional soccer team Borussia Dortmund.  International relations  From 1961 to 2001 Meinerzhagen had a partnership with the Dutch municipality IJsselmuiden. In 2001 IJsselmuiden was incorporated into the city Kampen, which subsequently continued the partnership. On April 12, 1987 the documents were signed for the partnership with the French town Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire.  Transportation  Meinerzhagen is situated at the Oberbergische Bahn and offers hourly connections to Cologne and (status October 2019) every two hours a direct train to L√ºdenscheid, with connections to Hagen and Dortmund.

Though the United States Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands are politically separate, they maintain close cultural ties. From its neighbors, the Virgin Islands has imported various pan-Caribbean genres of music, including calypso and soca from Trinidad and reggae from Jamaica. The major indigenous form of music is the scratch band (also called Fungi band in the British Virgin Islands), which use improvised instruments like gourds and washboards to make a kind of music called Quelbe. A Virgin Island folk song called cariso is also popular, as well as St. Thomas' bamboula. The quadrille is the traditional folk dance of the islands, and include varieties like St. Croix's Imperial Quadrille and St. Thomas' Flat German Quadrille. The Heritage Dancers are a respected dance troupe that perform traditional folk dances from the Virgin Islands and beyond.  Characteristics  Virgin Islander culture is syncretic, based primarily on African, European and North American cultures. Though the Danish controlled the present-day U.S. Virgin Islands for many years, the dominant language has been an English-based Creole since the 19th century, and the islands remain much more receptive to English language popular culture than any other. The Dutch, the French and the Danish also contributed elements to the island's culture, as have immigrants from the Arab world, India and other Caribbean islands. The single largest influence on modern Virgin Islander culture, however, comes from the Africans enslaved to work in canefields from the 17th to the mid-19th century. These African slaves brought with them traditions from across a wide swathe of Africa, including what is now Nigeria, Senegal, both Congos, Gambia and Ghana.Sheehy, pp 968-974  Folk music  Virgin Islander folk music has declined since the mid-20th century, though some traditions, such as scratch bands, remain vibrant. Trends that contributed to this change include the rise of the tourism industry, the switch of American tourists from Cuba to the Virgin Islands following the 1959 revolution, and the growth of industries based on mass radio, television and recorded music. These changes \\"(diluted) local traditions and (diverted) younger generations\\" from becoming involved in folk music, because popular styles came to be viewed as having more prestige, class and income. = Scratch bands and fungi music = Scratch bands, also known as fungi bands and formerly string bands, are a distinctive form of folk ensemble; they have survived the decline of other Virgin Islander folk traditions, through adapting to newly imported instrumentation and songs, and becoming a part of a more general revival of interest in folk culture on the islands. The name scratch band may derive from the sound produced by scraping the squash, an instrument similar to the Puerto Rican guiro, but larger, or from the word squash itself, used to refer to the bands first by American visitors and then by locals.The sound of the instrument theory is from the Jamesie Project; Sheehy, pg. 969 is the source for the other claim The traditional scratch band ensemble varied, but always used a percussive instrument, either the squash, tambourine, or a local form of double-headed barrel drum similar to the Dominican tambora, as well as an accordion, cane flute or violin as a melodic instrument. String instruments were also common, including the banjo, ukulele or a six-string guitar. The ass pipe, made out of a car exhaust tube, often provided the bass, and was played similar to the tuba. Since about the 1980s, the instrumentation for scratch bands became more rigid. The alto saxophone became the most common melodic instrument, replaced sometimes by a silver flute. Conga drums, squash, electric guitar or bass guitar, and a steel (a triangle). Banjo or ukulele, keyboard and additional saxophones or other melodic instruments are more rarely found in modern bands. The music of scratch bands are a type of folk music that dates back to the days of slavery. The slaves on the islands used everyday objects in order to fashion instruments. However, this was not unique to slaves as individuals like James \\"Jamesie\\" Brewster, considered by many as the King of Scratch in the Virgin Islands, recalls making his first banjo from an old sardine can, old white pine wood, and an old sack of flour to make twine. Lyrics traditionally function as oral history, spreading news and gossip. Modern scratch bands play a wide range of dances, including calypsos, boleros, quadrilles, international pop songs, merengues, mazurkas, waltzes, jigs and other styles. They perform at church services, private parties, public festivals, local dances and fairs, christenings and weddings, and also perform for tourists. The scratch band tradition remains most vibrant on St. Croix, where the bands Bully & the Kafooners, Stanley & the Ten Sleepless Knights, and Blinky & the Roadmasters are well known. Scratch bands are less common on St. Thomas, and in the British Virgin Islands, though the popular Elmo & the Sparkplugs hail from Tortola. = Quelbe = Quelbe is a form of topical folk song, and is the official music of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Quelbe is commonly performed by scratch bands, Stanley & the Ten Sleepless Nights being the most popular throughout the Virgin Islands, though their folk origin lies in individuals, who sang the songs in informal settings, celebrations and festivals. The music in most cases involved true stories where the listeners can identify events that happen throughout a timeline. These songs typically contained sexual innuendos and double entendres, as well as other hidden meanings; common topics included political events, such as a boycott. One example from the early 20th century chastises a carousel owner for opposing a wage increase: I rather walk and drink rum whole night Before me go ride on LaBega Carousel I rather walk, man, and drink rum whole night Before me go ride on LaBega Carousel You no hear what LaBega say \\"The people no worth fifteen cent a day\\" You no hear what LaBega say, man \\"The people no worth more than half cent a day\\" cited in Sheehy, pg. 971 = Other folk styles = The quadrille is a folk dance that was formerly an important part of Virgin Islands culture; it is now rarely performed, except on St. Croix. There, locals dance the quadrille at public performance venues, such as St. Gerard's Hall, or as educational spectacles for schools, festivals and holidays, or as entertainment for tourists. Educational and entertainment quadrille troops both wear traditionally styled clothing reminiscent of authentic attire.Sheehy, pp 971-872 Sheehy describes folkloric ensembles' clothing as \\"color-coordinated traditional garb reminiscent of early generations (typified by the St. Croix Heritage Dancers as led by Bradley Christian). The Virgin Islands tea meetings, the David and Goliath play and masquerade jig all probably derive from elsewhere in the Caribbean. The masquerade jig uses elements of theater, dance, music and oratory, and functions as simple entertainment with improvised jigs alternated with humorous monologues. Tea meetings are now only performed as reconstructions in folkloric ensembles; they were evenings of speech-making, feasting and the singing of hymns and parlor songs. The David and Goliath play features music, dance, theater, and dramatic and witty speeches, all based on the biblical story of David and Goliath. The Afro-Virgin Islander bamboula tradition is now only performed in a reconstructed fashion. It was a style of song, drumming and folk dance, performed by two drummers on one drum; one drum used his hands and heel, and the other two sticks. African-styled dance and group song with refrains were a constant part, with verses frequently improvised by a soloist. Traditional Virgin Islander folk music festivals were performed until the late 1950s. Masquerading (mas'ing) was an important tradition, and consisted of groups wearing theme-based costumes, and playing melodies and rhythms that suggest their identity. Instruments included a fife-and-drum ensemble that featured a cane fife, double-headed bass drum (known as keg or boom-boom) and snare drum (known as kettledrum). The Virgin Islander cariso tradition is extinct in a true folk context, but remains an important symbol of Crucian culture, and is performed by folkloric ensembles for educational and holiday events. Carisos were still performed as late as the 1990s by several elderly singers, most famously Ethel McIntosh and Leona Watson. Though similar in some ways to quelbe, cariso is more African in its melodic style, frequent sustained syllables and traditional performance context, namely women singing in groups in call-and-response. Carisos, like quelbe, commemorate historical events, and spread news and opinions about important issues. One particularly famous cariso dates to 1848, and documents the emancipation of the slaves; the first segment is the refrain, sung by a chorus, which is followed by a verse performed by a soloist singer: Clear the road, all you clear the road, Clear the road, let the slave them pass, We a go for a-we freedom. Hardship in the morning, suffering at night. No one ever help us, it is only Father Ryan. They bring we ya from Africa, that we bornin' land; Bring we ya in slavery, in the land of Santa Cruz. The French Virgin Islander In the early 1900s, small groups left the small French island of St. Barths and traveled to St. Thomas, VI in search of work. Known throughout St. Thomas as \\"Frenchies\\" many played instruments such as the accordion, harmonica, ukulele and guitar and made instruments such as the \\"Weero or Guiros\\" out of dried squash from their farms and cowbells from their livestock. Cyril Querrard of the Mountain Kings Band was a pioneer in promoting the music and sound of the French Virgin Islander. He had his own weekend show at the \\"Luau Club\\" on St. Thomas where he sang and played guitar for military personnel, tourists and locals alike. Because he lived on the peak of the island, he was once introduced as \\"The King of the Mountain\\" and the \\"Mountain Kings\\" band was later formed. Other local French descent bands later followed, such as, The Originals, Obsession Band and the Under Pressure band. These bands continued to have this unique sound as a result of this mix of cultures. Shawn Querrard, lead singer of the Obsession band and son of Cyril Querrard, is known for his song writing ability. Songs like \\"Gypsy Girl\\", \\"Cherry tree\\", \\"Chances\\", \\"I had to let you know\\" and \\"Music Medicine\\" has proven longevity and popularity in many of the Caribbean islands, particularly those of French influence.  Modern and recently imported styles  Until the mid-20th century, the Virgin Islands were largely culturally isolated from international popular music. In the 1960s, a growth in tourism caused an influx of immigrants to fill the service positions the tourism industry created. These immigrants brought with them many styles of popular music, which were popularized by the growth of mass media in the islands, including television and radio. By the 1980s, Virgin Islands was home to many imported styles, especially salsa, reggae, soca, merengue and rock. Jazz, Western classical music and musical theater, along with international pop stars, were common mainstream interests, while the islands' youth formed bands and dance troupes that played styles popular across the Caribbean, mainly Latin, Jamaican and Trinidadian influenced, such as salsa, reggae, steelpan and soca. The large Puerto Rican population in the Virgin Islands kept popular music from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic a major part of the islands' industry. = Calypso = The first calypso star from the Virgin Islands was Lloyd \\"Prince\\" Thomas, who moved to New York City in the mid-1940s and continued performing for some twenty years. Charles Harris, the Mighty Zebra (a well-known Trinidadian calypsonian) influentially performed in the Virgin Islands in the 1950s; he came for the Carnival in 1952, and stayed, playing at the Virgin Isles Hotel with the LaMotta Brothers Band. The LaMotta Band, led by Bill LaMotta, was a very popular group that recorded several albums and backed Mighty Zebra on a 1957 album for RCA Records. The remaining major early calypso band from the Virgin Islands was the Fabulous McClevertys, who toured widely across the East Coast of the United States at the height of the calypso craze in the late 1950s. Another popular Virgin Islands calypsonian is Irvin \\"Brownie\\" Brown, who has hosted the islands' Carnival and has been a leading singer, radio entertainer, MC and drummer for many years. Originally from St. Thomas, he learned the timbales as a young man, and joined his uncle's hotel band in 1949 or 1950. The band soon began performing in Florida and elsewhere, and Brownie became known as a calypso singer while also learning bongos, congas and a trap set. They recorded for Monogram and then Art Records, with Mighty Panther and the Haitian singer Calypso Mama. Brownie's return to St. Thomas was followed by joining up with Milo & the Kings, a well-known band, for whom he was a percussion for seventeen years, recording a number of albums and touring across North America and the Caribbean. He began working as a DJ for the WSTA radio station in 1966, and continued for more than three decades; he had a regular talk show with calypso performances, The Original Side of Walter and Brownie. Salsa In the 1950s through present day Milo and the Kings (Emile Francis - music director) kept Latin music alive, especially on St. Thomas. Milo and the Kings were famous for playing with such famous bands as El Gran Combo (Rafael Ithier - music director and Salsa Maestro to Milo), Tito Puente, Joe Cuba, Mongo Santa Maria, to name a few. Present day Milo's Kings sometimes attempt to honor Milo with Salsa. In 1998 Puerto RIco became the birthplace of Reggaeton music, a mix of Reggae and Latin music combined with Spanish Rap & Reggae. Prominent Reggaeton Artist from the Virgin Islands include Kamakazi, Nicky Jam, Nene Ganja, Panty Man. = Soca = The Virgin Islands has been home to a number of well-known soca bands. Among the oldest and most respected are: Milo & The Kings, Mandingo Brass, Imaginations Brass, & Eddie & the Movements (later renamed the \\"Awesome JamBand\\"). The \\"Jam Band\\" (formerly Eddie & the Movements) are 20 time Road March Champions. The original \\"Jam Band\\" slowed up with the death of the band's main front man Nick 'Daddy' Friday who died in 2005. The Enforcements band hailed out of Monbijou, St. Croix (many members branched out to form different bands). The Imaginations Brass was the first group to incorporate the used of electronic drums & keyboard sequencers into their music. They started the trend & other groups (such as Seventeen Plus & the JamBand) later advanced the technique. It demonstrated the full use of the drum machines, electronic keyboards, vocals, and a bass line working together to set a new standard for Caribbean Music. Other popular bands included: Seventeen Plus (17+); VIO International; Xpress Band (St. Croix Festival's 2006-2007 Roadmarch Champions); Starlites; P'your Passion Band; Xtaushun Band (St. Croix Festival two-time Road March Champions).\\"; Fusion Band(St. Croix Festival four-time Road March Champions); DJATC (Daddy Jones And The Crew); the Jammerz HP (formerly known as JDPP Jammerz); De Fabulous Stroka Band; Hyvoltage Band; Code 9; Xpress Band; Jam Tyme; UMB Soldiers; Rupsion Band; Spectrum Band (St. Thomas Carnival four-time Road March Champions); Kylo & Stylee Band; and Pumpa & The Unit have also made names for themselves. There is also the 5X Road March Champs Virgin Islands Based Entertainment [VIBE] out of the Virgin Islands, British to be exact. They are known for popular hit songs: Take Over, #Rule #Uno, Rock With Me, Jouvert Feeling, Speed Bumps, Dancing, Don't Catch No Feelings, Tuck and Roll, Hello, Flashlights, Show Me, One [Jougo, MacDaddy, TeeJaay, Ramon, Glenn, Zo, Tafari, Smudge] Management: Roger Frank @ 1 284 541 0546. To all our Fans, WE love ayo bad. Love Alone!! = Reggae = A reggae scene has been flourishing in the Virgin Islands, especially the island of St. Croix. The Virgin Islands reggae scene has achieved much popularity throughout the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, the United States, South America, Europe, and Africa. Prominent reggae artists from the Virgin Islands include Pressure, Midnite, Dezarie, Army, Abja, De Apostle, Niyorah, Emanuel, Bambu Station, Inner Visions, Sabbattical Ahdah, Eno, Revalation, Iba Wicked, Jah Rubal, Jah Croix, Exodus and many more. The reggae music of St. Croix has a distinct \\"roots\\" feeling and is strongly rooted in Rastafari. A prominent known reggae label in St. Croix is I Grade Records, who have released countless Midnite releases, two Dezarie albums, Niyorah albums, Army albums and Abja albums. Bambu Station guitarist Tuff Lion, along with Laurent Alfred of I Grade Records produce many of the tracks. St. Croix also boasts a reggae radio station, WSTX 100.3 FM, which features Virgin Islands reggae. = Band music = European-based military band music first came to the Virgin Islands through ship-based bands as well as the small military ensembles of the Danish troops based in the islands. Regular band concerts were given by Danish musicians in Charlotte Amalie at least as early as 1888 at the Emancipation Garden bandstand.Adams, 305 The Native Brass Band, reportedly the first official band of local musicians, was formed under the direction of Lionel Roberts in 1907, while the Adams Juvenile Band appeared in 1910 and would be inducted into the U.S. Navy when the service took over the administration of the islands from Denmark in 1917.Adams, 74‚Äì77 & 95 The induction of this all-black unit into the U.S. Navy was remarkable for its time and thus recognized the first black musicians in the U.S. Navy since the War of 1812.Adams, 295 The United States Navy Band of the Virgin Islands gave regular public concerts on St. Thomas until the departure of the naval administration in 1931, and not long after its founding two additional navy band units were stationed on St. Croix. Alton Augustus Adams, Sr., the founder of the Juvenile Band and the bandmaster of the Navy ensemble, also wrote the Virgin Islands March (1919), now the official territorial anthem of the Virgin Islands, as well as The Governor's Own, the official march of the Virgin Islands Governor. With the exception of a single surviving bamboula arrangement, Adams's marches are entirely in the standard American march style of his idol, John Philip Sousa. = Hip-hop = There has been the development of a hip-hop scene in the Virgin Islands, especially on the island of St. Thomas. There is also a burgeoning hip-hop scene among Virgin Islands artists in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Prominent Virgin Islands hip-hop artists include Iyaz from Tortola, Rock City, Verse Simmonds from St. Thomas, K'Are from Tortola, Virgin Islands, British of the CB 4 Lyfe camp who also does Solo but is still a member of CB and the VI centered hip hop group Dem Rude Boyz.  Institutions and festivals  The two most prominent music institutions in the Virgin Islands are the Island Center (on St. Croix) and the Reichold Center (on St. Thomas). Both these centers provide a venue for concerts of Western classical music, jazz, musical theater and international pop stars. St. Croix is also home to a public performance venue in St. Gerald's Hall in Frederiksted, where locals dance quadrilles and otherwise perform. A St. Thomas Carnival troupe Traditional Virgin Islander folk music festivals were performed until the late 1950s, and featured costumed masquerading. With the advent of formal parades and village festivals, local folk traditions declined, replaced by pan-Caribbean elements like calypso, moko jumbie stilt dancers and visiting performers from other islands.  Education  There are Virgin Islander institutions that support and promote the islands' folk heritage. Bradley Christian's St. Croix Heritage Dancers, for example, are folkloric group, one of several quadrille ensembles that offer a \\"compact, staged rendition\\" of folk traditions, along with educational narration. Music education in the Virgin Islands is focused primarily on the Western classical tradition, particularly orchestral and concert band music. Local folk music is also a part of the music curriculum; quadrilles are taught in schools in St. Croix, and Charlotte Amalie High School on St. Thomas is home to a well-known student scratch band.  Historiography and musicology  There is a paucity of historical documentation and musicological research and analysis of Virgin Islander music. The sound recordist Mary Jane Soule and ethnomusicologist Margot Lieth-Philipp collaborated on an annotated CD, Zoop Zoop Zoop: Traditional Music and Folklore of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John; these liner notes are among the comprehensive descriptions of folk music known. Lieth-Phillipp has also published some other material, on bamboula (which she refers to as a \\"forgotten\\" style of Caribbean music) and other topics. The loca and the Smithsonian Institution have also documented some folk traditions, but their research remains largely unpublished.Sheehy, pg. 973 Carmen Nibbs-O'Garra, wife of well-known Antiguan calypsonian Figgy, is the author of In de Calypso Tent, which, though perhaps no longer available, contains information of calypso competitions of St. Thomas and also reproduces the lyrics of popular Virgin Islands calypsos, and historical programs from past calypso tents on the islands. While not a scholarly history of the islands' musical life, The Memoirs of Alton Augustus Adams, Sr.: First Black Bandmaster of the United States Navy were recently published by the University of California Press in a scholarly edition by Mark Clague. This book offers a first-hand account of musical life in the Virgin Islands from the 1900s through the 1950s. Adams's remembrances are surprisingly precise as in addition to his musical activities, he worked as a journalist and much of his writing is based upon the articles and notes he penned for The St. Thomas Times and The Bulletin as well as The Pittsburgh Courier.

Early career After attending King Edward VII School, Sheffield, he graduated in law at the University of Nottingham in 1978, and joined BBC Radio Nottingham as a trainee reporter and subsequently the presenter of its speech-based breakfast show, Morning Report. It was here that he first met Trevor Dann, whom he subsequently worked with at BBC Radio 1. He first worked for Radio 1 as a presenter of its news programme Newsbeat between 1983 and 1985. He worked for Capital Radio as a journalist in the early 1980s, before returning as Head of News and Talks, after leaving Radio 1. He was also co-presenter with Sarah Ward of Capital Radio's The Way It Is. Managerial career Bannister first established himself as a name in the radio industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s as Managing Editor of GLR (Greater London Radio), the BBC's local radio station for London. Here he worked for the first time with Chris Evans, who was pioneering many of the ideas which would later win him greater success and much controversy at Radio 1, and also employed a number of the more musically credible DJs from Radio 1's past, such as Annie Nightingale, Tommy Vance, Janice Long and Johnnie Walker. The line-up also included Danny Baker, Emma Freud and Chris Morris. After working for two years in the BBC corporate centre on projects related to the renewal of the BBC's Royal Charter, in 1993 Bannister was chosen as the new controller for BBC Radio 1, replacing Johnny Beerling who had worked at the station since its inception in 1967. Many of the DJs, producers and other staff at Radio One had grown old with the station, as had the audience. Keen to return the station to its original purpose for \\"young listeners\\", Bannister overhauled the staff, resulting in many presenters either resigning or being sacked and replacing them with new presenters. Over the next few years the station lost approximately 5 million listeners. The Britpop explosion proved the success of Bannister's strategy: the bands he had championed a year or two earlier, when they were comparatively obscure and marginal, were now part of the mainstream, and Radio 1 was booming again. Chris Evans, who had become a hugely popular national figure as breakfast DJ, was the figurehead of this boom, but eventually things went sour; in January 1997 Evans resigned after Bannister refused to allow him to waive his Friday show, to concentrate on his TV show TFI Friday. After Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley had an unsuccessful stint on the breakfast show, the team of Kevin Greening and Zoe Ball were hosting the breakfast show when Bannister left Radio 1 in 1998 (Ball would subsequently host the show on her own). In the autumn of 1996 Bannister was appointed Director of Radio, a post which gave him responsibility for all the national BBC radio networks other than Five Live. He remained controller of Radio 1 alongside this until March 1998, when he was succeeded by Andy Parfitt.Bannister's time as controller of Radio 1 is documented in In 1999, Bannister was appointed Chief Executive of BBC Production, responsible for all non-news programme-making on English television, radio and online. He oversaw production centres in London, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. When John Birt announced he was stepping down as BBC Director General, Bannister lost out to Greg Dyke. After a short stint in 2000 as director of marketing and communications, he subsequently returned to radio presenting on BBC 5 Live, Radio 4 and the World Service. Return to broadcasting In October 2000 Matthew Bannister resigned from the BBC to return to broadcasting. From 2003 to 2005 he had his own late night talk show on BBC Radio 5 Live. He also deputised for other presenters on the station as well as on programmes on Radio 4 such as Broadcasting House and Saturday PM. Since 2006 he has presented an obituary programme on Radio 4 called Last Word and between 2008 and 2018 also hosted Outlook on the BBC World Service. He has also sat in for Jeremy Vine on his lunchtime Radio 2 show. He is Chairman of the independent production company Wire Free Productions. In August 2018, Bannister launched his own podcast, Folk on Foot , in which he walks and talks with leading folk performers in the landscapes that have inspired them. The podcast won the silver award in the Arts and Culture category at the British Podcast Awards 2019. https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/winners-2019-1 Folk on Foot producer Natalie Steed won gold as Best Music Producer at the Audio Production Awards 2019, when Bannister was nominated as Best Music Presenter. https://www.audiouk.org/index.php/policy-public-affairs/press- releases/613-audio-production-awards-winners-announced On 20 July 2011 Bannister was awarded an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, the University of Nottingham. On 19 November 2019 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts from Sheffield Hallam University. https://www.shu.ac.uk/alumni/news/doctor-who-cast-and-crew-among-honorary- doctorate-recipients He is also a Fellow of The Radio Academy. Personal life Bannister married his first wife, the radio and TV presenter Amanda Walker, in 1984. Their daughter Jessica was born later the same year. In 1988 Amanda drowned while swimming in the sea off the Spanish Costa Blanca during a family holiday. In 1989, Bannister married Shelagh Macleod, who later became Senior Vice-President of Legal and Business Affairs at the record company EMI. Their son Joe was born in 1990. Shelagh died of breast cancer in 2005. In 2007, he married Katherine Hood, a private equity investor. They were divorced in 2013. He now lives with his partner, Kate McGuire.

There are three hqx filters defined: hq2x, hq3x, and hq4x, which magnify by factor of 2, 3, and 4 respectively. For other magnification factors, this filter is used with nearest-neighbor scaling. Algorithm First, the color of each of the 8 pixels around the source pixel is compared to the color of the source pixel. Shapes are detected by checking for pixels of similar color according to a threshold. This gives total of 28 = 256 combinations of similar or dissimilar neighbors. To expand the single pixel into a 2√ó2, 3√ó3, or 4√ó4 block of pixels, the arrangement of neighbors is looked up in a predefined table which contains the necessary interpolation patterns. Hqx uses the YUV color space to calculate color differences, so that differences in brightness is weighted higher to mimic human perception. It is possible to use a look-up table for the color space conversion if the source image is 16 bit per pixel. The interpolation data in the lookup tables are constrained by the requirement that continuity of line segments must be preserved, while optimizing for smoothness. Generating these 256-filter lookup tables is relatively slow, and is the major source of complexity in the algorithm: the render stage is very simple and fast, and designed to be capable of being performed in real time on a MMX-capable CPU. In the source code, the interpolation data is represented as preprocessor macros to be inserted into switch case statements, and there is no source code leading to the generation of a lookup table. The author describes the process of generating a look-up table as: > ... for each combination the most probable vector representation of the area > has to be determined, with the idea of edges between the different colored > areas of the image to be preserved, with the edge direction to be as close > to a correct one as possible. That vector representation is then rasterised > with higher (3x) resolution using anti-aliasing, and the result is stored in > the lookup table. Implementations * The original algorithm has been ported to DevIL (but kept in the C language). * Ports to Java and C# languages are available. These implementations expand the macros. * A C++ port by byuu, the author of bsnes, which encodes the LUT in a space-efficient way. Byuu exploited the symmetry of patterns to make such an encoding, and wrote some notes on interpreting the original look up tables.Byuu.

The star tracker is seen pointing off to the side, above and to the right. The Defense Support Program (DSP) is a program of the USAF that operated the reconnaissance satellites which form the principal component of the Satellite Early Warning System used by the United States. DSP satellites, which are operated by the 460th Space Wing, detect missile or spacecraft launches and nuclear explosions using sensors that detect the infrared emissions from these intense sources of heat. During Desert Storm, for example, DSP was able to detect the launches of Iraqi Scud missiles and provide timely warnings to civilians and military forces in Israel and Saudi Arabia. The satellites are in geosynchronous orbits, and are equipped with infrared sensors operating through a wide-angle Schmidt camera. The entire satellite spins so that the linear sensor array in the focal plane scans over the Earth six times every minute. Typically, DSP satellites were launched on Titan IVB boosters with Inertial Upper Stages. However, one DSP satellite (DSP-16) was launched using the Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-44 (24 November 1991). The last known DSP satellite (flight 23) was launched in 2007 aboard the first operational flight of the Delta IV Heavy rocket, as the Titan IV had been retired in 2005. All 23 satellites were built by the prime contractor Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, formerly TRW, in Redondo Beach, California.https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS21148.pdf The 460th Space Wing, with headquarters at Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado, has units, primarily the 2nd Space Warning Squadron, that operate DSP satellites and report warning information, via communications links, to the NORAD and USSTRATCOM early warning centers within the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado. These centers immediately forward data to various agencies and areas of operations around the world. Air Force Space Command's SBIRS Wing at the Space and Missile Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is responsible for development and acquisition of the satellites.  History  The Defense Support Program replaced the 1960s space-based infrared Missile Defense Alarm System (MIDAS). The first successful launch of MIDAS (MIDAS-2) was 24 May 1960 and there were twelve launches before the DSP program replaced it in 1970. The first launch of a DSP (IMEWS-1 - Integrated Missile Early Warning Satellite) was on 6 November 1970 and since then it has become the mainstay of the United States ballistic missile early warning system. For the last 45 years they have provided an uninterrupted space-based early warning capability. The original DSP satellite weighed 2,000 pounds (900 kg) and had 400 watts of power, 2000 detectors and a design life of 1.25 years. Throughout the life of the program, the satellite design has undergone numerous improvements to enhance reliability and capability. The weight grew to 5,250 pounds (2380 kg), the power to 1275 watts, the number of detectors increased threefold to 6000 and the design life has been increased to a goal of ten years. DSP satellite deployment during STS-44 The numerous improvement projects have enabled DSP to provide accurate, reliable data in the face of evolving missile threats. On- station sensor reliability has provided uninterrupted service well past their design lifetime. Recent technological improvements in sensor design include above-the-horizon capability and improved resolution. Increased on-board signal-processing capability improves clutter rejection. Enhanced reliability and survivability improvements were also incorporated. The 23rd, and last DSP satellite (DSP-23) was scheduled to be launched on 1 April 2007, aboard a Delta IV Heavy rocket, but the launch was postponed until mid-August 2007 after two structural cracks were found in the metal launch table at pad 37B, caused by a fuel leak during testing. Further delays forced the launch back to 11 November 2007, when the satellite launched at 01:50:00 UTC (20:50 EST on 10 November). This satellite died in space sometime during 2008, for reasons unknown. It is now adrift in geosynchronous orbit and remains a potential hazard to other craft. The Department of Defense sent a MiTEx spacecraft to inspect DSP 23 sometime in 2008. Another DSP satellite was lost in 1999, DSP-19, after its Inertial Upper Stage failed following launch from a Titan 4B booster. DSP-19 was a USAF Defense Support Program missile early warning satellite equipped with an infrared telescope to detect rocket launches. The Titan 4B rocket placed the IUS upper stages and payload into a 188 km x 718 km x 28.6¬∞ parking orbit. The first stage on the IUS burned at 18:14 GMT and put the second stage and payload into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The IUS second stage fired at 23:34 GMT. However, the two stages of the IUS failed to separate completely. At least one connector remained attached. This meant the second stage motor nozzle did not extend properly. When the stage fired, the vehicle tumbled during the burn and the satellite was left out of control in a useless orbit. The project was originally to have had 25 satellites, but the last two have been canceled, mainly due to SBIRS. DSP satellites have been replaced by the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) satellites. There were five major improvement programs on the 23 satellites: * Block 1: Phase I, 1970‚Äì1975, five satellites * Block 2: Phase II, 1976‚Äì1987, seven satellites * Block 3: Multi-Orbit Satellite Performance Improvement Modification (MOS/PIM), 1989‚Äì1991, three satellites * Block 4: Phase II Upgrade, 1994‚Äì1997, two satellites * Block 5: DSP-I (DSP-Improved), 1999‚Äì2007, six satellites More recently, there has been some effort put into using DSPs' infrared sensors as part of an early warning system for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and forest fires.  Limitations  The DSP constellation may have offered an excellent vantage point for an early warning system against state-centric threats such as missiles, but military analysts warn its ability to collect intelligence on non-state actors is severely limited.

The book topped the New York Times Non-Fiction Bestsellers of 2000. An unabridged audiobook was also published, narrated by Albom. The appendix of the audiobook contains several minutes of excerpts from audio recordings that Albom made in his conversations with Schwartz before writing the book. A new edition with an afterword by Albom was released on the book's ten-year anniversary in 2007. Synopsis Albom is a successful sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press. After seeing his former sociology professor Morrie Schwartz appear on Nightline, Albom phones Schwartz, and is prompted to travel to Massachusetts to visit him. An ensuing newspaper strike allows Albom to visit Schwartz every week, on Tuesdays. The book recounts each of the fourteen visits Albom made to Schwartz, supplemented with Schwartz's lectures, life experiences, and interspersed with both flashbacks and allusions to contemporary events. After being diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Morrie's final days are spent giving his former student Mitch his final lesson of life. The novel is divided into 14 different \\"days\\" that Mitch Albom spent with his professor Morrie. Throughout these days, Mitch and Morrie discuss various topics important to life and living. The novel also recounts Mitch's memories of Morrie as a professor. =The 1st Audiovisual= This was the first episode out of three on a Nightline special on Morrie and his illness. Morrie caught the eye of a Nightline television producer after an article was published titled: \\"A Professor's Final Course: His Own Death\\". It was through this airing that Morrie's old student Mitch was reminded of his old professor, causing him to reach out and reconnect. Main characters =Mitch Albom= Mitch Albom was born in May 1958 in New Jersey. Originally, he was a pianist and wanted to pursue a life as a musician. Instead he became an author, journalist, screenwriter, and television/ radio broadcaster. In his college years, he met sociology professor Dr. Morrie Schwartz who would later influence his memoir, Tuesdays with Morrie. =Morrie Schwartz= Morrie Schwartz is a sociology professor at Brandeis University who is diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Morrie is a very wise man who has had many experiences in life. The son of Russian immigrants, Morrie's childhood was not short of difficulties including the death of his mother and his brother's infection with the Polio virus. Morrie later went on to work as a researcher in a mental hospital where he learned about mental illness and how to have empathy and compassion for other people. Later in life, Morrie decided to be a sociology professor so that his teachings would influence as many people as possible. This is where he met his student and lifelong friend Mitch Albom. Morrie was married to Charlotte Schwartz and together they had two children. After a long battle with ALS, Morrie died on 4 November 1995. His tombstone reads \\"A teacher until the end.\\" Adaptations The book was adapted into a 1999 television film, directed by Mick Jackson, and starring Hank Azaria and Jack Lemmon. In 2002, the book was adapted as a stage play that opened Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre. Co-authored by Mitch Albom and Jeffrey Hatcher (Three Viewings) and directed by David Esbjornson (The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?). Tuesdays with Morrie starred Alvin Epstein as Schwartz and Jon Tenney as Albom. It received positive reviews.

The Inhul River is long. The river valley is mostly trapezium-like with the width up to 4 km and the depth up to 60 meters. At the upper stream it has a narrow winding channel that cuts through the Dnieper Upland and its rocky banks show granite and gneiss; at the middle and lower stream after entering the Black Sea Lowland, it widens up to 30 meters and over. The river freezes over in December and thaws sometime in March. Among major cities on the river there are Kropyvnytskyi and Mykolaiv.

Education and career Born on September 9, 1755, in Bristol, Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, British America, Bourne was the son of Shearjashub Bourn, a lawyer who eventually served on the Rhode Island Supreme Court.Calbraith Bourn Perry, Charles D'Wolf of Guadaloupe, His Ancestors and Descendants (1902), p. 285-86. Like his father, Bourne graduated from Harvard University in 1775, received a Master of Arts degree from the same institution in 1778, and read law. He was quartermaster of the Second Rhode Island Regiment in 1776. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Providence, Rhode Island. He was a deputy in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1780 and from 1787 to 1790. He was clerk of the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1780 to 1786. He was a Justice of the Peace in Providence from 1785 to 1790. Congressional service Upon the ratification of the United States Constitution by the State of Rhode Island, Bourne was elected as a Pro-Administration candidate from Rhode Island's at-large congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 1st through the 3rd United States Congresses and as a Federalist to the 4th and 5th United States Congresses and served from August 31, 1790, until his resignation on October 13, 1796, before the close of the 4th United States Congress. Federal judicial service Bourne received a recess appointment from President George Washington on October 13, 1796, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island vacated by Judge Henry Marchant. He was nominated to the same position by President Washington on December 21, 1796. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 22, 1796, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on February 20, 1801, due to his elevation to the First Circuit.

The first column numerates the line's starting address, while the \`*\` indicates repetition. A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file. The term \\"binary file\\" is often used as a term meaning \\"non-text file\\". Many binary file formats contain parts that can be interpreted as text; for example, some computer document files containing formatted text, such as older Microsoft Word document files, contain the text of the document but also contain formatting information in binary form.  Structure  Binary files are usually thought of as being a sequence of bytes, which means the binary digits (bits) are grouped in eights. Binary files typically contain bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. Compiled computer programs are typical examples; indeed, compiled applications are sometimes referred to, particularly by programmers, as binaries. But binary files can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc. ‚Äì in short, any type of file content whatsoever. Some binary files contain headers, blocks of metadata used by a computer program to interpret the data in the file. The header often contains a signature or magic number which can identify the format. For example, a GIF file can contain multiple images, and headers are used to identify and describe each block of image data. The leading bytes of the header would contain text like \`GIF87a\` or \`GIF89a\` that can identify the binary as a GIF file. If a binary file does not contain any headers, it may be called a flat binary file.  Manipulation  To send binary files through certain systems (such as email) that do not allow all data values, they are often translated into a plain text representation (using, for example, Base64). Encoding the data has the disadvantage of increasing the file size during the transfer (for example, using Base64 will increase the file's size by approximately 30%), as well as requiring translation back into binary after receipt. The increased size may be countered by lower-level link compression, as the resulting text data will have about as much less entropy as it has increased size, so the actual data transferred in this scenario would likely be very close to the size of the original binary data. See Binary-to-text encoding for more on this subject. Microsoft Windows and its standard libraries for the C and C++ programming languages allow the programmer to specify a parameter indicating if a file is expected to be plain text or binary when opening a file; this affects the standard library calls to read and write from the file in that the system converts between the C/C++ \\"end of line\\" character (the ASCII linefeed character) and the end-of-line sequence Windows expects in files (the ASCII carriage return and linefeed characters in sequence). In Unix-like systems, the C and C++ standard libraries on those systems also allow the programmer to specify whether a file is expected to be text or binary, but the libraries can and do ignore that parameter, as the end-of-line sequence in Unix-like systems is just the C/C++ end-of-line character.  Viewing  A hex editor or viewer may be used to view file data as a sequence of hexadecimal (or decimal, binary or ASCII character) values for corresponding bytes of a binary file. If a binary file is opened in a text editor, each group of eight bits will typically be translated as a single character, and the user will see a (probably unintelligible) display of textual characters. If the file is opened in some other application, that application will have its own use for each byte: maybe the application will treat each byte as a number and output a stream of numbers between 0 and 255‚Äîor maybe interpret the numbers in the bytes as colors and display the corresponding picture. Other type of viewers (called 'word extractors') simply replace the unprintable characters with spaces revealing only the human-readable text. This type of view is useful for quick inspection of a binary file in order to find passwords in games, find hidden text in non-text files and recover corrupted documents. It can even be used to inspect suspicious files (software) for unwanted effects. For example, the user would see any URL/email to which the suspected software may attempt to connect in order to upload unapproved data (to steal). If the file is itself treated as an executable and run, then the operating system will attempt to interpret the file as a series of instructions in its machine language.  Interpretation  Standards are very important to binary files. For example, a binary file interpreted by the ASCII character set will result in text being displayed. A custom application can interpret the file differently: a byte may be a sound, or a pixel, or even an entire word. Binary itself is meaningless, until such time as an executed algorithm defines what should be done with each bit, byte, word or block. Thus, just examining the binary and attempting to match it against known formats can lead to the wrong conclusion as to what it actually represents. This fact can be used in steganography, where an algorithm interprets a binary data file differently to reveal hidden content. Without the algorithm, it is impossible to tell that hidden content exists. Binary compatibility Two files that are binary compatible will have the same sequence of zeros and ones in the data portion of the file. The file header, however, may be different. The term is used most commonly to state that data files produced by one application are exactly the same as data files produced by another application. For example, some software companies produce applications for Windows and the Macintosh that are binary compatible, which means that a file produced in a Windows environment is interchangeable with a file produced on a Macintosh. This avoids many of the conversion problems caused by importing and exporting data. One possible binary compatibility issue between different computers is the endianness of the computer. Some computers store the bytes in a file in a different order.

The resulting file is suitable for transmission over FTP, the World Wide Web, and electronic mail. The documents can also be stored on computers that run operating systems with no HFS support, such as Unix or Windows. MacBinary was widely supported on the Macintosh and was built into most communications programs on that platform. Similar solutions were built into most data compression applications on the Mac, and although these did not require MacBinary to survive transmission across non-Mac systems, MacBinary was often added in these cases to preserve longer filenames and other features. The dual-fork nature of the HFS system was not used on Mac OS X, and MacBinary has largely disappeared. Description In contrast to other computers of the era, Macintosh applications included both computer code as well as a large number of resources that were used by the operating system (OS) itself. These resources were also widely used in documents to store rich media like sounds and images. However, the resource system had the significant limitation that the maximum size of any single resource was only 32 kB, far too small for storing document data. To address this, Apple introduced the concept of forks, allowing any file in the filesystem to have both a resource fork and a data fork, basically separate files. The OS would ensure the two separate files were always treated as a single object, so dragging it to a floppy disk in the Finder would actually copy both files. This presented a serious problem when the file had to be stored on other computer systems. Those systems, unaware of the fork concept, would have to store the two forks as separate files. This presented the possibility that the two would be separated at some point, or not properly recombined when they were transmitted back to the Mac. This problem led to a number of solutions that combined the two forks together into a single file, and then automatically pulling them back apart when they reached another Mac. MacBinary was one of the most popular solutions, although BinHex was also used on the UseNet, where links were not 8-bit clean. Apple's own solutions, AppleSingle and AppleDouble, were never widely adopted in the user community. Files encoded with MacBinary, regardless of the version, usually have a .bin or .macbin file extension appended to the ends of their filenames. E-mail programs such as Eudora can extract and decode MacBinary mail messages. Most dedicated FTP programs for the Mac, such as Fetch and Transmit, transparently decode MacBinary files they download. MacBinary is similar to BinHex, but MacBinary produces binary files as opposed to ASCII text. Thus, MacBinary files take up less disk space than BinHex files, but older applications and servers are more likely to corrupt them. History The first incarnation of MacBinary was released in 1985. The standard was originally specified by Dennis Brothers (author of the terminal program MacTEP and later an Apple employee), BinHex author Yves Lempereur, PackIt author Harry Chesley, et al. then added support for MacBinary into BinHex 5.0, using MacBinary to combine the forks instead of his own methods. Most terminal programs and internet utilities added built-in MacBinary support during this period as well. Two years later it was updated to MacBinary II, to accommodate changes in Mac OS. MacBinary II remained compatible with subsequent updates of the operating system for some time. This changed with the release of Mac OS 8, which necessitated the release of MacBinary III in 1996. In the meantime, Apple itself had released the AppleSingle and AppleDouble formats, which serve the same purpose as MacBinary, but correct some problems with it.

A high level corridor deck in the backyard of a suburban house, in Australia A high level deck in the backyard of a suburban house, in Australia. The decking is a Malaysian timber, selangan batu In architecture, a deck is a flat surface capable of supporting weight, similar to a floor, but typically constructed outdoors, often elevated from the ground, and usually connected to a building. The term is a generalization of decks as found on ships. Functions and materials Wood or timber \\"decking\\" can be used in a number of ways: as part of garden landscaping, to extend living areas of houses, and as an alternative to stone based features such as patios. Decks are made from treated lumber, composite lumber, composite material, and Aluminum. Lumber may be Western red cedar, teak, mahogany, ip√™, reclaimed and recycled Ulin and other hardwoods. Recycled planks may be high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS) and PET plastic as well as mixed plastics and wood fiber (often called \\"composite\\" lumber). Artificial decking products are often called \\"wood-plastic composites\\". These days, WPC's have more widely known by different brands like NewTechWood, Azek, Ecornboard etc. Historically, the softwoods used for decking were logged from old growth forests. These include Atlantic white cedar, redwood and Western red cedar (redcedar). Atlantic City built the first coastal boardwalk in the United States, originally constructed of Atlantic white cedar. Soon, the commercial logging of this tree and clearing of cedar swamps in New Jersey caused a decline in the availability of decking. Atlantic City and New York City both switched to Western red cedar. By the 1960s, Western red cedar from the US was declining due to over-logging. More expensive Western red cedar was available from western Canada (British Columbia) but by then, pressure treated pine had become available. But even with chemical treatments (such as chromated copper arsenate or CCA), pine decking is not as durable as cedars in an outdoor environment. Thus, many municipalities and homeowners are turning to hardwoods. Decks are often built from pressure treated wood. Pressure treated wood is long lasting and holds up to wet and icy weather conditions. Pressure treated wood however is treated with chemicals which have been known to be toxic. It is also important to note that both softwood and hardwood decks will need to be finished after installation using either an oil or varnish to prevent weathering, wear, mould, algae and wood boring insects. Due to environmental and durability concerns, composite decking (a mixture of two materials, typically wood pulp and recycled material such as plastic bottles or plastic bags) have appeared on the market. Proponents of composite decking have touted this as a much needed development as this helps to curb logging of trees for new decks. However composite decking has been found to contain harmful chemicals, cannot be refurbished, and despite claims from decking companies, some composite decking still attracts mold. However newer more modern composites feature a cap or shell that prevents mold and staining. In multi-story commercial construction, the dominant form of deck (including roof deck) construction is composite steel deck. = Concerns = Generally, hardwoods used for decking come from tropical forests. Much of the logging taking place to produce these woods, especially teak, mahogany and ip√™, is occurring illegally, as outlined in numerous reports by environmental organizations such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Rainforest Relief. US tropical wood imports are rising, partly due to the demand for decking. Construction The deck of a house is generally a wooden platform built above the ground and connected to the main building. It is generally enclosed by a railing for safety. Access may be from the house through doors and from the ground via a stairway. Residential decks can be constructed over steep areas or rough ground that is otherwise unusable. Decks can also be covered by a canopy or pergola to control sunlight. Deck designs can be found in numerous books, do-it-yourself magazines and web sites, and from the USDA.L.O. Anderson, T.B. Heebink, and A.E. Oviatt. (1972).\\"Construction guides for exposed wood decks. Agriculture handbook no. 432\\". Washington: USDA, Forest Service. Typical construction is either of a post and beam architecture, or a cantilever construction. The post and beam construction relies on posts anchored to piers in the ground. Typically these types of structural decks are engineered and require an experienced construction company that specializes in structural decks. Cantilever decks rely on floor joists that protrude out further than the wall of the house. While this type of construction is common, it raises significant safety issues if the decks are not properly waterproofed and flashed. There have been a growing number deck failures resulting in death and critical injuries. Another key component of decks are code compliant railings. Railings on decks above 30 inches are considered guard rails. Guard rails have a specific building code requirement for both height and structural strength. Most U.S. commercial building codes require a 42-inch guardrail on decks, and 36 or 42 inches for residential code depending on the state. Typical railing assemblies must meet structural strength requirements of 200lbs of load force per foot. In short, decks are complex load bearing structures that most often require structural engineering, plans, and permits. Residential decks may contain spaces for cooking, dining and seating. Cooking areas ideally should be situated near the patio door while out of the way from general foot traffic. Dining spaces will include patio tables. For a typical 6 person outdoor patio table building an area of 12' x 16' (4x5 m) is ideal. If deck space is available, homeowners may choose to include a seating area for outdoor couches and benches. Larger buildings may also have decks on the upper floors of the building which can be open to the public as observation decks or greeneries. A deck is also the surface used to construct a boardwalk over sand on barrier islands. Laying deck or throwing deck refers to the act of placing and bolting down cold-formed steel beneath roofing and concrete floors. This is usually done by an ironworker, sometimes in conjunction with a cement mason or carpenter. It regarded as one of the most physically demanding jobs in the iron working industry. In the UK the various bans on smoking in public buildings were expected to lead to an increase in the use of timber decking for outdoor spaces where smokers can gather.\\"Smoking Ban Good News For Decking\\", Timber Construction, 2007 = Urban rooftop decks = Deck on roof of hotel in New York High-rise commercial and residential buildings with rooftop decks often utilize urban landscaping techniques to create \\"green spaces\\" or \\"sky parks\\".

Sveg Power Plant at Svegssj√∂n Hydroelectric power plants Sveg Power Plant (Svegs kraftverk) is a hydroelectric power plant that began to be built in 1972. The work was greatly accelerated as the energy crisis increased the need for Swedish energy production. The power plant was commissioned in 1975. The power plant is located at the 18 meter high dam next to Lake Svegssj√∂n, a water reservoir that was created when the Ljusnan, Veman and H√§rj√•n rivers were dammed up in 1975. There are two power plant facilities directly adjacent to the lake. Svegs kraftverk is the larger of the facilities, and the dam itself, is located near Sveg. The smaller power plant located at Kvarnforsen just south of Herr√∂ was built in 1966 and is owned by H√§rje√•ns Kraft AB. Sveg Church Sveg Church Sveg Church (Svegs kyrka) is located in central Sveg. The church is of stone with towers and narrower sacristy. It was built in 1845‚Äì47. The present church is believed to have been preceded by at least three prior church buildings, the first of which was probably built in the late 1000s. Construction was under the direction of Jacob Norin (1795‚Äì1864) from Norrala in H√§lsingland. The church includes an altar from 1623 and a pulpit from 1649. The church bell was cast at Stockholm in 1683. Climate Sveg has a relatively mild subarctic climate.

A more recent reading was in January 1987 during a chilling cold wave that struck Northern Europe. In spite of it being in the middle of the Scandinavian landmass on such a high latitude and a bit elevated, the winters are somewhat milder than expected, due to the mild North Atlantic air that often raises temperatures.

Use as fuel  Ligroin was used to refuel the world's first production automobile, the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, on a long distance journey between Mannheim and Pforzheim. Bertha Benz added ligroin to the vehicle at a pharmacy in Wiesloch, making it the first filling station in history. The first functional diesel engine could also run on ligroin.Rudolf Diesel: Die Entstehung des Dieselmotors, Springer, Berlin 1913, . p. 110  See also  * White spirit  References  *  Notes  Category:Hydrocarbon solvents Category:Petroleum products ","title":"Ligroin"},{"id":"920735","text":"J√§rpen () is a locality and the seat of √Öre Municipality in J√§mtland County, Sweden with 1,408 inhabitants in 2010.

None of the links to the program are functional, as of that date.  Identifying Martian craters  The original phase ran from November 2000 to September 2001, identifying and classifying the age of craters on Mars images from Viking Orbiter that had already been analyzed by NASA. The goal was to answer two meta-science questions: # Is the public ready, willing, and able to help science? # Does this new way of powering science analysis produce results that are just as good as the traditional way? In February 2001 clickworkers started processing new images from Mars Global Surveyor, surveying small craters never before cataloged. Clickworkers also searched Mars images for \\"honeycomb\\" terrain, although no further images were discovered and it is suspected that this is an illusory feature type. Their analysis might potentially be useful for scientists, although there are no specific plans for using it yet. , new beta tasks were up on the Clickworker site. This time workers were being asked to help catalog Mars landforms in one of two ways. In the first task, high resolution images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are displayed and the volunteers are to stamp areas on the image with appropriate landform types. The second task took a different approach and displayed wider field views from the older MOC camera on Mars Global Surveyor. The landforms on these wider views were then marked, and interesting features ould be tagged for possible future hi-res imaging with HiRISE. As of March 2020 the Clickworker program appeared to be defunct.  New site  In November 2009 it was announced that NASA has developed a new website to allow volunteer users to help in Martian mapping. The site \\"Be a Martian\\" went live on November 17, 2009, and allows users to either map features or count craters on Mars.BBC NEWS  Science & Environment  How to explore Mars and have fun As of March 2020, the \\"Be a Martian\\" website appears to be defunct.

Kronetorpsm√∂llan is an old preserved windmill in Arl√∂v. Here it is shown with a large Transformers banner, since it was the site of the very first Nordic Transformers convention in late 2007, arranged by The Nordic TransFans Association. Arl√∂v () is the seat of Burl√∂v Municipality, Sk√•ne County, Sweden. It is statistically not defined as a locality of its own, but forms part of the contiguous city of Malm√∂, 5 km northeast of downtown Malm√∂. Out of Malm√∂'s 344,000 inhabitants, 11,000 live in Arl√∂v. However, in the 1950s, a public vote took place, deciding once and for all that Burl√∂v Municipality would never be a part of Malm√∂. Overview Arl√∂v is known for its sugar industry, Sockerbolaget AB (owned by the Danish company Danisco). The town was also the home of the AB Svenska J√§rnv√§gsverkst√§derna (Swedish Railway Works) or ASJ, who in the 1970s also built several automobiles for SAAB, notably the Saab Sonett II and III. Arl√∂v Church dates from 1900 and is Neo-Gothic in style; it was built to accommodate the growing congregation. Arl√∂v is mentioned in the song \\"Hanna fr√•n Arl√∂v\\" (\\"Hanna from Arl√∂v\\") by the 1970s Swedish band Nationalteatern. Arl√∂v is also the birthplace of Swedish rock artist Kal P. Dal. The former office building of Danisco Sugar was bought in 2008 by the Church of Scientology who opened their new church, a so-called \\"Ideal org\\" there in 2009.
