The former community of Moscow is located just outside the current city limits of Prescott, Arkansas. The area is on or near the old \\"Moscow-Camden Road\\", or \\"Wire Road\\" which ran between Moscow and Camden, Arkansas. As of 2016, the location was known as the junction of Nevada County Roads 23 and 260.  History  As early as 1810, the community of Moscow had primarily consisted of various small farms and businesses that included several retail shops, two blacksmiths, a post office, a saloon, and a Masonic Lodge. Methodist historians place the church congregations date of origin as early as 1842. The first marked burial in the cemetery dates to 1864, but the deed to the grounds was not issued until 1868, so it appears that the land had been in use for burial and religious purposes well before the property transaction was formalized and recorded. In 1864, the Civil War brought several battles to the area surrounding Moscow during the Red River Campaign and the Camden Expedition. During those conflicts, the Confederate Army of Major General Sterling Price and Brigadier General Thomas Dockery engaged the Union Army of Major General Frederick Steele and Brigadier General John Thayer. The Moscow area was surrounded by historic battles that include: * Engagement at Elkin's Ferry. April 3‚Äì4, 1864. * Skirmish at Prairie D‚ÄôAne. April 9‚Äì13, 1864. * Action at Moscow. April 13, 1864. * Engagement at Poison Spring. April 18, 1864. In 1873, the Cairo and Fulton Railroad was constructed a short distance from Moscow and a new town was laid out alongside the rails. Being on the outskirts of a rapidly growing railroad town, Moscow merchants and businessmen quickly relocated to be alongside the rails and while Prescott grew, Moscow's population began to dwindle. The Citizens of Prescott continued to use Moscow Cemetery as a community burial site until 1880, when the De Ann Cemetery was established and Moscow community disappeared over the course of time. In the years afterwards, Moscow Methodist Church and Cemetery continued serving the Moscow and Prescott area. The church was listed in the minutes of the Little Rock Conference of the Methodist Church into the 1970s and regular services continued until 1989. In December 2003, the Trustees of the Arkansas Conference of the United Methodist Church quit-claimed their interest in the church building and grounds to the Moscow Cemetery Association. Moscow Methodist Church and Cemetery are what remains of the original community; an early settlement and little documented trade center in the Missouri Township, of Nevada County in Southwest Arkansas.

As large Catholic immigrant communities settled in the area in the early 20th century, mostly German and Austrian farmers, the parish outgrew its first church and had the present structure built in 1912.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Arkansas and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The fundraising for constructing the cathedral was done entirely by the Rt. Rev. Henry Niles Pierce, who was the fourth missionary bishop and the first diocesan bishop of Arkansas. He went on preaching tours on the East Coast of the United States, procured private gifts, and mortgaged his own house. The church itself was built in three stages as finances allowed. The nave and the baptistery were completed first and the first service was held in the cathedral on October 19, 1884. On that same date the cathedral was formally established. The transept and crossing were completed in February 1889, and the altar was moved from its original position under the west window to its new position under the north transept window. The structure was finally completed when the chancel was built in time for Easter in 1892. The altar was moved permanently to the east side of the church at that time. The present altar and reredos were carved in Oberammegau and were donated in memory of Frances Blakeslee and Philander Keep Roots in 1924. The Parish House was built in 1951, and the Cathedral House was completed two years later. The Lyman Annex was added to the cathedral complex in 1966 and the Chancellors Hall in 1981. The cathedral itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 1998, when the Very Rev. Henry Lee Hudson was Dean, close to $5 million was spent in renovating the Cathedral proper. The Dean's Hall was erected at this time. The Muller Pipe Organ Co. of Toledo, Ohio installed a 4-manual, 82-rank pipe organ the following year.

Both the spill and the cleanup efforts had effects on the environment. The oil spill was called the \\"worst environmental disaster the US has faced\\" by White House energy adviser Carol Browner. The spill was by far the largest in US history, almost 20 times greater than the usual estimate of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Factors such as petroleum toxicity, oxygen depletion and the use of Corexit are expected to be the main causes of damage. Impact to marine species An oiled gannet seabird getting the oil washed off. Most of the impact was on the marine species. Eight U.S. national parks were threatened and more than 400 species that live in the Gulf islands and marshlands are at risk, including the endangered Kemp's ridley turtle, the green turtle, the loggerhead turtle, the hawksbill turtle, and the leatherback turtle. In the national refuges most at risk, about 34,000 birds were counted, including gulls, pelicans, roseate spoonbills, egrets, terns, and blue herons. A comprehensive 2009 inventory of offshore Gulf species counted 15,700. The area of the spill includes 8,332 species, including more than 1,200 fish, 200 birds, 1,400 molluscs, 1,500 crustaceans, 4 sea turtles, and 29 marine mammals. In a 2011 paper in the journal BioScience, researchers from the University of New Hampshire reported that the spill threatened 39 marine species in addition to the 14 currently under federal protection. Threatened species, the report found, ranged from 'whale sharks to seagrass\\". Also another impact to marine species was the impact to various food chains. With one break in the chain, the rest of the chain could be impacted greatly. Harry Roberts, a professor of Coastal Studies at Louisiana State University, has stated that of oil would be enough to \\"wipe out marine life deep at sea near the leak and elsewhere in the Gulf\\" as well as \\"along hundreds of miles of coastline.\\" Mak Saito, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution indicated that such an amount of oil \\"may alter the chemistry of the sea, with unforeseeable results.\\" Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia indicated that the oil could harm fish directly, and microbes used to consume the oil would reduce oxygen levels in the water. The ecosystem, she said, could require years or decades to recover, as with previous spills. Damage to the ocean floor would endanger the Louisiana pancake batfish in particular, whose range is entirely contained within the area affected by the spill. The actual number of mammal deaths due to the spill may be as much as 50 times higher than the number of recovered carcasses, according to a study published in the Journal Conservation Letters. \\"The Deepwater oil spill was the largest in US history, however, the recorded impact on wildlife was relatively low, leading to suggestions that the environmental damage of the disaster was actually modest. This is because reports have implied that the number of carcasses recovered... equals the number of animals killed by the spill\\" stated Rob Williams from University of British Columbia. Timeline On 22 October 2010, it was reported that miles-long strings of weathered oil had been sighted moving toward marshes on the Mississippi River delta. Hundreds of thousands of migrating ducks and geese spend the winter in this delta. Two years after the Deepwater explosion, migratory birds were found to have carried chemicals from the spill to Minnesota. Preliminary evidence showed the vast majority of the small sample of pelican eggs tested contained \\"petroleum compounds and Corexit\\". As of 2 November 2010, 6,814 dead animals had been collected, including 6,104 birds, 609 sea turtles, 100 dolphins and other mammals, and 1 other reptile. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of death had not been determined as of late June. According to NOAA, since 1 January 2011, 67 dead dolphins had been found in the area affected by the spill, with 35 of them premature or newborn calves. An NOAA study in spring 2012, along with two other studies reported at the same time, suggests that the long-term environmental effects of the spill may have been \\"far more profound than previously thought\\". The joint study by NOAA and BP found \\"many of the 32 dolphins studied were underweight, anemic and suffering from lung and liver disease, while nearly half had low levels of a hormone that helps the mammals deal with stress as well as regulating their metabolism and immune systems\\". Researchers found that some types of spiders and other insects were far less numerous than before the spill. During a January 2013 flyover, former NASA physicist, Bonny Schumaker noted a \\"dearth of marine life\\" in a radius of 30 to 50 miles (50 to 80 km) around the Macondo well. \\"Since the fall of 2011, now about 14 months, I see no turtles, few if any dolphins, few if any rays ... few sharks, few bait balls, all of the things we used to see,\\" she commented. This may mean that the wildlife left the area in search of food. \\"I guess the Gulf of Mexico in these parts is a stinky, dead desert for its previous visitors,\\" Schumaker told NBC news. Three years after the oil spill, the residual effects were still apparent, with tar balls still found on the Mississippi coast, as well as an oil sheen along a coastal marsh, and erosion on an island in Barataria Bay sped up by the death of mangrove trees and marsh grass. Corals In February 26th, federally funded scientists found damage to deep sea coral several miles from the well. Expedition leader and biologist with Penn State University Charles Fisher said there was \\"an abundance of circumstantial data\\" suggesting coral damage is related to the spill. This discovery indicated that the spill's ecological consequences may be greater than was previously officially claimed. \\"The visual data for recent and ongoing death are crystal clear and consistent over at least 30 colonies; the site is close to the Deepwater Horizon; the research site is at the right depth and direction to have been impacted by a deep-water plume, based on NOAA models and empirical data; and the impact was detected only a few months after the spill was contained.\\" In March 2012, definitive link was found between the death of a Gulf coral community the size of half a football field and the spill. The scientists wrote: \\"The presence of recently damaged and deceased corals beneath the path of a previously documented plume emanating from the Macondo well provides compelling evidence that the oil impacted deep-water ecosystems.\\" Effect to Dolphins Striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) In February 2011, the first birthing season for dolphins since the spill, the director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport reported that dead baby dolphins were washing up along the Mississippi and Alabama shorelines at about 10 times the normal number for the first two months of the year. \\"For some reason, they have started aborting or they were dead before they were born; the average is one or two a month. This year we have 17 and February is not even over yet.\\" From mid-January to late March 2011, scientists counted almost 200 dead dolphins in the Gulf, with another 90 in 2010. After investigating the deaths, NOAA put a gag order on the results, saying that the research is part of a criminal investigation of the spill. Numerous independent scientists said they have been \\"personally rebuked by federal officials for speaking out of turn to the media about efforts to determine the cause\\" of the deaths. In April 2011, one year from the onset of the spill, scientists confirmed that they had discovered oil on dead dolphins found along the Gulf Coast. Fifteen of the 406 dolphins that had washed ashore in the last 14 months had oil on their bodies; the oil found on eight of them was linked to the spill. A NOAA spokesperson said it was \\"significant that even a year after the oil spill we are finding oil on the dolphins, the latest just two weeks ago.\\" A NOAA study in the summer of 2011 showed dolphins that came in contact with the petroleum were \\"seriously ill\\" with drastically low weight, low blood sugar and for some, cancer of the liver and lungs. In December 2013, the journal Environmental Science & Technology published a study finding that of 32 dolphins briefly captured from 24-km stretch near southeastern Louisiana, half were seriously ill or dying from liver disease, pneumonia, loss of teeth, and one pregnant female was carrying a dead fetus. The animals compared unfavorably with dolphins from an area of the gulf unaffected by the spill. BP said the report, which was the first study of the spill's impact on dolphins, was ‚Äúinconclusive as to any causation associated with the spill‚Äù. On 12 April 2016, a research team reported that 88 percent of about 360 baby or stillborn dolphins within the spill area \\"had abnormal or under-developed lungs\\", compared to 15 percent in other areas. The study was published in the April 2016 Diseases of Aquatic Organisms. Impact on Marine life \\"Disturbing numbers\\" of mutated fish were seen in the Gulf. Scientists and fishermen are pointing to the spill, the dispersants and chemicals used in its cleanup as the cause of these deformities which include shrimp born without eyes, fish with lesions, fish with oozing sores and, according to a local fisherwoman, \\"We are also finding eyeless crabs, crabs with their shells soft instead of hard, full grown crabs that are one-fifth their normal size, clawless crabs, and crabs with shells that don't have their usual spikes ... they look like they've been burned off by chemicals\\". The dispersants are known to be mutagenic. In Barataria Bay, Louisiana, an area \\"heavily impacted by oil and dispersants\\", 50% of shrimp were found lacking eyes and eye sockets. Another lifelong fisher-woman reported seeing \\"fish without covers over their gills and others with large pink masses hanging off their eyes and gills\\". A 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna, published in the journal Science, found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil. Prior to the spill, approximately 0.1% of Gulf fish had lesions or sores. A report from the University of South Florida said that many locations showed 20% of fish with lesions, and later expeditions some as high as 50%. A 2014 paper in the journal Science found that toxins released by the oil spill killed fish by causing cardiac arrest. The study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats. The study was conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as part of the federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment process required by the Oil Pollution Act. It focused on tuna partly because the spill occurred in an area where Atlantic bluefin tuna were spawning. The effects were considered especially problematic for fish embryos and early developing fish, because the heartbeat changes could affect the development of other organs, including the lungs and liver. BP disputed the study, raising questions about the study and the use of its findings in the damage assessment process. Another peer-reviewed study, released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that tuna and amber jack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs. BP responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the Gulf, but The New York Times reported that the BP statement was contradicted by the study. Methane Oceanographer John Kessler estimated that the crude gushing from the well contained approximately 40% methane by weight, compared to about 5% found in typical oil deposits. Methane can potentially suffocate marine life and create dead zones where oxygen is depleted. Oceanographer Dr. Ian MacDonald believes that the natural gas dissolving below the surface has the potential to reduce the Gulf oxygen levels and emit benzene and other toxic compounds. Entry to the food chain Signs of an oil-and-dispersant mix were found under the shells of tiny blue crab larvae in the Gulf by researchers at Tulane University in 2010. This finding indicated that the use of dispersants had broken the oil into droplets small enough to easily enter the food chain. Marine biologists found \\"orange blobs\\" under the shells of crab larvae in \\"almost all\\" of the larvae collected from over of coastline stretching from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Pensacola, Florida. According to a March 2012 study, spilled oil entered the ocean's food chain through zooplankton. Dr. Michael Roman of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science stated \\"traces of oil in the zooplankton prove that they had contact with the oil and the likelihood that oil compounds may be working their way up the food chain\\". Alabama researchers in July 2012 found that dispersants may have killed microscopic plankton and disrupted the food chain. Scientists commenting on the study, published in PLOS ONE, said it pointed toward \\"major future effects of the spill\\". One scientist called its findings \\"scary, though limited because the experiments spanned only five days\\". Carbon isotopic evidence has revealed that oil from the disaster has entered the bodies of land animals and birds (terrestrial fauna) leading to a reduction in the reproductive success of some species. Toxicity from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons Terry Wade of Texas A&M; University, Steven Lohrenz of the University of Southern Mississippi and the Stennis Space Center found evidence of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are often linked to oil spills, and include carcinogens and chemicals that pose various risks to human health, as deep as and as far away as in May 2010, and said it likely worsened as more oil spilled. The PAHs can kill animals immediately, in high enough concentrations, and can lead to cancer. \\"From the time that these observations were made, there was an extensive release of additional oil and dispersants at the site. Therefore, the effects on the deep sea ecosystem may be considerably more severe than supported by the observations reported here,\\" the researchers wrote in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. PAH's, they said, include a group of compounds, with different types at different depths. \\"It is possible they dissipate quickly, but no one has yet showed this\\". In September 2010, Oregon State University researchers found sharply heightened levels of chemicals in the waters off the coast of Louisiana in August 2010, the last sampling date, even after the well was capped one month prior. Near Grand Isle, Louisiana, the team discovered that PAH remained at levels 40 times higher than before the spill. The PAH's were most concentrated in the area near the Louisiana Coast, but levels also jumped 2‚Äì3 fold in other spill- affected areas off Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. As of August 2010, PAH levels remained near those discovered while the spill was still flowing heavily. Kim Anderson, a professor of environmental and molecular toxicology, said that based on the findings of other researchers, she suspected that the abundant use of dispersants by BP increased the bio-availability of the PAHs. \\"There was a huge increase of PAHs that are bio-available to the organisms ‚Äì and that means they can essentially be uptaken by organisms throughout the food chain.\\" Dr. Jim Cowan of Louisiana State University's Department of Oceanography and Coastal Sciences, believes PAHs, weathered from leaked oil on the seabed, are likely the cause of the mutations. A 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna, published in the journal Science, clarifying the mechanics by which PAH kill fish, found that the toxins from oil spills can cause irregular heartbeats leading to cardiac arrest. It found that PAHs block signaling pathways that allow potassium and calcium ions to flow in and out of cardiac cell membranes and sustain normal heart rates, and that even very low concentrations of crude oil can disrupt these signaling pathways, slowing fish heartbeats. The study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill. Impact on beaches Workers cleaning up a beach during Deepwater Horizon oil spill The oil from the disaster affected between 622 and 1300 miles of the United States coastline around the Gulf of Mexico and has acutely catalyzed the erosion of land due to the oil having led to the death of most of the marsh vegetation (flora). A 2012 study of the sands of the contaminated beaches and marshes showed that the variety of organisms, one of the lowest links in the food chain, had dropped dramatically since the spill. The remaining species are believed to be those that favor polluted conditions and that consume hydrocarbons. This could result in long-lasting effects to the ecosystem. The lead author said, \\"We went from this very diverse community with an abundance of different organisms to this really (impoverished) community that was really dominated by a couple of fungal species\\". The authors also expressed concerns that trace minerals and metals such as mercury and arsenic deposited by the oil may cause harm to both wildlife and humans. The use of dispersant made oil sink faster and more deeply into the beaches, and possibly groundwater supplies, according to a November 2012 a study released by Florida State University and Utrecht University in the Netherlands. The researchers found that Corexit 9500A allowed the PAHs to permeate sand where, due to a lack of sunlight, degradation is slowed. Impact due to clean-up The oil clean-up itself caused damage to the fragile environment. Environmentalists and oil spill veterans warned that the various rushed, sometimes untested and unnecessary methods being used in the clean-up was \\"wreaking havoc\\". \\"Absolutely nothing you do to respond to an oil spill is without impacts of its own,\\" said the EPA's Lisa P. Jackson. In Orange Beach Alabama, beach erosion and disruption of plant and animal life-cycles continued into 2011, despite repeated requests by the mayor and other local officials to leave the area. Clean-up crews deterred tourists from visiting local hotels and beaches due to an increase in criminal activity caused by the influx of clean-up workers.  Impact on vegetation  Studies of vegetation death and accelerated marsh erosion following Deepwater Horizon oil spill have shown that both of these impacts (or ‚Äúinjuries,‚Äù when assessing natural resource damages) can be related to the percent of oiling on the stems of marsh vegetation. Spatial quantification of these injuries thus relies on estimates of how many kilometers of shoreline fell into each of the four stem oiling categories on which these injury determinations were based (0-10%, 10-50%, 50-90%, 90-100%). The total length of the Louisiana coastline under mainland herbaceous marsh that was oiled was estimated to be 1,161 km, with 29% (334 km) falling into the two upper classes of stem oiling (i.e. > 50% stem oiling).  Remaining oil in the water  In August 2010, scientists had determined as up to 79% of the spilled oil remained in the Gulf of Mexico, under the surface. In March 2011, it was reported that thousands of pounds of oil and dispersant were collected each day from highly visible resort areas and that were collected from a beach in Alabama after a winter storm. A Coast Guard report released on 17 December 2010, said that little oil remained on the sea floor except within a mile and a half (2.5 km) of the well. The report said that since 3 August 2010, only 1% of water and sediment samples had pollution above EPA-recommended limits. Charlie Henry of NOAA warned even small amounts of oil could cause \\"latent, long-term chronic effects\\". Ian R. MacDonald of Florida State University said even where the government claimed to find little oil, \\"We went to the same place and saw a lot of oil. In our samples, we found abundant dead animals.\\" After Hurricane Isaac in September 2012, about 565,000 pounds of oiled material traced to the spill was brought to land. This was a greater amount than had been collected in the eight months prior. The Louisiana Coastal Protection Agency criticized BP and the USCG clean-up efforts, calling for more resources to deal with the roughly of oil believed to remain below water. Huge tar mats were also uncovered during the storm, prompting beach closures. Although some researchers thought that the damage from the spill would rapidly resolve, three years into the recovery dolphins continue to die, fish are showing strange lesions, corals in the gulf have died and oil still remains in some marsh areas.Three years after BP oil spill, USF research finds massive die-off  Tampa Bay Times Due to both its size and the way it was handled, there is little previous research to predict long-term effects. At the 2013 \\"Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference\\", oceanographer David Hollander presented data that showed as much as one-third of the oil released during the spill may still be in the gulf. Researchers described a phenomenon called \\"dirty blizzard\\": oil caused deep ocean sediments to clumped together, falling to the ocean floor at ten times the normal rate in an \\"underwater rain of oily particles\\". The result could have long-term effects on both humans and marine life. Commercially fished species feed on sediment creatures, meaning oil could remain in the food chain for generations. Concern was expressed for commercially fished species such as tilefish which burrow in the sediment and feed on sediment dwelling creatures.Nature news report In 2013, researchers found that a tiny amoeba-like creatures, foraminifera, that live in sediment and form the bottom of the gulf food chain, have died off in the areas that were affected by the underwater plumes that stretched out miles beyond the spill site. The foraminifera have returned in some areas but in other areas they have burrowed into the sediments, stirring them up all over again. Noting that it took several years for the herring population to crash following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the researchers expressed concerns that it may also take years for long-terms effects to become apparent in the gulf.

His shrine in Pirana Pir Dargah, English Bazar (Gaur), Malda, West Bengal, India, attracts hundreds of thousands of devotees every year. Akhi Siraj‚Äôs followers and admirers called him ƒÄainae-Hind, translating to \\"Mirror of India\\", from NizƒÅmuddƒ´n AuliyƒÅ(1238 ‚Äì 3 April 1325), a legendary Sufi saint of the Chishti Order in the Indian Subcontinent. As one of the first disciples of NizƒÅmuddƒ´n AuliyƒÅ, he spent long years with him. His successor Alaul Haq Pandavi is credited with the rise to prominence of the Chishti order in Bengal. Education As a young man, Siraj travelled to Delhi and studied under prominent Sufi personalities. He was educated in the Islamic sciences by Sheikh Fakhruddin Zarradi, a great scholar and senior khalifa of Nizamuddin Auliya. He sought the permission of Nizamuddin to educate him and promised to make him an Alim (scholar) within a mere six months. Akhi Siraj later took lessons from Maulana Ruknuddin, studying Kafiah, Mufassal, Quduri and Majma'a-ul Bahrain. Amir Khurd, a disciple and biographer of Nizamuddin Auliya as well as the author of Siyar-ul-Auliya, also participated in these lessons. He completed his studies in a short period of time and became an accomplished scholar, such was his zeal for learning. Khilafat Having finished his course, he was led into the presence of Nizamuddin Auliya who tested his knowledge. Delighted with him, Nizamuddin conferred his khirqa (initiatory cloak) and khilafat (successorship) upon him and gave him the name Aina-i-Hindustan (mirror of India). Later life After his khilafat, he remained in Delhi in the company of his spiritual mentor. He would also return to his native Lakhnauti once a year to see his mother. He remained in the company of his teacher for four years and during this period he devoted his time to further study until the demise of Nizamuddin, who ordered him to return to Bengal to preach prior to his death. He was at the bedside of his master when he died in 1325 AD. He stayed in Delhi until 1328‚Äì1329 at which point he departed for Lakhnauti after the sultan, Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1325-1351), ordered the forced migration of residents from Delhi to Daulatabad. After settling down in Lakhnauti, he established a huge langar (kitchen) where free food was distributed to the poor and destitute. He also brought some valuable books along with him from the library of Nizamuddin and these books formed the nucleus of the first Chishti khanqah in Bengal. Soon after Akhi Siraj's arrival in Pandua, Alaul Haq Pandavi became his disciple. Various relations of Ala ul-Haq were prominent in the government of sultan Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah and prior to living the modest life of a Sufi, he had also been part of the elite. Such was his love and devotion to Akhi Siraj that when they travelled, like Jalaluddin Tabrizi before him, he would carry a cauldron of hot food on his head even though it would burn his hair, so that he could provide his master with warm food on demand. He lived and worked in Bengal for the rest of his life and he also married. One of his daughters later married his disciple, Ala ul-Haq. Amir Khurd, his fellow student, said that he won great esteem from the people of Bengal and \\"illumined the whole region with his spiritual radiance.\\" Demise & Burial Place In 1357, Akhi Siraj passed away and was buried in a suburb of Lakhnauti called Sadullahpur. It is said that he buried the khirqa (robes) that he had received from Sheikh Nizamuddin Auliya in the north-western corner of the Sagar Dighi (reservoir) at Lakhnauti. He was interred near his buried robes according to his wishes, and a mausoleum was erected over his grave. The date of construction of the mausoleum is not known, but two inscriptions attached to its gateways show that they were erected in the 16th century by Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah and Sultan Nasiruddin Nusrat Shah. He was succeeded by his khalifa, Alaul Haq Pandavi. His Urs is commemorated annually on Eid ul-Fitr (1st and 2nd Shawwaal). His tomb is still visited by many today.

It was renovated in 1979, on the occasion of the two hundredth anniversary of the start of its original construction. An eternal flame is kept burning at the church, in atonement for a 14th-century murder. Exactly what murder is a matter of some confusion: it may be the 1357 murder of Heinrich Stucki by his neighbour Konrad Mueller, or another in which two brothers named Tschudi quarreled and one killed the other. In any case, someone deeded walnut oil from trees on two parcels of his land to be supplied to keep the flame burning. Later the deed was changed to make this into a payment of CHF70 per year, a condition which was attached to the land title in the local registry. Legally speaking, this condition was lost in 1911 during registry reforms, but owners of the land continued to pay it over the course of the next century, until 2012 when the new landowner refused the obligation and the church took him to court to dispute his non-payment.

Kiev 1900 It was in result of the active efforts of Naumenko that the magazine in 1898 received a permission on publication of fiction in Ukrainian language and creation of Ukrainian printshop; two years later there was opened a bookstore of \\"Kievan Past\\". The journalistic activity of Naumenko was tied and with other periodicals: at the end of 1870 - start of 1880 he worked with the newspaper \\"Labor\\" (), in 1898 took part in creation of newspaper \\"Kiev responses\\" (), in 1905-06 along with I.Luchytsky established newspaper \\"Liberty and right\\" (), a publishing body of the Kiev Committee of Constitutional Democratic Party. At the end of 1906 he attained a certificate on the right to publish in Kiev a magazine \\"Ukraine\\" () which had to become successor of Kievan Past, however the publication was terminated already at the end of 1907. Pedagogical activity For many years Volodymyr Naumenko was a teacher of gymnasium teaching literature in the 2nd Kiev Gymnasium (1880), the State Female Gymnasium of St. Olga (1883), Collegiate of Pavel Galagan, Kiev Funduklei Gymnasium (1889), Vladimir Cadet Corps (1893). For his work he received multiple awards such as the Order of St Anna (IV, 1883), Order of St Stanislaus (II, 1886), Order of St Ana (II, 1893), Order of St Vladimir (IV, 1897). On February 28, 1898 Naumenko was granted a title of Merited Teacher. Volodymyr Naumenko entered history of Ukrainian Pedagogy not only as a brilliant practical teacher, but also as an experienced Methodist-innovator and theoretic. Almost annually he was receiving invitation from various regional governments to head teacher summer courses and he never refused. Naumenko systematically was conducting methodic classes with pedagogues of Sunday school of the Kiev Grammar Society serving as its chairman in 1897-1907. For many years he was being invited to check knowledge of pupils of Kiev orphanages. These kind of examinations Naumenko was transforming into exemplary classes not only for students, but primarily for teachers and educators. In the Vernadsky Institute of manuscripts are preserved the text of lectures from different years that Volodymyr Naumenko read to teachers of people's schools. He constantly was expressing his conviction that the most effective school education may exist only when it is conducted in the native language.

May 28, 926Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.Academia Sinica Chinese- Western Calendar Converter.) was an official of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period state Later Tang (and Later Tang's predecessor state Jin. He was credited with making sure that the campaigns of Later Tang's founding emperor Emperor Zhuangzong (Li Cunxu) was well-financed, but his methods of extracting funds from the people were also said to be so exacting that the people eventually became resentful of Emperor Zhuangzong, helping to lead to Emperor Zhuangzong's downfall.  Background  It is not known when Kong Qian was born, but it is known that he was from Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 26. At some point prior to the surrender of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered at Wei Prefecture) to Jin in 915 ‚Äî i.e., at a time when Tianxiong belonged to Jin's archrival Later Liang ‚Äî Kong became the accounting officer at Wei Prefecture. He thus became a Jin subject when Tianxiong became a Jin possession then. He was said to be diligent and good at managing the books.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269.  During Jin  After Tianxiong became Jin possession, Jin's prince Li Cunxu personally assumed the title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianxiong. Apparently impressed with Kong Qian's abilities, Li made him the officer in charge of the treasury. It was said that Kong flattered the prince and carefully cultivated relationships with powerful individuals, such that he became increasingly powerful. For the next eight years (until 923, when Later Liang fell), as the Jin and Later Liang forces battled on the Yellow River border, it was said that despite Tianxiong's war-ravaged status, Kong made sure that the Jin army never lacked money or food, but as a result of his high taxations and other means of wresting wealth from the people, the people of Tianxiong came to bear a heavy resentment for the prince.  During Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong) at Wei Prefecture (which he renamed Xingtang Municipality (). As part of the orders commissioning various officers to imperial offices, he was considering whom to name as the director of material pricing (ÁßüÂ∫∏‰Ωø, Zuyongshi) ‚Äî i.e., the official in charge of the key functions of taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies. Kong Qian considered himself capable and suitable for the position, but the popular sentiment among the officials at the time was that Kong was of too lowly birth and had insufficient previous accomplishments to serve in such a post, so Emperor Zhuangzong's chief of staff Guo Chongtao recommended the senior officer Zhang Xian () to serve in that office, with Kong serving as his deputy. This displeased Kong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Later in the year, Emperor Zhuangzong, in a surprise attack, captured the Later Liang capital Daliang. The Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang and allowing Later Tang to take control of Later Liang territory, and Emperor Zhuangzong subsequently made Luoyang his capital, designating Xingtang as the eastern capital. Shortly after, Kong, wanting to get Zhang out of the role of supervising him, went to see Guo, and suggested that Zhang would be suitable for the important role of defender of Xingtang, by emphasizing Xingtang's importance and that Zhang was the only suitable person for that position. Guo agreed and recommended Zhang to be Xingtang's defender. However, instead of becoming director of material pricing as Kong expected, Kong remained deputy, with the chancellor Doulu Ge assuming the director of material pricing office as an additional office, again disappointing Kong. In 924, Kong argued to Guo that because Doulu's position as chancellor already required him to carry out many duties, his work as the director of material pricing was getting backlogged. He further showed Guo a note that suggested that Doulu was misappropriating treasury funds. When Guo brought this matter with Doulu, Doulu became fearful and offered the office to Guo. Guo declined. When Emperor Zhuangzong asked Guo for an alternative recommendation, Guo again recommended Zhang, and Emperor Zhuangzong thus initially issued an order summoning Zhang from Xingtang to serve as director of material pricing. This displeased Kong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. and Zhang's morally upright nature was also causing concern among other officials. Kong thus went to Doulu with an alternative idea: Doulu mentioned this idea to Guo, and Guo subsequently suggested to Emperor Zhuangzong to leave Zhang at Xingtang. Instead, Wang was made the director of imperial pricing, again with Kong as his deputy. This was a situation Kong preferred, as he saw Wang as weak and apprehensive and therefore someone that he could control. Meanwhile, Kong was concentrating his efforts on gathering tax revenue so that he could use the revenues to make the emperor and other powerful individuals happy. Indeed, it was said that whatever taxes Emperor Zhuangzong might have ordered exempted in his edicts, Kong disregarded the exemptions and collected the taxes anyway, such that the emperor's edicts lost credibility. Further, when the people, as they were allowed to, submitted silk in lieu of money for taxes, Kong would have the silk assessed at lower value than it actually was, thus causing the people more grief. By fall 924, Kong was displeased that he was still just deputy director of material pricing, and therefore often criticized Wang before Guo. He further bribed Emperor Zhuangzong's favorite actors and eunuchs, hoping that they would help intercede with the emperor for him. However, he was not successful at that time at replacing Wang. In anger, he offered to resign, and Emperor Zhuangzong, believing that he was trying to dodge responsibility, was so angry that he considered arresting Kong, only relenting when one of his favorite actors, Jing Jin (), interceded on Kong's behalf. When Wang suffered a stroke later in the year, Kong was finally made director of material pricing, with the former Later Liang official Kong Xun serving as his deputy. As described in the Zizhi Tongjian: Meanwhile, by 925, the central part of the Later Tang realm, including Xingtang, was suffering from a major famine. The elite Yinqiang corps from Xingtang, who served as Emperor Zhuangzong's personal guard corps, were already resentful because Emperor Zhuangzong had not delivered on the promise that they would be heavily rewarded with wealth after he destroyed Later Liang. In this famine, their family members, who remained at Xingtang, suffered greatly, and many starved, despite Kong Qian's efforts to have food delivered to Xingtang and distributed to the soldiers' families, leading to many soldiers resenting him. By spring 926, particularly after Emperor Zhuangzong executed Guo and another major general, Zhu Youqian, without good cause, the Later Tang realm became overrun with mutinies.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. In summer 926, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in battle at Luoyang in one of those mutinies, and one of the rebel leaders, Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan, quickly arrived at Luoyang and assumed (for that time) the title of regent. (He would later take the throne as Emperor Mingzong.) Believing that Kong was responsible for causing suffering for both soldiers and civilians, he ordered Kong be executed, and ended the regulations that Kong promulgated that he considered overly harsh. He also abolished the office of director of material pricing, redivided the directorate's responsibilities among three agencies in charge of taxation, treasury, and monopolies (i.e., to the state it was before Later Liang consolidated those responsibilities into a single office), and returned to the chancellors.

Early life and career Stevens was born on 26 October 1876 in Prahran, Melbourne, Australia to Horace Stevens, a dentist and Fanny Stevens (n√©e Gittins), a homemaker. In 1884, at the age of 8, he joined the All Saints Grammar School and Anglican Church in St Kilda, where he sang in the choir. The choir was being trained in singing for the 1891 opening of St Paul's Cathedral. Climbing up the ranks, Stevens became a lay clerk in 1898 and a few years later, as a temporary choirmaster. He resigned from the choir in 1949. An apprentice to his father, the younger Stevens was also a dentist for twenty years. He worked as his father's dental clinic, which was situated in Collins Street, Melbourne. Stevens served as an army officer during the First World War, during which he attained the title of Honorary Lieutenant. He served on HMAT Medic, A7. In 1918, Stevens was invalided to England. After performing impromptu at a caf√© in London, he was persuaded by Sir Henry Wood to give up dentistry and take up singing as a career. In 1919, Stevens made his debut as an opera singer in Elijah with the Queen's Hall Orchestra, in which he sang the title role. His performance received positive comment, with Sir Edward Elgar dubbing him as the \\"best Elijah\\" of the period. Stevens went on to perform at many major music festivals in the UK and the United States. He returned to Australia in 1934. He also appeared with the British National Opera Company as Wotan and other Wagnerian roles.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, vol. VIII, p. 84 In his later years, Stevens gave music lessons at the University of Melbourne from 1938 (four years after his return from Britain to Australia) until his death in 1950. Personal life An undefeated champion sculler until his retirement at 35, Stevens was also an active marksman and tennis player. A member of the London and Melbourne Savage Clubs, he was said to be a Bohemian. On 26 August 1905, Stevens married Nellie Chapman, who died in 1931. On 5 December 1934, Stevens married Australian builder and constructor Ella Elizabeth Hallam (n√©e Davis) at Scots' Church, Melbourne. They had three sons. Death and legacy On 18 November 1950, Stevens died of an unanticipated coronary occlusion-caused heart attack at his house in South Yarra, Melbourne. His death was said to have been \\"sudden\\".

In 1929 the two quarries on Rollstone Hill began removing the final section of the hill between them where the Rollstone boulder was perched. At the urging of state representative Louis N. M. Des Chenes, the mayor of Fitchburg, Joseph N. Carriere, forced the quarries to halt operations so the boulder could be removed. The plans for moving the boulder were fairly simple as all that seemed to be holding the stone together was the iron band encircling it. The plan was to remove this band and the subsequent pieces the boulder crumbled into were to be moved to a small triangular traffic island in downtown Fitchburg to be reassembled. Lines and numbers were painted on the Rollstone Boulder and it was meticulously photographed and drawn so that it could be reassembled exactly the same as it was before the move. After all this planning and documentation, when the iron band was removed the boulder did not fall apart. It took multiple blasts with black powder to even crack the stone. After it was broken into smaller pieces, they were all transported to its new home. J. Marc Leblanc, a local stonemason, was given the task of reassembling the Rollstone Boulder. The tough job was made even tougher due to streetcars going by the work site jarring loose stones after they had already been placed. After months of work and all of the money the city had put aside for the project was exhausted, Leblanc could not reassemble it. Out of money and out of time the project was transferred to a special committee headed by U. S. Senator Marcus A. Coolidge. The committee, state representative Des Chenes, and Leblanc decided the best way to go forward with restoring the boulder would be to discard the inside and only reassemble the exterior portion of the stone. Des Chenes explains, \\"We just used the outside and tied the parts together with iron rods ... We drilled holes and hooked the rods to the insides of the rock. After the shell of the boulder was fixed in place, Leblanc poured in concrete and filled it up.\\" The Rollstone Boulder in 2012 After the reconstruction, the Rollstone Boulder appeared the same as it did before and is in the same orientation as when it was on Rollstone hill. In 1930 a plaque was attached to the boulder by the Fitchburg Historical society, which stated: The plaque is misleading as the Rollstone Boulder was not brought from Mt. Monadnock, just somewhere in central New Hampshire, there was no popular subscription to save it, and no citizens of Fitchburg were asked to raise money for its move.  Geology  The Rollstone Boulder is a granite glacial erratic described by Peter Cristofono in his article \\"Minerals of Rollstone Hill\\" as being composed of \\"porphyritic Kinsman quartz monzonite.\\" The phenocrysts in the boulder are plainly visible large white feldspar crystals.Cristofono, Peter.

It was likely moved to Fitchburg from central New Hampshire, as there are ridges located in and near the towns of Bradford and Warner that are of the same composition as the stone.

He lost his first preliminary match by an ippon and a sode tsurikomi goshi (sleeve lifting and pulling hip throw) to Azerbaijan's Movlud Miraliyev. Because his opponent advanced further into the semi-finals, Azzoun offered another shot for the bronze medal by entering the repechage rounds. He was defeated in his first match by Georgia's Levan Zhorzholiani, who successfully scored an ippon and a kuzure kami shiho gatame (seven mat holds), at three minutes and fifty-four seconds.

Poverty in New Zealand deals with the incidence of relative poverty in New Zealand and its measurement. Between 1982 and 2011, New Zealand's gross domestic product grew by 35%. Almost half of that increase went to a small group who were already the richest in the country. During this period, the average income of the top 10% of earners in New Zealand (those earning more than $72,000) almost doubled going from $56,300 to $100,200. The average income of the poorest tenth increased by only 13% from $9700 to $11,000. Growing inequality is confirmed by Statistics New Zealand which keeps track of income disparity using the P80/20 ratio. This ratio shows the difference between high household incomes (those in the 80th percentile) and low household incomes (those in the 20th percentile). The inequality ratio increased between 1988 and 2004, and decreased until the onset of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, increasing again to 2011 and then declining again from then. By 2013, the disposable income of high-income households was more than two-and-a-half times larger than that of low-income households. Highlighting the disparity, the top 1% of the population now owns 16% of the country's wealth ‚Äì the richest 5% owns 38% ‚Äì while half the population, including State beneficiaries and pensioners, receive less than $24,000.  Poverty  In the 21st century concern has been growing that an increasing number of New Zealanders, especially children, have been pushed into poverty where poverty is defined in income terms as households living at below 60% of the national median income. In 2005, an international report found that one in six children in New Zealand were being raised in poverty ‚Äì making New Zealand children 23rd poorest out of 26 rich nations. In 2009 according to NCCSS, over half a million New Zealanders, including 163,000 children were living in poverty. The Expert Advisory Group established by the Children's Commissioner found that the number of children falling below the threshold has continued to grow. In 2013, around 265,000 children, a quarter of all children in New Zealand, were now \\"mired in poverty\\". Statistics New Zealand also publishes a range of data on the economic well-being of New Zealanders and, in 2012, released a discussion paper highlighting the need for government agreement on the development of more useful criteria and statistics related to poverty. Currently the information that is collected is 'static data' ‚Äì it shows the percentage of citizens below a certain level of income. But New Zealand is unique among western OECD countries in that it does not collect 'dynamic' data which captures the extent to which people move in and out of poverty. In 2013 over a dozen different reports were released which focused on the issue and the need to develop agreed ways of describing and measuring poverty. However, the National Government resisted these attempts maintaining that \\"endless arguments about definition and measurement are a waste of time\\". Because of the Government's reluctance to define and measure the problem, in 2012 Children's Commissioner Dr Russell Wills, established an expert advisory group which produced a comprehensive report, called Solutions to Child Poverty in New Zealand: Evidence for Action which contains 78 recommendations to combat poverty. Dr Wills also set up the Child Poverty Monitor to highlight the living conditions of children in New Zealand on an ongoing basis.  Growth in numbers on welfare  Factors contributing to the growth in inequality include substantial cuts in the top income tax rate in 1986-88 combined with a surge in unemployment caused by Rogernomics and the stock market crash of 1987 which pushed more people onto welfare. Then in 1991, benefits were also cut back substantially as part of the reforms and those on welfare have been struggling ever since. Professor Jonathan Boston of Victoria University says nearly 20% of poorer households in New Zealand now depend on welfare benefits. He says the growing gap between rich and poor enables the rich to \\"exercise disproportionate political influence\\", and that \\"if disadvantaged citizens are not to be excluded from political life, they must have access to education, healthcare and social assistance\\". British epidemiologists, Richard Pickett and Kate Wilkinson, argue that inequality is damaging for everyone in society, not just the poor. They say that when the gap between the top and the bottom levels of society becomes too wide, this erodes trust and empathy between citizens leading to alienation and social fragmentation. This exacerbates a multitude of health and social problems such as high infant mortality, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime and imprisonment.  Impact on social indicators  In 2014, Pickett and Wilkinson were invited to Auckland and Dunedin to discuss the relevance of their research to New Zealand. They argued that as inequality in New Zealand has grown, there has been a dramatic increase in the youth suicides, although in contrast, recent Department of Health data shows that the age-standardised suicide rate decreased by 19.5% from the peak rate of 15.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 1998 to 12.2 deaths per 100,000 population in 2012. The proliferation of food banks increased dramatically; and the number of families and children living in poverty has increased. However serious crimes causing injury and death decreased by 20% between 2012 and 2014, whilst assaults decreased by 3% over the same period. At the same time, health care spending has increased. In 2011 Health spending accounted for 10% of GDP, higher than the OECD average of 9.3%. As in many OECD countries, health spending in New Zealand slowed post- GFC but still reached 3% in real terms in 2010 and 2011 ‚Äì higher than the OECD average. in 2012 New Zealand has 2.7 doctors per 1,000 population, and increase from 2.2 in the year 2000. Wealth inequality in New Zealand, measured by the Gini coefficient, stands at 0.34 as of June 2019. In 2012, life expectancy at birth in New Zealand stood at 81.5 years, more than one year higher than the OECD average of 80.2 years.  Impact on growth  In December 2014, the OECD released the Global Income Inequality Report which said \\"[r]ising inequality is estimated to have knocked more than 10 percentage points off growth in ...New Zealand\\" between 1990 and 2010. The paper found no evidence that redistributive policies, such as taxes and social benefits, harm economic growth, provided these policies are well designed, targeted and implemented. It concluded that \\"focusing exclusively on growth and assuming that its benefits will automatically trickle down to the different segments of the population may undermine growth in the long run.\\"  See also  * Homelessness in New Zealand References New Zealand ","title":"Poverty in New Zealand"},{"id":"38006382","text":"Cloudmachine was an eclectic indie rock band hailing from the Netherlands, founded by songwriter and composer Ruud Houweling (Alphen aan den Rijn, July 29, 1968) who fronts the band, singing and playing guitar.Dutch wikipedia Ruud Houweling Other band members were: Marco Kuypers (keyboards), Mike Coolen (drums), Richard Lagerweij (guitars) and Ray Edgar Duyns (bass).

The title refers to a nickname of the protagonist Zhan Zhao (the nickname can also be translated as \\"Imperial Cat\\"). Plot During the Song dynasty, after the upright prefect Bao Zheng executed Pang Yu for embezzlement, the grand tutor Pang Ji sent assassins to avenge his son's death. A chivalrous man, Zhan Zhao the \\"Southern Hero\\", saved Bao and was conferred the title \\"King Cat\\" by the emperor.

The real criminal, however, was Hua Chong the \\"Flowery Butterfly\\", who had been involved with the treacherous grand tutor and his daughter Consort Pang, as well as a few Taoist priests in a plot to overthrow the dynasty. Hua tried to rape Ding, but fled after Zhan stopped him. Ding informed Zhan of Bai's guilt, so Zhan went to the island occupied by Lu Fang the \\"Sky-Penetrating Rat\\" and his four sworn brothers to arrest Bai, but was trapped under a fish pond. Ding Yuehua and his two brothers Ding Zhaolan and Ding Zhaohui arrived later looking for Zhan, and Zhan escaped from the trap. Finally Zhan discovered that Bai was not the rapist, and Jiang remembered overhearing a plot by Hua to rape Princess Yong'an during her visit to a monastery. The heroes and gallants arrived in the monastery to rescue the princess, only to discover it was filled with rebellious priests.

It is a two-story wood frame structure, finished with wooden clapboards and topped by a gable roof with a small belfry. Decoration is relatively plain, with pilastered corners, a plain entablature along the side walls, and transom windows above the pair of entrances on the main facade. Built in 1870, it is the oldest surviving building in Springdale. It was used for many years as both a church (by multiple denominations) and the local Masonic lodge. By the late 1920s it had been abandoned by all of these users, and was acquired in 1932 by the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), which used it as its lodge. The IOOF chapter deeded the building to the city in 2005. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

Background In October 1881, Dvo≈ô√°k was working on his new opera Dimitrij, when it was announced in a Viennese newspaper that the Hellmesberger Quartet was going to premiere a new Dvo≈ô√°k string quartet on 15 December 1881. Deciding to temporarily abandon work on the opera to concentrate on the quartet, Dvo≈ô√°k completed the first movement in three days before abandoning the quartet around 10 October 1881 and starting again, this time in the key of C major on 25 October 1881. It is unclear why this happened; Terry Barfoot speculates that Dvo≈ô√°k felt the completed movement lacked tension. Geijtenbeek claims that Dvo≈ô√°k believed at the time that it was impossible to write a quartet in F major (Dvo≈ô√°k was to later write his 12th String Quartet in the same key). Writing in The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet Jan Smaczny states that the completed movement is inferior to the C major quartet Dvo≈ô√°k completed.

The episode was directed and written by series creator Kurt Sutter. The episode originally aired on November 26, 2008 in the United States, and garnered 2.4 million viewers. Plot Jax consoles Opie, who blames his choice to return to SAMCRO for Donna's death. Jax visits Tara at the hospital to check in on her and she breaks down, guilty over Kohn's murder and unsure about her future with Jax. She tells Jax of her plans to leave Charming, and he accuses her of using him to do her dirty work. Jax assures Tara that she is the only one he's ever loved. Gemma consoles a guilt- ridden Clay, but orders him to put on a strong face for his men. Opie's father Piney is eager to hit the One-Niners as 'revenge' for Donna's death, and demands satisfaction from Clay. Piney drives up to Oakland and demands a meeting with Laroy Wayne, and Clay sends Jax, Chibs, and Half-Sack after him to prevent him from making any messes. Wayne assures them that the Niners had nothing to do with Donna's killing. Bobby's lawyer Rosen warns Clay that Brenan Hefner's mistress is preparing to testify against Bobby and Opie, and Clay blackmails Elliott Oswald into helping SAMCRO figure out her identity so that they can silence her. Hale begs Unser to help him take down the club, but Unser flatly refuses, encouraging Hale to let the bikers serve their own justice. Hale reaches out to Jax and tells him that he suspects that Clay is guilty of ordering Opie's murder. Jax confronts Clay and demands the truth, but Clay lies and tells Jax to put it out of his mind for the good of SAMCRO. As Jax leaves the club, Juice informs him that Hefner's mistress is a 17-year old girl, and Jax rushes off to prevent her assassination. He stops Happy, Chibs, and Tig just before they finish the job, and then tussles with Tig in the safehouse before leaving and drinking himself to sleep in the Charming graveyard. He wakes up and walks to Donna's funeral. Tara gives him his SAMCRO kutte and a kiss, and he shoots a knowing look at Clay, Gemma, and Tig before placing a flower on the coffin and walking off. Piney follows and hands Jax a fresh copy of his father's memoirs, declaring that it's \\"time for a change.\\" Jax visits his father's grave and proclaims his agreement as Gemma and Clay look on, nervously. Music The song, \\"John the Revelator\\", performed by Curtis Stigers and the Forest Rangers, plays over the ending scene. Reception IGN gave \\"The Revelator\\" an 8.6/10.0 rating, stating, \\"I can't talk much more about this episode without revealing anything important, so I'll just wrap it up.

Zach Handler of The AV Club gave \\"The Sleep of Babies\\" a perfect A rating, stating; \\"And then there's Donna's funeral. It plays out like the end of a rock video; Jax shows up during the service in a T-shirt in jeans and Tara brings him his Sons jacket; they make out a bit; and then Jax gives the evil eye to Clay and the others. It's a goddamn chasm between him and the others now, and it was awesome to see. This whole season, I'd been thinking we were building up to some massive catastrophe in the final moments, but when \\"Revelator\\" ended, I couldn't stop grinning. Still can't, really. The ground has broken, and break is final: on one side, it's Jax trying to bring his father's dream to Charming, with Tara at his side, and hopefully a few others (Piney, for sure, but other than that‚Ä¶). On the other side, it's Clay, Gemma, and Tig fighting to keep that dream dead, with the weight of the charter and all of Clay and Gemma's cunning behind them.\\" References External links * * Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Sons of Anarchy episodes ","title":"The Revelator (Sons of Anarchy)"},{"id":"38006662","text":"Governagiri is a village in Ottapidaram taluk Tuticorin District Tamil Nadu India.

The program is highly interactive and incorporates case studies, team-based exercises and tools to help participants in their leadership journey, and uses evidence-based leadership principles as its core curriculum. The PLA is built upon Kouse‚Äôs and Posner‚Äôs five practices of exemplary leadership,Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership and includes an individual leadership assessment and a learning agreement to participants to measure their development. It is offered in the format of a series of didactic lectures followed by other modalities shown to enhance participant interactions.D Davis, \\"A Systematic Review of the Effect of Continuing Medical Education Strategies\\", The Journal of the American Medical Association, 1995 The PLA focuses on developing the core competencies for public health leadership as identified by the U.S National Public Health Leadership Network. These competencies include visionary leadership, sense of mission, effective change, political processes, negotiation, ethics and power, marketing and education, understanding of organizational dynamics, inter-organizational collaborating mechanisms, social forecasting, developing team-oriented systems, facilitation and mediation and serving as an effective team member.K Wright, \\"Competency Development in Public Health Leadership\\", American Journal of Public Health, 2000 Target Unlike the majority of leadership training programs, the PLA is tailored for young physicians at the beginning of their professional careers. By instilling the principles of leadership in this generation, they ensuring a sound foundation for their career development and are also giving these skills to the ones who are the most likely to make significant change in their communities and institutions. Objectives * Be inspired to work with, and advance treatment for, children with ADHD and their families * Be inspired to believe they can make a difference * Understand the dynamics and process of making large-scale health care system change and the incremental steps to doing so * Understand the functional, day-to-day behaviors of leadership * Develop strategies for managing and resolving conflict * Understand the dynamics and importance of effective teams Rationale Most physicians are in positions of potential leadership. Reinertsen, in his article Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems,JL Reinertsen, \\"Physicians as Leaders in the Improvement of Health Care Systems\\", Annals of Internal Medicine, 1998 used a business-based definition of leadership, describing it as the ability to coordinate processes that begin an organization or facilitate an organization‚Äôs adaptation to changing circumstances. Whether serving in an academic medical center, working as a physician executive in a health plan or public health program, functioning as a partner in a group practice, collaborating on a community project, or advocating for effective health legislation, physicians have multiple opportunities to function as leaders in changing health care in the 21st century. Despite these prospects, many physicians either have not taken on leadership roles or function ineffectively in those roles. Some have argued that the majority of administrative, organizational, team- building, and self-assessment skills of quality leaders are not taught in medical training programs. In fact, much of traditional medical curricula have emphasized autonomy in decision making, the individual physician-patient relationship, and hierarchical cultural processes that are counterproductive to effective leadership.R Schwartz, \\"Physician Leadership: Essential Skills in a Changing Environment\\", The American Journal of Surgery, 2000 In addition, although leadership development programs have been implemented in many sectors of the economy and have been accompanied by a rapid proliferation of both a scholarly evaluation and the popular inspirational literature, medicine has tended to act as though leadership were an innate characteristic and not a skill to be learned. Until recently, physicians who were interested in acquiring leadership skills training have had to search for programs in industries outside medicine. Principles Kouze's and Posner's Five Practices of Exemplary LeadershipFive Practices of Exemplary Leadership model proves its effectiveness as a clear, evidence-based path to achieving the extraordinary‚Äîfor individuals, teams, organizations, and communities. It turns the abstract concept of leadership into easy-to-grasp practices and behaviors that can be taught and learned by anyone willing to step up and accept the challenge to lead. Model the Way Leaders establish principles concerning the way people (constituents, peers, colleagues, and customers alike) should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow. Because the prospect of complex change can overwhelm people and stifle action, they set interim goals so that people can achieve small wins as they work toward larger objectives. They unravel bureaucracy when it impedes action; they put up signposts when people are unsure of where to go or how to get there; and they create opportunities for victory. Inspire a Shared Vision Leaders passionately believe that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the organization can become. Through their magnetism and quiet persuasion, leaders enlist others in their dreams. They breathe life into their visions and get people to see exciting possibilities for the future. Challenge the Process Leaders search for opportunities to change the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the organization. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. And because leaders know that risk taking involves mistakes and failures, they accept the inevitable disappointments as learning opportunities. Enable Others to Act Leaders foster collaboration and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others, making each person feel capable and powerful. Encourage the Heart Accomplishing extraordinary things in organizations is hard work. To keep hope and determination alive, leaders recognize contributions that individuals make. In every winning team, the members need to share in the rewards of their efforts, so leaders celebrate accomplishments. They make people feel like heroes.

Some of his contemporaries were Pascual Ortega Portales, Antonio Smith, Nicol√°s Guzm√°n, and Miguel Campos. Once home, he faced a great deal of competition from his rivals which affected recognition for his work after he died. Caro worked in an academic style in portrait painting, rather than in the more experimental styles then gaining a foothold in Europe. His subject matter often involved genre scenes of folklife, historical and 'costumbrista' subjects (subjects in costume acting out an historical event), and urban society of the 19th century. One of his famous paintings is his 1873 work The Zamacueca, a colorful folk dance scene that for a time was lost during the Pinochet regime, but eventually became an icon of Chilean identity.

In 1804 he became regent while the heirs to the sultanate were minors. When he attempted to increase his power in 1806 he was killed. Early years Badr bin Saif was the son of Saif bin Ahmad, one of the sons of Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, the first sultan of the Al Said dynasty. His uncle, Sultan bin Ahmad, became ruler of Oman in 1792. While Sultan was away on a pilgrimage to Mecca early in 1803, Badr bin Saif made an attempt to get control of Fort Al Jalali, a key stronghold guarding Muscat harbor. The story is that he was being smuggled into the fort in a large box, but was detected by a Hindu trader. He managed to escape and took refuge in Qatar. In Zubarah in Qatar he asked for protection from the Wahhabis, and adopted their beliefs. They helped him with two abortive attempts to take Muscat. He then travelled to Najd and met the Amir Saud, who made him welcome. Sultan bin Ahmad left on an expedition to Basra in 1804. He died near the island of Qeshm in mid- November 1804 during a minor skirmish. Sultan had appointed Mohammed bin Nasir bin Mohammed al-Jabry the Regent and guardian of his two young sons, Salim bin Sultan and Said bin Sultan. Dynastic power struggle After Sultan's death the tribes to the north broke away from Omani authority, while a struggle for power broke out within the ruling family. Badr bin Saif, based in Muscat, gained the support of the Wahhabi leader, Su'ud, in this contest. The former sultan's brother Qais bin Ahmad decided to try to seize power. Early in 1805 he joined forces with his younger brother Mohammed and marched down the coast to Muttrah, which he took with little opposition. Mohammed bin Nasir tried to buy Qais off with a large monthly annuity. Qais refused since he had growing support and was confident of success, and continued to besiege Muscat. Mohammed bin Nasir called on Badr bin Saif for help. Badr bin Saif arrived at Muscat just in time to forestall its capitulation. He also arranged for the Wahabbis to attack Sohar as a diversion. Qais agree to lift the siege in return for being given Al Khaburah and part of the Batinah. A month later Qais returned and again took Muttrah, but was forced to withdraw when a large seaborne force of Wahabbis appeared. He accepted peace on the grounds that he would gain Muttrah as well as the other places he had taken, and a monthly subsidy. In July Qais broke his engagement and again advanced on Muscat. The Wahabbis again attacked Sohar, while Said bin Sultan advanced into the Samail valley. Kais was forced to make peace, and gave up Muttrah and his subsidy. Effective ruler The rulers of Bahrain, the Al Kalifah, had come under the power of the Wahabbis. They were forced to leave members of their families in Zubarah as hostages to their loyalty. In 1805 they appealed for protection from Badr bin Saif, now the effective ruler of Muscat. He sent warships and helped them evacuate their family from Zubarah to Bahrain. The Al Kalifah then asked the British Resident in Muscat, Captain David Seton, if the British would provide one or two gunboats to help them and Badr bin Saif keep the Wahhabis under control in the Persian Gulf. Seton recommended acceptance, but the British did not want to become involved in Bahraini politics. The next year the Al Kalifah declared their independence of Badr bin Saif. By 1805 the people of Muscat were becoming concerned with Badr's close relations with the Wahhabis. He paid tribute and maintenance for a force of 400 Wahabbi cavalry stationed at Barka. He also enforced the strict Wahhabi doctrines, destroyed the minarets of Ibadi and Sunni mosques and enforced regular attendance at prayers. At one point the Wahhabi leader called on Badr to attack India as part of the Jihad. He was forced to stall since this would mean attacking his British allies. In 1806 there were further inconclusive military operations against Kais in Sohar. The same year Badr bin Saif began to make moves to increase his power. He made his ward Salim bin Sultan governor of Al Ma≈üna‚Äòah, on the Batinah coast and Said bin Sultan governor of Barka to remove them from government affairs. Death Badr bin Saif died on 31 July 1806. He was lured to Burka and attacked by Said bin Sultan at Naaman, a nearby village. There are different accounts of what happened, but it seems clear that Said struck the first blow and his supporters finished the job. Said was acclaimed by the people as a liberator from the Wahhabis, who left the country. Qais bin Ahmad at once gave his support to Said. Nervous of the Wahhabi reaction, Said blamed Mohammed bin Nasir for the murder. Badr bin Saif left two sons, Hamud and Saif. Hamud became deputy governor of Rustaq in 1833.

The Rome Empire had made Ibiza a Federatae Civitae.The History Buff's Guide to Ibiza. Author: Emily Kaufman. Published: Tarita, S.L. The island was never conquered by the Romans and during a gradual period of Romanization the island saw an economic golden age which lasted from approximately 25 BC and AD 75. It is thought that it was during this period the first bridge was built by the Romans to access the north east Canton of the island. The bridge that stands today is probably built on the foundations of the Roman bridge.Ibiza & Formentera's Heritage, A Non-clubber's Guide. Author: Paul R Davis Pub:Barbary Press, 2009, It has been estimated that this bridge was probably built in the sixteenth or seventeenth century. The Legend of Els familiar According to an ancient Ibizan legend there is a rather ugly bad tempered pixie that can be both good and bad. This pixie's appearance could only be conjured up by the picking and the instant bottling of a flowering herb which could only be found under the Pont Vell's arches. These herbs shelter the spirits of Fameliars. The pixies were said to have only two aims during their apparitions: to work or eat. If you had a particular task which required some hard work, capturing one of the pixies was a good way to complete your job. The drawback was that if the work stopped, the pixie would then spend all its time eating. The legend dictates that to capture the Familiar you must first go under the bridge at first light on the day of the festival of Saint Juan (June 24) and collect the flowers of the herb, making sure that you pick the herbs quickly, as they can appear and disappear at a glance. Placing the crop in the black bottle the vessel should then be closed tightly. The bottle could then be kept and opened when hard work was required to be done quickly and properly. Once liberated, the Familiar will cry: \\"Soc es familiar, vull veina o menjar\\", which means \\"I am a Familiar! I would like work or food!\\" . The drawback of the releasing of this spirit is that if you do not give the Familiar work to do, it will eat you out of house and home. Although this story is a subject of myth, an unfortunate man from Santa Eul√†ria was sent to prison by the Holy Office in 1744. He had sworn under oath to owning a Familiar and that he knew of many people in the area who also had possession of the spirits.

His daring escape from a camp at Dehradun in 1944 with mountaineer Heinrich Harrer is documented in Megener's memoir, Prisoner's Bluff. After the war he became a successful business executive and chief financial officer for BASF, and held a senior- level position with Mercedes-Benz. Early years Rolf Magener was born in Odessa on 3 August 1910 to a German businessman father and a Russian mother. He grew up in Germany, but his family spent significant time on the French Riviera due to the health of the mother. After completing boarding school at Hermann Lietz-Schule, he went on to study business management, spending several semesters at Exeter in England, where he became fluent in English. Magener earned his doctorate from the University of Frankfurt in 1937, writing his dissertation on industry liquidity in economic trends. He then travelled widely around southeast Asia. War years By 1938, Magener was working in Bombay for the German multi-national company IG Farben. At the start of World War II, he was interned in September 1939 by the British. By April 1944, he found himself with 1500 other foreign nationals in a warehouse in Dehradun near the border of Nepal at the foot of the Himalayas. Magener and his friend, Heins von Have, were resolved to escape. They learned that several other prisoners were also planning to escape, among them, Heinrich Harrer, who was part of the four-man climbing team that first scaled the Eiger north face in Switzerland. On the afternoon of 29 April 1944, seven internees made their escape, with Magener and von Have‚Äîboth of whom spoke fluent English‚Äîdisguised as British officers. After the escape, the group split up. Harrer and Peter Aufschnaiter, both professional climbers, headed for Tibet. Harrer later recording his adventures and friendship with the Dalai Lama in Seven Years in Tibet (1953). They were accompanied part of the way by Hans Kopp, who later wrote Himalayan Shuttlecock. Magener and von Have decided to make their way to Japan. They travelled 1500 miles southeast across India, still disguised as British soldiers, to the Japanese lines in Burma. Along the way, in an effort to maintain their disguise, they shared railway compartments and restaurant tables with actual British officers. On several occasions they were almost caught by military police. At Calcutta, the pair changed their disguises, now pretending to be Swiss businessmen, and continued on by train and river steamer to Chittagong, from where they took a sampan to Cox's Bazar. They continued on foot through the jungle, fighting hunger and the approaching monsoon. After more than a month on the run they crossed the Naf River into Burma, where they were captured and imprisoned by Japanese troops who were convinced they were spies. Following two months on starvation rations, they were transferred to a jail at Rangoon, where they were appalled by the conditions inflicted on Allied prisoners. In September 1944, four months after their initial escape, news of their presence in Burma was released to the Press, and soon they were released and flown to Japan, where they waited out the war, working as honorary consuls at the German Embassy in Tokyo. Later years In 1947, Magener returned to Germany, where he was again imprisoned by the Americans at the reception camp at Ludwigsburg. He was eventually released, and in 1955, he worked for the international chemical company BASF in their London office. In 1958 he became a financial director of the company and beginning in 1962 was a member of the board of directors. Magener retired in 1974. In 1976, he accepted a position on the supervisory board of BDO Germany, serving as its chairperson between 1983 and 1989. During this time, a held a senior post with Mercedes-Benz in Germany. Magener remained an Anglophile throughout his life, regularly spending his winters in London, where he and his wife kept an apartment and collected English paintings and furniture. In 1954, Magener published Prisoner's Bluff, an account of his wartime escape. Rolf Magener died in Heidelberg, Germany on 5 May 2000 at the age of 89. He was survived by his wife Doris (n√©e von Behling), whom he married in Japan in 1947.

The mineral is named after its tetragonal crystal structure and its relation to the iron-nickel alloy, taenite. It is one of the mineral phases found in meteoric iron.Mindat.org ‚Äì TetrataeniteHandbook of Mineralogy ‚Äì Tetrataenite  Formation  Tetrataenite forms naturally in iron meteorites that contain taenite that are slow-cooled at a rate of a few degrees per million years, which allows for ordering of the Fe and Ni atoms. It is found most abundantly in slow-cooled chondrite meteorites, as well as in mesosiderites. At high (as much as 52%) Ni content and temperatures below 320 ¬∞C (the order-disorder transition temperature), tetrataenite is broken down from taenite and distorts its face centered cubic crystal structure to form the tetragonal L10 structure.\\"Taenite.\\" Britannica Academic, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 6 Nov. 2009. academic-eb- com.ezproxy.neu.edu/levels/collegiate/article/taenite/342903. Accessed 30 Mar. 2018. The L10 phase can be synthetically produced by neutron- or electron- irradiation of FeNi below 593 K or by hydrogen-reduction of nanometric NiFe2O4, but only on a small scale. In 2015, it was reported that tetrataenite was found in a terrestrial rock - a magnetite body from the Indo-Myanmar ranges of northeast India.  Crystal Structure  Tetrataenite has a highly ordered crystal structure, appearing creamy in color and displaying optical anisotropy. Its appearance is distinguishable from taenite, which is dark gray with low reflectivity. FeNi easily forms into a cubic crystal structure, but does not have magnetic anisotropy in this form. Three variants of the L10 tetragonal crystal structure have been found, as chemical ordering can occur along any of the three axes.  Magnetic Properties  Tetrataenite displays permanent magnetization, in particular, high coercivity. It has a theoretical magnetic energy product, the maximum amount of magnetic energy stored, over 335 kJ m‚àí3.  Applications  Tetrataenite is a candidate for replacing rare- earth permanent magnets such as samarium and neodymium since both iron and nickel are earth-abundant and inexpensive.

He wrote a book, titled The Logic of Perception, and was regarded as an excellent perception psychologist. Rock is notable in the field of psychology for his 1957 experiment where he tilted a square to make it look like a diamond and then tilted his test subjects and asked them what shape they saw. The experiment tested Rock's hypothesis that perceptual phenomena could be explained by higher-level mental processes instead of merely by automatic processes. When his test subjects continued to perceive the shape as a diamond after being tilted to view the shape as a square, Rock concluded that perception is an intelligent, higher-level mental process. This differed from previous conclusions by Gestalt psychologists that perception was not a higher-level process. Rock later wrote another important book on the field of inattentional blindness.  Life   Education and career  Irvin Rock grew up in New York City where he received his bachelor's degree in psychology in 1947 and his master's degree in psychology in 1948, both at the City College of New York. He earned his Ph.D. while a student under Hans Wallach in 1952 from the New School for Social Research, now known as The New School. He became a professor there, and afterward at Yeshiva University. In 1967, he moved to the Rutgers-Newark campus and later to the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus at Rutgers University, where he continued to teach psychology until he retired from the university in 1987. Shortly after retiring from Rutgers, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked as an Adjunct Professor of Psychology until his death in June 1995. In the 1990s at Berkeley, he conducted much research in the field of inattentional blindness, a term he coined with his co-researcher, Arien Mack. They published a seminal book called Inattentional Blindness in 1998.Mack, A. & Rock I., Inattentional Blindness, Boston: MIT Press, 1998  Death  On July 18, 1995, Rock died from pancreatic cancer in his home, survived by his wife Sylvia, and five children: Peter, Alice, Lisa, and David Rock, and Rayna Shilling-McCallum.

She was launched in 1824. North Star Bay, a bay in Greenland, was named in honour of this ship.  Suppressing the Atlantic slave trade From 1826 to 1828 under Captain Arabin, North Star was stationed in the West Africa Squadron, whose task was to suppress the Atlantic slave trade by patrolling the coast of West Africa. In late 1828 she sailed to England, via the West Indies. From 1829 to 1832 she was stationed in Portsmouth; then from 1832-1833 she became part of the North America and West Indies Station before being paid off. In 1834 she was commissioned for service on the Pacific Station then known as the South American Station. She was in the Pacific off the coast of South and Central America until 1836, when she returned to Portsmouth.  First Anglo-Chinese War In September 1841 Captain Sir J. E. Home was appointed to North Star. She was then commissioned for service in the East Indies and China Station and in November of that year she conveyed money for the commissariat in China. During the period 1841-42 she served with Sir William Parker's ships in the First Anglo-Chinese War (1839‚Äì42), known popularly as the First Opium War. Service in the Flagstaff War in New Zealand H M S North Star destroying Pomare's PƒÅ, 1845. Painting by John Williams. At the end of the First Anglo- Chinese War North Star was sent to Calcutta, then Sydney, Australia, and when at Sydney, the Flagstaff War began in New Zealand. On 23 March 1845 North Star arrived in New Zealand, under the command of Sir Everard Home, with the officers and men of the 58th Regt. North Star operated in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand during the Flagstaff War between 11 March 1845 and 11 January 1846. On 28 March 1845 cannon fire from North Star was directed at the pƒÅ of P≈çmare II on the coast in the Bay of Islands. A pƒÅ is a fortified village. Because of the almost constant intertribal warfare, the art of defensive fortifications had reached a very high level among the MƒÅori. The colonial forces were able to occupy P≈çmare's pƒÅ without a fight, although up until that time P≈çmare had been considered neutral and was not a supporter of the rebellion led by Hone Heke. On 3 May 1845 a small naval brigade from both North Star and HMS Hazard supported the 58th Regt. and other colonial forces at the Battle of Ohaeawai. The colonial forces were repulsed by MƒÅori warriors with serious losses. From 27 December 1845 to 11 January 1846 officers, seamen and Royal Marines from North Star assisted the army at the siege of Ruapekapeka PƒÅ. Officers present at the battle were Commander Hay and Lieutenant Egerton. Mr. Murray, a midshipman, was killed during the battle. Following the end of the Flagstaff War North Star returned to England. On 19 December 1846 she arrived in Portsmouth sailing via the Cape of Good Hope. Arctic Expedition Under Commander James Saunders North Star sailed to the Arctic in 1849 in the spring on a venture to search for and resupply Captain Sir James Clark Ross' expedition, who in turn had sailed in 1848 trying to locate the whereabouts of Sir John Franklin's expedition.Icy Imprisonment: The 1849 Voyage of the HMS North Star Failing to find Franklin or Ross, Saunders's mission aboard North Star consisted in depositing stores along several named areas of the Canadian Arctic coast and returning to England before the onset of winter. However, progress being made difficult by ice in Melville Bay James Saunders's ship became trapped by ice off the coast of NW Greenland in North Star Bay, a protected bay off Wolstenholme Fjord, being the first Royal Navy ship to winter so far north. While wintering in the frozen bay in 1849‚Äì50 Saunders named numerous landmarks in that area.The Nautical Magazine and Naval Chronicle, Simpkin, Marshall & Co. London 1850, p. 588 In August 1850 North Star broke free of the ice and crossed Baffin Bay to Lancaster Sound, eventually reaching Whaler Point. Since westward progress became difficult on account of the ice Saunders returned to Baffin Bay and off Admiralty Inlet, he met William Penny's expedition and was informed that Ross had returned home. After leaving the remaining stores at Navy Board Inlet, North Star sailed back to England. She was immediately attached to Edward Belcher's 1852 Franklin search expedition and returned to the arctic under William Pullen. Left at Beechey Island, she served as depot ship and when the remainder of the expedition was frozen in and abandoned, she and HMS Phoenix brought off the crews of Belcher's four other ships as well as that of HMS Investigator, returning again to England in 1854. In 1860 she was broken up at the Chatham Dockyard.

Frozen stars would belong to a spectral class \\"H\\".Table 5 in  Characteristics  Due to opacity effects, as metallicity of the interstellar gas increases both the maximum and minimum masses a star can have will decrease. For the latter case, it's expected that an object with a mass of 0.04 solar masses (40 times the mass of Jupiter), that currently would become a brown dwarf unable to fuse hydrogen, could do so ending in the main sequence with a surface temperature of 0 ¬∞C (273 K, thus frozen), much cooler than the dimmest red dwarfs of today, and ice clouds forming in its atmosphere.

His soul-searching Confessions of a White Racist was nominated for a National Book Award in 1972, and earned him praise from other writers, including Maya Angelou. In 1974, he wrote an article about the Chicken Ranch brothel in La Grange, Texas; after the article was published in Playboy, King and fellow Texan Peter Masterson developed it into the book of the Broadway musical. King received an Emmy Award in 1982 for the CBS documentary The Best Little Statehouse in Texas. In 1988, Austin's Live Oak Theatre presented King's new drama The Night Hank Williams Died.

History The castle was founded by the Livonian Order in 1272, as a purely defensive crusader fortress. During the course of the Livonian War, the castle was for a period occupied by Polish troops and between 1570 and 1578 served as the official residence of Duke Magnus of Holstein, who aspired to create a Livonian kingdom with the help of Tsar Ivan the Terrible of Russia. In 1623, king Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden gave the estate to Field Marshal Herman Wrangel as a gift. Wrangel started to transform the castle from a medieval fortress into a stately late-renaissance home. During the course of the Great Northern War, however, the castle was burnt and the interiors destroyed. After the war, Emperor Peter the Great in his turn gave the castle as a gift to reformer Heinrich von Fick. Through inheritance, it eventually passed into the ownership of Woldemar Johann von Lauw in 1750. He began an extensive rebuilding scheme, transforming the fortress into a luxurious rococo palace. After his time, it eventually ended up in the hands of the Russian princely family Gagarin in whose hands it remained until the Estonian land reform of 1919. In 1941, during the Second World War, the castle was almost completely destroyed in an air raid. Architecture The lavishly decorated Rococo \\"marble hall\\", destroyed in 1941. The medieval castle was built on the banks of P√µltsamaa River, and is surrounded by a moat. It was a square fortress with three gates and an inner courtyard. In the 14th and 15th centuries several additions were made, for example was a convent hall added and the walls raised successively. Small rectangular towers stood at three of the corners of the wall. The inner convent building had its own, inner courtyard and a watchtower in the south-west corner. In the 16th century, a bastion and a cannon tower was added in front of the southern gate. A cannon tower was also added to protect the northern gate. During the ownership of Herman Wrangel, the castle started to change appearance; it was slowly transformed from a fortress into a residence. Wrangel had fireplaces and tiled stoves put in place, enlarged the windows and doors and added an extra floor to the building. The courtyard was also transformed into a household yard. The most visible legacy of his reconstruction scheme, however, is that he transformed the southern cannon tower into the present-day church, which is still standing.P√µltsamaa castle viewed from the north-east During the Great Northern War the castle was burnt and the interiors largely destroyed. However, in 1772‚Äì73 the interior was re- decorated in a lavish rococo style, perhaps the most artistically accomplished rococo interior in all of Estonia. Master stucco decorator Johann Michael Graff, whose craftsmanship can still be admired in RundƒÅle Palace, Latvia, was engaged in the creation of these interiors. During this time Gottlieb Welt√© was probably also active as an artist at P√µltsamaa castle. In the 1941 bombing, the castle was almost disintegrated. Today, only ruins remain of the main buildings. The church, although also damaged, has been restored, as have some of the annexes.

It was founded in 1393 and disestablished after the creation of the Principality of Bulgaria in 1878.  History and Administration  The Sanjak of Sofia was established around 1393. Initially it had two nahiyahs: Znepolje and Visok. Its first sanjakbey was Ince Balaban, also referred to as 'the conqueror of Sofia'. One of its sanjakbeys was Malko√ßoƒülu Ali Bey, a member of the Malko√ßoƒülu family, who died in 1514. Soon after the establishment of the sanjak, Sofia became the seat of the Rumelia Eyalet. Although the beglerbegs of Rumelia in early periods sometimes stayed in Bitola, Sofia remained the seat and center of the Rumelia Eyalet. Since it was a seat of the Rumelian beglerbey, the Sanjak of Sofia had a status of Pasha Sanjak (), or the main sanjak of the Elayet. The Sanjak of Sofia and its 50 timars were registered for tax purposes in 1446 and 1455, and also in 1488/1489 and 1491. In the 1520s around 6.1% of the total population (25,910) of the Sanjak of Sofia were Muslims. At the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century Ni≈° belonged to the Sanjak of Sofia. At the end of the 18th century it was under frequent attacks by Osman Pazvantoglu. In the period 1846-1864 the Sanjak of Sofia belonged to the Ni≈° Eyalet By James Henry Skene while from 1864 to 1878 it belonged to the Danube Vilayet. At that time it had the following kazas: Sofia, Kyustendil, Samokov, Dupnica, Radomir, Zlatica, Orhanie and D≈æumaja.  Disestablishment  After the decisions of the Berlin Congress were signed on 13 July 1878, the Sanjak of Sofia was merged with Northern Bulgaria into the Principality of Bulgaria, a de facto independent vassal of the Ottoman Empire, except for the kaza of D≈æumaja (also called Cuma-i Bala), which was passed to the newly founded Sanjak of G√ºm√ºlcine.

Born in Shildon, Bushby began his career with Southend United in 1934, and later played for a number of Hampshire-based teams including Portsmouth and Southampton, before retiring from professional football in 1947. Life and career After beginning his football career with local youth sides in his hometown of Shildon, County Durham, Bushby moved to Third Division South side Southend United in September 1933, signing professional terms with the club in October 1934. He remained with Southend for five seasons, making 40 League, 4 FA Cup and 2 Third Division South Cup appearances after which he moved to Portsmouth (then in the First Division) in June 1939 as a replacement for regular half back Jimmy Guthrie, who had been injured in a car accident earlier that year. During the Second World War, Bushby played the majority of his football with Folland Aircraft Football Club, a team formed by the workers of Folland Aircraft, although also appeared for Southampton and Chelsea in a number of unofficial wartime matches. Following the end of the conflicts, Bushby moved permanently to Southampton in September 1946, appearing twice for the club at right half in games against West Bromwich Albion on 5 October 1946 and Birmingham City on 1 February 1947. Ultimately he could not retain his position in the team ahead of players like Bill Stroud and George Smith though, and left near the end of the season to join Cowes. Bushby, although with Portsmouth also made 1 Wartime appearance for Clapton Orient, this was at Portsmouth on 20 February 1943.

In May 1947 Bushby was offered a professional contract by Aldershot, but he ultimately turned it down and remained with Cowes on non-professional terms (while working with Folland Aircraft), thus signifying an end to his professional playing career. Bushby did remain with Cowes for seven years however, making 232 consecutive appearances between 1947 and 1954, and he later went on to manage the football team of Sarisbury, a village near the Hampshire town of Fareham.

Scrap metal shredders come in many different variations and sizes. Applications Some examples of scrap metal materials that are commonly shredded are: Car crushers are large machines that turn a car into a large bucket of scrap steel and the rest of the car into non-ferrous materials, plastics and waste called automotive shredder residue. The glass, fabric, plastic, and all other non-ferrous materials are separated by eddy current magnets in place of heavy media separation. The non-ferrous materials may be referred to as \\"zorba\\". Often the profit from the non-ferrous materials covers the operating cost for the shredder. When a metal shredder starts, the material enters into the tear box through the feeding system. The tear blade is loaded on the box. The material is torn into small pieces through the tear, extrusion and shear of the tear blade, and is discharged from the lower part of the box.metal shredder Metal scrap recycling, also called secondary metal processing, is a large industry that processes, in the U.S. alone, 56 million tons of scrap iron and steel (including 10 million tons of scrap automobiles), 1.5 million tons of scrap copper, 2.5 million tons of scrap aluminum, 1.3 million tons of scrap lead, 300,000 tons of scrap zinc and 800,000 tons of scrap stainless steel, and smaller quantities of other metals, on a yearly basis. Types Scrap metal shredders can be equipped with different types of cutting systems: horizontal shaft, vertical shaft, single-shaft, two-shaft, three-shaft and four-shaft cutting systems. These shredder designs can be high speed, medium speed and sometimes slow-speed systems, they always include hammermills of a vertical and horizontal shaft design, and can also include in contrast to hammer mills slow speed technology which are also used to process or shred metal and plastic and other waste materials encountered in the scrap metal industry. The largest scrap metal shredders in the world often have 10,000 horsepower (hp) and are made by a wide range of companies which all originated their designs from the 1966 patent applications of the Newell Group and the Williams Group as the first patented vertical and horizontal designs for auto shredding or scrap metal shredding. Often cited is the 9,200 hp shredder from the Lynxs group at the Sims plant at the mouth of the River Usk in Newport Wales with access by road, rail and sea. This Lynxs shredder can eat 350 cars per hour. However, the Lynxs shredders are not unique in this high hp range design. Historically the Schnitzer Steel group installed a 10,000 hp unit that they made on their own in 1980, and there are many Newell Shredders that have these high hp designs. A 9,000 horsepower Mega Shredder at Sims Metal Management's Claremont Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey processes 4,000 tons of metal a day.  Environmental impact  An engineered enclosure may be used to contain noise and dust. In 2018, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control requested public comment on plans to implement enforceable operating requirements for scrap metal shredders. In Houston, the carcinogenic substance hexavalent chromium was identified as an emission from a scrap recycling facility.

The release updated the Chromium engine used by Torch and introduced an embedded player to stream torrents downloaded before the download is completed. Reception Reviews of Torch have evolved over time, as the browser continued to add features and functionality. Early versions of the browser have received mixed reviews, with some praising its interesting feature combination while others pointed to the lack of add-on support (an issue which has been resolved in newer versions). In October 2012, The Blog Herald said of Torch: \\"The Torch Web Browser is built on a lightweight framework that offers what appears to be decent security. If you like to browse the web while grabbing various files this might be the perfect browser for your arsenal of web applications. Overall I have been pleased with the Torch Browser and I only hope it continues to grow so more social sharing features can be experienced and more files can be grabbed.\\" In reviewing Torch in December 2012, CNET said of Torch 2.0.0.1614: \\"An all-in-one Web browser is nothing to sneeze at, but Torch Browser isn't going to pry you away from Chrome or Firefox. While it has options that make sharing and social media a breeze, Torch Browser just isn't unique enough to win people's hearts. It lags in performance and its major features aren't worth making the switch...Torch Browser tries to carve out its niche by being an all-in-one Web browser... However, it doesn't do any of those things well enough to replace what you currently use. Once you get over the novelty, it becomes obvious that Torch Browser isn't that powerful as a Web portal. It's noticeably slower than other browsers and it doesn't have the same sort of add-on support. The layout is just a rip-off of the open-canvas setup of other, more popular browsers. None of this is to say that using it is all a bad experience. Torch Browser still runs circles around Internet Explorer and would be a major upgrade there... While not a threat to Firefox or Chrome, Torch Browser is easy enough to use and might just impress Internet Explorer users. Heavy downloaders might enjoy the torrent downloader and media player that come with it, too.\\" PC Advisor, in an April 2013 review of the newest version, gave Torch 3.5/5 stars and praised it: \\"This is a great alternative browser that adds some interesting extras on top of the Chrome engine. It‚Äôs well worth trying out\\". In a March 2015 Techradar review by Jamie Hinks, the publication called Torch 39 \\"an excellent alternative for anyone looking to a browser that breaks away from the norm\\".  Criticism   Bundling of unwanted software  Torch Media receives payments from companies like Ask.com to bundle potentially unwanted programs with the browser. Users may be asked to install search toolbars or adware programs during installation. These bundled programs commonly do one or more of the following things: * Change the user's browser homepage to a page with ads * Change the user's default search engine * Prevent the user from changing their homepage and default search engine * Collect and upload data about the user's internet browsing behavior * Add toolbars to the user's browsers * Inject advertisements into websites that are visited by the user While this practice is deemed controversial by some, users are given a chance to opt out of sponsored software and Torch claims to work fine without it., Torch FAQ Torch makes contradictory claims about the software they bundle. Their online troubleshooter claims that \\"Torch does not install additional toolbars\\" while at the same time stating that \\"the Torch installer may include an optional Ask.com toolbar\\" on another page.

Born in Reading, Ephgrave began his professional career with Aston Villa in 1936, and later played for a number of Football League clubs including Southampton and Norwich City before retiring from professional football in 1954. Life and career Born in Reading but brought up in Guernsey, George Ephgrave began his youth football career with local side Guernsey Rangers, and was later signed by Tottenham Hotspur feeder club Northfleet in October 1935. A year later, Ephgrave signed a professional contract with recently relegated Second Division side Aston Villa, although he failed to make a single appearance in his three seasons at the club. In March 1939, at the end of the last full season before the Second World War, the goalkeeper signed for Swindon Town, where he made his first appearance in the Football League. During the conflicts Ephgrave served his country, resulting in him being captured and held as a prisoner of war in Odessa, Ukraine for four years, but on his return to England he was signed by Southampton, where he was used as the first-choice goalkeeper for the first season after the war. In the 1946‚Äì47 season he played in 29 of the 42 Second Division league games, as well as in both of the FA Cup games the Saints played, although in the following season he was second choice to Len Stansbridge and, later, Ian Black, making only seven league appearances in the first half of the campaign. In July 1948 Ephgrave moved to Norwich City for a transfer fee of ¬£500, where he made just five appearances in three seasons. He was later transferred to Watford in August 1951, playing just four times in his only season at the club, and ended his career with seasons at non-league sides Deal Town and March Town United. After his retirement, Ephgrave moved back to Guernsey, and he died on 12 December 2004 at the age of 86.

(February 23, 1933 ‚Äì September 22, 2002) was an American economist and professor at the University of Michigan. During the first half of his career, he did research on macroeconomics; during the second half, he focused on Marxist economics and became an editor of Monthly Review, a Marxist journal.  Early life and education  Anderson earned a B.A. from Williams College in 1955 and a PhD from Harvard University in 1960, immediately after which he joined the economics department of the University of Michigan. He became a full professor in 1968.  Career  In macroeconomics, his research monographs studied corporate finance, investment, and national income theory. He served as a staff economist for the Council of Economic Advisers of the United States President during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. Becoming critical of mainstream economics during the 1960s, he subsequently devoted his energies to Marxian political-economy, believing that \\"only Marxism provides the intellectual equipment needed to understand the reality of a modern capitalist society\\". He helped to organize the Union for Radical Political Economy (URPE), which publishes the journal Review of Radical Political Economics. He developed new economics courses in Marxist theory and the economics of women at the University of Michigan and became an associate editor of Monthly Review, a Marxist economics journal, after publishing an essay \\"Apologizing for capitalism\\" in 1987. In this essay, Anderson wrote: > As objects of curiosity, although not of course as conversationalists, > economists are among the most interesting intellectuals of bourgeois > society.

The French government awarded him the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur for the glory he brought to France. Biography Early life Lago was born in Venice in 1893, but the family moved to Bergamo, where his father was manager (or owner) of the municipal theatre. He grew up in the company of actors, musicians and government officials, developing relationships with leaders such as Pope John XXIII and Benito Mussolini.

Profile of Talbot-Lago Politics A founder member (one of the first 50) of the Italian National Fascist Party, he became outspokenly critical of fascism, which led to a violent dispute with Benito Mussolini, necessitating his subsequent fleeing to France. In an era of volatile politics he always carried a hand grenade. In 1919 three members of the fascist youth entered a trattoria looking for him, but as they shot the two owners he threw the grenade and ran out the back door. One of the fascists was killed and Lago fled to Paris, reportedly never returning to Italy.Old Racing Cars. Profile of Antonio Lago Engineering Lago worked for Pratt and Whitney in Southern California before settling in England in the 1920s, where he changed his name to Anthony. He represented Isotta Fraschini at showrooms in North Audley Street, Mayfair and was technical director of L.A.P. Engineering.Agents for L.A.P. carburettors(Veteran-Edwardian-Vintage. Motor Sport, Page 68, February 1984), Restelli cars made by Officine Meccaniche Isolabella SA in Milan and head conversion kits for Fiat cars made by Silvani (Automobile Quarterly, 1985, Volume 23, Issue 4) He then became a director of Self-Changing Gears Ltd owned by Walter Gordon Wilson and John Davenport Siddeley which manufactured Wilson pre-selector gearboxes, and persuaded S.T.D. Motors and others of the gearbox's merits. He acquired the rights to export Wilson gearboxes from England.Automobile Quarterly, 1983 Volume 21, Issue 1 Automobiles Talbot S.A. In 1933 Lago moved to France to manage the failing French subsidiary of S.T.D. Motors, Automobiles Talbot S.A.. Starved of capital it now had antiquated plant and aging products. During the 1920s Louis Coatalen had overspent Sunbeam's funds on Grand Prix racing. Not only had this hampered plant and product development but it was Sunbeam's heavy borrowing brought S.T.D. Motors to its knees when it fell due for repayment in mid 1934. S T D Motors was forced to sell profitable Cl√©ment-Talbot or Talbot London, Sunbeam which now had little value ‚Äîboth bought by the Rootes brothers‚Äî and Automobiles Talbot S.A. which was unsaleable being hopelessly indebted to its French bankers. A complete collapse of the French company proved unavoidable. Lago was a \\"ruthless businessman with great charm\\". In 1933 he had persuaded the other directors of S T D Motors that with him as director Automobiles Talbot France could be back on its feet in 18 months. They paid his salary whilst he transformed the company and they also agreed to share any profits from the sale. His three pronged rescue plan for Talbot involved reducing expenses; building light sporting cars and using racing for development and publicity. He insisted that the racing cars should be closely related to Talbot production models. When, at the end of 1934, Automobiles Talbot S.A. was forced into receivership Lago managed to convert his rights to export Wilson gearboxes into an option to purchase the factory and its plant and machinery at Suresnes. At a cost of ¬£63,000 ([approx Euro 40,000 as of 2012) he and his investors finally acquired the business of Automobiles Talbot S.A. in mid-1936 and S T D Motors was liquidated.S.T.D. Motors.

Body by Figoni & Falaschi Walter Becchia, now best known for designing the Citroen 2CV's flat twin engine during the Second World War's German Occupation, moved from Fiat to S T D Motors' Sunbeam racing in 1923. In June 1934 he produced the first Talbot-Lago T150 model. Antonio Lago organised its promotion. In June three cars, painted in the French Tricolour of red, white and blue, were entered in a Concours d'Elegance in the Bois de Boulogne and driven by well-known female racing drivers wearing tailored outfits that matched the cars. The following weekend the same cars and ladies were presented to the French motoring industry at the Prince of Wales hotel, followed by another concours sponsored by a Paris newspaper. Sales were slow due to French recession and lack of racing success so Lago found a new publicity niche, covering 100 miles in one hour at the Autodrome de Linas- Montlh√©ry. Scandal Capitalising on the company's success in sportscar racing, Lago announced plans to build a 3-litre V16-engined car for the 1938 Grand Prix season. He showed the blueprints to the Comit√© de la Souscription Nationale pour le Fonds de Course (a government body that used public money to try to achieve success in motor racing) and received a 600,000-franc subsidy (approx Euro 300,000 as of 2012), but the V16 never appeared, and it was believed that he used the money to build a factory for Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines. Business Despite going into receivership four times, Lago kept the business running until 1958, when he sold it to Simca. Death and commemoration Antonio Lago was awarded the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur by the French government \\"for the glory he brought to France on the race course\\". He died in Paris in December 1960. He is buried in the cemetery of Predore, the village where he lived.

Born in Lambeth, Evans began his professional career with Woking, and later played for a number of Football League clubs including Southampton and Exeter City. He retired from professional football in 1950, after which he worked in various managerial positions at Aldershot and Tottenham Hotspur. Playing career Early in his career, Harry Evans played for Isthmian League club Woking, Football League members Fulham, Athenian League side Romford, and Third Division South team Aldershot, before joining Southampton in October 1943 whilst serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. After making 71 unofficial wartime appearances, Evans made only a single league appearance (in addition to four FA Cup matches) when The Football League resumed in 1946, playing at centre forward in a 3‚Äì2 win over Bradford Park Avenue on 23 November 1946. After leaving the Saints at the end of the season, Evans completed his professional playing career with brief spells at Third Division South clubs Exeter City and Aldershot, before taking on the role of secretary at Aldershot in 1950. Coaching and management career In 1955 he took over as manager of the Shots following the departure of Gordon Clark, leading the club through 184 matches including 53 wins before leaving in 1959.

Early life  Gaspar de Faria was the son of Sebasti√£o de Faria and, his wife, Gr√°cia Machado, a family of Barcelos. Bishop He was clergy in the habit of Saint Peter, doctored in the sacred canons at the University of Coimbra, presented to bishopric of Angra by the Vicar-General of the Archbishopric of Lisbon.Jorge A. Paulus Bruno, ed. (2009), p. 14 After being confirmed as Bishop of Angra, by papal bull issued by Pope Pius V, on 15 October 1571, he arrived at his post in 1572. One of his first actions was to establish vicarages to represent all the ecumenical parishes of the island of Terceira, which included S√£o Pedro and S√£o Bento in the city of Angra. He was one of the first prelates of Angra to visit the islands that corresponded to the Diocese, with notice that he celebrated mass at the Church of S√£o Sebasti√£o in the city of Ponta Delgada. The bishop was also attributed with the creation, around 1576, of the parish of S√£o Pedro da Ribeira Seca, on the outskirts of the town of Ribeira Grande. The parish of Santa Clara was also created at the beginning of 1570, during the bishop's prelature, obtaining its seat in the hermitage of its invocation that already existed before the 1522 earthquake. Yet, his visit to S√£o Miguel was not all that calm, as he launched an injunction against the nuns at the Convent of Esperan√ßa, in Ponta Delgada.Gaspar Frutuoso (1591), p. 63 This resulted in the nuns sending the Franciscan Br√°s Camelo, who was able to obtain a determination against the injunction, from the Cardinal-King Henry. The King, therefore, sent Lu√≠s de Vasconcelos, rector of the College of the Society of Jesus, in order to smooth the conflict between the nuns and prelate. There is also notice that he celebrated mass in the parochial Church of Vila Nova (in Praia da Vit√≥ria) on the day of Pentecosts, signalling that the settlement of Ramo Grande was already, by the 16th century, the center of the Cult of the Holy Spirit on the island of Terceira. Alleging his \\"inspiration by God\\", managed to quell the scandal that developed with the marriage of Beatriz Dinis, daughter of Gon√ßalo Vaz Dinis, with Br√°s Louren√ßo do Rego, and members of the principal families of the islands. Despite understanding the inclinations of King Sebastian, in favor of the economic situation clergy, many of the payments were being hindered by others with the Cortes, and the bishop appealed directly to the king, and was attended on 4 September 1572. He later obtained a regal writ from King John III, dated 4 September 1572, so that local clergy could be paid 2:1 in wheat and monies, while on the remaining islands the payment was evenly divided. In this writ, wheat was equivalent to 3$300 r√©is per moio, noting its importance. Later life For many years Bishop Faria lived along the margins of the Ribeira dos Moinhos in the northern parish of Agualva, municipality of Praia da Vit√≥ria, in a small farm with orchards, noting that the air and waters of the area were fresh and of the highest quality. The farm, identifiable by an episcopal coat- of-arms, was for a period linked to buried silver and money, which the prelate had hidden away, but was recuperated years later by other property-owners. Bishop Gaspar de Faria died suddenly in the S√© Cathedral of Angra, and was buried alongside the epistle side of the altar of the Sant√≠ssmo Sacramento.

Richard Adams dies at 65; gay marriage pioneer. Los Angeles Times After his 1975 same-sex marriage was declared invalid for the purposes of granting his husband permanent residency, Adams filed the federal lawsuit Adams v. Howerton. This was the first lawsuit in America to seek recognition of a same-sex marriage by the federal government.https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/us/richard-adams- who-sued-us-after-1975-gay-marriage-dies-at-65.html?_r=0 Life and career Adams was born in Manila in the Philippines. His family moved to the United States when he was 12, and he grew up in Long Prairie, Minnesota. He studied liberal arts at the University of Minnesota. Adams became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1968 and lived in Los Angeles, California when he met Australian citizen Anthony Corbett \\"Tony\\" Sullivan in 1971. They were issued a marriage license along with five other gay couples by Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex in Boulder, Colorado on April 21, 1975. They were married by Rev. Elder Freda Smith, clergy in Metropolitan Community Churches and Rev. Robert Sirico (now a Catholic priest but then MCC clergy). The event was witnessed by Rev. Charlie Arehart, pastor of MCC of the Rockies in Denver and Frank Zerilli, Rev. Troy Perry's long-time assistant. In 1975, the couple applied with the Immigration and Naturalization Service for Sullivan to be granted permanent residency as a citizen's spouse. The petition was initially denied, with a letter stating that \\"[Adams and Sullivan] have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots.\\" A revised letter was later sent after they filed a formal protest, explaining that \\"[a] marriage between two males is invalid for immigration purposes and cannot be considered a bona fide marital relationship since neither party to the marriage can perform the female functions in marriage.\\" They sued the INS in 1979, but a federal district judge upheld the INS decision. They also lost their appeals. They later filed a second suit arguing that Sullivan's deportation after the couple had been together for 8 years constituted an \\"extreme hardship.\\" The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their claims, making it possible for Sullivan to be deported. Following that loss, they traveled in Europe for a year, but they eventually returned to the US and stopped doing high-profile activism to avoid attention from immigration authorities. Adams worked as an administrator for a law firm until his retirement in 2010. After retirement, Adams and Sullivan made some appearances at events supporting gay marriage. They are featured in the documentary Limited Partnership, which was released by Tesseract Films in 2014.http://www.limitedpartnershipmovie.com/ Adams died of cancer in Los Angeles in December 2012. On April 21, 2014, on their 39th wedding anniversary, Sullivan filed a motion with the Los Angeles Field Office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to reopen and reconsider Adams' petition for a marriage-based green card. On January 5, 2014, the USCIS approved Adams' immigrant visa petition filed in 1975 on behalf of his husband. Sullivan received his green card on April 21, 2016.

It resulted in the defeat and annexation of the Principality of Wales, and the other last remaining independent Welsh principalities, by Edward I, King of England. By the 13th century Wales was divided between native Welsh principalities and the territories of the Anglo- Norman Marcher lords. The leading principality was Gwynedd whose princes had gained control of the greater part of the country, making the other remaining Welsh princes their vassals, and had taken the title Prince of Wales. Although English monarchs had made several attempts to seize control of the native Welsh territories, it was not until Edward's war of conquest against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (\\"Llywelyn the Last\\") of 1277 to 1283 that this was achieved on a lasting basis. In two campaigns, in 1277 and 1282-1283 respectively, Edward first greatly reduced the territory of the Principality of Wales and then completely overran it, as well as the other remaining Welsh principalities. Most of the conquered territory was retained as a royal fief, and these lands later became, by custom, the territorial endowment of the heir to the English throne with the title Prince of Wales. The remainder would be granted to Edward's supporters as new Marcher lordships. Although the territories would not be effectively incorporated into the Kingdom of England until the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542, Edward's conquest marked the end of Welsh independence. Background: Wales in the High Middle Ages thumbright250pxWales after the Treaty of Montgomery 1267 Following a series of invasions beginning shortly after their conquest of England in 1066, the Normans seized much of Wales and established quasi-independent Marcher lordships, owing allegiance to the English crown. However, Welsh principalities such as Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth survived and from the end of the 11th century, the Welsh began pushing back the Norman advance. Over the following century the Welsh recovery fluctuated and the English kings, notably Henry II, several times sought to conquer or establish suzerainty over the native Welsh principalities. Nevertheless, by the end of the 12th century the Marcher lordships were reduced to the south and south east of the country. The principality of Gwynedd was the dominant power in Wales in the first half of the 13th century, with Powys and Deheubarth becoming tributary states. Gwynedd's princes now assumed the title \\"Prince of Wales\\". But war with England in 1241 and 1245, followed by a dynastic dispute in the succession to the throne, weakened Gwynedd and allowed Henry III to seize Perfeddwlad (also known as the \\"Four Cantrefs\\", the eastern part of the principality). However, from 1256 a resurgent Gwynedd under Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (who became known as \\"Llywelyn the Last\\") resumed the war with Henry and took back Perfeddwlad. By the Treaty of Montgomery of 1267, peace was restored and, in return for doing homage to the English king, Llywelyn was recognised as Prince of Wales and his re- conquest of Perfeddwlad was accepted by Henry. However, sporadic warfare between Llywelyn and some of the Marcher Lords, such as Gilbert de Clare, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun continued. Conquest Immediate causes of war Henry III died in 1272 and was succeeded by his son, Edward I. Whereas Henry's ineffectiveness had led to the collapse of royal authority in England during his reign, Edward was a vigorous and forceful ruler and an able military leader. In 1274, tension between Llywelyn and Edward increased when Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys and Llywelyn's younger brother Dafydd ap Gruffydd defected to the English and sought Edward's protection. The continuing conflict with the Marcher Lords, particularly over Roger Mortimer's new castle at Cefnllys, and Edward's harbouring of defectors led Llewelyn to refuse Edward's demand to come to Chester in 1275 to do homage to him, as required by the Treaty of Montgomery. For Edward, a further provocation came from Llywelyn's planned marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort, the leader of a rebellion against the crown during the reign of Edward's father. In November 1276, Edward declared war on Llywelyn. However, his objective was to put down a recalcitrant vassal rather than to begin a war of conquest. Invasion of 1277 Early in 1277, before the main royal army had been mustered, Edward deployed, in south and mid-Wales, a mixture of forces comprising paid troops, some of the marcher lords' retainers and knights of the royal household. They met with considerable success as many of the native Welsh rulers, resentful of Llywelyn's overlordship, surrendered and joined the English. In July 1277, Edward launched a punitive expedition into North Wales with his own army of 15,500‚Äîof whom 9,000 were Welshmen from the south‚Äîraised through a traditional feudal summons. From Chester the army marched into Gwynedd, camping first at Flint and then Rhuddlan and Deganwy, most likely causing significant damage to the areas it advanced through. A fleet from the Cinque ports provided naval support. Llywelyn soon realised his position was hopeless and quickly surrendered. The campaign never came to a major battle. However, Edward decided to negotiate a settlement rather than attempt total conquest. It may be that he was running short of men and supplies by November 1277 and, in any case, complete conquest of Llywelyn's territories had not been his objective. Treaty of Aberconwy Gwynedd after the Treaty of Aberconwy 1277 By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, Llywelyn was left only with the western part of Gwynedd, though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales. Eastern Gwynedd was split between Edward and Llywelyn's brother Dafydd, with the remainder of the lands that had been tributary to him becoming effectively Edward's. As a result of both territorial expropriation and the submission of the ruling families, Deheubarth, Powys and mid-Wales became a mixture of directly controlled royal land and pliant English protectorates. Edward's victory was comprehensive and it represented a major redistribution of power and territory in Wales in Edward's favour. Edward now enjoyed a degree of direct control in the native Welsh areas which no previous English king had achieved. Campaign of 1282‚Äì83 War broke out again in 1282, as a result of a rebellion by Llywelyn's brother Dafydd, who was discontented with the reward he had received from Edward in 1277. Dafydd launched a series of attacks co-ordinated with the Welsh rulers in Deheubarth and North Powys, who had been Llywelyn's vassals until 1277 and were now Edward's vassals. Llywelyn and the other Welsh leaders, including those in the south, joined in and it soon assumed a very different character from the 1277 campaign. It became a national struggle enjoying wide support among the Welsh, who were provoked particularly by Edward's attempts to impose English law on the Welsh. Edward, however, soon began to see it as a war of conquest rather than just a punitive expedition to put down a rebellion. The Llywelyn Monument at Cilmeri which marks the site of the Battle of Orewin Bridge The English launched a three-pronged attack, with Edward leading his army into North Wales along much the same route as in 1277, Roger Mortimer operating in mid-Wales and the Earl of Gloucester advancing with a substantial army in the south. Initially the Welsh were successful. In June 1282, Gloucester was defeated at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr. Edward replaced him with William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke who raided in the south as far as Aberystwyth but failed to engage with a Welsh army. Edward then suffered a set-back in mid-Wales when his commander there, Roger Mortimer, died in October. On 6 November, while John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, was conducting peace negotiations, Luke de Tany, Edward's commander in Anglesey, decided to carry out a surprise attack. Shortly after Tany and his men had crossed over a pontoon bridge they had built to the mainland, they were ambushed by the Welsh and suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Moel-y- don. However, the war turned in Edward's favour when Llywelyn unexpectedly marched out of North Wales towards Builth in mid-Wales. He was lured into a trap and killed at the Battle of Orewin Bridge on 11 December 1282. Taking advantage of this fortuitous event, Edward raised a new army and boldly marched into Snowdonia in January 1283 and captured Dolwyddelan Castle in the heartland of the Welsh resistance. At the same time de Valence in the south advanced from Cardigan into Meirionnydd. The combination of de Valence's pressure from the south and the king's advance into the north was too much for the Welsh forces. The conquest of Gwynedd was completed with the capture in June 1283 of Dafydd, who had succeeded his brother as prince the previous December. Dafydd was taken to Shrewsbury and executed as a traitor the following autumn. Aftermath thumb200pxleftRoyal lands after the conquest March of Wales Territorial settlement :See also: Principality of Wales: 1284 to 1542 Edward divided the territory of the Welsh principalities between himself (that is, retained under direct royal control) and his supporters through feudal grants, which in practice became new Marcher lordships. The lordships created were mainly grants to Anglo-Normans such as the Earl of Lincoln who received the lordship of Denbigh. But additionally, Edward's Welsh allies received back their own lands, but on a feudal basis; for instance, Owain ap Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn, of the princely house of Powys Wenwynwyn, received his ancestral lands as the lordship of Powys and became known as Owen de la Pole (or \\"Poole\\"). Lands retained under direct royal control were organised under the Statute of Rhuddlan of 1284, which declared that they were \\"annexed and united\\" to the English crown, although they did not become part of the Kingdom of England. They were the King's personal fief and in 1301, they were bestowed on Edward's son, Edward of Caernarfon (the future Edward II), with the title \\"Prince of Wales\\" and thereafter the lands and title became the customary endowment of the heir to the throne. The Statute of Rhuddlan divided the territory under royal control into six shire counties on the English model, administered by royal officials. The Statute also enforced the adoption of English common law in Wales, albeit with some local variation. Welsh law continued to be used in some civil cases such as land inheritance, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance, which Welsh law had allowed them to do. The rest of Wales continued to be constituted as the March of Wales under the rule of Marcher lords as before, from the 1290s Edward began intervening in the affairs of the March to a much greater extent. Colonisation and castle building Caernarfon Castle, the \\"capital\\" of English rule in North Wales for two centuries after the conquest. From 1277, and particularly after 1283, Edward embarked on a policy of English colonisation and settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth, and Rhuddlan. Outside of the towns, Welsh peasants were evicted from key areas and their land resettled by English peasants: for example, in the Lordship of Denbigh 10,000 acres were occupied by English settlers by 1334. Edward's main concern following his victory was to ensure the military security of his new territories and the stone castle was to be the primary means for achieving this. Under the supervision of James of Saint George, Edward's master-builder, a series of imposing castles was built, using a distinctive design and the most advanced defensive features of the day, to form a \\"ring of stone\\" around north Wales. Among the major buildings were the castles of Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Conwy and Harlech. Further rebellions Rebellions continued to occur in Wales sporadically. These included revolts in 1287‚Äì8, and more seriously, in 1294 under Madog ap Llywelyn, a distant relative of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd and in 1316‚Äì1318 by Llywelyn Bren, Lord of Senghenydd. In the 1370s, Owain Lawgoch the last representative in the male line of the ruling house of Gwynedd planned two invasions of Wales with French support. In 1400, a Welsh nobleman, Owain Glynd≈µr (or Owen Glendower), led the most serious revolt against English rule. None of these rebellions succeeded and by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 Wales was effectively incorporated into the Kingdom of England. Consequences for England There was an unforeseen constitutional impact for England. The financial cost of the conquest was heavy. Including the construction of the new castles, Edward spent around ¬£173,000 to achieve it. Additionally, the exchequer had to bear the cost of the ongoing military presence in Wales, including maintenance of the castles. The king's financial need contributed to the extension of the role and membership of the English Parliament as taxes were needed to be raised in consequence.

It was Leander's first film for the German studio UFA, and its success brought her into the front rank of the company's stars.Ascheid p. 177 It was shot at the Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. Synopsis London, 1846. Gloria Vane, is a cabaret singer and the lover of Sir Albert Finsbury, a selfish aristocrat set to join the royal cavalry in Australia, as an officer. The night before Albert leaves England, he begs a friend for money to repay debts. The angry friend gives Albert only ¬£15, instead of the ¬£615 Albert needs, so Albert forges the number 6 before the 15 on the check. When his forgery is discovered, Albert has already left. Gloria confesses to the crime out of love for Albert and to protect his promising career as an officer. Gloria is tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be transported to Australia to serve seven years in the Parramatta prison in Sydney. In prison, Gloria dreams only of being reunited with Albert, and writes him a letter, begging him to rescue her. Albert is already engaged, however, to Mary Jones, the daughter of his commanding officer, the Governor of New South Wales. Albert is also having an affair with Fanny, the wife of a local doctor, Dr. Hoyer. Albert tears up Gloria's letter, afraid she will endanger his career. Albert goes to the prison, but cannot bring himself to visit Gloria, though he learns from the prison wardress that he could save Gloria. The wardress tells Albert that, due to the shortage of women in the colony, any female prisoner can be released, if she finds a man to marry her. Meanwhile, Henry Hoyer, a local farmer and horse breeder, sees Gloria leaving the prison chapel and falls instantly in love. Henry is Dr. Hoyer‚Äôs nephew and recently sold Albert a horse, but knows nothing of Albert's connection to Gloria. Gloria eventually allows herself to be paraded with the marriageable female prisoners before the male suitors. Henry attends the event and tells the wardress he will marry Gloria. Gloria half-heartedly agrees, to get out of prison. However, as Gloria and Henry ride back to his farm, she admits she loves Albert and cannot marry Henry. She intended to abandon Henry with no explanation, but tells him he‚Äôs so kind she cannot bear to leave without telling him the truth. Gloria jumps from his wagon and runs back to the city, leaving Henry brokenhearted. Gloria learns Albert is at a ball celebrating Queen Victoria's birthday, at the Governor's mansion. She races there, but as she waits for him outside, she hears the announcement of his engagement to Mary and leaves, despondent. Meanwhile, out on his farm, Henry also learns of Albert's engagement to Mary and realizes Gloria will be left all alone. Still in love with Gloria, Henry races back to Sydney to rescue her. Albert finds Gloria working at a dingy music hall. He watches her perform a gloomy song about her broken heart, then talks to her backstage. Gloria is a broken woman. She turns down Albert's offer to stay with her, telling him she no longer loves him - he left her in prison too long, it is too late. Gloria reveals she was convicted of the check fraud he committed. Overwhelmed with guilt, Albert commits suicide that night, on the eve of his wedding to Mary. The next day, Gloria gets fired from the music hall for singing such a depressing song. With nothing left in her life, she returns to the prison and asks to be readmitted. Henry and Dr. Hoyer discover Albert's corpse and word is sent to the Governor's mansion that the wedding ceremony must be cancelled. Dr. Hoyer returns home and tells Fanny that Albert is dead. Fanny assumes her husband killed Albert, since he knew about their affair all along. Fanny hurries to arrange their escape, but Dr. Hoyer explains he did not kill Albert. Fanny's urge to protect Dr. Hoyer convinces him that she truly loves him, and he forgives her for her affair. Henry goes to the music hall and learns Gloria has returned to prison. Henry finds Gloria in the prison chapel, where he first fell in love with her. Henry tells Gloria he still loves her and asks her to be his wife. They are married alongside Gloria's best friend from prison, who they discover is simultaneously marrying an employee of Henry's.

It is a semi-regular variable nearing the end of its life. Discovery HD 179821 was first catalogued as an unremarkable 8th magnitude star at the start of the 20th century. It was later listed as a spectral standard G4 0-Ia, indicating a highly luminous star type now known as a hypergiant. It was first considered notable for its infrared excess and double-peaked spectral energy distribution in the infrared. These were considered to be indicators of surrounding dust and HD 179821 was identified as a possible proto-planetary nebula. Variability was also detected. High resolution spectroscopic studies and modern space-based observations have revealed an unusual chemical makeup and a hollow spherical dust shell, but haven't fully resolved whether HD 179821 is a highly luminous yellow hypergiant or a more modest dying star. Observations HD 179821 has a cold detached dust shell that has been studied with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope. The shell is approximately circular in shape, has an inner diameter of ~3\\".3 corresponding to 20,000 AU at 6,000 pc, and an outer diameter of 5\\".7 or more, with the star 0\\".35 from the centre of the shell. The current mass loss is low, but during the formation of the shell it is estimated to have been , an exceptionally high rate. Like its constellation neighbor and also hypergiant star IRC +10420, it is surrounded by an extended reflection nebula. Discovered at near-IR wavelength, this indicates a massive star and, as with the reflection nebula around IRC+10420, it may be masking a star hotter than the given G5 spectral type. It is that which contributes to a double-peaked spectral energy distribution. It is estimated the star has lost about 10% of its initial mass after being a red supergiant star just 1,600 years ago, and is a likely supernova candidate. The distance is estimated to be around 6,000 parsecs and has a high luminosity of between and and a radius of between 400 and . It has a high radial velocity of . According to the studies of Jura et al (2001), the star may explode as a supernova in the next 100,000 years. Variability HD 179821 is a semiregular variable star with the variable star designation V1427 Aquilae. Between 1899 and 1989, its photographic apparent magnitude varied erratically between about magnitudes 9 and 10, although coverage is not complete and some larger variations may have been missed. It then varied by no more than 0.1 magnitudes until 2009, at a visual magnitude around 8.1. The colour of the star changed noticeably so that the variability at different wavelengths is not consistent. In general, the star became bluer from 1899 until 1990, and then redder again. The colour changes most likely reflect changes in the effective temperature, and probably underlying evolutionary trends with the star performing a blue loop between temperatures of and . Pulsations for much of this time occurred with an approximate period of 100 to 150 days, although this increased to 250 days between 2010 and 2017, which is expected for stars which are decreasing in temperature. At its coolest, the spectral type has been recorded as K4, while near its hottest in 2007 it was classifies F7. Chemical composition The chemical composition of this star differs from that of other yellow supergiant stars. The star is moderately metal-deficient and the main elements present in the star (apart from hydrogen and helium) are oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. Molecules such as hydrogen isocyanide, sulfur monoxide and HCO+ have been detected in the circumstellar envelope of the star. These molecules may result from an active photochemistry, generated by UV photons emitted by the central star as it warms up, or can be produced in shocks. Controversy While most authors consider HD 179821 to be a warm supergiant or hypergiant star, others think it is actually a protoplanetary nebula or a post-AGB star at a distance of 1 kiloparsec (3,200 light years). In that case the star's luminosity and radius would be much lower, around 16,000 times that of the Sun and 60 to , and its initial mass would be equal to the current mass of the Sun. This discrepancy arises because its distance was too great to be measured by parallax before the Gaia mission and it has some properties of both a yellow hypergiant and a protoplanetary nebula/Post-AGB star. Gaia Data Release 2 gives a parallax of implying a distance around .

Left Right Left revolves around the lives of Jayan (Indrajith), Roy (Murali Gopy), Sahadevan (Hareesh Peradi), Anitha (Lena) and Jennifer (Remya Nambeesan). Released on 14 June 2013, the film was set in three periods ‚Äì the 60s/70s, the 80s/90s and the present day. It got mostly positive reviews upon release but drew occasional criticism for some of its characters and scenes resembling real- life political leaders and incidents. However, it has gathered a cult status over the years as one of the finest political thrillers ever made in Malayalam. Murali Gopy's performance won him the 61st Filmfare Awards (South) for The Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Lena won Kerala State Film Award for the Second Best Actress. Plot The story revolves around P. K. Jayan aka 'Vattu' ('Mad') Jayan (Indrajith), Roy Joseph aka 'Che Guevera' Roy (Murali Gopy) and Kaitheri Sahadevan (Hareesh Peradi). The film opens with formative events from their childhood - Sahadevan and Roy losing their fathers to thugs employed by their opponents (in two separate incidents), and Jayan losing his ill sister to lack of money for an operation. Jayan grows up to become a somewhat corrupt policeman, Roy a communist who teaches in a school with his wife Anitha (Lena), and Sahadevan a ruthless leader of the Communist Party. Roy and two of his friends expose a case of corruption in which Sahadevan is involved. The two friends are mysteriously murdered, while Roy is spared; purportedly because of Sahadevan's respect for Roy's father. Sahadevan tells Roy about his painful childhood, claiming that his actions are aimed at ensuring that his followers and his own children do not suffer as he and his ancestors did. Roy's friend and neighbour Jayan grows close to Jennifer (Remya Nambeesan). Once, when her estranged husband assaults her, he attacks him, resulting in his death. He is placed under investigation, but learns that Sahadevan might be able to help him. Sahadevan agrees to help if he apologises to some of Sahadevan's loyalists whom he had insulted earlier. Jayan refuses. One day, Roy collapses and is taken to a hospital. The doctor is enjoying a game of billiards with his friends, and lies that he is busy. His assistant is unable to save Roy. Anitha tells Jayan the story of their old friendship with Sahadevan, and how Roy's idealism and Sahadevan's use of violence and trickery soured the relationship. Jayan finally learns that Sahadevan had once hired goons to attack Roy, maiming him for life and eventually leading to his death. In his anger, he stabs Sahadevan, killing him. Jayan is then arrested by the police. Cast *Indrajith as P.K.

A character promo video of the movie was released, the first of its kind in a Malayalam film. The video titled 'LRL Anthem', sung by Murali Gopy, gives a glimpse of the incidents that shape the personalities and mindset of the three main characters in the movie. Reception Critical response The Times of India rated the movie (3/5) and stated that \\"Loads of brilliance goes into each character. Few films have shown more intensity in depicting the effects of politics on individuals than Left Right Left.\\" Jabir Mushthari of The Hindu found the movie to be refreshing and said, \\"The movie entertainingly refers to a number of issues presently faced by society even while seeking answers to certain key questions such as who is a \\"real communist\\" and what their plight is in the changing scenario.\\" Malayala Manorama rated the movie (3/5) and called it a 'feast for discerning film connoisseurs'. Deccan Chronicle rated the movie (3.5/5). Suresh Kumar of East Coast Daily compared the movie to classics from the Golden Era of Malayalam Film. Veeyen of Nowrunning.com rated the film (3/5) and said \\"'Left Right Left' has a rare, melancholic, poetic power that is magical in more ways than one. It invites the audience to delve deep beneath the rugged, craggy portrait of the society that we live in. A glorious tale on perseverance, struggles and survival, 'Left Right Left' enters the pantheon of must-see movies with grace.\\" Sify.com rated the movie as Good. Yentha.com rated the movie (3.5/5)and said that \\"For anyone who is exasperated by the ragbag of 'one time watch' films now-a-days, this film is a relief.\\" Oneindia.in stated that the movie has a hard-hitting tale, which is thought provoking and sure to start serious debate on the topic that it deals with. Webdunia.com called it the best Malayalam movie of recent times. Paresh C Palicha of Rediff.com called it a brilliant movie and said \\"The film can be described as intense, gritty, real, brave and most of all, honest. It depicts the degradation of politics today and tries to analyse where it all comes from, justifying the tagline 'Revolution is home made.\\" G Krishnamurthy of Movieraga opined that Left Right Left is not a movie, but a mirror image of the political and social set up in Kerala.

In a racing career which began in July 2011, he ran twenty-eight times and won thirteen races. As a two-year-old in 2011, he won his two of his four races. In 2012, he won the Satsuki Sh≈ç and the Kikuka Sh≈ç, the first and third legs of the Japanese Triple Crown. In December, he defeated a strong field in the weight-for-age invitational Arima Kinen, which led to his being rated the best three-year-old racehorse in the world by some authorities. As a four-year-old, he ran disappointingly in the Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç but returned to form to win the Takarazuka Kinen. As a five-year-old, Gold Ship became the first horse to record a second victory in the Takarazuka Kinen and in 2015 he added a win in the Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç. He was known for his unpredictable temperament, with major wins being interspersed with inexplicably poor efforts. Background Gold Ship is a light-coloured grey horse bred in Japan by his owner Eiichi Kobayashi. His sire, Stay Gold, a son of the thirteen-time Leading sire in Japan Sunday Silence, was a successful international performer, winning the Dubai Sheema Classic and the Hong Kong Vase. Standing at stud at the Big Red Farm in Hokkaido, he produced numerous important winners including Dream Journey, Orfevre, and Nakayama Festa. Gold Ship's dam, Point Flag, from whom he inherited his grey coat, was a daughter of the Hall of Fame inductee Mejiro McQueen. Racing career 2011: two-year-old season Gold Ship began his racing career in Hokkaido by winning a maiden race at Hakodate Racecourse on 9 July and followed up with a win in the nine-furlong Cosmos Stakes at Sapporo Racecourse on 10 September. He was then moved up to Group Three class to contest the Sapporo Stakes over the same course and distance on 1 October. He started at odds of 7/2 and finished second, half a length behind the winner, Grandezza. On his only other start of the season, he finished second to Adam's Peak in the Group Three Radio Nikkei Hai Nisai Stakes over ten furlongs at Hanshin Racecourse on 24 December. 2012: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Gold Ship contested the Group Three Kyodo News Service Hai (Tokinominoru Kinen) at Tokyo Racecourse in February. Ridden for the first time by Hiroyuki Uchida, he overtook the leader, Deep Brillante, inside the final furlong to record his first win by one and three quarter lengths. In April at Nakayama Racecourse Gold Ship started at odds of 6.1/1 for the Satsuki Sh≈ç, the first leg of the Japanese Triple Crown. Apparently relishing the extremely wet conditions, he came from last place to take the lead in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from World Ace and Deep Brilante, with Grandezza and Adam's Peak unplaced. Gold Ship was made the 2.1/1 second favourite for the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) over one and a half miles and finished fifth, one and a half lengths behind the winner, Deep Brillante. Gold Ship returned from the summer break in the Group Two Kobe Shimbun Hai, a trial race for the Kikuka Sh≈ç (Japanese St Leger), at Hanshin on 27 September. He started the 1.3/1 favourite and won by two and a half lengths from fifteen opponents. A month later, he started odds-on favourite for the Kikuka Sh≈ç over fifteen furlongs at Kyoto Racecourse and won by one and three quarter lengths from Sky Dignity. As in the Satsuki Sh≈ç, the colt came from last place before he \\"cruised\\" to victory, although the competition was less strong than anticipated following the late withdrawal of Deep Brillante, who had sustained a tendon injury. Gold Ship was one of sixteen horses to be invited to contest the all-aged Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 23 December. He was towards the back of the field before moving up on the wide outside on the approach to the straight. In the closing stages, he overtook the leaders and won by one and a half lengths from Ocean Blue, with Uchida standing up in the irons and saluting the crowd as he crossed the line. The 42-year-old jockey won for the first time after recovering from a broken back sustained in a fall in May 2011. Naosuke Sugai said that the horse would stay in Japan in 2013 before challenging for international races such as the Dubai World Cup and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2014, saying that \\"this is just the beginning for him\\". Britain's Racing Post described the winner's performance as \\"a stunning display\\" whilst pointing out that Japan's other two outstanding middle-distance horses, Orfevre and Gentildonna, had bypassed the race. 2013: four-year-old season Gold Ship began his four-year-old season on 17 March in the Group Two Hanshin Daishoten, a trial race for the Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç. Starting at odds of 1/10 he won the fourteen-furlong race by two lengths from Desperado. On 28 April, the colt was moved up further in distance for the two- mile Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç at Kyoto. He started odds-on favourite and finished fifth of the eighteen runners behind Fenomeno. On 23 June, Gold Ship met Fenomeno again in the Takarazuka Kinen at Hanshin Racecourse where the field, which was decided by public ballot, also included Gentildonna. Orfevre was withdrawn from the race after bleeding after an exercise gallop on 14 June. Uchida positioned the grey just behind the early leaders before moving up on the outside in the straight. He hit the front inside the final furlong and drew clear to win by three and a half lengths from the five-year-old Danon Ballade, with Gentildonna third and Fenomeno fourth. Gold Ship's autumn campaign began in the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten on 2 October. He was made the 1/5 favourite and finished fifth of the thirteen runners behind the 165/1 outsider Hit The Target. Sugai offered several explanations for the colt's poor run, including the unseasonably hot weather, the fast track, and an unfavourable draw. On 24 November, Gold Ship started second favourite behind Gentildonna for the Japan Cup. He was never in contention at any stage and finished fifteenth of the seventeen runners. For the horse's last race of the year, the British jockey Ryan Moore took over from Uchida in the Arima Kinen. He started at odds of 17/5 and finished third behind Orfevre and Win Variation. 2014: five-year- old season Gold Ship began his fourth season by repeating his 2013 success in the Hanshin Daishoten: he started the 7/10 favourite and won by three and a half lengths from Admire Rakti. On 4 May, Gold Ship started 3.3/1 second favourite for the Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç but was never near enough to challenge and finished seventh of the eighteen runners behind Fenomeno. On 29 June at Hanshin, he attempted to become the first horse to record back-to-back victories in the Takarazuka Kinen. Ridden by Norihiro Yokoyama, he started the 17/10 favourite in a field of twelve which included Gentildonna, Meisho Mambo, Tosen Jordan, Verxina, Denim And Ruby, and Win Variation. Gold Ship started poorly but recovered well and raced behind the leaders on the outside before taking the lead in the straight. He drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from the 55/1 outsider Curren Mirotic. After the race, Yokoyama said, \\"He's a clever horse and whether he performs well or not depends on his mood. So I'm relieved that he lived up to the expectations of many fans\\". Gold Ship was then aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and began his preparation for the race with a run in the Grade 2 Sapporo Kinen over ten furlongs at Sapporo Racecourse on 24 August. He finished second, beaten three- quarters of a length by Oka Sho winner Harp Star. Sugai said that it was \\"no disgrace to fail\\" when attempting to concede eleven pounds to the three-year- old filly. In the Arc de Triomphe on 5 October, Gold Ship started at odds of 12.9/1 in a three-horse Japanese challenge which also included Harp Star and Just A Way. After becoming agitated in the pre-race parade, he started poorly and raced at the back of the twenty-runner field for most of the way. He made some progress in the straight but never looked likely to make a serious challenge and finished fourteenth of the twenty runners, seven lengths behind the winner, Treve. Shortly after his return from Europe, Gold Ship topped the poll to decide the runners for the Arima Kinen. At Nakayama on 28 December he started the favourite for the Arima Kinen ahead of Epiphaneia, Just A Way and Gentildonna. He made steady progress on the outside in the straight but was unable to reach the leaders and finished third, beaten three quarters of a length and a nose by Gentildonna and To The World. 2015: six-year-old season On his first appearance of the new year, Gold Ship produced what the Racing Post described as a \\"dismal display\\" when finishing unplaced in the American Jockey Club Cup at Nakayama on 25 January. On 23 March Gold Ship recorded his 2015 campaign by winning the Hanshin Daishoten for the third consecutive time. On 4 May he made his third attempt to win the spring edition of the Tenn≈ç Sh≈ç and started second favourite behind Kizuna in a seventeen- runner field. He started slowly and was towards the rear for the first half of the race, but made rapid progress on the back straight and turned for home in fourth place. Curren Mirotic opened up a clear lead, but Gold Ship produced a sustained run to take the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from the fast-finishing Fame Game. After the race Yokoyama said \\"I was thinking of going front if he started well, which obviously was not the case. From there on, I just concentrated on following the pace and careful not to turn him off. In the straight, he really showed his stamina and perseverance\\". On 28 June, the grey started 9/10 favourite as he attempted a record third win in the Takarazuka Kinen. After appearing to panic in the starting stalls he lost many lengths at the start and finished fifteenth of the sixteen runners behind Lovely Day. Yokoyama commented \\"I'm not sure what had happened in his mind because he can't tell us... he is just Gold Ship\\". Gold Ship returned in the autumn of 2015 for two more races before retirement. On 29 November he started the 3.7/1 second favourite for the Japan Cup. He finished tenth but was only three lengths behind the winner Shonan Pandora. He ended his racing career by running for the fourth time in the Arima Kinen on 27 December. He was made 3.1/1 favourite but finished eighth of the sixteen runners behind Gold Actor. Gold Ship's retirement ceremony followed the race. Assessment and awards Following his win in the 2012 Arima Kinen, the Racing Post rated Gold Ship the best three-year-old in the world, one pound ahead of Camelot, I'll Have Another, and Dullahan. Although he finished second to the filly Gentildonna in the vote for Japanese Horse of the Year he was the unanimous winner of the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt. In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racechorse Rankings Gold Ship was rated the second-best three- year-old colt, one pound behind I'll Have Another, and the thirteenth best horse in the world. In 2013, Gold Ship was rated the eleventh-best racehorse in the world in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings and the equal second best four-year-old behind Novellist and level with Declaration of War. He was again rated eleventh in the 2014 edition of the rankings. In the JRA Awards for 2014, Gold Ship finished third to Just A Way and Epiphaneia in the poll for the JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse.

The station is located in Saudi Arabia, approximately 100 km north- west of Dammam, but was built for and owned by Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority (GCCIA). The converter station was built by Areva T&D;, now Alstom Grid, between 2006 and 2009. GCCIA is constructing a 400 kV, 50 Hz AC transmission line to interconnect Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar through Saudi Arabia. Later phases will also connect Oman and United Arab Emirates. The Al-Fadhili HVDC system allows power to be exchanged between the 50 Hz GCCIA system and the 60 Hz Saudi Electricity Company system. The converter station consists three identical poles, each with a nominal power transmission rating of 600 MW and an overload rating of 660 MW. Each pole has nominal DC voltage and current ratings of 222 kV, 2776 A. Unlike most HVDC systems, which are designed to be used more or less continuously for transmission of power, the Al-Fadhili system is normally intended to remain in standby mode, only transmitting power between the two systems after a major loss of generation in one system. The converter poles are normally kept blocked but the control systems continuously monitor the frequencies of the two grids and, upon detection of a sudden change of frequency, deblock one or two poles as needed to restore the shortage of power. This allows Spinning reserve to be shared between the two system and as a result the concept is known as Dynamic Reserve Power Sharing (DRPS). With a total power rating of 1800 MW, the Al-Fadhili system was, on completion, the largest HVDC back-to-back system in the world Sadullah, S., Ebrahim, A., Application of a HVDC Link to Promote Stability by Sharing Dynamic Reserve Power after Generation Deficiencies, IEEE Power Systems Conference and Exposition, 2009. and the first HVDC system in the Middle East.

The concept was defined by David A. Garvin, formerly C. Roland Christensen Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School (died 30 April 2017).Harvard Business School, Harvard Business School Professor David A. Garvin Dies at 64, 5 May 2017, accessed 3 January 2018 Garvin was posthumously honored with the prestigious award for 'Outstanding Contribution to the Case Method' on 4 March 2018. Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not‚Äîimprovement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the trade-offs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage. Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows: #Performance: Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. #Features: Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user. #Reliability: Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail. #Conformance: Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards. #Durability: Durability measures the length of a product‚Äôs life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. #Serviceability: Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service person. #Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual‚Äôs personal preference. #Perceived Quality: Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures. Performance Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste. Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard. Features Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user. Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the \\"bells and whistles\\" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw. Reliability Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail. This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly. Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis. Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates. Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. For example, recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute. Conformance The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product‚Äôs design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran. All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met. On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called ‚Äútolerance stack-up‚Äù. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly. This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favored process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of ‚Äútolerance stack-up‚Äù is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together. In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes. Durability Durability measures the length of a product‚Äôs life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. As well The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products \\"one- hoss shays\\" (Oliver Wendel Holmes poem). In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair. This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed. Serviceability Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel (example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time). Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel. Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality. Some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service, while others can be measured quite objectively. Customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs. How these complaints are handled is important to a company's reputation for quality and service. Eventually, profitability is likely to be affected as well. Companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability. Some do their best to resolve complaints; others use legal gimmicks, the silent treatment and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers. For example, recently, General Electric, Procter & Gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing toll- free telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments. Important attributes for the serviceability dimension are service warranty, parts warranty, parts availability, distance to dealer service centers, distance to service parts center-dealer, distance to service parts center individual, length of wait for service appointment, schedule of preventive maintenance, employees listen to customers, information regarding repairs, courteous service centers, repaired correctly first time, service time relative to other dealers, warranty claims handled without argument, average repair cost/year, extended warranty, underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car. Aesthetics or Style The aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand. Faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties, even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality, are often cause for rejection. Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference. Nevertheless, there appear to be some patterns in consumers' rankings of products on the basis of taste. A recent study of quality in 33 food categories, for example, found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as \\"rich and full flavor, tastes natural, tastes fresh, good aroma, appetizing looks\\". Aesthetics also refers to the \\"outside\\" feel of the product. The aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to \\"performance\\" in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal. Not all people prefer \\"rich and full\\" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone. Quality in Japanese culture In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu. * atarimae hinshitsu ‚Äì The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the \\"atarimae\\" quality requirement is met. * miryokuteki hinshitsu ÔºàÈ≠ÖÂäõÁöÑÂìÅË≥™Ôºâ‚Äì The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from \\"atarimae hinshitsu\\" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the \\"miryokuteki\\" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product. In the design of goods or services, atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have. Perceived Quality Perception is not always reality. Consumers do not always have complete information about a product's or service's attributes; indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands. A product's durability for example, can seldom be observed directly; it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product. In such circumstances, images, advertising and brand names -inferences about quality rather than the reality itself- can be critical. For this reason, both Honda -which makes cars in Marysville, Ohio- and Sony -which builds color televisions in San Diego- have been reluctant to publicize that their products are \\"made in America\\". Reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality. Its power comes from an unstated analogy: that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday, or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a company's established products.

Although its cultural affiliation is disputed, it is an important archaeological site. Geographic context and early history In 1908, forty-one different earthworks were known in Greene County.Broadstone, M.A., ed. History of Greene County Ohio: Its People, Industries and Institutions. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Bowen, 1918, 76. One of these is located atop the cliffs near a large natural spring called the \\"Yellow Spring\\", close to the village of Yellow Springs.Dills, R.S.

During the 1840 election campaign, the mound served as an orator's platform for Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, who spoke before a great audience on the same summer afternoon. Until it was excavated in 1953, the mound was built of stone and measured in diameter and high, although its size may have grown since white settlement of the region, since locals are known to have added earth to the mound to resist erosion.Case, D. Troy, and Christopher Carr. The Scioto Hopewell and Their Neighbors: Bioarchaeological Documentation and Cultural Understanding. New York: Springer, 2007, 360.

Accessed 2012-12-22. a National Natural Landmark.Ohio, National Park Service, 2012-06-28. Accessed 2012-12-23. Excavations The earliest known excavation of the mound took place in 1953 and 1954, under the supervision of a man known as Frank Van Wort; little of this excavation is known, because Van Wort published no reports of his work nor wrote any surviving unpublished reports. It appeared that he tried to dig through the middle of the mound but missed slightly to the northern side. A more systematic excavation was conducted in 1971 by Antioch College students under the supervision of archaeologist Wolfgang Marschall; under his work, Van Wort's work was exposed, and approximately one-third of the entire mound was excavated. Their work revealed the presence of a burial chamber at the heart of the mound. Archaeologists have failed to come to a conclusion on the archaeological culture that built the mound. Van Wort found five skeletons within the mound ‚Äî two men and three infants ‚Äî that he interpreted as being from the Adena culture, as well as Adena-style projectile points. Conversely, Marschall's team recovered detailed information about skeletons, grave goods, their relationships with each other, and the general stratigraphy of the mound, and their work concluded that the mound was produced by later Hopewellian peoples. Seven skeletons from this excavation, along with various artifacts and records of the excavation, were placed in the Dayton Museum of Natural History. Preservation The mound's location within Glen Helen puts it in the bounds of a nature reserve and a National Natural Landmark. It was given further protection in 1974, at which time it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it is currently one of six archaeological sites on the Register in Greene County. The mound's continued preservation was threatened in 2008, as maintenance funding and labor was ended when Antioch College closed for lack of funds, but multiple grants obtained in 2010 included money for upgrading the trail by which the mound is accessed.

Badr had a confrontational approach during his term. Early life and education Badr was born in the Minya province of the southern Egypt on 28 February 1926. He graduated from police academy in 1946. Career Badr began his career as a police officer in 1947. He served as the governor of Asyut in the Upper Egypt. He also served in the ministry of interior during the term of Nabawi Ismail, and was in charge of the central region of Minya. He was the key man in the Egyptian government's struggle against the underground extremists cells. He took strong measures on Asyut when extremists rioted in the city after Anwar Sadat's assassination in October 1981. Minister of Interior Badr was appointed interior minister on 27 February 1986, replacing Ahmed Rushdi in the post. Shortly after his appointment Badr fired or transferred hundreds of security officials from March to August 1986. He was the most disliked man in the cabinet due to his hardliner approach against Islamic \\"fundamentalist\\" movements. He confronted nearly all groups in the society in order to achieve the regime's goal of eliminating Islamist militant entities in Egypt. Badr also toughly struggled against drug trafficking, black market currency speculation and extremism during his term. On the other hand, human rights activists in Egypt criticized him for the violations of civil liberties, since his brutal policies were experienced everywhere in the country, including the universities. Badr ordered the arrest for the relatives of the fugitive Islamic Group leaders. These people were tortured at Ain Shams police station and the state security intelligence department in Lazughli. This event was one of the triggers of the assassination attempt against Badr in 1989. However, Badr was a frequent and respectful guest at gatherings of Copts, who supported for his iron fist. Badr was sacked by the President Hosni Mubarak in January 1990 and replaced by Abdul Halim Moussa in the post. No explanation was given for the dismissal of Badr. However, a scandal he had been involved was the reason for his removal. On the other hand, Najib Ghadbian regards Badr's removal as one of three steps towards democracy in Egypt occurred in 1990. Assassination attempt During his term as interior minister on 16 December 1989, Badr became the target of an assassination attempt when a Suzuki pickup truck loaded with gunpowder exploded in a Cairo suburb seconds before his motorcade was to pass. He survived the attack, and nobody was hurt in the blast. The driver of the truck, Youssef Hasan Mahmoud, who was a 24-year-old medical student, was arrested while trying to escape the scene. The perpetrators were the members of the Islamic Group whose relatives had been arrested and tortured earlier, including Ayman Zawahiri. Controversy When he was interior minister, Badr referred to Islamist extremists as \\"mad dogs, with all respect to dogs.\\" In 1994, Badr and his successor as interior minister Abdul Halim Moussa accused each other of corruption and wrongdoing. Personal life Badr was married and had two sons. One of his sons, Ahmad Zaki, was appointed minister of education by Hosni Mobarak in 2010. His family founded a charitable foundation, the Zaki Badr Foundation, in the United States. Death Badr died at a hospital in the United States on 2 April 1997.

Santa Mar√≠a has been witness of important events of the history of Chile and the world. History Santa Mar√≠a Island was called Tralca or Penequen by their Mapuche inhabitants and she was discovered, for the Europeans, by Juan Bautista Pastene possibly seen in 1544, but in any case in 1550, during his second voyage. Thomas Cavendish sacked and looted the dependencies in 1586, during his first voyage. Later, also pirates from Netherlands, Joris van Spilbergen, Simon de Cordes, Hendrik Brouwer anchored at the island and they were supplied with fresh water and wood. In 1642, the Dutch East India Company joined the Dutch West Indies Company in organizing an expedition to Chile to establish a base for their trade at the west coast of South America. Valdivia, Chilo√© Island and Santa Mar√≠a Island came into consideration because they were isolated from Chile but with harbours. Valdivia, like all cities south of B√≠o B√≠o River, had been abandoned by Spaniards and destroyed by the Mapuches in 1599 during the Destruction of the Seven Cities. The fleet sailed from Dutch Brazil where John Maurice of Nassau provided them with supplies. After landing on Chiloe Island, Brouwer made a pact with the Mapuche, in permanent War of Arauco against Spain, to aid in establishing a resettlement at Valdivia. However, on August 7, 1643 Hendrik died (at the age of 62) before arriving, and was succeeded by his vice-admiral Elias Herckman, who landed at the ruins of Valdivia on August 24. Brouwer was buried in the new settlement, which Herckman named Brouwershaven after him. Herckman and his men occupied the location only until October 28, 1643. Having been told that the Dutch had plans to return to the location, the Spanish viceroy in Peru sent 1000 men in twenty ships (and 2000 men by land, who never made it) in 1644 to resettle Valdivia and fortify it. The Spanish soldiers in the new garrison disinterred and burned Brouwer's body.Robbert Kock The Dutch in Chili at coloniavoyage.comKris E.

On 26 October 1818 anchored at the island the First Chilean Navy Squadron under the command of Manuel Blanco Encalada and captured several ships of a Spanish convoy carrying men and weapons for El Callao. On 1 November 1914, the Battle of Coronel was fought off Santa Mar√≠a Island. HMS Good Hope was sunk with the loss of all lives approximately 10 miles east of the island. On 22 April 1924, the SV Garthwray ran aground on Santa Mar√≠a Island in a fog.

History The Ohio State Limited arriving at Dayton Union Station in September 1967, three months before service ended NYC began the Ohio State Limited on April 27, 1924. The new service departed Grand Central Terminal at 3 PM, just after the 20th Century Limited, with a scheduled arrival in Cincinnati of 9:30 AM the following morning. A section of the train split at Cleveland, Ohio to serve Toledo, Ohio, while the Boston & Albany Railroad exchanged through cars for Boston, Massachusetts at Albany, New York. The train used the Big Four route between Toledo and Cincinnati. In 1941 the Ohio State Limited began receiving lightweight streamlined equipment, becoming part of the NYC's famed \\"Great Steel Fleet.\\" The train was fully re- equipped with lightweight equipment by 1949. Its chief postwar rival was the Pennsylvania Railroad's Cincinnati Limited. By 1960 the eastbound trip of train at Buffalo picked up coaches and sleeping cars from the NYC's #376, from Toronto, Ontario for continuous service to New York City.

The end came on December 2, 1967, when NYC eliminated all named trains in anticipation of a transition toward short-haul corridor services. The last remnant of the Ohio State Limited was a rump coach trip between Cleveland-Cincinnati, often running with a single car. This remained the case after the Penn Central merger and survived until Amtrak took over most passenger services on May 1, 1971, when it was discontinued.

It was never utilized for regular passenger service. The design of the Z√©bulon resembled that of the MF 67 A-series, but the stainless steel design of the train made it very difficult for the RATP to maintain, and was extremely susceptible to vandalism. Both of these reasons eventually led to the train's demise. The Z√©bulon was composed of five cars, although there was a sixth car that was unused. The composition consisted of M.10003 + N.11003 + NA.12002 + N.11004 + M.10004. The train was also equipped with twin bogies. Although the Z√©bulon spent most of its time (roughly 30 years) at the RATP training centre, it briefly circulated on Lines 3, 7, and 9. In 2010, the train succumbed to heavy vandalism and was deemed to be beyond repair.

It is a surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and recommended when there is constant (not just intermittent) numbness, muscle weakness, or atrophy, and when night-splinting no longer controls intermittent symptoms of pain in the carpal tunnel. In general, milder cases can be controlled for months to years, but severe cases are unrelenting symptomatically and are likely to result in surgical treatment. Approximately 500,000 surgical procedures are performed each year, and the economic impact of this condition is estimated to exceed $2 billion annually. Indications The procedure is used as a treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome and according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) treatment guidelines, early surgery is an option when there is clinical evidence of median nerve denervation or the patient elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment. Management decisions rely on several factors, including the etiology and chronicity of CTS, symptom severity, and individual patient choices. Nonsurgical treatment measures are appropriate in the initial management of most idiopathic cases of CTS. Splinting and corticosteroid injections may be prescribed, and they have proven benefits. Steroid injections can provide relief if symptoms are of short duration. If no improvement is seen following steroid injection, carpal tunnel release may not be as effective.AAOS Comprehensive Orthopaedic Review. 2014. Surgical treatment is indicated in acute cases of CTS from trauma or infection, in chronic cases with denervation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle or a pronounced sensory loss, and in cases unresponsive to conservative management. Before pursuing CTR, confirmation of the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is recommended, given that the symptoms of median nerve entrapment can overlap with other disorders including: cervical radiculopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, and pronator syndrome. Beyond physical exam testing, confirmatory electrodiagnostic studies are recommended for all patients being considered for surgery. Nerve conduction studies are reported to be 90% sensitive and 60% specific for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. These studies provide the surgeon with a patient baseline and can rule out other syndromes that present similarly. Specifically, a distal motor latency of more than 4.5 ms and a sensory latency of more than 3.5 ms are considered abnormal. Of note, these electrodiagnostic studies can yield normal results despite symptomatic median nerve compression. In this scenario, CTR should be considered only if physical signs of median nerve dysfunction are present in addition to classical symptoms of CTS. Surgical techniques Scars from carpal tunnel release surgery. Two different techniques were used. The left scar is 6 weeks old, the right scar is 2 weeks old. Also note the muscular atrophy of the thenar eminence in the left hand, a common sign of advanced CTS. The goal of any carpal tunnel release surgery is to divide the transverse carpal ligament and the distal aspect of the volar ante brachial fascia, thereby decompressing the median nerve and providing relief. The transverse carpal ligament is a wide ligament that runs across the hand, from the scaphoid bone to the hamate bone and pisiform. It forms the roof of the carpal tunnel, and when the surgeon cuts across it (i.e., in a line with the ring finger) it no longer presses down on the nerve inside, relieving the pressure.http://www.handuniversity.com/topics.asp?Topic_ID=16 A patient's guide to endoscopic carpal tunnel release The two major types of surgery are open carpal tunnel release and endoscopic carpal tunnel release. Open carpal tunnel release can be performed through a standard incision or a limited incision. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release, which can be performed through a single or double portal. Most surgeons historically have performed the open procedure, widely considered to be the gold standard. However, since the 1990s, a growing number of surgeons now offer endoscopic carpal tunnel release.Rodner, Craig M.; Katarincic, Julia. (2006)\\"Open Carpal Tunnel Release\\". Techniques in Orthopaedics ¬Æ21(1):3‚Äì11 ¬© 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. Existing research does not show significant differences in outcomes of one kind of surgery versus the other, so patients can choose a surgeon they like and the surgeon also will practice the technique they like. Historically, carpal tunnel release was performed under general anesthesia with a tourniquet, however the worldwide trend is now for 'wide awake hand surgery': with no tourniquet, no general or regional anesthesia and no sedation; which also enables carpal tunnel release to be performed under local anesthesia as a one stop procedure. After carpal tunnel surgery, the long term use of a splint on the wrist should not be used for relief., which cites * Splints do not improve grip strength, lateral pinch strength, or bowstringing. While splints may protect people working with their hands, using a splint does not change complication rates or patient satisfaction. Using splints can cause problems including adhesion and lack of flexibility. Carpal tunnel surgery is usually performed by a hand surgeon, orthopaedic surgeon, or plastic surgeon. Open surgery The traditional open carpal tunnel surgery Open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) has long been considered the gold-standard surgical treatment for CTS. This approach allows for direct visualization of the anatomy and possible anatomical variants, which minimizes the risk of damaging critical structures. It also provides the surgeon with the option of probing the carpal canal for other structures that may be contributing to the compression of the median nerve, include ganglions and tumors. The technique involves placement of a longitudinal incision at the base of the hand. The length of the skin incision varies but typically is <4 cm. The subcutaneous tissue, the superficial palmar fascia, and the muscle of the palmaris brevis (if present) are also incised in line with the incision, thereby exposing the TCL. With the incision of the transverse carpal ligament longitudinally, the median nerve is exposed. The release is extended to the superficial palmar arterial arch distally and for a limited distance proximally beneath the wrist flexion creases. For optimal outcomes, the TCL must be completely released while avoiding damage to the vital structures. The flexor tendons can be retracted to inspect the floor of the canal for lesions. Scar tenderness, pillar pain, weakness, and delays in return to work can occasionally be seen following an OCTR. The open release technique has been compared to other treatments. = Postoperative care = A light compression dressing and a volar splint may be applied. The hand is actively used as soon as possible after surgery, but the dependent position is avoided. Usually the dressing can be removed by the patient at home 2 or 3 days after the surgery, and then gentle washing and showering of the hand is permitted. Gradual resumption of normal hand use is encouraged. If non-absornable sutures are used, they are removed after 10 to 14 days. A splint may be continued for comfort as needed for 14 to 21 days.  Limited open carpal tunnel release  Limited-incision carpal tunnel release techniques similar to endoscopic surgery were developed to decrease palmar discomfort and hasten the return to activities. It allows for adequate exposure to avoid complications and keeps the incision out of the painful portion of the palm. The surgical approach involves a small skin incision in the palm followed by release of the distal end of the TCL under direct visualization. Patients experience reduced post-operative pain as this techniques leaves the palmar fascia intact over the proximal TCL. = Carpal tunnel release through mini-transverse approach (CTRMTA) = Sayed Issa's approach is a carpal tunnel release through a small approach on the distal wrist crease; it is about 1.5 cm; the benefits of this technique are less surgical traumatic and more tender, it takes less time for rehabilitation, so the patient can work next day of operation, and it has very cosmetic and gentle scar in results and outcome. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release Endoscopic techniques for carpal tunnel release involve one or two smaller incisions (less than half inch each) through which instrumentation is introduced including a synovial elevator, probes, knives, and an endoscope used to visualize the underside of the transverse carpal ligament.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4hTY1vyrxg The endoscopic methods do not divide the subcutaneous tissues or the palmar fascia to the same degree as does the open method. Advocates of endoscopic carpal tunnel release cite less palmar scarring and ulnar ‚Äúpillar‚Äù pain, rapid and complete return of strength, and return to work and activities at least 2 weeks sooner than for open release. Some studies comparing open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release found no significant differences in function. The advantages of the endoscopic technique in grip strength and pain relief are realized within the first 12 weeks and seem to benefit those patients not involved in compensable injuries. However, problems related to endoscopic carpal tunnel release include (1) a technically demanding procedure; (2) a limited visual field that prevents inspection of other structures; (3) the vulnerability of the median nerve, flexor tendons, and superficial palmar arterial arch; (4) the inability to control bleeding easily; and (5) the limitations imposed by mechanical failure. Although this technique has proved to be effective, it may not be applicable to every patient with carpal tunnel syndrome. If an endoscopic release cannot be accomplished safely, the procedure should be converted to an open technique. Briefly, the endoscopic method can be performed using either one portal, or two portals. In the Agee single-portal technique, a small transverse skin incision is made at the ulnar border of the palamaris longus tendon. A distally based flap of forearm fascia is elevated to expose the proximal end of the carpal canal. With the wrist held in slight extension, the endoscopic blade is inserted into the canal, the distal edge of the TCL is identified, and the ligament is sectioned distally to proximally. The two portal technique requires a proximal incision and a distal incision deep to the TCL. Many surgeons have embraced limited incision methods. It is considered to be the procedure of choice for many of these surgeons with respect to idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome. Supporting this are the results of some of the previously mentioned series that cite no difference in the rate of complications for either method of surgery. Thus, there has been broad support for either surgical procedure using a variety of devices or incisions.  Thread carpal tunnel release  Procedure of Thread Carpal Tunnel Release The thread carpal tunnel release (TCTR) is a minimally invasive procedure for transecting the transverse carpal ligament (TCL) by sawing a piece of thread looped percutaneously under the guidance of ultrasound. The TCTR is performed under local anesthesia in a clinic based procedure room, and results in only one needle entry point at the palm and one needle exit point in the wrist. The technique ensures that the division happens only inside the loop of the thread around the TCL without injuring adjacent tissues. The features of the procedure includes the potentials of reduced risk of iatrogenic injury, reduced surgical cost, and reduced patient recovery time. An animation of carpal tunnel release procedure steps  Outcomes  Carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be cured, but surgery to alleviate symptoms can be successful. Success is greatest in patients with the most typical symptoms. The most common cause of failure is incorrect diagnosis, and this surgery will only mitigate carpal tunnel syndrome, and will not relieve symptoms with alternative causes. The recurrence rate after primary carpal tunnel release is approximately 2%. The success rate of surgery to relieve symptoms depends on the definition of ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and the metrics applied. For example, with respect to alleviation of symptoms, up to 90% success is reported. Yet with respect to patient satisfaction, approximately 50% is reported. The rate at which patients return to their former employer also is less than 90%. Yet approximately 25% of those patients are re-tasked to another duty in order to minimize further stress on their hands. In general, endoscopic techniques are as effective as traditional open carpal surgeries, though the faster recovery time (2‚Äì3 weeks) typically noted in endoscopic procedures is felt by some to possibly be offset by higher complication rates. A recent Cochrane Review showed that the use of absorbable sutures (stitches that the body dissolves) provide the same outcomes (i.e. scar quality, pain levels, etc) as non-absorbable sutures but are much cheaper. Risks and complications Complications and failures are estimated to be 3% to 19%. Unrelieved symptoms may lead to repeat operation in 12% of patients. Because most patients obtain relief in the early postoperative period, it is difficult to attribute one anatomical cause to recurrent symptoms. Findings reported at reoperation include incomplete release of the transverse carpal ligament, re-formation of the flexor retinaculum, scarring in the carpal tunnel, median or palmar cutaneous neuroma, palmar cutaneous nerve entrapment, recurrent granulomatous or inflammatory tenosynovitis, and hypertrophic scar in the skin. As with most soft-tissue surgeries of the hand, postoperative wound infection is rare after CTR, occurring in only 0.36% of cases. Most of these are superficial, with only 0.13% of cases having deep infections. The most common complication with open carpal tunnel release surgery is pillar pain (pain in the thenar or hypothenar eminence that is worse with pressure or grasping), followed by laceration of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. Pillar pain occurs in approximately 25% of surgical cases, with symptom resolution reported in most patients by 3 months. There is no difference in the rates of pillar pain between patients undergoing open or endoscopic release. Incomplete release of the TCL with persistent or recurrent CTS symptoms is the most frequent complication attributed to endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery. Recurrent CTS develops in 7% to 20% of surgical cases. The problem is difficult to address, and revision surgery is less successful than primary carpal tunnel release surgery. Injury to the median nerve proper occurs in 0.06% of cases. Risk of nerve injury has been found to be higher in patients undergoing endoscopic CTR compared with open, though most are temporary neurapraxias. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve may be injured during superficial skin dissection or while releasing the proximal portion of the transverse carpal ligament with scissors or an endoscopic device. Nerve injury can lead to persistent paresthesias or painful neuroma formation. In addition to pain, patients may have mechanical symptoms related to the flexor tendons contained in the carpal tunnel after release of the transverse carpal ligament. Damage to the tendons during release may cause inflammation and adhesions leading to triggering at the wrist. Balloon carpal tunnelplasty Balloon carpal tunnelplasty is an experimental technique that uses a minimally invasive balloon catheter director to access the carpal tunnel. As with a traditional tissue elevator-expander, balloon carpal tunnelplasty elevates the carpal ligament, increasing the space in the carpal tunnel. As an experiment it has been described but there are no peer-reviewed series available in the current hand surgical literature that review or comment upon the procedure. The technique is performed through a one-centimeter incision at the distal wrist crease. It is monitored and expansion is confirmed by direct or endoscopic visualization. The technique's secondary goals are to avoid to incision in the palm of the hand, to avoid cutting of the transverse carpal ligament, and to maintain the biomechanics of the hand.

The database holds two types of information: 1) genomic information of microorganisms, linked to, 2) metadata of those microorganism such as epidemiological details. The database includes all genera of microorganisms: bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.  Technology  For genotyping of microorganisms for medical diagnosis, or other purposes, scientists may use a wide variety of DNA profiling techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or multilocus sequence typing. A complication of this broad variety of techniques is the difficulty to standardize between techniques, laboratories and microorganisms, which may be overcome using the complete DNA code of the genome generated by whole genome sequencing. For straightforward diagnostic identification, the whole genome sequencing information of a microbiological sample is fed into a global genomic database and compared using BLAST procedures to the genomes already present in the database. In addition, whole genome sequencing data may be used to back calculate to the different pre- whole genome sequencing genotyping methods, so previous collected valuable information is not lost. For the global microbial identifier the genomic information is coupled to a wide spectrum of metadata about the specific microbial clone and includes important clinical and epidemiological information such as the global finding places, treatment options and antimicrobial resistance, making it a general microbiological identification tool. This makes personalized treatment of microbial disease possible as well as real-time tracing systems for global surveillance of infectious diseases for food safety and serving human health.  The initiative  The initiative for building the database arose in 2011 and when several preconditions were met: 1) whole genome sequencing has become mature and serious alternative for other genotyping techniques, 2) the price of whole genome sequencing has started falling dramatically and in some cases below the price of traditional identifications, 3) vast amounts of IT resources and a fast Internet have become available, and 4) there is the idea that via a cross sectoral and One Health approach infectious diseases may be better controlled. Starting the second millennium, many microbiological laboratories, as well as national health institutes, started genome sequencing projects for sequencing the infectious agents collections they had in their biobanks. Thereby generating private databases and sending model genomes to global nucleotide databases such as GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology Information or the nucleotide database of the EMBL. This created a wealth of genomic information and independent databases for eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic genomes. The need to further integrate these databases and to harmonize data collection, and to link the genomic data to metadata for optimal prevention of infectious diseases, was generally recognized by the scientific community. In 2011, several infectious disease control centers and other organizations took the initiative of a series of international scientific- and policy-meetings, to develop a common platform and to better understand the potentials of an interactive microbiological genomic database. The first meeting was in Brussels, September 2011, followed by meetings in Washington (March 2012) and Copenhagen (February 2013). In addition to experts from around the globe, Intergovernmental Organizations have been included in the action, notably the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health.  Development plan  A detailed roadmap for the development of the database was set up with the following general timeline: :2010 - 2012: Development of pilot systems. :2011 - 2013: International structural start-up, with the formation of an international core group, analysis of the present and future landscape to build the database, and diplomacy efforts to bring the relevant groups together. :2012 - 2016: Development of a robust IT-backbone for the database, and development of novel genome analysis algorithms and software. :2017 - 2020: Construction of a global solution, including the creation of networks and regional hubs.

Compliant bonding a gold wire Click to enlarge view Figure 2. Solid- state/wire bonding bonding a gold wire with a hard faced bonding tool. Compliant bonding is used to connect gold wires to electrical components such as integrated circuit \\"chips\\". It was invented by Alexander Coucoulas in the 1960s.Alexander Coucoulas \\"Bonding With A Compliant Medium\\". . October 13, 1970. Filed July 6, 1967. The bond is formed well below the melting point of the mating gold surfaces and is therefore referred to as a solid-state type bond. The compliant bond is formed by transmitting heat and pressure to the bond region through a relatively thick indentable or compliant medium, generally an aluminum tape (Figure 1).Coucoulas, A. (1970) ‚ÄúCompliant Bonding‚Äù Proceedings 1970 IEEE 20th Electronic Components Conference, pp. 380‚Äì89. PDF, PDF2  Comparison with other solid state bond methods  Solid-state or pressure bonds form permanent bonds between a gold wire and a gold metal surface by bringing their mating surfaces in intimate contact at about 300 ¬∞C which is well below their respective melting points of 1064 ¬∞C, hence the term solid-state bonds. Two commonly used methods of forming this type of bond are thermocompression bonding and thermosonic bonding. Both of these processes form the bonds with a hard faced bonding tool that makes direct contact to deform the gold wires against the gold mating surfaces (Figure 2). Figure 3. Stages of compliant bonding gold wires to a gold metallized surface. Figure 4. Compliant bonding wires of varying sizes simultaneously. Since gold is the only metal that does not form an oxide coating which can interfere with making a reliable metal to metal contact, gold wires are widely used to make these important wire connections in the field of microelectronic packaging. During the compliant bonding cycle the bond pressure is uniquely controlled by the inherent flow properties of the aluminum compliant tape (Figure 3). Therefore, if higher bond pressures are needed to increase the final deformation (flatness) of a compliant bonded gold wire, a higher yielding alloy of aluminum could be employed. The use of a compliant medium also overcomes the thickness variations when attempting to bond a multiple number of conductor wires simultaneously to a gold metalized substrate (Figure 4). It also prevents the leads from being excessively deformed since the compliant member deforms around the leads during the bonding cycle thus eliminating mechanical failure of a bonded wire due to excessive deformation from a hard faced tool (Figure 3) which is employed by thermocompression, and thermosonic bonding.

Hard faced bonding tool simultaneously bonding all of the extended beam leads File:Compliant bonding a beam leaded chip0002.jpgFigure 8. Compliant bonding a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit showing the indented compliant member after bonding the \\"chip\\"  History  An important application for compliant bonding arose in the early 1960s, when techniques were developed for fabricating a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit ‚Äúchip‚Äù consisting of pre-attached electroformed 0.005-inch thick gold leads or ‚Äúbeams‚Äù extending from the silicon chip (Figure 5). Thus the beam leaded ‚Äúchip‚Äù eliminated the need to thermosonically bond wires directly onto metallized pads of the fragile silicon chip (as shown in Figure 6) The extended ends of the electroformed beams could then be permanently solid-state bonded to a matching metallized sunburst circuit which has been pre-deposted on a ceramic substrate appropriately packaged in a computer in the making. Figure 7. shows a preshaped hard faced tool thermocompression bonding all of the beam leads of a chip in one bonding cycle. In order to avoid excessively deforming the fine beam leads with the hard bonding tool and putting them at risk of mechanical failure, the applied bonding forces have to be carefully monitored. The invention of compliant bonding eliminated the problems associated with a hard faced bonding tool and therefore was ideally suited to simultaneously bond all of the extended electroplated gold beam leads to a matching gold metallized sunburst patterned ceramic substrate packaged in a computer (Figure 8). For example, compliant bonding eliminated the problems of using a hard faced bonding tool such as: attempting to uniformly deform the nominally 0.005-inch thick beams leads having slight variations in their thickness; excessive lead deformation that could cause mechanical damage and an ultimate \\"costly\\" failure of these fine beam leaded silicon chips which are the \\"brains\\" of our computers. The compliant bonding tape media offered the additional advantage of carrying the \\"beam leaded silicon chip\\" to the bonding site thus facilitating production.Ludwig; David P., Zwickel; Friedich, Figures 9. and 10 show that the compliant tape offers the advantage of carrying the beam leaded chip to the bonding site as discussed above. Figure 11 shows a beam leaded silicon integrated circuit compliantly bonded to a gold metallized sunburst pattern deposited on an alumina ceramic substrate which will be encapsulated and packaged in a computer-type device. Figure 12 shows the spent compliant member used to bond the chip in Figure 11 which clearly shows a mirror image of the uniformly bonded beam leads.

Compliant bonded beam leaded silicon integrated circuit File:Indentations in compliant member0001.jpgFigure 12. Mirror image of the bonded beam leads clearly shown indented in the spent compliant member  Silicon integrated circuit  The two forms of integrated circuits discussed above were the beam leaded integrated circuit composed of attached electroformed gold leads or beams (Figure 5) and the silicon integrated circuit chip (Figure 6). With respect to the beam leaded silicon chip, both compliant and thermocompression bonding can be employed since each have their advantages. At this time, the most widely used form is the silicon integrated circuit chip, without the beam leads, which therefore requires electrical connections directly to the metallized silicon Chip (Figure 6). If wire connections is the method of choice to form these connections, thermosonic bonding gold wires directly to the silicon chip has been the process most widely used because of its proven reliability as a result of the low bonding parameters of force, temperature, and time needed to form the bond.

On October 9, 2002, the Boeing 747-400 carrying out the flight experienced a lower rudder hardover event, when the flight was over the Bering Sea. A rudder hardover is when the aircraft's rudder deflects to its travel limit without crew input. The 747's hardover gave full left lower rudder, requiring the pilots to use full right upper rudder and right aileron to maintain attitude and course. The flight diverted to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. No passengers or crew were injured, but the incident resulted in an airworthiness directive to prevent the possibility of a future accident. Aircraft  The aircraft involved was the prototype Boeing 747-400 (Boeing 747-451, c/n 23719, reg N661US) and was built by Boeing for flight testing as N401PW, before subsequently being re- registered as N661US and delivered to Northwest Airlines (the launch customer for the 747-400) on January 26, 1989. The aircraft was later delivered to Delta Air Lines on October 29, 2008. The aircraft was then preserved in Delta Heritage Museum on April 30, 2016. Incident flight Flight 85's crew members aboard N661US, now preserved at the Delta Flight Museum, March 28, 2017. A model of N401PW at the Museum of Aeronautical Sciences at Chiba Narita The flight departed Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport at 2:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time. The incident occurred at 5:40 PM Alaska Daylight Time, around 7 hours into the flight.Wallace, James. \\"Aerospace Notebook: Boeing, NTSB investigating 747 rudder incident.\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Tuesday November 5, 2002. Retrieved on December 25, 2012. At the time of the incident, Junior Captain Frank Geib and First Officer Mike Fagan had just taken control of the aircraft, allowing Senior Captain John Hanson and First Officer David Smith to rest.Steenblik, Jan W. \\"ALPA's Annual Air Safety Awards.\\" (Archive) Air Line Pilot. Air Line Pilots Association. January 2004, p.19. Retrieved on December 25, 2012. Flight 85's captain said that the event occurred at flight level 350 (35,000 feet/11,000 meters). The aircraft abruptly went into a 30 to 40 degree left bank. Geib initially believed that an engine failure had occurred. Hanson re-entered the cockpit and continued to fly the aircraft by hand with Fagan. Geib declared an emergency and began a diversion to Anchorage. While trying to declare the emergency, the plane was in a communications dead zone between North America and Asia. Even with a weak signal, they contacted another Northwest Airlines flight, Flight 19, who helped Flight 85 declare the emergency since they were closer to Alaska. Flight 85's captain reported that none of the emergency procedures available could correct the problem. The pilots established a conference call with Northwest Airlines at the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and the Northwest employees there were unable to find a solution to the sudden bank. The flight crew took back control of the aircraft and landed at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. To steer the aircraft, they had to use the ailerons and asymmetric engine thrust, applying more engine power to one side than the other. Hanson said that crew resource management (CRM) contributed to the flight's safe landing at Anchorage; he said \\"This was a classic application of CRM. We were blessed and lucky that we had full flight crew augmentation. We had four pilots to work together in the cockpit. We had an excellent group of flight attendants on board; that became important later because we briefed this as a ‚Äòred‚Äô emergency, which means there‚Äôs at least a solid chance you‚Äôre going to have to evacuate. We weren‚Äôt sure we were going to be able to keep the airplane on the runway.\\" The incident did not initially receive media attention. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Boeing launched investigations into the incident. NTSB investigator Carolyn Deforge, who oversaw the investigation, recounted on the television program Mayday (Air Crash Investigation, Air Emergency) \\"it appeared to be a very dramatic event, and ... it definitively seemed like something we needed to follow up on, trying to understand what had happened.\\" The NTSB found that there was a fatigue crack in the power control module and that it was not possible to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's cast metal housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was unusual because most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself. The NTSB ruled that the probable cause was a \\"fatigue fracture of the lower rudder power control module manifold, which resulted in a lower rudder hardover.\\" In a rudder hard-over, the rudder is driven to its full deflection and stays there.

Kremenets Botanical Garden () is located in the city of Kremenets in the Ternopil Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. The garden was founded in 1806, making it one of the oldest botanical gardens in the country. Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine from October 12, 1992 declared the Kremenets Botanical Garden as a protected area of national importance, which aims are to preserve, study, acclimate rare and common flora. Description Botanical Garden's area has 200 hectares, most of which - natural landscapes of complex topography with a height difference of 150 meters (maximum absolute height ois the territory of 399 meters, minimum - 255 m). 170 hectares of the territory consist of artificial and natural forest plantations, herbaceous and rock communities. The slopes of the garden covered with hornbeam, oak - hornbeam, larch, pine, pine-birch, ash-maple forests of artificial and natural origin. History During 1806-1809 project of Kremenets'kiy Botanical Garden had been formed by famous Irish master of landscape architecture Dionysius Mc Klyer. According to this project garden area was 4.5 hectares. It consisted of the park, rose garden, three orangeries, greenhouses and pharmacist garden. Collected by D. Mc Klyerom collection of living plants totaled 480 species of local flora and 760 exotic plants. The contribution of an Irishman was something that Grain Land Ukraine did not want to let dissipate. To sustain this Irish link and to protect a two-century-old work, Grain Land Ukraine financed a new Irish Corner in the garden. The Irish Corner is planted with plants and trees native to Ireland. In 1809, the director of the garden became doctor of medicine, botany and zoology, Austrian Wilibald Swibert Joseph Gottlieb von Besser. The area extends to 20 hectares and number of species increased to 1200. In 1810 W. Besser published the first catalog of plants of botanical garden, which describes the interesting species brought from France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the U.S. and other countries. This catalog include such species as: Canadian pine, Rhododendron anthopogon, Liriodendron tulipifera, Ginkgo biloba, Morus alba, Castanea sativa. Many species was transferred to the botanical garden from private collections and gardens. W. Besser widely practiced exchange seeds and herbarium with the botanic gardens of Krak√≥w, Hamburg, Paris, Hetinhen, Vienna and others. became famous as a result of systematic publications V. Besser.A clear indication of species richness and uniqueness of the collection of living plants of Kremenets‚Äôkiy Botanical Garden was the presence of 241 plant species from Cape floral kingdom in it. In 1832, the Kremenets Botanical Garden was closed. The main collector base was moved to Kyiv, where it formed University of St. Vladimir (now Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv) and botanical garden with it (now The Fomin Botanical Garden). In 1921-1939 and 1951-1969 attempts were made to open the garden. In 1990 according to the Council of Ministers of Ukraine botanical garden was restored.

The Keep also houses the library and office of The Sussex Family History Group, functions as headquarters of Friends of The Keep Archives, and holds the Historic Environment Record database for East Sussex. From November 2018, it has also functioned as the South East Hub for the Unlocking Our Sound Heritage project for The British Library. It was funded by East Sussex County Council, the City Council of neighbouring Brighton and Hove and the University of Sussex, and was built on land close to the University in the Moulsecoomb area of Brighton and Hove. The building, constructed with a budget of ¬£19 million, opened on 31 October 2013, superseding the former East Sussex Record Office in the county town of Lewes. Background The Maltings in Lewes housed East Sussex County Council's records from 1949. East Sussex was designated an administrative county in 1865, and in 1889 its county council was formed in accordance with the Local Government Act 1888. In 1949, the council set up its archive and record office in The Maltings in the county town of Lewes; they adapted a Grade II-listed former malt house near the castle. Records, documents and objects up to nine centuries old were stored and displayed, such as a letter to the Abbot of Battle Abbey dating from 1101 and bearing King Henry I's seal. The building had a document repository, conservation laboratory and facilities for the public to examine certain records. Following an inspection in 2003, The National Archives allowed the building to remain in use in the short term as long as a new building was provided; and after another inspection in 2006 it condemned the building as \\"not fit for purpose\\" in relation to how it stored paper and parchment documents. If a better facility could not be provided within the county, The National Archives could have arranged for public records to be moved to a suitable building elsewhere in England and stored there‚Äîall at East Sussex County Council's expense‚Äîwhile other records would remain in the Lewes building, where conditions would get worse. Suggested alternative locations included the national archive facility at Kew, and newly built archives in Cumbria and Kingston upon Hull. As well as \\"heavily criticis[ing]\\" the facility after this second inspection, The National Archives removed most of the licences allowing the county council to store records there. Although East Sussex County Council had started investigating alternatives in 1996 and undertook a feasibility study in 2004, the project to create a new archive was formalised in April 2006 after the unfavourable second inspection. Between that date and April 2008, several actions were taken: a committee and project manager were appointed, funding was allocated, documentation was produced, Brighton and Hove City Council and the University of Sussex became involved in the process, and a \\"rigorous site search\\" was undertaken across the county and the city of Brighton and Hove. Locations at Woodingdean, Newhaven, Lewes, Glynde and two in the Falmer area were examined; one of these was Woollards Field, just inside the Brighton and Hove city boundary on the edge of the Moulsecoomb housing estate. Woollards Field was chosen in May 2007. Woollards Field site Road access will be via a new road which will join the Brighton Aldridge Community Academy access road (foreground) and lead to the A270 (background). Woollards Field is an area of open space in the northeast of the city of Brighton and Hove, from the city centre. Clockwise from north, it is bounded by the A27 and A270 roads towards Falmer and Lewes, the Brighton Aldridge Community Academy (formerly Falmer High School), a health club, buildings associated with Southern Water and the University of Brighton, the East Coastway railway line, and the Moulsecoomb housing estate. It is owned by East Sussex County Council, and is mostly grass with some trees and shrubs. Until 1990 it was used by local schools for sport and recreation, but the site has been unused since then as it was declared \\"surplus to requirements\\". A Tree preservation order for trees on the site was granted in 1974. The project team selected a section of the site as the location for the new archive in May 2007. Woollards Field benefited from having outstanding planning permission for development covered by Class B1 of the UK Property Classification. Permission for such development had first been granted in 1993, and various renewals and changes had since taken place. In March 2010, the contractors and Brighton & Hove City Council discussed whether to retain all the trees on the site. It was agreed to retain half of the existing trees and to plant a new copse at the west end of the site (nearest the Moulsecoomb housing estate), while also reducing the amount of car parking on the site to below the \\"maximum standard\\" for a building of its size. The new copse will be part of a \\"informal recreation\\" area which will include some open grassland for public use. Also, in December 2012 it was stated that a community orchard would be created on some of the free land which does not form part of the development area. Falmer railway station is nearby, and new bus stops have been built on both sides of the A270. Public footpaths and a cycle path will be built through the site to connect it with the Moulsecoomb estate and the adjacent road; this was estimated to cost ¬£33,000. A 69-space car park and 20-space bicycle park will be provided behind the building. Coach parking facilities will be added on the south side. Construction The building stands at the end of a new access road. The building under construction in April 2013, seen from the northeast. East Sussex County Council and Brighton & Hove City Council put the scheme out to competitive tender and commissioned the Kier Southern (Kier Longley) division of Kier Group as its preferred building contractor. Atkins were chosen as the scheme architects; they have been involved in the design of archive facilities since 1991, including the Berkshire Record Office and the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre. Both were designed with the principle of keeping the archive storage and the public areas separate while maintaining a consistent architectural style, which was also the intention with The Keep. The provisions of BS 5454 (the British Standard consisting of \\"recommendations for the storage and exhibition of archival documents\\") and the wishes of The National Archives also influenced the design process. Other companies involved with the design and construction process included GTA Civils Ltd, who undertook transport and flood risk assessments; Lizard Landscape Design, who were involved with environmental analysis such as landscape assessments, ecological planning, arboricultural investigation and site photography; Ashdown Site Investigation Ltd, who carried out site contamination analysis; and Archaeology South East (part of the Institute of Archaeology, University College London), who undertook archaeological investigation at Woollards Field. The scheme budget was originally set at ¬£23.6 million. The committee sought National Lottery money through a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund, but this was turned down in December 2008. This created a ¬£4.9 million shortfall, and the budget was later revised to ¬£19 million. A grant received in respect of installing photovoltaic electricity generating equipment subsequently increased the available funds to ¬£19,142,000, of which ¬£17,910,000 was allocated to construction and capital expenditure and the remaining ¬£1,232,000 to other costs such as marketing, planning and payments to professionals. ¬£12 million was provided by East Sussex County Council. The building (pictured in December 2012) is next to the A270 Lewes Road. Planning permission for the development was given on 14 January 2011, and construction work started on 7 October 2011 after a turf- cutting ceremony. Just under a year later, on 1 October 2012, the roof was finished and a topping out ceremony took place. At that time, it was stated that the building was expected to be finished at the end of 2013, although East Sussex County Council's timeline anticipated completion in early 2013 and a public opening later in the year. Brighton and Hove City Council stated in March 2013 that the former Brighton History Centre near the Royal Pavilion in the city centre would close on 1 April 2013 to allow about 350,000 items to be transferred to The Keep in time for its public opening. In June 2013, when construction work finished and the building's owners took possession of it, the official opening date was set at November 2013. Queen Elizabeth II performed the official opening on 31 October 2013 during a visit to Sussex. The building has three storeys and a gross floor area of . A separate \\"Energy Centre\\" adds another to The Keep's footprint. The main building is intended to have capacity for 20 years worth of records; a further 14 years worth of capacity could be added with an extension at the southwest side, for which provision has been made in the design. Up to 270 public users and 35 members of staff can accommodated: the maximum capacities of the lecture rooms and reading rooms are 155 and 115 respectively. Architecturally, The Keep is a rectangular structure with pale brickwork and some rendering, metal-framed windows and doors, a silver metal roof with areas of vegetation and wildflowers, and an \\"embossed concrete frieze\\" near the roofline to \\"create additional visual interest and ... break down the mass of the block\\". The building is high, long and wide. The design is said to reflect that of \\"many educational buildings which have been developed in a similar architectural idiom\\". Remit and facilities The Keep houses all of the archives, documents and historical records of both East Sussex County Council and Brighton & Hove City Council. The University of Sussex's Special Collections are also included, including the records of the \\"internationally renowned\\" Mass-Observation project and manuscripts by Rudyard Kipling and Virginia Woolf. The Sussex Family History Group (which covers both East and West Sussex) is based in the building and has moved its library there. Facilities are provided for public access and research. Educational visits by schools and other institutions, volunteer groups, societies and similar will be catered for. Facilities include lecture rooms, a public reading/study room and similar provision for the archivists, a recording centre for oral histories, conservation laboratories and areas where archive materials can be repaired, repositories for storage, reprographic and record digitisation facilities, offices, eating and refreshment areas, toilets and a separate Energy Centre. By generating electricity from photovoltaic panels, turning rainwater into usable water and generating heat from a biomass boiler, this facility will help The Keep meet its aim of being \\"the most sustainable archive building in the country\\". The proposed opening hours are 9.00am‚Äì5.00pm Mondays to Saturdays inclusive, with occasional Sunday opening. These hours are longer than those at the former record office at The Maltings in Lewes.

It stars Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa, and features music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon, who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's previous films. The theme song, \\"Rain\\", was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988, but was remade for the film and was sung by Motohiro Hata. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film. The film focuses on Takao Akizuki, an aspiring 15-year-old shoemaker, and Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman he keeps meeting at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings. While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing his passion for shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn that they have been teaching each other \\"how to walk\\". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of \\"lonely sadness\\", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for \\"love\\", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry, and the Japanese garden. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults sometimes feel no more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai. The Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had its general release on May 31, 2013 in Japan. For the Japanese premiere, the film was screened with an animated short called , also directed by Shinkai. The Garden of Words had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes the same day as the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. The film performed well in theaters for an extended period of time and was hosted at many local and international film events. It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. It won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award and awards at the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film. Online reviews were generally favorable with universal praise of the art, though opinions were mixed regarding the story's length, plot and emotional climax.  Plot  The Garden of Words opens at the start of the rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There, he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work. Following summer break, Takao returns to school and spots Yukari. His friends inform him that she is a literature teacher and that she had been the target of gossip and bullying. Out of kindness and to avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears and be able to \\"walk\\" again. However, Yukari quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'y≈çsh≈´ Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on Shikoku. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her. The credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career. In a post-credits scene, Takao revisits the park that winter, reads a letter from Yukari, places her finished shoes on the bench and then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career. In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him in the park. Also, at the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her.

He was responsible for the storyboards, animation composite, key animation, and editing. According to Shinkai, his numerous roles in the production of his works is due to the small size of the company, and in this film, it allowed him to tailor many elements of the film to more accurately portray his ideas. The animated film was produced by Shinkai Creative, CoMix Wave Films, and the producer was Noritaka Kawaguchi. Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design, while Hiroshi Takiguchi was the art director. Planning for the film began in the spring of 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year. The Japanese release was initially slated for the first half of 2013. Production took only six months, starting with location scouting by Shinkai around Shinjuku. Production officially started after he had created storyboards based on the photos he took. Shinkai was approached in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga, which was then done by Midori Motohashi. In April, Shinkai stated that he was not contributing to the adaptation, leaving the work entirely to the manga artist. However, he did express interest in seeing the finished product. Inspirations, motifs, and metaphors According to Shinkai's announcement of the film early during its production, The Garden of Words was his first attempt at making a love story using the traditional Japanese meaning of \\"love\\". During the era of the Man'y≈çsh≈´, the native Japanese words today known as were starting to be written using kanji, and the word for \\"love\\", koi (today written ÊÅã) was written as Â≠§ÊÇ≤, or \\"lonely sadness\\". As noted by Shinkai, a more modern concept of \\"romance\\", represented by , came about by Western influence. The Garden of Words emphasizes the original meaning of koi‚Äîa \\"longing for someone in solitude\\"‚Äîbut in a modern setting. Loneliness is the central element of the film, according to Shinkai. In an interview, he said he created the film with the hope of cheering up people who feel lonely or incomplete in their social relations. However, he made a point that \\"this movie doesn't treat loneliness as something that must be fixed.\\" Photographs (bottom) were used as a base, with the art (top) drawn over them. Although the story's central theme is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry and the Japanese garden in which it is set. Although rain is typically seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain‚Äîthat neither can be controlled or stopped. According to Shinkai, shoes were a metaphor for life as Yukari learned to walk again, while Takao's shoe-making typified their relationship. Similarly, Yukari's choice of food and beverages‚Äîinitially beer and chocolate, due to a stress-induced taste disorder‚Äîwas a metaphor for her emotional health. In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings resulting from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories are intended to encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, he admitted that he had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, \\"We're all still just children at age 27,\\" a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with. The original idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire to capture the beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film. Animation During production, a novel coloring method was used to mimic the refraction of light on the skin of the characters. Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words was created using a combination of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic. For the rainy scenes at the park, the color palette was toned down, and pale green shading was used to match the gloomy, rainy weather, thereby increasing the detail and defining the characters. Matching the tones to the background and lighting helped highlight the characters' faces. According to Shinkai, a novel coloring method was chosen from other coloring methods following careful testing. The method involved integrating the coloring for each character with the background, a \\"new innovation of sorts\\" that mimics the refraction of light on the skin as seen in nature. This was accomplished by coloring the outline of the character, including the lines drawn for the separation of lit and shadowed surfaces, and then incorporating the background color onto the surface. Shinkai felt that this coloring method made the anime stand out from others. Character design and casting Shinkai originally envisioned Takao as a boy who wants to help people, but also felt that he should have a passion for making something, since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling. On a list he made of potential crafts, he picked out the word \\"shoes\\". After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking. When first presenting the original story to the rest of his team, Shinkai learned that Yukari had unintentionally come across as selfish. To remedy this, he gave her character nervous traits and personality flaws, such as letting her emotions spill over during mildly upsetting events. Shinkai later realized that some of these personality quirks and temporary professional challenges seen in Yukari were present in a former girlfriend, for whom he had written his short film She and Her Cat. In addition to making Yukari's character more convincing, these character flaws also made it more difficult to plan since she had to be both flawed and attractive to a young boy. One aspect of her character that Shinkai focused on was her appearance. He felt that she had to be dressed in nice clothes, and particularly nice shoes. In order to balance realism with fashion, he researched shoemaking, worked with a clothing coordinator and stylist, and held weekly fashion meetings with his staff. One of the \\"complicated realistic elements\\" of Yukari's character was her sense of purity that only her voice could convey. Though it took days of listening to the audition tapes, Shinkai finally chose Kana Hanazawa, who had a very low natural voice, despite typically playing the roles of high-pitched younger girls. One of the things that impressed Shinkai about Hanazawa's voice was her ability to cover such a broad range of expression. It was the final scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, it had to be something impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, \\"I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film.\\" This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a na√Øve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices. In regards to the English dub, Shinkai did not feel that he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the feedback he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences. Length The Garden of Words is short, lasting approximately 46 minutes in length, a trend also seen among Shinkai's earlier works. Although he had stated in an interview with Anime News Network that he does like making shorter films, Shinkai noted that he did not originally plan for the film to be played in theaters. Instead, he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets, computers, and in home theaters. A target length was never specified from the outset, instead the relationship between Takao and Yukari was emphasized, although it was known from early in the production that the film would be short. Shinkai acknowledged that it is difficult to sell 46-minute films in theaters; however, many individuals in the industry had requested to show the film in theaters and conventions. During an interview at Anime Expo 2013, a representative from Toho, the film's distribution company, emphasized that the quality of the story and the reputation of its director played a key role in the decision to bring it to theaters. Music In Shinkai's previous films, the music was produced by Tenmon; however, The Garden of Words features music by Daisuke Kashiwa. Kashiwa had been a fan of Shinkai's 5 Centimeters Per Second and had sent him several of his albums. Shinkai listened to these albums while writing the screenplay and then elected to base the film's music off of the songs from Kashiwa's album 88. In an interview, Shinkai said that the music was primarily responsible for making the movie seem \\"unlike other anime\\". The theme song, \\"Rain\\", was written and composed by Senri Oe, and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988. Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since one of the film's themes was rain, it was the first song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film. The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by Motohiro Hata. Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao. Shinkai also felt that Hata's voice was perfect because to him it carried an \\"underlying loneliness\\" and \\"sounded a little like an anxious young man\\". Themes Two common themes among Shinkai's films, including The Garden of Words, are subtle romances and lingering emotions. However, this film's focus on \\"lonely sadness\\" (koi) was interpreted in a couple of ways. According to Cynthia Webb of The Jakarta Post, the loneliness is seen at the end of the film, when Takao learns to cope with Yukari's move to Shikoku. Luke Carroll at Anime News Network felt the end of the rainy season and the resulting separation created the sense of koi. Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, disagreed with these interpretations of koi and the notion that the story was a \\"bittersweet romance\\" or \\"another love story\\", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations‚Äîin their \\"garden of words\\"‚Äîthey found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, \\"romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about\\". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship \\"without needing to cling to each other\\". However, neither could \\"learn to walk again\\" if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. Another one of the themes discussed by the film's reviewers was rain or water. According to Cynthia Webb, the rain represented \\"unfulfilled longing\\", while Bradly Storm saw water as a third main character to the story, acting to both bring Takao and Yukari together and to symbolize the renewal of life. Kaze felt that the rain symbolized their lonely states, though also acknowledging Shinkai's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love. Following the reasoning that rain symbolized their lonely states, Kaze noted that the tanka had not only romantic intentions, but was also a \\"simple plea\\" by Yukari for someone to stay with her, even when she's no longer lonely, and not just out of pity. Promotion and release Premiere The anime film was announced in Japan on December 24, 2012, with the release scheduled for the first half of 2013 and news updates available on its Facebook page. On February 20, 2013, the film's production company, CoMix Wave Films, released a trailer with subtitles in multiple languages on YouTube and announced that it would be released in Japan on May 31, 2013\\\\. In early April, it was announced that the world premiere of the film would be held at Gold Coast Film Festival (GCFF) in Broadbeach, Queensland, Australia. Scheduled for the end of the festival at 4:00 PM on April 28, 2013, the film was part of the 'Cool Japan' Gold Coast lineup and included a guest appearance and discussion with Shinkai. The film's premiere was hosted in Australia as a way of showing appreciation to Australians for their support. According to the GCFF's director, the film sold out in advance and was relocated to a larger theater. Despite feeling nervous about the world premiere, Shinkai provided a discussion of the film and asked everyone to not share the plot and story until after the Japanese release the following month. Shinkai was scheduled for an hour-long movie poster signing, but ended up staying two and a half hours to accommodate the high turnout. Following the world premiere, but ahead of the Japanese premiere on May 31, the first five minutes of the film were previewed on TV Tokyo and NTV on May 12\\\\. On May 22, it was announced on Shinkai's official Twitter account that the film would play in Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at the same time and that the film would be available on iTunes on the day of the release. Additionally, the Japanese premiere would include a screening of Shinkai's short film, Dareka no Manazashi, which was released earlier that same year. By October, it was reported that many theaters in Japan had extended screening of the film. The official English language premiere of The Garden of Words was next shown in the United States at the Los Angeles Convention Center on July 6 and 7 as part of Anime Expo 2013. Sentai Filmworks hosted the film, and Shinkai was the Special Guest of Honor for the expo. The Canadian premiere was held at Montreal's 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival, where the film was screened on July 22 and 25. The film then returned to Australia when it screened alongside Ghost in the Shell: Arise at Madman Entertainment's Reel Anime 2013. The Garden of Words was shown in Moscow on September 27, 2013, after which Shinkai made an appearance to answer questions. He also attended the UK premiere, which took place during Scotland Loves Anime 2013 in mid- October, where it was played in conjunction with Shinkai's earlier work, The Place Promised in Our Early Days. By late February 2014, the film had been shown in 11 countries. In 2014, it was showcased at Amsterdam's Imagine Film Festival in mid-April, at the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film in late- April, with Dareka no Manazashi on May 21 in Italian theaters as part of the Nexo Anime project, and at the Japan Film Festival of San Francisco (JFFSF) in late-July. Theatrical and home media The film was released in digital format on iTunes on the same day as the theatrical release, which was very unusual for a film. Furthermore, the DVD and Blu-ray were made available while the film was still playing in theaters. With the Japanese premiere on May 31, the DVD and Blu-ray editions were released in Japan less than a month later, on June 21\\\\. The DVD came with a 16-page booklet and approximately 30 minutes bonus features, including a short version of some interviews with Shinkai and the cast. The Blu-ray had similar features, except it contained 90 minutes of bonus features, including a long version of the interviews. On April 24, 2013, the video distribution company Section23 and the licensing company Sentai Filmworks announced their acquisition of the license and plans to release a digital version and the North American bilingual DVD and Blu-ray later in the year. The DVD and Blu-ray were both were released on August 6, 2013\\\\. The Blu- ray used 1080p AVC (Advanced Video Coding) with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 Widescreen and audio encoded with the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio codec. Its packaging did not include inserts or a reversible cover. The DVD and Blu-ray releases for the UK were licensed by Anime Limited, which was announced on October 18, 2013\\\\. During the 2013 Lucca Comics & Games convention, the Italian publisher Dynit announced that it had acquired the rights to distribute the film. Australian distributor Madman Entertainment released the DVD on February 19, 2014\\\\. The French publishing company Kaz√© released a German and Japanese dubbed DVD on March 28, 2014, which also included the short film Dareka no Manazashi. Related media Manga and novel A manga adaptation of the story with art by Midori Motohashi was serialized in the June to December 2013 issues of the monthly seinen manga magazine Afternoon. It was bundled into a single volume released by Kodansha on November 22, 2013\\\\. In February 2014, North American publisher Vertical announced at the Katsucon anime convention that it had licensed Motohashi's manga; the English translation was released on October 28, 2014\\\\. With editing by Media Factory, Shinkai himself created a novelization of the story, which drew many responses on Twitter following serialization. It was released in monthly installments in the September 2013 to April 2014 issues of Da Vinci magazine. The full novel, which contained new scenes not present in the film or serialized novel chapters, was published by Kadokawa Shoten on April 11, 2014\\\\. On March 6, 2020, Yen Press announced that it has licensed the novel for North American release, which was released on August 25, 2020. Stage Play On October 14, 2019, it was announced that U.K. theatrical company Whole Hog Theatre is producing a stage play adaptation of the film. The play was held at Park Theatre at London's Finsbury Park in 2020, from July 15 to August 15 after previews on July 15‚Äì16. The play ran in Tokyo, and Nelke Planning is participating in production. The play will be performed in English with \\"occasional Japanese,\\" and it will feature \\"puppetry, movement and projection art.\\" Alexandra Rutter, who also directed Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke stage play for Whole Hog Theatre, directed the play. Reception Like many of Shinkai's other films, The Garden of Words was considered most appropriate for teenage and adult audiences due to its more intense and personal mood. The film performed strongly at the box office, with many theaters offering extended screenings. Because of its theatrical success, the film has been considered one of Shinkai's biggest hits. Shinkai considered it one of his best films, and reviews of the story in each media form were equally favorable. The digital version ranked 7th on the iTunes store for Western and Japanese films by the end of 2013. In the year following its initial release, it continued to be a popular at local and international film events. The news and review site, ICv2, listed the DVD under \\"The Best of 2013: Anime\\". Reviews At Anime News Network, Luke Carroll praised the film, calling it a \\"visual treat\\", but was disappointed in the short length and found Shinkai's new coloring method to be distracting. Jon Hayward was impressed by the \\"almost photo realistic\\" quality of the scenery, particularly in Shinjuku Gyoen. The Managing Editor, Bamboo Dong, described it as \\"beautifully designed and tenderly animated, it is nature eye candy at its finest.\\" She was impressed by the film's unrushed yet thorough story despite its short length and praised both the music and art. In particular, she noted the beauty of the light reflections, rain scenes, and camera angles. At UK Anime Network, Andy Hanley gave it a score of 10/10, calling it \\"visually beautiful with a touching story to match\\". He praised the natural progression of their relationship, despite the age gap, and enjoyed the emotional climax of the film. Hanley felt that The Garden of Words had a \\"tighter focus\\" than Children Who Chase Lost Voices and a better ending than 5 Centimeters Per Second, concluding it was Shinkai's best work yet. Dan Rhodes called the film \\"a real return to form for Makoto Shinkai\\" following Children Who Chase Lost Voices, which he felt had been an attempt by Shinkai to live up to the common expectation of being the \\"next Hayao Miyazaki.\\" He praised the film for its beauty, romance, pacing, and subtlety. Although he felt that the film's ending was an improvement over the ending to 5 Centimeters Per Second, he described it as rushed and overly emotional. However, he was very critical of the English dub, which he felt adversely affected both content and mood. Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer gave it a 4.5 out of 5, describing it as \\"painfully intimate and touchingly sentimental\\" and \\"the single most beautiful animated film ever created\\". Despite the film's length, Storm was impressed that Shinkai was able to connect his audience with his characters faster and more effectively than full-length films. He worried that some viewers might miss the subtle message of the film and view it as a \\"by-the-books love story that can feel cliche or even trite\\". Curtis Stone of Geekenstein gave it a 5 out of 5 and rated it #1 in his top five list of anime for 2013. He praised not only the art and music, but especially the voice acting, which he felt was perfect for the final scene. Lindsay Nelson at Midnight Eye compared the film to Whisper of the Heart by Studio Ghibli for its poetic use of \\"seemingly bland and uninteresting locations\\". She was impressed with both the sound and art, and particularly the sweeping view of the Docomo tower with the sunset in the background. However, she criticized it for its \\"tearfully over-the-top climax\\", \\"treacly\\" pop theme song, and lack of reflective silence. Andrew Hamlin at Northwest Asian Weekly gave it a 3.5 out of 4 stars, applauding its poetic use of nature while criticizing the film's brevity. Trung Rwo at Twitch Film also praised the artwork and felt the film displayed \\"honest and fresh emotions\\". He described it as \\"clean and cute, a little bit cheesy\\" due to the highly emotional ending. Sam at Otaku's Study gave the film an A-, describing it as an \\"immersive love story\\" and complimenting the Japanese voice acting and music. Allen Moody of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews praised the artwork and claimed it overshadowed the film's flaws, which he felt were its short length and underdeveloped story. Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post praised the artwork, but felt that the story was weak, noting the simplicity of the plot, the abrupt ending, and the awkwardness of the age difference between the two main characters. Amy Wong, the editor at Yam, called it \\"a story of solitude and heartache that comes before love.\\" She praised the animation as its best feature, but also enjoyed its pace, though she saw the climax as overblown. Akumetsu at Anime e Manga thought the film could have been a masterpiece, but felt the plot was too straightforward, the film was too short, and the conclusion came too dramatically. Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post reviewed the Blu-ray release, noting that the dialogue was \\"clean and clear\\" throughout the entire playback and described the high definition video as something worth showing off. He also felt the disc included a fair number of extras given the quick release. Matt Hinrichs at DVD Talk felt the video made a clean transfer from digital to Blu-ray, the atmospheric sound effects were \\"carefully crafted\\", and that the dialog in the center channel was clear. Dan Rhodes at UK Anime Network gave the DVD by Anime Limited a 9 out of 10, calling it a \\"barebones release\\", though praising its reversible insert. Serdar Yegulalp, of About.com Reviews, stated: \\"A gorgeous short film designed to tug on the emotions as much as it fills the eyes.\\" Awards and other recognition Not only did the iTunes Store staff recommend The Garden of Words, it was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. In addition to the high acclaim on iTunes, The Garden of Words won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award. At the 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival, it shared the Satoshi Kon Award for Achievement in Animation with Berserk: Golden Age Arc III ‚Äì Descent while winning the Audience Award for Best Animation Feature. At the 2014 Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film, it won the AniMovie Award for feature films. Storyboards, original art, and other material from The Garden of Words were exhibited between June 28 and October 19, 2014 at the Ooka Makoto Kotoba Museum in Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture. The museum, run by Z-Kai Co., also featured Shinkai's commercial Cross Road (made for Z-Kai Co.), along with She and Her Cat and 5 Centimeters Per Second. In addition to the display materials and film viewings for each of the works, a replica of the shoes designed by Takao was also on display.

Born in Hammersmith, Stroud played the first half of his professional career with Southampton, and later played for Leyton Orient, Newport County and Hastings United. He retired from professional football in 1954, after which he worked in coaching positions at former clubs Newport County and Southampton. Life and career Stroud was a product of youth football in Hampshire, and eventually signed as a youth player at Southampton in May 1938 at the age of 18. He signed professional terms with the club in February 1940, and during the break from competitive football due to World War II made almost 200 appearances and converted from a forward to a wing half. Despite this lengthy allegiance to the Saints, Stroud spent only the first season after the war with the club in the Second Division, making 29 league appearances and scoring four goals, mainly from the right side of the half back line. In June 1947 Stroud joined Leyton Orient as part of a deal which saw full back Ted Ballard taking his place in the Southampton squad. First-team league football was similarly available for the wing half at the London club, and Stroud made 65 league appearances for the team in three seasons. In June 1950 he moved up to Welsh side Newport County for three seasons, and later finished his playing career with Southern League side Hastings United. After retiring from playing, Stroud returned to Newport County as coach of the reserves team, where he remained for nine years before returning to Southampton to work as youth team assistant coach. During his 24-year stint with the Southampton Academy, Stroud assisted in the development of such legendary Saints players as Mick Channon, Matthew Le Tissier and Alan Shearer, before retiring in 1987 after briefly working as the coach for a Hants Intermediate XI team.

It provides long-term psychiatric care and psychosocial rehabilitation services to the entire Eastern Cape. The hospital has a full-time psychiatrist since December 2015. The hospital departments include a rehabilitation centre, pharmacy, anti- retroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV/AIDS, laundry services, and kitchen service. In 1894 the colonial government converted the barracks at Fort Beaufort into an asylum for natives only. This asylum admitted both the mentally ill and patients with tuberculosis. It received far less funding than other asylums within the colony. Perhaps the most famous admission was made in 1922, when the prophetess Nontetha Nkwenkwe was incarcerated here. Today the hospital is situated on new grounds in Fort Beaufort within the Amathole Municipality. The institution serves the entire province of the Eastern Cape, with an estimated population of 6.9 million. It provides medium-to-long-term psychiatric care (approximately 180 days) and psychosocial rehabilitation services. This is a government-funded hospital consisting of 400 beds (344 males, 56 females). Vision and mission The vision of the institution is to provide an effective and efficient resource to empower psychiatric patients in the province to attain maximum level of independence, optimal wellbeing and a quality of life in a just society. The mission is to aspire to be a dynamic, well equipped resource in the province, capable of developing patients' life skills and potential, through skills education and training so that patients can be independent citizens capable of managing their own affairs in a rapidly changing society. Staff The hospital has a chief executive officer, clinical manager and a hospital board. The multi-disciplinary team consists of nurses, a psychiatrist, two clinical psychologists, two occupational therapists and five social workers. There is an onsite pharmacy run by two full-time pharmacists. The administrative service consists of an onsite human resources department, finance officer and supply chain office. The grounds are maintained by the workshop staff. There is onsite laundry and kitchen services. Services In addition to general psychiatric care the Hospital provides psychosocial rehabilitation services. The Rehabilitation Centre is the flagship of the institution. The Centre provides an onsite adult basic education, computer literacy, piggery, carpentry, leather works, garden projects, sewing and art work. The Art Work project jointly runs an exhibition with Fort England Psychiatric Hospital at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival. The Centre is embarking on an Independent Livings Project, a move towards the provision of community psychiatric services. Referral procedure Patients are referred by other specialised psychiatric hospitals and mental health units from within the province. Referral forms are available from the patient administration office.

According to local tradition, a picture of Saint Joseph hanging in the schoolhouse was untouched by an arson fire, and the parish was therefore dedicated to him. The historic parish church is located at 110 E. Henri de Tonti Boulevard. It is a large Late Gothic structure, built in 1939‚Äì44 from rusticated concrete blocks that were fashioned on site. Its architecture is characterized by buttresses, lancet-arched windows, and a square tower with open belfry projecting at one corner. The main entrance, on the south gable end, has a projecting arched surround finished in stucco. The church has been a major cultural civic center for the local Italian community, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

After a prolonged siege, the Cossacks were defeated and surrendered to the Commonwealth forces. Background The unrest in Ukraine among Cossacks remained high following the defeat of the Pavlyuk Uprising in 1637. After the uprising, the Sejm passed a law setting the number of registered Cossacks at 6,000, and declaring all others peasants. This led to a new mobilization of Cossacks, this time led by Yakiv Ostryanyn, Dmytro Hunia and Karpo Skidan. Battle After several smaller battles, the Commonwealth forces under Prince Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki caught up with the Cossack force under Ostryanyn and Hunia near Zhovnyn on the morning of 13 June. Wi≈õniowiecki decided to attack the Cossacks as soon as possible to prevent them from building a tabor fortification. He was soon reinforced by most of the Commonwealth army under regimentarz Stanis≈Çaw Potocki. The Poles deployed their infantry and artillery in the center, and the cavalry on the flanks, with the right flank under Wi≈õniowiecki, and the left under Potocki. Wi≈õniowiecki was able to break through the Cossack defenses, but Potocki fared less well, and Wi≈õniowiecki found himself surrounded after breaching the Cossack fortifications. After three charges, which he led personally, and in one which he lost a horse, Wi≈õniowiecki succeeded in breaking back through the Cossack fortifications and returning to the Polish camp that evening. Nonetheless, Wi≈õniowiecki's charge was enough for some Cossacks, including Ostryanyn, to abandon the camp and run away; the Cossacks would elect a new leader, Dmytro Hunia. On the morning on the next day, Wi≈õniowiecki led an infantry assault. The Cossacks, expecting reinforcement, had begun negotiations, which, however, broke down quickly. In the meantime, Cossack reinforcements under Karpo Skidan fared less well, losing some skirmishes. In the end, only a part of them broke through to the Cossack camp, and Skidan himself would be captured during the assault on 16 June. The siege dragged on, as the Cossack fort was well built, and the besieging forces failed to prevent small parties of reinforcements from relieving the Cossacks. The Polish forces were also lacking in infantry and ammunition for the artillery. Before Polish reinforcements under Hetman Miko≈Çaj Potocki arrived around 21 June, the Cossacks under Hunia succeeded in building a bridge in the night and moving the entire camp to a new location nearby. Potocki arrived soon after the Cossacks finished their relocation, on the 22nd. It would be a week before the Polish forces were reinforced by the much-needed artillery. Despite the artillery support, a new assault on 10 July failed to take the camp. The Commonwealth forces decided to wait for the Cossacks to run out of supplies. In the meantime, on the night of 22 to 23 July, a few dozen Cossacks managed to sneak into the Polish camp, kill a number of artillery personnel, and almost succeed in wrecking the entire artillery section. Meanwhile, another Cossack leader, Filonienko, attempted to relieve the camp, bringing much needed supplies. On 4 August, two battles took place: another assault on the camp, and a battle against the Cossack reinforcements. To bypass the Polish cordon, Filonenko used river boats (czajki) to approach the camp. Hunia attempted to aid Filonienko with a counterattack outside the camp, and the forces clashed outside the walls of the Cossack camp in a battle that lasted the entire day. Eventually Filonienko made it to the camp, but with only a few hundred troops, and without any supplies. That night, Hunia escaped from the camp, seeking asylum in Muscovy. Aftermath Abandoned by their leader, the Cossacks entered negotiations on 7 August and surrendered soon afterward.

The First Oil Well in Oklahoma (also known as Old Faucett Well) is a historic oil well site near the present Wapanucka, Johnston County, Oklahoma. It was drilled by Dr. H.W. Faucett, who started work in 1885 on Choctaw land for the Choctaw Oil and Refining Company, but the well was not completed until 1888. A small amount of oil and gas was produced, but not in commercially usable quantity. The well was abandoned after Faucett fell ill and died later in 1888. The first commercially productive well in Indian Territory was the Nellie Johnstone No. 1 well near Bartlesville, Oklahoma (then in the Cherokee Nation), drilled in 1897. The well was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1972. The capped well casing is the well's only remnant. Background The presence of oil in Indian Territory had been observed for many years, usually as natural seepage from the ground. Oklahoma Historian Muriel H. Wright described an incident in 1859, in which Lewis Ross, the brother of Cherokee Chief John Ross, attempted to drill a deep water well for the salt works he owned in the Cherokee Nation. Instead, the well hit an oil formation. She reported that production was estimated at ten barrels a day for nearly a year. Production stopped when gas pressure in the formation dropped too low to continue the flow.Wright, Muriel H. \\"First Oklahoma Oil was Produced in 1859.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 4, No. 4. December, 1926. Accessed August 18, 2016. According to the NRHP submission, Dr. H. W. Faucett, a resident of New York, was one of the first businessmen to recognize the potential of oil as a fuel in Indian Territory. He wrote the following letter to Rev. Allen Wright, Governor of the Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory, dated December 12, 1883, proposing terms for exploiting this resource. > ... It would be impossible to interest capital in the work unless there was > some agreement as to the extent of territory that could be had and the > specified royalty; it would not do to wait until petroleum was found. You > will please write me fully and explicitly as to what can be done in both the > Choctaw and Chickasaw nations. Say if you think the exclusive privilege can > be had, also the pipe line privilege for transporting oil. Allen Wright evidently approved the proposal in principle and passed it on to the tribal council. On October 23, 1883, the council approved creating the \\"... Choctaw Oil and Refining Company, for the purpose of finding petroleum or rock oil, and increasing the revenue of the Choctaw Nation.\\" The authorizations (basically concessions) gave exclusive rights for producing, transporting and refining in both nations ... an larea of nearly . Muriel Wright reported that Dr. Eliphalet Nott Wright, then president of the Choctaw and Refining Company, enthusiastically backed Faucett. On several occasions when funds ran dangerously low, Dr. Wright supplied his own money to pay the workers and keep the well digging work going. This calmed the fears of other important Choctaws that Faucett was at fault for delaying completion of the well. Drilling operation Faucett's crew erected a drilling rig on Choctaw land near Clear Boggy Creek in late 1885. The actual drilling operation was a very slow operation because all supplies had to be shipped by railroad from St. Louis to Atoka, then loaded onto oxcarts and driven to the job site. Poor lines of communications with Faucett's backers in the East slowed the delivery of funds, further hampering progress. Construction of the Choctaw well apparently did not begin until after August 1885. By that time, members of both the Choctaw and Cherokee companies were complaining openly about the delays. Faucett explained to the Choctaw company that everything was ready to begin. However, the Cherokee operation, which had been approved a few months after the Choctaw agreements, would be started later. So, the Cherokee council repealed its 1884 act, effectively canceling their part of the project. On receiving this news, Faucett's New York backers, also backed out of the deal. That forced Faucett to find new financial backing in St. Louis. When Robert L. Owen tried to get the Cherokee council to reinstate the project in the following year, he found that both the Cherokees and the St. Louis backers had lost interest, so the Cherokee well was never resumed. End of the Choctaw project The Choctaw project continued as promised, without unnecessary delays. Finally, the hole reached a depth of , when the well started showing both oil and gas. Faucett became ill at the jobsite just as work was being completed. He rushed to his home in Neosho, Missouri to seek medical treatment, but died shortly after. Evidently, all other parties to the project felt they could not continue without him, so the Choctaw Oil Company capped the well, abandoned the site and went out of business.

There are concepts for reparations in legal philosophy and reparations in transitional justice. Throughout history reparations for slavery have been both given by legal ruling in court and/or given voluntarily (without court rulings) by individuals and institutions. Reparations can take numerous forms, including: individual monetary payments, settlements, scholarships, waiving of fees, and systemic initiatives to offset injustices, land-based compensation related to independence, apologies and acknowledgements of the injustices, token measures, such as naming a building after someone, or the removal of monuments and renaming of streets that honor slave owners and defenders of slavery. There are many instances of reparations for slavery relating to the Atlantic slave trade dating back to the at least 1783 in North America, with a growing list of modern day examples of Reparations for slavery in the United States in 2020 as the call for reparations in the US has been bolstered by protests around police brutality and other cases of systemic racism in the US. Recently in the US, the call for reparations for racism has been made alongside calls for reparations for slavery. Despite many calls for reparations, examples of international reparations for slavery consist of recognition of the injustice of slavery and apologies for involvement but no material compensation.\\"Blair 'sorrow' over slave trade\\". BBC News, 27 November 2006. Accessed 15 March 2007.  United States  Slavery ended in the United States in 1865 with the end of the American Civil War and the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which declared that, \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction\\". At that time, an estimated four million African Americans were set free.  Support for reparations  Within the political sphere, only one major bill demanding slavery reparations has been proposed at the national level, the \\"Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act,\\" which former Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-MI) proposed unsuccessfully to the United States Congress every year from 1989 until his resignation in 2017.Cong. John Connyers. My Reparations Bill ‚Äì HR 40., Institute of the Black World. As its name suggests, the bill recommended the creation of a commission to study the \\"impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of our nation\\"., however there are cities and institutions which have initiated their own reparations in the US (see for a list). In 2014, prominent American journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates published an article titled \\"The Case for Reparations\\", which discussed the continued effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws and made renewed demands for reparations. Coates makes reference to Rep. John Conyers Jr.'s aforementioned H.R.40 Bill, pointing out that Congress's failure to pass this bill expresses a lack of willingness to right their past wrongs. In September 2016, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent encouraged Congress to pass the aforementioned H.R.40 Bill to study reparations proposals, but the Working Group did not directly endorse any specific reparations proposal. The report noted that there exists a legacy of racial inequality in the United States, explaining that, \\"Despite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.\\" The report notes that a \\"dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the US population\\". In 1999, African-American lawyer and activist Randall Robinson, founder of the TransAfrica advocacy organization, wrote that America's history of race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination have \\"resulted in $1.4 trillion in losses for African Americans\\". Economist Robert Browne stated the ultimate goal of reparations should be to \\"restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination\\". He estimates a fair reparation value anywhere between $1.4 to $4.7 trillion, or roughly $142,000 () for every black American living today. Other estimates range from $5.7 to $14.2 and $17.1 trillion. Rapper T>I. supports reparations that give every African American $1,000,000 and that slavery caused mass incarations, poverty and other illshttps://pulptastic.com/rapper-t-i- demands-44-trillion-in-slavery-reparations/ The topic became a major issue in 2020 due to the Black Lives Matter movement naming reparations as one of their policy goals in the United States.  2020 presidential candidate endorsement for reparations  Andrew Yang said that he supports HR40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, while speaking on the Karen Hunter show.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEWUwiM3pz0 In January 2019, Marianne Williamson detailed a plan for reparations in an interview for Ebony Magazine. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have both indicated some level of support for reparations, according to NPR. Tulsi Gabbard is a cosponsor of H.R.40, the only piece of legislation in Congress to study and develop reparations proposals and Bernie Sanders is a co-sponsor for the Senate version of the bill. Kamala Harris declared in April 2019 she supports reparations. Beto O'Rourke is \\"open to considering some form of reparations,\\" according to U.S. News & World Report. Tom Steyer in the 2020 Democratic Primaries Debate in South Carolina voiced his support for reparations.  Opposition to reparations  Opposition to slavery reparations is reflected in the general population. In a study conducted by YouGov in 2014, only 37% of Americans believed that slaves should have been provided compensation in the form of cash after being freed. Furthermore, only 15% believed that descendants of slaves should receive cash payments. The findings indicated a clear divide between black and white Americans on this issue. The study summarized their findings, noting: \\"Only 6% of white Americans support cash payments to the descendants of slaves, compared to 59% of black Americans. Similarly, only 19% of whites ‚Äì and 63% of blacks ‚Äì support special education and job training programs for the descendants of slaves.\\" In 2014, in response to Ta-Nehisi Coates's article, \\"The Case for Reparations\\", conservative journalist Kevin D. Williamson published an article titled \\"The Case Against Reparations.\\" In it, Williamson argues: \\"The people to whom reparations are owed are long dead\\". Another article opposing reparations to slavery was also published in 2014 by Canadian-American neoconservative political commentator David Frum.  United Kingdom  The African Reparations Movement, also known as ARM UK, was formed in 1993 following the Abuja Proclamation declared at the First Pan-African Conference on Reparations, in Abuja, Nigeria in the same year. The conference was convened by the Organisation of African Unity and the Nigerian government. On 10 May 1993 Bernie Grant MP, tabled a motion in the House of Commons that the House welcomes the proclamation and recognised that the proclamation \\"calls upon the international community to recognise that the unprecedented moral debt owed to African people has yet to be paid, and urges all those countries who were enriched by enslavement and colonisation to review the case for reparations to be paid to Africa and to Africans in the Diaspora; acknowledges the continuing painful economic and personal consequences of the exploitation of Africa and Africans in the Diaspora and the racism it has generated; and supports the OAU as it intensifies its efforts to pursue the cause of reparations.\\" The motion was sponsored by Bernie Grant, Tony Benn, Tony Banks, John Austin-Walker, Harry Barnes, and Gerry Bermingham. An additional forty-six Labour Party MPs signed to support the motion including former leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn. The Abuja Proclamation called for national reparations committees to be set up throughout Africa and the Diaspora. Bernie Grant formed ARM UK as the co- founder and chairperson, with a core group including: secretary, Sam Walker; treasurer Linda Bellos and trustees Patrick Wilmott, Stephen Small, Dorothy Kuya and Hugh Oxley. The aims of the organisation were to: * to use all lawful means to obtain Reparations for the enslavement and colonisation of African people in Africa and in the African Diaspora * to use all lawful means to secure the return of African artefacts from whichever place they are currently held * to seek an apology from western governments for the enslavement and colonisation of African people * to campaign for an acknowledgement of the contribution of African people to World history and civilisation * to campaign for an accurate portrayal of African history and thus restore dignity and self-respect to African people * to educate and inform African youth, on the continent and in the Diaspora, about the great African cultures, languages and civilisations. Following the death of Bernie Grant in 2000 ARM UK became inactive. In 2004 descendants of Africans enslaved in America enlisted lawyer Ed Fagan in a class action lawsuit against insurance market Lloyd's of London, among other British and American corporations, stating that by insuring and financing the slaving ships they were complicit in genocide. The case was not successful. In Jamaica in 2004, a coalition of Rastafari movement and the Berber Moors who claim to have built the infrastructure of nations but never fully got paid for their building knowledge, and other groups argued that European countries formerly involved in the slave trade, especially Britain, should pay 72.5 billion pounds sterling to resettle 500,000 Jamaican Rastafarians in Africa. The claim was rejected by the British government, which said it could not be held accountable for wrongs in past centuries. On 27 November 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a partial apology for Britain's role in the African slavery trade. However African rights activists denounced it as \\"empty rhetoric\\" that failed to address the issue properly. They feel his apology stopped shy to prevent any legal retort. Blair again apologized on 14 March 2007.\\"Blair 'sorry' for UK slavery role\\". BBC News, 14 March 2007. Accessed 15 March 2007. On 24 August 2007, Ken Livingstone (then Mayor of London) apologized publicly for London's role in the slave trade. \\"You can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery\\", he said pointing towards the financial district, before breaking down in tears. He claimed that London was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. Jesse Jackson praised Mayor Livingstone, and added that reparations should be made.  Africa  In 1999, the African World Reparations and Repatriation Truth Commission called for the West to pay $777 trillion to Africa within five years. In September 2001, the United Nations sponsored the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance held in Durban, South Africa. The Durban Review Conference sponsored a resolution stating that the West owed reparations to Africa due to the \\"racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance\\" that the Atlantic slave trade caused. Leaders of several African nations supported this resolution. The former Minister of Justice of Sudan, Ali Mohamed Osman Yassin, stated that the slave trade is responsible for the current problems plaguing Africa.  Caribbean  Haiti Having attained its independence from France in 1804 through a brutal and costly war, the case for reparations to Haiti was tenable. Shortly thereafter, France would demand that the newly founded Haiti pay the French government and slaveholders 90 million francs for the \\"theft\\" of the slaves' own lives (Compensated emancipation) and the land that they had turned into profitable sugar and coffee-producing plantations in order to formally recognize the fledgling nation's independence. This debt was financed by French banks and the American Citibank, and finally paid off in 1947. This century long extortion inflicted upon Haiti by her former colonizer would provide further grounds for a modern day discussion regarding possible reparations. In 2003, then-President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide demanded that France compensate Haiti for over $21 billion, the modern equivalent of the 90 million gold francs Haiti was forced to pay to gain international recognition. Commonwealth Caribbean In 2007, Guyana President Bharrat Jagdeo formally called on European nations to pay reparations for the slave trade. President Jagdeo stated, \\"Although some members of the international community have recognized their active role in this despicable system, they need to go step further and support reparations.\\" In 2014, the Parliament of Guyana established a \\"Reparations Committee of Guyana\\" to further investigate the impact of slavery and create formal demands for reparations. In 2011, Antigua & Barbuda called for reparations at the United Nations, saying \\"that segregation and violence against people of African descent had impaired their capacity for advancement as nations, communities and individuals\\". More recently, in 2016, Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States, Sir Ronald Sanders, called on Harvard University \\"to demonstrate its remorse and its debt to unnamed slaves from Antigua and Barbuda.\\" According to Sanders, Isaac Royall Jr., who was the first endowed professor of law at Harvard, relied on the slaves on his plantation in Antigua when establishing Harvard Law School. Sanders recommended these reparations come in the form of annual scholarships for Antiguans and Barbudans. In 2012, Jamaica revived its reparations commission, to consider the question of whether the country should seek an apology or reparations from Britain for its role in the slave trade. The opposition cited Britain's role in the end of the slave trade as a reason that Britain should issue no reparations. Also in 2012, the Barbados government established a twelve-member Reparations Task Force, to be responsible for sustaining the local, regional and international momentum for reparations.\\"Barbados Takes Lead in Fight For Reparations for Slavery in the Caribbean\\", Atlanta Black Star, November 6, 2012.Patrick Hunter, \\"CARICOM and reparations for slavery\\", Share, 20 February 2013. Barbados is reportedly \\"currently leading the way in calling for reparations from former colonial powers for the injustices suffered by slaves and their families.\\"Sanchez Manning, \\"Britain's colonial shame: Slave-owners given huge payouts after abolition\\", The Independent, 24 February 2013.\\"Barbados Takes Lead in Fight For Reparations for Slavery in the Caribbean\\", Atlanta Black Star, November 6, 2012. In 2013, in the first of a series of lectures in Georgetown, Guyana, to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the 1763 Berbice Slave Revolt, Principal of the Cave Hill Campus of the University of the West Indies, Sir Hilary Beckles urged Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries to emulate the position adopted by the Jews who were persecuted during the Second World War and have since organized a Jewish reparations fund.\\"UWI principal wants CARICOM to seek reparation for slavery\\", Jamaica Observer, 12 February 2013.Rony Best, \\"The Case for Reparations\\", The New York Carib News, 6 March 2013.  CARICOM Reparations Commission  Following Sir Hilary Beckles's advice, the CARICOM Reparations Commission was created in September 2013. In 2014, 15 Caribbean nations unveiled the \\"CARICOM Ten Point Plan for Reparatory Justice\\" which spelled out demands for reparations from Europe \\"...for the enduring suffering inflicted by the Atlantic slave trade\\". Among these demands were formal apologies from all nations involved (as opposed to \\"statements of regret\\"), repatriation of displaced Africans to their homeland, programs to help Africans learn about and share their histories, and institutions to improve slavery descendants' literacy, physical health, and psychological health. Representatives of Caribbean states have repeatedly announced their intention to bring the issue to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). However, no action has been taken. Moreover, from the perspective of international law, it is disputed whether slavery, genocide and other crimes against humanity had been outlawed at the time they were committed in the Caribbean. As international law knows the principle of intertemporal law, in principle today's prohibitions cannot be applied retroactively. Still, some lawyers have argued that exceptions to the principle of intertemporal law are applicable in cases of crimes against humanity, as European states and their representatives could not expect slavery to be legal in the future (referred to as teleological reduction of the principle).

The oil field, discovered in September 1972 by Signal Oil and Gas Company,Department of Trade and Industry, North Sea Oil and Gas: A Report to Parliament, 1973, p. 2. is produced over the Thistle Alpha platform, located 125 nautical miles Northeast of Sumburgh, Shetland Islands and 275 nautical miles Northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland. Licence P236 was awarded as part of the UKCS fourth round in 1972, and the first well on the site was drilled and completed in July 1973 when the Thistle oil field was confirmed as a commercial discovery. The oil has a gravity of 38.4¬∞API. The oil field is estimated to have a reserve of roughly 824 million barrels of oil. The nearby Deveron field, also produced over the Thistle Alpha platform, was discovered in 1972 following the successful completion of a second well on the site. A 1997 seismic re-interpretation site's estimated the reserves to be roughly 61.3 million barrels of oil. Production commenced for partners BNOC, Britoil and BP on the site in 1978. Ownership of the operations licence for the site was subsequently transferred to DNO in 2003, followed by Lundin in 2004 before the de-merging of Lundin's UK assets in 2010, when EnQuest became the operator. The site is currently operated in partnership between EnQuest and BP, with EnQuest holding over 99% of the total ownership of the site. Thistle Alpha platform The Thistle Alpha platform is a fixed installation, which consists of a 60-slot drilling and production platform.http://www.enquest.com/thistle-alpha-20121217.pdf It was built by Laing Offshore at the Graythorp Dry Dock, Teesside now renamed TERRC The jacket is a conventional steel tower structure approximately 183 meters tall with a base measuring 85 meters by 82 meters and weighs 31,500 tonnes with an integral Module Sub Frame (MSF), and is secured by steel piles driven 143 meters into the seabed. The Thistle Alpha platform was installed and completed in 1976. The installation comprises a steel jacket with four main legs, supporting 36 modules arranged on 3 deck levels. 28 of these modules contain the equipment and machinery, which constitute the production, utilities, drilling systems and facilities. The remaining 8 modules situated on the southeast end of the installation contain living quarters (LQ), offices, the central control room (CCR), the helideck and workshops. The platform was installed on the jacket in 1978. Oil from the Thistle and Deveron reservoirs is recovered by platform wells. The oil is processed through a two-stage production separation system. Stabilized oil is metered and exported using the main oil line pumps to the Brent Pipeline System. The original gas compression system has been decommissioned as a result of a small volume of gas separated from the oil being flared. Produced water is cleaned and discharged to the sea. Oil is imported from the Dons field via an 8\\" pipeline, and combined with oil produced by the Thistle platform. The combined oil production is exported from the Thistle platform through a 16\\" pipeline through the Brent Pipeline System via the Dunlin and Cormorant platforms to the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal. Gas is imported from the Northern Leg Gas Pipeline (NLGP) system. A portion of the imported gas is used for as fuel to provide the Thistle installation with power, with the remainder exported to the Dunlin and Northern Producer installations. Production history Production through the Thistle Alpha platform production system peaked at 130,000 barrels per day in the early 1980s and fell to a low of about 3,750 barrels per day in 2008. EnQuest took over the field from Lundin in 2008 and commenced the Thistle Late Life Extension (LLX) strategy. This strategy is currently delivering twice as much production in 2012 as was delivered in 2008, with the potential for more in the future. In 2014 the Thistle Alpha produced more than 3 million barrels of oil, the first time since 1997. Thistle Late Life Extension The Thistle Late Life Extension (LLX) Strategy aims to recover over 35 million barrels of oil over the next 15 years from the Thistle and Deveron oil fields, using a mixture of existing well stock and new wells. A drill rig re-activation project has been completed and has successfully delivered several new wells and well renovations to date with an industry leading-safety record. The Thistle LLX strategy will also ensure that the Thistle platform will be operable to 2025 and beyond. To achieve this, a series of major activities have started including initiatives to provide reliable power, improve structural and topsides integrity, upgrade safety and control systems and simplify the platform oil and production and water treatment processes. These activities are scheduled to run from 2012 to 2015, dependent upon receipt of the UK Government support through the Brown Field Allowance (BFA). Thistle Alpha platform structural concerns On 21 October 2019 all production on the Thistle Alpha was shut down and the platform was fully evacuated as a precaution following a routine subsea inspection of the jacket‚Äôs structural condition. On board at the time were 115 staff, who were removed by in-field and UK Coastguard helicopters to the Dunlin Alpha platform.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney- shetland-50134399 References Category:Oil fields of Scotland Category:1973 establishments in Scotland ","title":"Thistle oil field"},{"id":"38009587","text":"Mardock Mission was a historic meetinghouse built in 1898 in Mardock, Oklahoma. The mission was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its significance as the only remaining building associated with the Big Jim Band of Absentee Shawnee Indians, the Quaker Missionaries, and a pre-World War I socialist movement. The Absentee Shawnee were so named because in 1845 they had left the rest of the tribe in Kansas and settled along the Canadian River in Indian Territory. Big Jim, (Wapameepto), grandson of Tecumseh, was the chief of the Kispicotha, better known as the Absentee Shawnee. The group numbered 454 in 1904. The mission building and property were in the Southwest corner of the Northwest Quarter of Section 36, T9N, R1E. The village of Mardock in Cleveland County was just south of the mission for the Absentee Shawnees (Big Jim Band). This village, at one time, consisted of a post office, two stores, and a cotton gin. In 1897 the Maine Branch of the Women's National Indian Association established a mission at the location. The mission was to serve as a school, religious community and agricultural experiment station for the Indians. Buildings were constructed, an orchard planted and cropland cultivated. In 1898 or 1899 the Mission was transferred to the Associated Executive Committee of Friends who continued to operate the Mission under the direction of John T. Mardock. A Mr. Bohannon deeded the land to Mardock. The Big Jim Band was relatively non-progressive and although they were receptive to the farming and community activities, they resisted the missionizing efforts. However, the mission persisted and in the early 1900s, began to minister to the growing white population in the nearby community of Mardock. Many activities were centered at the mission: Bible talks, night evangelistic meetings, singing, group recreation and during berry season, berries were harvested and sold. Monthly farmers meetings were held and in 1929 about 35 Indian farmers still attended. The Mission was also an unofficial center for the Jones Family, a group active in the socialist movement during World War I. It is thought that some members participated in the Green Corn Rebellion activities of 1917. Young members were advised to resist the draft. After 1929 the concentrated mission effort ceased though the mission church building did serve the area white people until about 1955, when the settlement was abandoned. The property was sold to a local farmer who used the church to store hay. Sometime later an independent missionary to the Big Jim Band, Rev. Ted Reynolds, repaired the church and briefly used it. The church was nominated for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. At that time it was abandoned and was the only remaining building of the original mission property. The Big Jim Mission building was described as a small, single story, weatherboard, frame, T-shaped structure. The roof was gabled, steeply pitched. The central entry was covered with a gable roofed porch with decorative bracketing. Originally the porch roof was cantilevered over the concrete step with support posts later added. A diamond-shaped window was in the front end gable. Single windows were found on four facades and paired windows on three facades. A single brick exterior chimney stack was on the east elevation. Dense shrubs and numerous trees closely surrounded the building. Exterior alterations included partial filling of two windows.

Until 1947, it was known by its German name Juditten (; ) as first a suburb of and then a quarter of K√∂nigsberg, Germany. Juditten Church was a site of pilgrimage since the Middle Ages. The philosopher Johann Christoph Gottsched was born in Juditten in 1700. Etymology The estate was first documented ca. 1287 as duas villas sic nominatas Gaudityn near K√∂nigsberg. The name was derived from the Old Prussian words gaudis (melancholy) and juodas (dark), describing the landscape. Separately, Eugen Reichel, a historian of Gottsched, attributed the name to a converted Sudovian chieftain known as Gedete who had relocated to Sambia.Reichel, p. 48 The site was documented in 1349 as super villam Gauditin, Gauditen and in 1402Albinus, p. 143 as Judynkirchen. In 1670 it was mentioned by its modern German name, Juditten, in ducal documents. In 1947 Juditten was renamed Mendeleyevo in Russian. History Founded in 1288, the fortified Juditten Church was one of the oldest churches of Samland and included within the state of the Teutonic Order. The estate of Juditten developed nearby. The church was a popular Catholic pilgrimage site, especially during the 14th century rule of Grand Master Konrad von Jungingen; pilgrimages were allowed to continue after Juditten converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation.Baczko, p.185 It was included within the Duchy of Prussia in 1525 and the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. Juditten was made part of East Prussia in 1773. In 1760 the estate was purchased by the wine merchant Balthasar Schindelmei√üer,Hermanowski, p. 145 a member of K√∂nigsberg Castle's Blutgericht tavern after 1805.Weise, p. 93 In 1808 his successor Johann Richter hosted King Frederick William III and Queen Louise several times.Hermanowski, p. 145 In 1814 Richter named the estate Luisenthal to honor Louise, while a fort constructed in 1855 received the name K√∂nigin Luise (Queen Louise). Juditten developed into a garden town suburb; the conservation of the parish copse was due to the efforts of the K√∂nigsberg city councillor Theodor Krohne (1846-1925). The copse was later known as the Theodor-Krohne- W√§ldchen. As a result of the Prussian administrative reorganization following the Napoleonic Wars, Juditten was included within the rural district of K√∂nigsberg (Landkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr.), part of Regierungsbezirk K√∂nigsberg in East Prussia, on 1 February 1818. The Amtsbezirk Juditten, administered from Ratshof, was created north and west of K√∂nigsberg in 1874. It included Juditten proper, Lawsken, Moditten, Spittelhof, Waldthal; the estates Charlottenburg, Friedrichswalde, Gro√ü Rathshof, Klein Rathshof, Moditten; and the Juditten mill (M√ºhle). The fort VI K√∂nigin Luise, named in 1894, was built near Juditten as part of the new K√∂nigsberg fortifications constructed from 1872-94. At the beginning of the 20th century the village was developed into a villa suburb by the private company Villenkolonie Juditten.Gause II, p. 652 On 16 June 1927 Juditten was merged into the urban district of K√∂nigsberg (Stadtkreis K√∂nigsberg i. Pr). The Juditten roads Derfflingerstra√üe, Lehwaldtstra√üe, and Frischbierweg were named after the field marshal Georg von Derfflinger, the general Hans von Lehwaldt, and the folklorist Hermann Karl Frischbier, respectively. Gottschedstra√üe and the town square Gottschedplatz honored native son Johann Christoph Gottsched. Peterweg honored Peter, the painter who created the frescoes in the church. Lovis-Corinth-Stra√üe was named after the painter Lovis Corinth.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 92 Juditten was largely unscathed during World War II. Its inhabitants either fled or were subsequently expelled westward.

The community church was located at 133 South Thompson Street. It was demolished in 1895, after most denominations had built their own churches in downtown Vinita. The Methodists had moved to a small building on South Scraper Street. Soon thereafter, they built a wooden church building on South Thompson street, where they met until the early 1920s.\\"First Methodist-Episcopal Church.\\" National Park Service. Registration Form.

After deciding to build a new facility on adjacent property on Thompson Street, the church hired the Butler and Sanders architectural firm of Tulsa to design the facility. In mid-November, the church awarded the construction contract to a Vinita firm, Love Brothers Construction Company. The old wood frame church was donated to an African Methodist-Episcopal congregation. The last ceremony in that structure was held on October 22, 1922.

Matthias was working under time pressure, because his wife was suffering from an inoperable cancer. He wanted to have the church finished during her lifetime, so she could enjoy his memorial to her. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Biography of Matthias Splitlog The church was built by Matthias Splitlog who had come to Indian Territory in 1874, when he was about 62 years old. By the time he started building the church building named for him, he had already outlived his wife and nine of his ten children. Family stories said that he was of mixed ancestry, half Cayuga and half French, and born in the state of New York in 1812. According to his grandson, when he was only three years old, he was taken to Ohio, with most of the other Cayugas. The family story goes on to say that Matthias lived among the Wyandottes in Sandusky, Ohio as a young man when he married a Wyandotte woman, thus becoming a member of her tribe. A group of 700 to 800 Wyandottes emigrated to Kansas Territory in 1843, where they had been assigned on the Neosho River. The tribal leaders decided that this tract for their new home, so they bought a tract of 39 sections lying between the Kansas and Missouri Rivers. (The site of present-day Kansas City.). Although Matthias could neither read nor write, he reportedly could speak seven languages. He was also noted of his mechanical abilities. In Kansas, Matthias revealed himself to be a shrewd businessman. He built the first gristmill in Kansas, and he also built his own steamboat to carry small loads on the river. His land holdings were in the community of Westport, which had become the starting point for numerous wagon trains headed west. A company of speculators calling themselves, the Wyandotte City Company, began buying land around Westport in 1857. Matthias decided to hold out for a higher price and continued living on the land until 1860. When the Civil War broke out, he enlisted in the Union Army and ferried materiel until he was captured by the Confederates. He was paroled, and returned to Kansas.\\"Matthias Splitlog the 'Indian Millionaire.' Grand River History. Accessed November 22, 2016. Move to Indian Territory In 1863, the Union Pacific Railroad wanted to cross his land near the river and also build machine shops there. Matthias later said that he was paid a fabulous sum for the property. White settlers soon realized that the Wyandotte land was too valuable to let it remain in Native American hands and began pressuring the Government for their removal. In 1855, they discarded their treaty and tribal rights, to become citizens of the United States, with the same immunities and privileges of white people, including the right to sell their lands. Years before, the Wyandottes had given the Senecas of land on the Sandusky River in Ohio. The Wyandottes sold their Kansas properties and moved southwest. Initially, Matthias Splitlog stayed behind, but soon his friends began writing letters for him to join them in their new homeland. He had bought another parcel of land and constructed a new home in 1870. By 1874, Matthias had sold most of his property and journeyed to Indian Territory. He found a suitable tract between the Grand River and the Cowskin River, near the present day city of Grove, Oklahoma. The property included a large spring that he named Cayuga, in honor of his original tribe. Matthias immediately set to work on a variety of building projects. First he constructed a sawmill, then he built a gristmill and a large blacksmith shop. He also established a ferry and a general store. His building projects employed lots of the local people, paid good wages, and treated the employees well. After completing his own home, he built a factory to make buggies, two-seated hacks and coffins. He named the growing town Cayuga Springs. In 1884, a Cayuga post office was established, with one of Matthias' sons, Joseph, as postmaster. Since there were no public schools, Splitlog provided a building and started a subscription school for the community's children. Fate of Cayuga Springs John Wesley Morris wrote a brief description of Cayuga Springs and its church. In it, he said that the village burned in 1913. Only the church, the priest's house and the carriage factory remained. Destroyed structures included a hotel, general store, post office, blacksmith shop and eight or ten dwellings.Morris, John Wesley, \\"Cayuga Springs.\\" Ghost Towns of Oklahoma. University of Oklahoma Press. Norman. p. 42. Available on Google Books Accessed November 21, 2016. After Matthias died, the of land containing the church and cemetery were deeded to the Catholic Church. However, membership declined as Cayuga's residents moved away, and the Church found it very difficult to supply priests to serve this mission, so the parish was dissolved. The confessional, the altar and certain other Catholic-specific items were removed and taken to other churches. The bell was taken down and sent to St. Catherine's church in Nowata, Oklahoma.\\"Splitlog Church.\\" National Register of Historic Places Inventory Form. Accessed November 22, 2016.

It was the first time Belmondo played a police officer. It was released in the USA and the UK as The Night Caller. Plot Policeman Jean Letellier is under pressure because the infamous gangster Marcucci escaped from him publicly. Moreover during the pursuit an innocent bystander was killed by a stray bullet. Letellier is investigated for having fired the deadly bullet. Before Letellier is cleared, a serial killer begins to murder young women, each time leaving a weird message at the site of crime. He calls himself \\"Minos\\", referring to the Divine Comedy. The murderer always declares he had punished his victims for what he considers their impure life style. While Letellier still has no trace of \\"Minos\\", he comes across Marcucci's current whereabouts. Just as before, Marcucci tries to escape in a spectacular manner when Letellier confronts him. But this time Marcucci dies in the course of action. Marcucci's death is no relief for Letellier who is now publicly accused of having neglected the \\"Minos\\" case in favour of settling his personal feud with his late archenemy. \\"Minos\\" keeps on murdering and leaving provoking hints until Letellier can identify him. The serial killer can only scarcely elude Letellier, who chases him over the roofs of Paris. His next coup is to take hostages in a skyscraper. Letellier decides he has had it and goes airborne.

It is situated in the Knightsfield area of Welwyn Garden City in the county of Hertfordshire and long predates the building of the town.Richard J Busby 'The Book of Welwyn' Barracuda Books Third Edition 1983 The current house was erected a little eastward of the site on which its predecessor had stood and was built as a commodious country gentleman's home, in an architectural style that can best be described as neoclassical. A portico, with four massive Ionic columns, on the south front is its most impressive external feature. History Before 1785 An old manor house west of the present-day Digswell House was built by Sir John Peryent in the early 15th century. The old manor house was subsequently inhabited by the families of Peryent, Horsey, Sedley and Shallcross. Capability Brown created some of the landscape work at Digswell between 1771 and 1773. 1785-1850 The mediaeval manor house was purchased in 1785 by George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper and as it was in poor condition was then demolished in 1805 to make way for new mansion. 1850s The house was occupied by Henry Pearse Esquire a West India Merchant with his wife Mary and daughters Mary Louisa, Julia Charlotte, Alice Jane and sons Cosmo Brice and Ernest Charles and a full house of staff are shown in the 1851 census. He also resided at No. 8, Finsbury-place South, in the city of London. He was later declared bankrupt on 17 June 1854. 1880s The house was owned by Phoebe Tatham the wife of William Smith Brown. Phoebe Tatham had inherited wealth from Duncan Dunbar following his death when still a bachelor in 1862. Dunbar had been one of the largest shipping magnates in the Commonwealth having built up the Dunbar Line of trading and convict ships. Phoebe was his niece, the elder daughter of Dunbar's sister Justina and her husband, Poplar surgeon Christopher Tatham. William and Phoebe had eight children. Phoebe died at Digswell 23 February 1891 and William died 31 December 1891 at Portsea Island. 1914-1918 At this time the house was owned by the Aclands who gave over its use during the first World War Digswell House served as the Number 5 Australian Auxiliary Hospital and nursing home for wounded Australian Soldiers though Belgian and British Soldiers also stayed there. It was staffed by the Red Cross from local families. The grounds of Digswell house provided a centre for sports for those soldiers who could compete as can be seen in photographs from this period. A letter published in 1917 sums up the situation at the time. The Hon. Mrs. Acland, owner of Digswell House, has generously given up her home to convalescent Australians, the house accommodating about 25 officers. Her husband, Colonel Acland, is at the front, also her only son, Lieut. Acland, with the Grenadier Guards. Her eldest daughter is also nursing in France. Truly a patriotic family! The grounds are very extensive, and include a small lake: Plenty of shooting is available for those able to get about. A batch of Australian officers will be leaving Digswell House next week for Australia, two of whom (shot through the stomach) have some way yet to go for recovery. 1918-1939 After the war, the house was then purchased by Sir Ebenezer Howard in 1919. From 1928 to 1939 it functioned as a conference centre with good connections to London through local railway transport. Notable guests have included Mahatma Gandhi, George Bernard Shaw, Paul Robeson, Lord Beaverbrook and Hugh Gaitskell and other leading politicians and intellectuals of the time. 1945-1959 After the second World War Digswell House served as a boarding house and a place of retreat. Between 1955 and 1957 Digswell House was the Boarding House for Sherrardswood School. After 1959 Notable visitors include Henry Moore who was one of the inspiring figures in the creation of the trust. It remained a retreat for artists until 1985 when Digswell House was sold and turned into a collection of private dwellings. The Digswell Arts Trust continues to this day but has moved to another site.

It is sometimes treated as a synonym of refactoring code, which involves making the source code itself easier to understand, maintain, and modify.  Examples   C++  In C++, code cleanup involves deallocating previously allocated dynamic memory. This is usually done with the C++ \`delete\` and \`delete[]\` operations. int x = 15; int* mySequence = new int[x]; for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) { mySequence[i] = 0; } mySequence[0] = -127; delete[] mySequence;  Python  In Python 3, explicit deletion of variables requires the \`del\` keyword. x = 15 my_sequence = [0 for useless_variable in range(x)] my_sequence[0] = -127 del my_sequence  JavaScript  In JavaScript, objects are garbage collected if they are unreachable from the global object. One way to make an object unreachable is to overwrite the variables or properties that reference it. let x = {}; // The variable x is declared and set to an object x = null; // x is overwritten and the object becomes unreachable  Java  In Java, variables cannot be truly deleted. The most that can be done is to set the variable to \`null\`, which works with any Java object, including arrays. int x = 15; int[] my_sequence = new int[x]; for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) { my_sequence[i] = 0; } my_sequence[0] = -127; my_sequence = null;  Other meanings  Code cleanup can also refer to the removal of all computer programming from source code, or the act of removing temporary files after a program has finished executing. For instance, in a web browser such as Chrome browser or Maxthon, code must be written in order to clean up files such as cookies and storage. The deletion of temporary files is similar to the deletion of unneeded lists and arrays of data. However, a file is treated as a permanent way to store a resizable list of bytes, and can also be removed from existence.

This species is a member of the tribe Cynipini: the oak gall wasp tribe. Cynipini is the tribe partially responsible for the formation of galls known as oak apples on oak trees. These are formed after the wasp lays eggs inside the leaf buds and the plant tissues swell as the larvae of the gall wasp develop inside. This wasp has a widespread distribution within Europe.  Description  Biorhiza pallida has a complex life cycle involving an agamic female that reproduces by parthenogenesis without a male during the summer, and a winter/spring generation of adults where individuals are either male or female. These mate and produce fertilised eggs. The wingless agamic wasp is between long. The head is golden brown with mid-brown eyes and orange ocelli (simple eyes). The long antennae have fifteen segments and are orangeish-brown. The thorax, legs and bulbous, glistening gaster (abdomen) are yellowish-brown. Male and female wasps that develop in the summer generation are smaller with a length between . The head, thorax and gaster are golden brown and translucent. The clear wings have dark veins and pale brown hairs. The eyes are large and dark in the case of the female and pale in the male. The other main difference between the sexes is the gaster, which is deep and narrow in the male and broad and tipped with an ovipositor in the female.  Life cycle  Oak apple in which larvae are developing The winter-hatching generation of agamic females climb up the trunks of oak trees such as Quercus robur and Quercus petraea in the spring. They lay batches of eggs in the young buds of the oak, injecting venom at the same time. This causes the leaf tissues to swell and soften. The eggs hatch and the larvae secrete further substances that encourage plant growth and a globular gall is formed. Reaching as much as in diameter, it is soft and pudgy at first, but later becomes dry and papery. The gall provides a nutritious, protective environment and there may be as many as thirty larvae developing inside. Males and females emerge from different galls after two to three months. After mating, the females descend to the ground where they make their way into the soil and lay their eggs singly inside the small rootlets of the oak. Small globular galls appear on the roots and after overwintering as larvae, another generation of wingless agamic females emerge and crawl up the trunk.  Ecology  As well as providing food and protection to the wasp larvae, the galls provide shelter for several inquiline species of gall wasp including Synergus gallaepomiformis and Synergus umbraculus. These share the tissues that provide food for the wasp larvae. About twenty other species of gall wasps are hyperparasites and live inside the gall and parasitise the rightful owners, the Biorhiza pallida larvae.

They were married February 22, 1922 and honeymooned in France. They moved to New York City after they wed to pursue separate illustration careers. Eventually, the couple worked out of their Westport, Connecticut home. Commercial illustrator Dorothy was a commercial illustrator specializing in babies and children. She was one of the \\"Ivory Soap Baby\\" illustrators for Procter & Gamble, illustrating children's books for Putnam and several magazine covers. *Woman's Home Companion August 1925 *Woman's Home Companion September 1934 *Parent-Teacher Magazine April 1935 *Parent's Magazine June 1936 *The Farmer's Wife Magazine December 1936 Dorothy worked regularly from the 1920s until her death in 1955. She was a successful commercial illustrator for many products. Gerber baby Dorothy's famous Gerber Baby drawing came about through a contest. In 1928, Gerber invited artists to submit drawings of babies for a contest. Dorothy submitted a preliminary charcoal sketch. The sketch was created from a snapshot of Ann Turner, the child of a family friend. Dorothy's unfinished submission was intended more as an inquiry as to what the age of the baby should be and what the ad size would be.Heim, Michael, Exploring America's Highways, Exploring America's Highway (2004), Dorothy intended to finish the sketch if accepted. The Gerber Company judges, however, preferred the simplicity of the illustration when compared to other more elaborate entries. Dorothy won $300 in the contest, selling the rights of her drawing to Gerber. Due to its popularity, Gerber officially trademarked the drawing in 1931. Perry Barlow Dorothy's husband, Perry Barlow was a cartoonist for The New Yorker magazine, drawing 135 covers over the years in addition to many cartoons. He also contributed work to Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and others. Because Perry was partially colorblind, his wife Dorothy helped with the color process of his work. Dorothy and Perry had 2 sons, Collins and Peter. Peter's child is Dorothy's only granddaughter. Dorrie carries her namesake, Dorothy \\"Dorrie\\" Barlow Thomas. After Dorothy's death in 1955, their son Peter continued the color treatments to Perry's work.

It constitutes Tien Hai Commune of H√† Ti√™n, Ki√™n Giang Province, Vietnam. Since pirates used to plague the region in the past, another popular name for the islands is H·∫£i T·∫∑c Islands (, literally \\"Pirate Islands\\"). Geography A dock in H√† Ti√™n Islands. Photo: ƒê·ªó Do√£n Ho√†ng. The H√† Ti√™n Islands lie off the coast of H√† Ti√™n, to the east of Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island. The archipelago is in turn , and away from the coast of H√† Ti√™n, the mainland of Vietnam and Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island. There are in total 16 islands (other sources cited: 14 ) locating close to one another with a height of less than , and among those, Hon Doc () is the largest entity. The total area of the islands is spreading out over a water area which is in length and in width. Islands are composed primarily of Cretaceous shale and sandstone. Fresh water is scarce. History Etymology The H√† Ti√™n Islands were also formerly known as Pirate Islands since the late 17th century and early 18th century when it served as pirates' dens. Pirates departing from here attacked and seized large merchant ships from China and the Western world. The islands were still known as H·∫£i T·∫∑c (\\"Pirate\\") Islands under the administration of South Vietnam. On July 28, 1958, an ARVN military mission visited the islands and later erected a sovereignty stele which still stands on the western part of the island Hon Doc. Piracy in the past Due to the rugged topography as well as the position on the important trade route, the islands were the ideal base for pirates to hide, ambush and attack crossing merchant ships for a long time. The golden era of piracy was when H√† Ti√™n fell into anarchy following the defeat of M·∫°c Thi√™n T·ª©'s administration by Siamese army. Meanwhile, foreign ships with which pirate vessels mingled still had freedom of navigation in the area. Even when the French occupied H√† Ti√™n, this area was still being ravaged by piracy. There are some rumors about pirate treasure hiding in H√† Ti√™n Islands. In March 1983, an American and a British departing from Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island secretly visited the island of Hon Tre Nho () in the archipelago, and they brought radios, cameras, binoculars, nautical charts,... along with themselves. After being captured by local residents, two men claimed that they had a 300-year-old map passed down by their ancestors depicting pirate treasure. In 2009, some fishermen accidentally found a quantity of ancient coins. Demography Only 6 to 7 islands in the archipelago are inhabited. According to Decree No. 47/1998/ND-CP establishing the town of H√† Ti√™n in 1998, H√† Ti√™n Islands had 1,055 inhabitants. In early 2012, the island had more than 420 households with nearly 1,800 people. Economy Local residents live mainly by fishing. In 2011, the total output of marine products was 22,000 tons. Per capita income is about 48 million ƒë·ªìng (nearly 2,300 U.S dollars). Furthermore, water shortage in the dry season has been solved thanks to a freshwater reservoir. In 2007 and 2008, Kien Giang provincial government laid down a policy to lease a number of islands of Ha Tien Islands to develop marine eco-tourism.

History Tourists began hearing stories about a young Khmer man, Aki Ra, who cleared landmines with a stick and had a house full of defused ordnance. Ra began charging a dollar to see his collection, using the money to help further his activities. Thus began the Cambodia Landmine Museum. thumb In 2007 the Cambodian government ordered Aki Ra‚Äôs museum closed. He was allowed to move it to a new location 40 kilometers from Siem Reap, near Banteay Srey Temple, inside the Angkor National Park. A Canadian NGO, the Cambodia Landmine Museum Relief Fund, founded by documentary film producer Richard Fitoussi, raised the money to buy the land and build the Museum. Most of the funding was provided by Tom Shadyac, a movie director from California. The new museum opened in May 2007 and currently houses a 4 gallery museum as well as being the home to 27 children. The Cambodia Landmine Museum exists for 3 reasons: * To tell Aki Ra‚Äôs story * To tell the world about the horrors of landmines and explain that war is only half the problem. The aftermath of war continues long after the shooting stops. * To care for the children who live at the museum. Note The Cambodia Landmine Museum and Cambodian Self Help Demining are distinctly separate NGOs. They are headquartered in separate locations, run by different individuals (although Aki Ra is the MD), and funded entirely separately. The Museum and Child Relief Center is funded by revenues gained from ticket sales, donations, and sales from the small shop.

Upon this event, Ismail went to the city and stayed there until the terrorists were exterminated. President Hosni Mobarak fired Ismail in January 1982. He was replaced by Hassan Abu Basha, who was his senior aide at the interior ministry, in the post. However, Ismail continued to serve as deputy prime minister, which he had assumed during his term as interior minister. As deputy prime minister, Ismail was in charge of civil services and local governments. After leaving public office, Ismail was hired as a consultant by an Islamic investment company, al Rayyan. Assassination attempt Four gunmen in a car opened fire at Ismail's home in August 1987. He survived the attack. The Salvation from Hell group was the perpetrator of the attack. Some members of the group were arrested in August 1987. Death Ismail died at Dar Al Fouad Hospital in Cairo on 15 June 2009.

Himka received his BA in Byzantine-Slavonic Studies and Ph.D. in History from University of Michigan in 1971 and 1977 respectively. The title of his Ph.D. dissertation was Polish and Ukrainian Socialism: Austria, 1867‚Äì1890. As a historian Himka was a Marxist in the 1970s‚Äì80s, but became influenced by postmodernism in the 1990s. In 2012 he defined his methodology in history as \\"eclectic\\". Life Himka is of mixed ethnic background, Ukrainian (on father's side) and Italian (on mother's). Initially he wanted to become a Greek Catholic priest and studied at St. Basil Seminary in Stamford, Connecticut. However, due to the radicalization of his political views to the left by the end of the 1960s he did not pursue that vocation. Career Since 1977, he taught at University of Alberta, Department of History and Classics.John-Paul Himka, Curriculum vitae. Department of History and Classics, University of Alberta. He became full Professor in 1992 and retired from the university in 2014. Himka is the recipient of several awards and fellowships, most notably the Rutherford Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2006, the Philip Lawson Award for Excellence in Teaching,Fellow Professor John-Paul Himka. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. and the J. Gordin Kaplan Award for Research Excellence. He served as co-editor of the Encyclopedia of Ukraine for three volumes devoted to history.John-Paul Himka, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. Himka, who traveled to Ukraine to conduct research since 1976, began to work with academics at Lviv University's Department of History. Initially Himka focused on Galicia's social history in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 1988 1000th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus' kindled his interest in the history of Greek Catholic Church and the influence of the church in terms of the development of Ukrainian nationalism. In 2002 he researched socialism in Habsburg Galicia, a formerly autonomous region in Western Ukraine, sacred culture of the Eastern Slavs (on iconography in particular) and the Holocaust in Ukraine. Since the late 1990s his contention with what he calls Ukrainian \\"nationalist historical myths\\" became subject of increasing, sometimes heated, debates both in Ukraine and Ukrainian Diaspora (especially in North America). Himka challenged the interpretation of Holodomor as a genocide and the view that Ukrainian nationalism and nationalists played no or almost no role in the Holocaust in Ukraine. He also opposed official glorification of such nationalistic heroes as Roman Shukhevych and Stepan Bandera in Ukraine during the presidency of Viktor Yushchenko. In his 1996 article, Krakivski visti and the Jews, 1943: A Contribution to the History of Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Second World War, published in the Journal of Ukrainian Studies, based on earlier Ukrainian-language versions presented in 1991 in Kyiv and 1993 in Jerusalem at Ukrainian-Jewish relations conferences, Himka wrote that the history of Ukrainian-Jewish relations during WWII remained surprisingly underinvestigated. Himka cited Raul Hilberg's \\"monumental study\\", The Destruction of the European Jews as the source used by historians. In response to this lacuna, Himka presented his detailed study of the publishing of a series of antisemitic articles in 1943 in the \\"flagship of Ukrainian journalism under Nazi occupation,\\" Krakov's daily newspaper Krakivs'ki Visti. The primary sources for his study included the articles as well as the records of the Krakivs'ki Visti maintained by Ukrainian-Canadian Michael Chomiak, who was born in the Ukraine in the 1910s as Mykhailo Khomiak and changed his name to Michael Chomiak when he emigrated to Canada at the end of WWII. The Provincial Archives of Alberta acquired Chomiak's records in 1985 following Chomiak's death. He was the chief editor of Krakivs'ki Visti from 1940 to 1945. Himka is his son-in-law. Himka described how Krakivs'ki Visti \\"played an important and, generally, positive role in Ukrainian life,\\" \\"serving as a buffer between the German occupation authorities and the population of the Generalgouvernement.\\" In response to a May 1943 order by the German press chief, the newspaper published antisemitic articles from May 25 through July which were received negatively by the Ukrainian intelligentsia in general. Himka completed a series of three major studies on the history of Ukrainian Galicia in the 19th century. The first, Socialism in Galicia: the emergence of Polish social democracy and Ukrainian radicalism (1860‚Äì1890) was published in 1983. The second, Galician Villagers and the Ukrainian National Movement in the Nineteenth Century was published in 1988. The third, Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine: The Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian National Movement in Galicia, 1867‚Äì1900, which is \\"devoted to the interrelations between church and state\\", was published in 1999. In a book review in the Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Larry Wolff described Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine as a subtle, sophisticated and insightful account of an \\"important and profoundly complex historical problem.\\" Wolff writes that Himka's research \\"makes the case for a contingent and evolutionary perspective on nationality in which several different forms and inflections of national identity jostle one another in cultural competition, enhanced or diminished by various historical forces, including religion, without any predetermined outcome. \\"engaged with the all-important issue of national identity, makes a brilliant contribution, not just to the history of Ukrainian nationality, but also to the general theoretical understanding of modern nationalism.\\" Himke employs \\"concepts of nationality and nationalism developed by Ernest Gellner, E.J. Hobsbawm, and Miroslav Hroch. Himka observed that the \\"Greek Catholic case in Galicia\\" is \\"a stunningly transparent instance of how much agency and choice can be involved in the construction of nationality.\\" In his 2005 article, War Criminality: A Blank Spot in the Collective Memory of the Ukrainian Diaspora War Criminality he examined material that emerged from an important Ukrainian-Jewish relations conference held in 1983, that happened to be held on the 50th anniversary of the Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì33. as well as \\"current electronic media and recent years of The Ukrainian Weekly, supplemented with a retrospective sampling of articles from Svoboda.\\" At the 1983 conference, Professor Yaroslav Bilinsky 'denied \\"a causal connection between alleged collaboration of Jewish-born Communists in the collectivization of agriculture and the Great Famine and any proven collaboration of Ukrainian-born extremists in the Holocaust.\\"' His 2009 book, Last Judgment Iconography in the Carpathians, was the result of ten years of research \\"throughout the region of the Carpathian Mountains, where he \\"found a distinctive and transnational blending of Gothic, Byzantine, and Novgorodian art.\\" In his chapter Ethnicity and the Reporting of Mass Murder: Krakivs‚Ä≤ki visti, the NKVD Murders of 1941, and the Vinnytsia Exhumation, Himka examined how the Krakivs'ki Visti, an \\"important [Ukrainian] nationalist newspaper\\" \\"reported on two cases of mass violence by the Soviets, the 1941 NKVD prisoner massacres and the 1943 Vinnytsia massacre. Himka wrote that Krakivs'ki Visti \\"ethnicized both perpetrators and victims, ascribing primarily Jewish identity to the former and depicting the latter as almost exclusively Ukrainian.\\" Personal life John-Paul Himka is married to Chrystia Chomiak, Mykhailo Chomiak's (1905 ‚Äì 1984) daughter. Himka learned of Chomiak's role as editor of the Krakivs'ki Visti in Chomiak's personal papers after he died in 1984. They have two children.

The project is spearheaded by Peter Hooton of The Farm. It was originally established in 2012 as a fund-raising record raising money for the various charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster. It is best known for its charity single \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" in 2012. A closely related The Peace Collective released the charity single \\"All Together Now\\" in 2014. The Justice Tonight Band After the News International phone hacking scandal, members of The Farm along with Pete Wylie and Mick Jones of The Clash performed at an anti-The Sun concert at the Liverpool Olympia in September 2011. Following this they formed The Justice Tonight Band and toured the United Kingdom and Europe for the next year in order to raise awareness of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. Recording of \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" Initially, the idea was to re-release the 2009 single \\"The Fields of Anfield Road\\" by The Liverpool Collective featuring The Kop Choir; however, this idea was rejected by Peter Hooton as only a relatively small number of people would buy it. Inspired by Everton's Hillsborough tribute on 17 September 2012, the song was played at Goodison Park prior to their match against Newcastle United. It was then decided that a re-recording of \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\" would be made by various artists including The Justice Tonight Band and released as the charity single. Keith Mullen of The Farm recruited Guy Chambers to produce the single and with Chambers offering free use of his Sleeper Studios to record the song. On 25 October, Steve Rotheram, Guy Chambers and Kenny Dalglish announced plans of the single to be recorded by various artists. In 2012, The Justice Collective recorded a new version of \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\", a popular music ballad written by Bobby Scott and Bob Russell made famous by The Hollies. The song went on to take the coveted Christmas number 1 position for 2012 in the UK, beating The X Factor winner James Arthur, who was number one the previous week. It was number 2 in Scotland, number 4 in Ireland. The song was recorded with vocals including those of Melanie C, Robbie Williams and two original members of The Hollies, Bobby Elliott and Tony Hicks, for various charities associated with the Hillsborough disaster. Musicians Vocalists include Andy Brown (of Lawson), Gerry Marsden (of Gerry and the Pacemakers), Paul Heaton (of The Beautiful South), Glenn Tilbrook (of Squeeze), John Power (of Cast and The La's), Robbie Williams (of Take That), Melanie C (of Spice Girls), Rebecca Ferguson, Holly Johnson (from Frankie Goes to Hollywood), Paloma Faith, Beverley Knight, Eliza Doolittle, Dave McCabe (of The Zutons), Peter Hooton (of The Farm), Ren Harvieu, Jon McClure (of Reverend and The Makers), Paul McCartney (of The Beatles), Shane MacGowan (of The Pogues), Bobby Elliott and Tony Hicks (both of The Hollies), Hollie Cook (from The Slits), LIPA Gospel Choir, Clay Crosse, Alan Hansen, Peter Reid, comedian John Bishop, writer Neil Fitzmaurice and footballer Kenny Dalglish. Musicians were Chris Sharrock (of Beady Eye) on drums, David Catlin-Birch (of World Party) on bass, Paul McCartney on lead guitar, Mick Jones (of The Clash) on electric guitar, Andrew \\"Davo\\" Davitt on acoustic guitar, Guy Chambers on piano, Will Pound on harmonica, Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra on strings, Richard Blake on trumpet/flugelhorn, Matthew Lewis on trombone/euphonium, Meredith Moore on French horn and Will Roberts on tuba. Guy Chambers was producer, Richard Flack producer and engineer and Oliver Som, Liam Nolan, Chris Taylor, Jon Withnall, Tony Draper and Alec Brits as engineer. The Peace Collective In October 2014, many members of The Justice Collective reconvened as The Peace Collective, a fund-raising recording of The Farm's 1990 hit \\"All Together Now\\" in aid of The British Red Cross and the Shorncliffe Trust. The new track features a backing choir of schoolboy footballers from the Premier League and German Bundesliga plus a number of music acts including Clean Bandit, Engelbert Humperdinck, The Proclaimers, Gorgon City, Suzi Quatro, Jona Lewie, Alexandra Burke, Julian Lennon, Paul Potts, Jane McDonald, David Gray, Gabrielle, Mick Jones, Tommy Scott, Holly Johnson, and many more.

It is based on the novel with the same name written by Leonardo Sciascia. It premiered at the 1991 Venice International Film Festival, in which it entered the main competition. The film was awarded with a Nastro d'Argento for best screenplay, two Globi d'oro for best film and best screenplay and a Grolla d'oro for best actor to the ensamble cast.  Plot  The Sciascia story unfolds with the arrival in Sicily of a medicine rep from Verona. He is unaware that he witnessed a double murder at a rural railway station until he hears about the event on his car radio. He calls on the local police station to help with the enquiries. The police have discovered the body of a retired ambassador, returned after years of absence, in his remote farmhouse, after he had called them about the discovery of an item (a stolen painting) rolled up in the attic. The police did not call that night, since the duty Inspector thought it might be a hoax (he knew the farm house to be abandoned). The following day the strange appearance of the retired ambassador's body, which appears to have been a suicide, raises suspicion that he may have been murdered. This is the investigating policeman's opinion but it is rejected by the Police Commissioner, who insists on a simple and uncomplicated suicide. There is a suggestion that the Carabinieri who have also turned up at the crime scene are aware of the alternative theory. Meanwhile, interrogation of the medicine rep from Verona clarifies that he had not seen the railway staff, but rather their murderers rolling up a \\"carpet\\" (actually the painting) in the station. The investigation proceeds with an old friend of the \\"suicide,\\" a professor Franzo who reveals more about the telephone conversations they had exchanged before the ambassador's death. It looks to the police as though the farm buildings had been used for criminal activity for some time. The inspector, however, appears to be overly familiar with the inside of the main house and real doubts enter the Brigadiere's mind as to his real involvement in the crime. The judge insists unreasonably that the police Commissioner and Carabinieri should give him cast iron evidence if he is to proceed with any case, as in his view all he heard were conjectures. The estranged widow and son of the ambassador arrive and the extent of the family rift is evident. They appear to have relied on the local parish priest Don Cricco to oversee the mainly abandoned family properties in the area. The film ends with an accident in which the Inspector and Brigadiere exchange pistol shots, killing the Inspector. The police call it an accident.

Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties. The non-partisan special primary was held Tuesday, June 3, 2008. San Diego City Council member Donna Frye and former San Diego police chief Jerry Sanders received the most votes and advanced to the November special general election. Sanders was elected mayor with a majority of the votes in November. Dick Murphy resignation On April 25, 2005, Dick Murphy announced that he would resign as mayor of San Diego, effective July 15, 2005. Murphy had only recently been reelected as mayor in the highly contested 2004 mayoral election. Murphy's resignation occurred during investigations by the SEC and the FBI into the San Diego pension scandal. The city held a special election to fill the vacancy at mayor. Following Murphy's resignation, Michael Zucchet served as acting mayor for three days before he too resigned due to a corruption conviction that was later overturned. Council member Toni Atkins then served as acting mayor until the mayoral election was complete.

Former police chief Jerry Sanders ran on a platform of executive experience, having successfully turn around the financial situations of the local chapters of the Red Cross and United Way since retiring as police chief. Steve Francis, founder and chairman of AMN Healthcare Services emphasized downsizing city government and implementing business principles. Francis outspent his rivals in the campaign, putting nearly $2 million of his own money into his campaign. Lawyer Pat Shea ran on a platform that San Diego should declare bankruptcy to deal with the pension scandal, a position that the other front runners disagreed with. Frye won the plurality of votes in the July primary and advanced to the general election along with runner-up Sanders.

Miles specialised first in British Victorian art and later toured the former Soviet Union buying Socialist Realist art that he sold for a huge markup. In the 1970s and 80s he was able to capitalise on the rising status of London as an art centre and his innate entrepreneurial skills and flair for self-publicity.

She was also a sk√°ldkona (poetess), and the only woman listed in Sk√°ldatal.  Family  Steinv√∂r's parents were Sighvatr Sturluson, leader of the Sturlungs, and Halld√≥ra, daughter of Tumi Kolbeinsson, headman of the √Åsbirningar family clan. Tumi's successor, Kolbeinn Tumason, was her uncle, and his successor, Kolbeinn ungi Arn√≥rsson, was a cousin. Steinv√∂r considered herself a Sturlung. She had two sisters and seven brothers; among them Sturla Sighvatsson and √û√≥r√∞r kakali.  Life  In 1230 Steinv√∂r married H√°lfdan S√¶mundsson, the son of S√¶mundr J√≥nsson, go√∞i at Oddi. The couple settled on the estate Keldur in Rang√°rvellir. H√°lfdan was, according to the Sturlunga Saga, a peaceful man who preferred the calm of his own farm to getting involved in contemporary politics. Steinv√∂r, who supported the Sturlungs, seems to have put up with this ‚Äì at least as long as her own dynasty prospered. But in 1238 the Sturlungs suffered a crushing defeat in the battle of √ñrlygssta√∞ir, where Steinv√∂r's father and four brothers were killed. When her brother √û√≥r√∞r kakali returned four years later from Norway to take revenge and restore the lost power of the Sturlungs, he first sought refuge with his sister at Keldur. According to √û√≥r√∞ar saga kakala he reckoned that Steinv√∂r \\"who was a very powerful woman, certainly would prompt her husband to act\\".√û√≥r√∞ar saga kakala So she did. She even threatened to hand over the fatab√∫r (storeroom) keys (i.e. the symbol of a married woman) to him and take up arms herself if he did not help her brother. The peaceful H√°lfdan relented, but was still cautious and refused as long as possible to take open position in the conflict. Steinv√∂r was highly respected by her contemporaries and had a greater influence than most women in her days. This was clearly shown in the conflict between √û√≥r√∞r kakali and the peasants of Southern Region in the autumn of 1242. Open assault at arms was averted when Steinv√∂r and bishop Sigvar√∞r √û√©ttmarsson were chosen as mediators. The peasants agreed to a reconciliation provided that these two stipulated the conditions. But if also the mediators disagreed Steinv√∂r alone would decide. Thus, the peasants had a greater trust in her than in their bishop. At √û√≥r√∞r kakali's death in 1256 Steinv√∂r was sole heir. She then gave the estate Grund to her son-in-law √ûorvar√∞r √û√≥rarinsson of the Sv√≠nfellingar family clan, and set him to take charge of √û√≥r√∞'s go√∞or√∞ in Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur. This led to a conflict between him and √ûorgils skar√∞i (a Sturlung), who also claimed power in the district. As a result, √ûorvar√∞r treacherously ambushed and killed √ûorgils on the night of January 22, 1258. For this outrage, however, he lost all reputation in the district and was soon driven away from Eyjafj√∂r√∞ur.√ûorgils saga skar√∞a ¬¥ Steinv√∂r and H√°lfdan had three sons: Loft, who became knight (riddari) at Grund, Sighvatr who became knight at Keldur, and Sturla.  Poetry  Steinv√∂r was the only woman whose name is included in the Sk√°ldatal catalogue of court poets. She is said to have sung the praises of a chieftain called Gautr on Melr (died 1270), who was an ally of the Sturlungs. But nothing of this poem (a dr√°pa?) has survived. In √çslendinga saga is a collection of versified dreams and portents said to have occurred shortly before the battle of √ñrlygssta√∞ir. One of these stanzas, written in a kind of t√∂glag, is attributed to Steinv√∂r. She is there said to have dreamed that she found a severed human head on a field and that a dream figure asked her why the head was there. If this short poem is authentic, it is the only verse that remains of Steinv√∂r's poetry.  Notes   Sources  Most of what is known about Steinv√∂r Sighvatsd√≥ttir is told in √çslendinga saga, √û√≥r√∞ar saga kakala and √ûorgils saga skar√∞a, all of which are included in the Sturlunga Saga.

Technology entrepreneurship Denninger was the founder and CEO of MCSNet in Chicago. Opened as Macro Computer Solutions, Incorporated in 1987, it expanded its service offerings in 1993 to become one of the area's first commercial internet service providers. Among its customers was the Chicago Public Library, which relied on MCSNet for both internet access and web hosting. In 1997 he led a coalition of ISPs in setting up the Enhanced Domain Name System, a short-lived alternative DNS root which allowed registrants to add their own generic top-level domains. Denninger continued to run MCSNet until August 1998, when he sold it to Winstar Communications for an undisclosed amount. For his efforts, the Chicago Sun-Times dubbed him one of \\"the movers and shakers who brought Chicago into the Internet Age\\". After the sale of MCSNet, he moved to Florida, where he began to devote more time to stock trading and political activism. Blogging and political activism Denninger is a founding contributor to the libertarian-oriented finance blog market-ticker.org, and has used the internet to bring attention to his concerns with the financial system. He now utilizes his blog to sell his home networking daemon and sell the artwork of his highly independent daughter. In the aftermath of the March 2008 collapse of Bear Stearns, he helped found the website FedUpUSA.org He came to national attention for the criticisms of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which he posted on FedUpUSA.org in September that year. Of special concern to Denninger was the over-the-counter trading of credit default swaps, as well as the high leverage of financial institutions; his objections to the bailout plan stemmed from the fact that it did not address either of these issues. He has also spoken out against high-frequency trading, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 Flash Crash. Denninger was also one of the early members of the Tea Party movement, sometimes referred to as a founder. On January 20, 2009, the day of President Obama's first inauguration, he published a blog post calling on readers to mail tea bags to the White House and Congress on February 1, echoing a suggestion by a commenter on one of his earlier blog posts. However, Denninger later expressed concern with the Tea Party movement, stating in an October 20, 2010 blog post that Republicans had hijacked the movement and perverted its original goals to the standard Republican concerns of \\"guns, gays and God\\". Media appearances Denninger has been invited as a guest on a variety of television and radio programs. In July 2009, he appeared on CNBC Reports. In April 2010, he appeared on the Glenn Beck show, where he spoke about the FedUpUSA.org website. In October 2011, he appeared on The Dylan Ratigan Show on MSNBC to voice his support for the Occupy Wall Street movement. In January 2013, he spoke with Voice of Russia in an interview covering a variety of topics, including the United States public debt, Medicare reform, and his opposition to Keynesian economics.

Biography Robert Constable, born about 1522, was the second son of Sir Robert Constable,Bindoff and Horrox state that John Sothill was a knight (; ). of Everingham.. and his wife Katherine, daughter of George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros of Helmsley Castle, and Anne, only daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas St. Leger.; . Constable's elder brother Marmaduke who was about thirty-eight years of age, succeeded to the family property in 1558 when their father died. Marmaduke died on 13 May 1560. As a younger son, Constable had to largely make his own way. His marriage to Christiana Dabridgecourt may have occasioned his decision to settle in Newark-on-Trent, where her first husband, Anthony Forster, had been an alderman. Constable later acquired from the Hospital of St. Leonard the lease of a property known as the Spittal on the northern outskirts of Newark. According to Hasler it is almost certain that he was the Robert Constable, gentleman pensioner, who towards the end of the reign of Queen Mary, as a reward for his service, was made constable of Queenborough Castle.. It is also almost certain that he was the Sir Robert Constable listed by Segar as one of the 'lords and gentlemen' who had participated in Queen Elizabeth's Accession Day tournaments.. Constable served under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, in the campaign after the Northern Rebellion of 1569. He was knighted by Sussex at Berwick on 11 May 1570, together with William Drury, Thomas Manners, and George Carey, who were captains in the army sent into Scotland on the following day to assist the Earl of Lennox in the Marian civil war at Glasgow.Boyd, William, ed., Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.3 (1903), pp.170‚Äì174 Constable received leases of lands 'for his service to the Queen in the wars', and 'for his service during the late rebellion in the north', and later composed a treatise on the 'Ordering of a Camp'. In 1575 he was appointed Marshal of Berwick. On 2 February 1576 he wrote to his kinsman, Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland, son and heir of his first cousin, Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, complaining that he had not received any imprest money, and requesting the Earl to pass on his thanks to Sir Francis Walsingham, for 'I have not found so great a friend as he. I know that I have this friendship for your sake, for I was a mere stranger to him'.. Constable was soon requesting to be relieved of the position. On 25 May 1576 he wrote to the Earl that he had been 'in very good hope that I should have been discharged of this office, but I am now stayed'. He complained that 'No one ever lived here at so great a charge as I do', and that the garrison had been unpaid since Michaelmas.. In 1577 he was still at Berwick, from which he wrote on 25 March that he had been 'very sick'.. In about September 1577 he wrote to the Earl that 'Riding about the Queen's works here my horse has fallen upon me and bruised me so much that I am not able to stir out of my bed. . . The fall was so great that my sword was broken into three pieces'. He complained that he could 'get no help of physic', and although he hoped to escape danger from the injury, 'it will be very hard in consideration of my old years'.. He was finally allowed to resign in August 1578. Lord Burghley commented that Constable had been 'beggared' as a result of his time spent at Berwick.. According to Hasler, Constable now lived \\"as a country gentleman\\" on his properties in Nottinghamshire. Nevertheless, in May 1585 he was in London. In a letter dated 18 May 1585 to the Earl of Rutland he described a recent event at Greenwich:. > I have been before her Majesty with my people at Greenwich, where Mr > Treasurer and I did show it in such sort that it was to her Majesty's > contentment, and well liking of all the whole people, and such a skirmish > maintained as the like hath not been at any time, for it never ceased until > her Majesty gave commandment it should cease. And after the skirmish she did > cause that we should pause awhile for the cooling of their pieces, and so to > begin, which latter skirmish exceeded that the French ambassador and all the > counsellors did greatly commend it .... And so every captain went with his > company, [and] marched home to London that night. Constable reported further that the Queen had sent Sir Walter Raleigh to him with her thanks, and that later she had let him kiss her hand, saying that she had 'taken such order for me as I should not mislike of'.. It may have been as a result of this performance that Constable was appointed Lieutenant-General of the OrdnanceSullivan states that he was Master of the Ordinance . at some time before 4 August 1588.. In 1587 Constable was a principal mourner at the Earl of Rutland's funeral.. The precise date of Constable's own death is unknown. He was buried in Holy Trinity Minories on 12 November 1591.. Family Constable married, before 1562, Christiana Dabridgecourt, widow of Anthony Forster, and daughter of John Dabridgecourt of Langdon Hall, Warwickshire. Their only child was the poet, Henry Constable..

Kirchbach attended private school in Auerbach and the higher secondary school of Bezzenberger and Opelt in Dresden. He joined the army on 1 April 1863, at the age of 14 years, spending 3 years as a cadet in the Royal Saxon Artillery School in Dresden. In May 1866, Kirchbach was assigned to the 19th (2nd Royal Saxon) Foot Artillery and with this regiment took park in the Austro-Prussian War. He was promoted in July 1866 to the rank of second lieutenant and in August joined the 12th (1st Royal Saxon) Field Artillery. He served with this regiment in the Franco-Prussian War and won the Iron Cross (1870). In 1872, he was promoted to first lieutenant and captain in 1877. Between 1878 and 1881 he served as a regimental and brigade adjutant and as adjutant to the King Albert of Saxony. In 1881, he was appointed battery commander in the 19th (2nd Royal Saxon) Foot Artillery Regiment. He served from 1884 to 1889 as an instructor at the Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin, gaining promotion to major in 1887.

In 1907 he was appointed General der Artillerie and commanding general of the XIX (2nd Royal Saxon) Corps. Thus, he held one of the three highest positions in the Saxon army during peacetime. Kirchbach received this post even though he had not previously held a general staff position. King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony appointed him in 1912 \\"√† la suite\\" of the 32nd (3rd Royal Saxon) Field Artillery Regiment. After nearly six years as corps commander, Kirchbach retired at the end of November 1913. World War I Within months of retirement, the First World War broke out.

Now based in Manchester, the band consists of lead vocalist, producer, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Matthew Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer/producer George Daniel. The band's origins trace to their attendance at high school and playing together as teenagers. Gigs organised by a council worker led the band to formally sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles \\"Sex\\", \\"Chocolate\\", and \\"Robbers\\" and reached number one in the United Kingdom. Their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016), reached No. 1 in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the touring cycle for the record, the band announced their third album under the working title of Music for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017. Returning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth studio albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim, and became their third No. 1 album in the UK. The second, Notes on a Conditional Form, was released in May 2020 and became their fourth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK. The 1975 has garnered acclaim for their exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B;, funk rock, electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage, 2-step and ambient), and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel. Frontman Matty Healy's energetic and eccentric stage presence has also garnered acclaim, as has his lyricism due to its deeply personal, self-aware, self-deprecating, and often observational nature; his lyrical analyses of politics, society and culture have been praised, notable in songs such as \\"Love It If We Made It\\", \\"Loving Someone\\", \\"Sincerity Is Scary\\", and \\"People\\". History 2002‚Äì2012: Formation Matthew Timothy Healy, the son of actors Denise Welch and Tim Healy, grew up in Newcastle and Cheshire. He met Ross MacDonald, Adam Hann and George Daniel at Wilmslow High School in Wilmslow in 2002; as teenagers they played together. The band formed when the local council worker organised numerous gigs for teens. Matty Healy found Hann who \\"came up to [him] and said he wanted to play one of these shows.\\" The band began playing covers until they \\"eventually wrote a song\\", according to Healy. \\"We started from then and we've been making music together since we were about 15.\\" After Hann invited the members to form a band, they passed their early days covering punk songs in a local club. Healy was originally the drummer but took over vocals after the previous singer left to start another band. George Daniel was recruited as the new drummer to complete the final line-up. Bassist Ross MacDonald performing in Buenos Aires in 2017 The band formerly performed under the names Me and You Versus Them, Forever Drawing Six, Talkhouse, the Slowdown, Bigsleep, and Drive Like I Do, before settling on \\"the 1975\\". Healy recounts that the name was inspired by deranged and \\"mental\\" scribblings found on the backpage of the book On The Road by Jack Kerouac that were dated to \\"1 June, The 1975\\". This would become a prominent day of the band. 2012‚Äì2014: Early career and self-titled debut album The band's self-titled debut album was recorded with Arctic Monkeys collaborator Mike Crossey. Between Autumn 2012 and Spring 2013, during which time the album was recorded, the band released four EPs. They toured to support and build momentum for the album, including numerous gigs and special appearances with other artists. The album received positive reviews from critics, and topped the UK Albums Chart on 8 September. As of March 2016, it had sold 410,981 copies in the UK, and 390,000 copies in the US. The release of the band's first EP, titled Facedown, in August 2012 saw the band's first UK airplay on national radio with lead track \\"The City\\", which was also featured as part of a BBC Introducing show with Huw Stephens on BBC Radio 1. The 1975 once again garnered national radio attention in late 2012, with BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe championing their single \\"Sex\\" from the eponymous EP, which was released on 19 November. They embarked on a United Kingdom and Ireland tour extended into early 2013, before beginning a US tour in Spring 2014. Upon the release of Music for Cars on 4 March 2013, the 1975 found mainstream chart success with \\"Chocolate\\", reaching number 19 in the UK Singles Chart. On 20 May 2013 the band released IV, which included a new version of \\"The City\\". The track charted in UK and received airplay in several other countries. The 1975 toured extensively to support releases and to build hype before releasing their debut. The band supported Muse on the second leg of The 2nd Law World Tour at the Emirates Stadium in London on 26 May 2013. They also toured with the Neighbourhood in the United States in June 2013, and supported the Rolling Stones in Hyde Park on 13 July. In August, the band performed on the Festival Republic Stage at 2013 Reading and Leeds Festivals. In a feature article, Elliot Mitchell of When the Gramophone Rings wrote that releasing a string of EPs before the debut album was \\"a move that he deemed necessary to provide context to the band's broad sound, rather than just building up with singles alone.\\" Matthew Healy said, \\"We wouldn't have been able to release the album without putting out the EP's first, as we wanted to make sure we could express ourselves properly before dropping this long, ambitious debut record on people.\\" Dublin Tour 2016 Their self-titled debut, The 1975, was released on 2 September 2013, co-produced by Mike Crossey, known for his work with Arctic Monkeys and Foals. The 1975 were selling out shows even before the debut of their full length as Healy recalls in an interview with Larry Heath of The AU Review. The lead single is a re-worked \\"Sex\\", which was released on 26 August 2013. The song premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 July 2013, and a music video premiered on YouTube on 26 July. The 1975 debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Matthew Healy at Southside Festival 2014 The 1975 toured in the UK in September 2013, among others performing in Kingston upon Hull as headliners at Freedom Festival, a celebration of the city's shortlisting for 2017 UK City of Culture designation, and at iTunes Festival on 8 September as an opening act for indie electronic quartet Bastille. The band undertook a North American tour in October, a European for November, and in January 2014 the band performed in New Zealand and Australia. In September 2013, the band performed three sold- out shows at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire. In April 2014, the band performed for the first time in a major American music and arts festival: Coachella.\\"Stereogum review\\" Chris DeVille, 'Coachella 2014: The 7 Best Things From Sunday', Stereogum.com, 14 April 2014 The band played at Royal Albert Hall the same month. In May, the band's recorded output was distributed digitally while they were touring North America. Healy noted that the band had recording scheduled in Q2 2015. 2015‚Äì2017: I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It On 1 June 2015, the band's social accounts were terminated, which caused intense speculation. A comic strip was posted on Healy's Twitter a day prior but is now on their manager, Jamie Oborne's account, which suggested the band's break-up. The next day, the accounts were reinstated, but the cover images and profile photos were white and light pink, instead of the usual black and white, revealing it to be a publicity stunt. During the Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim 2016 On 8 October, the band announced their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. They premiered the lead single, \\"Love Me\\", simultaneously scheduling a support tour in Europe, North America, and Asia. They premiered the second single, \\"UGH!\\", on 10 December on Beats 1. The album's third single, \\"The Sound\\" debuted on BBC Radio 1 on 14 January 2016. The 1975 released the fourth single \\"Somebody Else\\" on 15 February on Beats 1 before the album's release. \\"A Change of Heart\\" premiered on Radio 1 on 22 February, four days prior to the album's release. NME, who had previously been highly critical of the band, praised the album for its scope and ambition, writing that \\"Any record that burrows as deep into your psyche as ‚ÄòI Like It‚Ä¶' should be considered essential. It's hugely clever and wryly funny, too.\\" They later named it their Album of the Year for 2016. Although music journalist Alexis Petridis noted that parts of the album were over- ambitious, he went on to claim that \\"incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That's sometimes because his observations are sharp ‚Äì as a skewering of celebrity squad culture, 'you look famous, let's be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like' is pretty acute ‚Äì but more usually because they come loaded with witty self- awareness and deprecation: the endless depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself.\\" In a more mixed review, Rolling Stone criticised tracks like 'Lostmyhead' and 'Please Be Naked' for being 'boring-melty' but praised songs such as 'Somebody Else', 'Loving Someone' and 'Love Me'. The album was released on 26 February and topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. The band released a free download of \\"How to Draw\\" on Twitter and through Target Exclusive. It was shortlisted for the 2016 Mercury Music Prize and nominated for Album of the Year at the 2017 Brit Awards.  2017‚Äì2019: A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships  On November 2016, member George Daniel teased the band's third album by releasing a video on his Instagram account captioned \\"2018\\", containing snippets of audio along with Healy playing the keyboards. On 3 April 2017, Healy tweeted \\"I like it when you sleep is coming to an end\\" (sic) before following up with \\"Music for Cars\\", which shares the name of their third extended play. In March 2017, the band confirmed that two songs for the new album have already been written. In June, Healy also confirmed that Drive Like I Do, one of the 1975's prior incarnations, will release a debut album as a side project 'in a few years'. In November, Healy teased the release of an EP within 2017. Besides being confirmed, the EP was delayed to 2018, with manager Jamie Oborne stating that \\"something\\" would be released instead; this was the band's debut live album, DH00278. He also confirmed that no singles from Music for Cars will be released in 2017, with the band confirming that something will be released on 1 June 2018. In March 2018, the band deleted many media posts across their accounts going back to July 2017, during their final show at Latitude Festival for I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. On 22 April 2018, in response to a fan comment on Twitter, Oborne stated that their second album's campaign would remain for \\"a few more days\\". At the end of April, cryptic posters titled \\"Music for Cars\\" appeared in London and Manchester, containing taglines and a Dirty Hit catalogue number, DH00327, amongst a black background. Various billboards were also spotted in the United Kingdom, having used d√©tournement to apply themselves over existing advertisements. The band updated their website to display a timer counting down towards 1 June at the beginning of May 2018, becoming active again on social media. Within its first hours, it was revealed to contain a hidden zip file with four individual posters, each of the names leading to a hidden page on the website that displayed a conversation between a 'human' and a 'machine'. Over social media, the band frequently released different posters, all titled \\"A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships\\". On 31 May 2018, the band released the single \\"Give Yourself a Try\\", after premiering as Annie Mac's \\"Hottest Record in the World\\" on BBC Radio 1 that same day. The album garnered almost universal praise from critics. According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has received a weighted score of 83 based on 29 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork gave the album a score of 8.5, earning it the Best New Music tag, and called it \\"outrageous and eclectic\\", as well as \\"similar to its predecessor in its boundless sense of style, swerving from Afrobeats to brushed-snare jazz balladry to one track that sounds like a trap remix of a Bon Iver ayahuasca trip\\", but \\"more purposeful\\" than I Like It When You Sleep. Time considered it one of the Best Albums of 2018, placing it at number nine on their list. However, Conrad Duncan writing for the same site gave the album a positive review, calling it \\"full of genuine heart, intelligence and wit\\". Popmatters criticized the album as bloated and inconsistent, stating \\"The band's reach exceeds their grasp here, and vocalist/band leader Matt Healy's indulgences are often more tiresome than charming\\", while still praising it as \\"fascinating\\". Healy, in an interview for Beats 1, stated that \\"Music for Cars\\" is more of an era to release music, after renaming Music for Cars to A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. It was released on 30 November 2018. The band headlined both Radio 1's Big Weekend in Stewart Park, Middlesbrough on 26 May 2019 and Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2019. The album was shortlisted for the 2019 Mercury Music Prize and won the award for British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards.  2019‚Äìpresent: Notes on a Conditional Form  On 24 July 2019, the opening song of Notes on a Conditional Form, titled \\"The 1975\\", was released, featuring climate activist Greta Thunberg. The lead single, entitled \\"People\\" released on 22 August 2019. This was announced by a countdown on the band's social media accounts, including small snippets of lyrics from the song that fans could piece together. A second single, titled \\"Frail State of Mind\\", was released on 24 October. The music video for the song was released on 30 November 2019. The next single, \\"Me & You Together Song\\", was released on 16 January 2020. On 17 February 2020, the band put up a \\"digital detox\\" website called MindShowerAI which contained a countdown to their next single as well as several odd messages like ‚ÄúI am doing my mind and my life!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI feel comfort and respect.\\" A fourth single, ‚ÄòThe Birthday Party‚Äô, was released on 19 February 2020 at the end of the website's countdown. On 3 April, the band released \\"Jesus Christ 2005 God Bless America\\", featuring guest vocals from Phoebe Bridgers, which was followed by \\"If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)\\" on 23 April 2020. The band's fourth album, Notes on a Conditional Form, was released on 22 May 2020. It became the band's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart as well as reaching number one in Australia and number four in the United States. Musical style The 1975 has been classified as a pop rock band. Scott Kerr of AllMusic wrote that the band combined \\"the dark and youthful themes of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music.\\" Healy specifically cites Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Michael Jackson as musical influences; he states that his greatest influence is the oeuvre of filmmaker John Hughes. For their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It, Healy cited D'Angelo, Roberta Flack, Boards of Canada, and Sigur R√≥s as inspirations, saying that they're \\"a post-modern pop band that references a million things. I don't even know what my band is half the time.\\" Their \\"melancholic\\" black and white visual aesthetic is juxtaposed with major keys and what the band calls \\"classic pop sensibilities.\\" Critics at Pitchfork have favourably compared them to the Big Pink. Sex EP was described by Paste as \\"equal parts ethereal and synth pop\\", with \\"haunting\\" and \\"smooth\\" vocals. Their \\"mellow\\", stripped down style was praised for its lack of \\"attention- grabbing production theatrics.\\" The 1975 has been described as electropop, funk rock, indie pop, indie rock, pop, pop rock and rock. I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It has been described as indie rock and pop. Healy has stated that their influence is \\"heavily rooted\\" in Black American music in many interviews. Public reaction to the band's music has been mixed, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter, \\"perhaps the last public space for unfettered music criticism in an increasingly anti-critical landscape\\", according to Vice magazine's Larry Fitzmaurice in 2016. In an essay on the critical response, he said they have been \\"the Most Hated and Loved Band in the World\\" and described \\"as underrated and overhyped, although the needle has far more often swung towards the former direction\\". In Fitzmaurice's opinion, the band's debut album was mainly a straightforward rock album recorded \\"with a soft-focus and especially British sensibility\\", while I Like It When You Sleep was only rock music in the loosest sense of the word. Overall, he said their music is pop \\"in the realm of Alternative\\", most comparable to INXS.

Its final position is one of the most famous in the history of the game. It was one of the earliest games in master chess to employ the Sicilian Defence and was instrumental in popularising the defence.  Overview  Alexander McDonnell from Ireland was a wealthy merchant who was regarded as one of the leading chess players of the time. Louis-Charles Mah√© de La Bourdonnais from France was regarded as the unofficial World Chess Champion. The two played a series of six matches in London over the summer of 1834. Of these matches, La Bourdonnais won the first, third, fourth and fifth, McDonnell the second, while the sixth was abandoned with McDonnell leading. In all they played 85 games, of which La Bourdonnais won 45, McDonnell 27, and 13 were draws. This game was the 62nd of the series. In the game, La Bourdonnais set up a powerful mobile pawn centre very much in the spirit of his predecessor Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor, who once remarked that pawns were \\"the soul of chess\\". He then made an exchange sacrifice at 23.Bxf8?! fxe4! to set these pawns in motion, leading to a series of complicated tactical threats involving the promotion of the pawns that ultimately overwhelms his opponent. Garry Kasparov observed that this remarkable game remains forever the \\"French master's visiting card\\". Annotated game White: McDonnell Black: La Bourdonnais Opening: Sicilian Defence, Kalashnikov Variation (ECO B32) [Comments in quotation marks are Howard Staunton's original comments in the Chess Player's Chronicle.] 1\\\\. e4 c5 :These are the opening moves of the Sicilian Defence, a counterattacking opening in which players typically attack on opposite sides of the board. This game was one of the earliest in master chess to use the opening, helping to establish its popularity. 2\\\\. Nf3 Nc6 :The knights contend for control of the strategically important d4-square. 3\\\\. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 :A mutually advantageous and time-honoured exchange. White gets a advantage, while Black keeps both centre pawns and gets a half-open c- to attack on. 4... e5 :Kasparov gives this move, which 150 years later became the starting point for the Kalashnikov Variation (albeit with a rather different plan than La Bourdonnais could possibly have entertained when he played it here), an exclamation mark for the accelerated tempo. The trouble with the move is that it creates a backward d-pawn while Black also loses control of the d5-square Black would normally have exercised with the less ambitious 4...e6. 5\\\\. Nxc6 (see diagram) :\\"This is not so good as retiring the Knight.\\" (Staunton) :Kasparov remarks that today every schoolchild knows that 5.Nb5 is the right move here. Playing 5.Nxc6 allows Black to regain control of the d5-square when Black retakes the knight with a pawn. Nevertheless Kasparov reminds us that in those days chess masters aimed for rapid development and an attack, without paying too much attention to positional nuances such as a weak d5-square. 5... bxc6 :Not 5...dxc6 because this would mean Black giving up a centre pawn as well as leaving Black open to an exchange of queens that would prevent him from castling. 6\\\\. Bc4 Nf6 7. Bg5?! :Planning to exchange the bishop and knight. Kasparov prefers 7.0-0! 7... Be7 :Developing the bishop as well as unpinning Black's f6-knight and ensuring that after an exchange on f6 White's bishop can be retaken with the e7-bishop and not with the g7-pawn, which would weaken Black's defensive pawn structure. 8\\\\. Qe2?! (see diagram) :Allowing Black to advance 8...d5 the next move (the d5-square is now only attacked twice by White whereas it is defended three times by Black), a considerable strategic goal for Black in the Sicilian defence. That the queen is bringing pressure to bear on e5 is unlikely to be relevant until White is safely castled. Burgess, Nunn and Emms prefer either 8.Nc3 or 8.Bxf6 followed by 9.Nc3. 8... d5 9. Bxf6? :Kasparov calls 9.Bxf6? a serious error, pointless and anti-positional. 9... Bxf6 10. Bb3 0-0 11. 0-0 a5 :11...a5 carries a double threat. First, it threatens 12...a4, trapping the white bishop; second, it brings the a6-square under rook protection, allowing 12...Ba6 pinning the white queen against the rook with a potential exchange advantage. White responds by making concessions in the centre. 12\\\\. exd5 cxd5 13. Rd1 d4 14. c4?! (see diagram) :\\"Queen's Bishop's Pawn one square [i.e. 14.c3] would have been better play.\\" (Staunton) :McDonnell decides on a pawn race, but his passed c-pawn is not likely to be as strong as La Bourdonnais' supported passed d-pawn. Kasparov considers this the decisive mistake. White should instead his knight with 14.Nd2. 14... Qb6 15. Bc2 Bb7 :\\"It is pretty obvious that Black would have lost his Queen if he had taken the Queen's Knight's Pawn [i.e. 15...Qxb2??].\\" (Staunton) :15...Bb7 supports e4. 15...Qxb2?? loses the queen to 16.Bxh7+. 16\\\\. Nd2 Rae8! (see diagram) :A frequent dilemma in chess play is which rook to choose to cover a particular file. In this case La Bourdonnais made the good decision to use his a-file rook to cover the e-file, leaving his f-file rook in place, thus supporting the pawns that in turn support his passed d-pawn. :Although 16...Qxb2 is no longer a direct blunder, White can win the e-pawn back with the threats 17.Qd3 followed by 18.Rab1 if this is not followed directly by 17...e4, leading to a probable draw, or elect for some sharp play with the Greek gift sacrifice 17.Bxh7+!? Kxh7 18.Rab1. 17\\\\. Ne4 Bd8 :Black's threat is 18...f5!, starting the centre pawn surge. White must react quickly. 18\\\\. c5 Qc6 :White pushes his pawn forward, threatening the queen. Black still can't play 18...Qxb2? as this loses the queen, if less expensively, to 19. Nf6+ gxf6 20. Bxh7+. 19\\\\. f3 :White plans to defend the e5-square with 20.Nd6. But White must first prevent the immediate 19...Qxg2# were White to play this now. 19... Be7 :Black neutralises the Nd6 threat and prepares for play. 20\\\\. Rac1 f5! (see diagram) :Kasparov calls this the beginning of the end. Burgess, Nunn and Emms remark that Black wastes no time preparing a defence against a White queenside attack. Nevertheless, Black can't play 20...Bxc5?? due to 21.Nxc5 and the same Bxh7+ motif as before. 21\\\\. Qc4+ Kh8! :The best defence. 21...Qd5? leads to an exchange of queens and a loss of Black's initiative after responses such as 22.Bb3 or 22.Qb5, while 21...Rf7? 22.Ba4 leads to Black losing the exchange without the compensation of an attack. 22\\\\. Ba4 Qh6 :\\"Black's play from this point to the end of the game is well deserving attention.\\" (Staunton) :White's bishop pinned the queen against the rook, threatening to win the exchange. Black is unfazed. 23\\\\. Bxe8?! :Kasparov says that 23.Nd6! was the last chance White had for sharper play. Burgess, Nunn and Emms agree, and observe that Black must play extremely precisely to maintain the advantage. Kasparov gives 23.Nd6! Bxd6 24.cxd6 Rc8 and Black wins. 23... fxe4! (see diagram) :Black unleashes a pawn \\"tsunami\\" that sweeps everything away before it. 24\\\\. c6 exf3! 25. Rc2 :\\"If White had ventured to take the Bishop [i.e. 25.cxb7??], he would have been mated by force in five or six moves.\\" (Staunton) :25.cxb7?? brings 25...Qe3+ forcing mate after 26.Kf1 (or Kh1) fxg2+ 27.Kxg2 when White is exposed to a rook and queen attack he cannot defend, e.g. 27...Rf2+ 28.Kg1 Rxb2+ (an example of a discovered check) 29.Kh1 Qf3+ 30.Kg1 Qg2#. On the other hand, 25.gxf3?? brings 25...Qe3+ 26.Kg2 (or Kh1) Qxf3+ 27.Kg1 Rf5 threatening ...Rg5# and similarly White can't escape. 25... Qe3+?! (see diagram) :La Bourdonnais won the game with this move, but it must be regarded as dubious given that 26.Rf2! limits Black to a draw. 26\\\\. Kh1?? :A final mistake. White retreats into the corner, but is now powerless in the face of either of the pawn advances to d3 or f2. Curiously, a much better defence is provided by the self-pin 26.Rf2! that David LeMoir has analysed. Black has the tactically strong response 26...fxg2, but this is neutralised by 27.Qe2 whereupon an exchange of queens gives White the stronger passed pawn. Black gets better play with 26...Bc8, but White should nevertheless hold him to a draw after 27.Bd7. 26... Bc8 27. Bd7 :Black was threatening either 27...Bf5 or 27...Bg4, both of which are fatal for White. 27.Bf7 (trying to block off the black rook instead) leads to lines like 27...Bg4 28.c7? fxg2+ that win for Black. Kasparov notes that computers suggest 27...d3 directly. 27... f2 (see diagram) 28. Rf1 :Black was threatening both 28...d3 and 28...Qe1+. As an example of the tactical play involved here, suppose White ignores these threats and makes an essentially pointless move such as 28.c7 in the pious hope of helping his pawn on to queen. Then Black responds 28...Qe1+. If White plays 29.Rxe1 then it is mate in two with 29...fxe1=Q+ 30.Qf1 Qxf1#. So White is forced to respond to the check by interposing with 29.Qf1, leading to mate again after 29...Qxd1 30.Qxd1 f1=Q+ 31.Qxf1 Rxf1#. 28... d3 29. Rc3 Bxd7 30. cxd7 e4 :28...d3 was threatening mate in 12 beginning ...dxc2. After 30...e4, the threat is ...Qe1 and mate in 13. Burgess, Nunn and Emms remark that there is not much White can do about it. For example, White can give his king a getaway square with 31.h3, but if he uses it, 31...Qe1 32.Kh2, he gets mated in a few moves beginning with 32...Bd6+. So White is obliged to reply 32.Rc1, after which 32...d2 33.Rd1 e3 gives Black a mate in 10. 31\\\\. Qc8 Bd8 :White tries a last-ditch attack, but Black just deflects it with his bishop. Black could also have played 31...Rd8!? 32.Rcc1 d2 33.Rcd1 Qe1. 32\\\\. Qc4 Qe1! 33. Rc1 d2 34. Qc5 Rg8 35. Rd1 e3 :After 35.Rd1, Black has a mate in 10. If White had played 35.Rfxe1 (or similarly 35.Rcxe1), Black can just clear the back rank: 35...dxe1=Q+ 36.Rxe1 fxe1=Q+ 37.Qg1 Qxg1+, winning. 36\\\\. Qc3 :This move allows what Burgess, Nunn and Emms call \\"a truly magical finish\\". '36... Qxd1! 37. Rxd1 e2 (see diagram) ' :Black has a forced mate in five (White can hold out a little longer with 38.h4), and White resigned. Kasparov notes it is enormously regrettable that both these outstanding players died soon after, while still relatively young. They are buried near one another in Kensal Green Cemetery, where amongst others they join Charles Babbage, the Victorian computer scientist whose difference engine was a forerunner of the modern chess engine that so enhances an appreciation of their remarkable game.

He also wrote histories of the early European-American settlement of the San Joaquin Valley. Early life Frank Forrest Latta was the son of Presbyterian minister Eli C. Latta and teacher Harmonia Campbell, born on September 18, 1892, in Stanislaus County, near Orestimba Creek. Latta lived most of his life in the San Joaquin Valley. His father and three older brothers had come to California from Arkansas during the California Gold Rush. His father and one brother remained in California, where they were joined by his mother. One brother returned to Arkansas, and the third wrote that he was returning to Arkansas with $8,000 in gold, but disappeared without a trace. As a young boy Latta worked on several ranches in the San Joaquin Valley. He became interested in the stories of the early pioneers. In 1906, at the age of 14, he began interviewing people and gathering research regarding early pioneer life and farming in California. Latta also spent much time researching the Miller & Lux farming corporation and its founders Henry Miller and Charles Lux. Frank F. Latta became a teacher. He taught drafting and carpentry at high schools in Gustine, Porterville, Shafter and Bakersfield, California from 1915 to 1945. In 1919, he married Jeanette Allen. They had four children together. Patterson Cemetery District; Obits listing; Latta, Jeanette, M 880818 p3 Historical avocation When not teaching, Latta was traveling in the San Joaquin Valley, interviewing European-American pioneers and Native Americans, gathering artifacts and articles, or writing at home. He published numerous articles in San Joaquin Valley newspapers during the 1920s and 1930s. Finding aid for Frank F. Latta Collection: Skyfarming, 1802-1982 (bulk 1860-1975); Biographical Note In the early 1920s, Latta began interviewing the Yokuts and settlers who were acquainted with them. Among these was Thomas Jefferson Mayfield, (\\"Uncle Jeff\\"), the youngest son of William Mayfield, a settler from Texas who had developed a place on the Kern River. Following the death of his mother, Uncle Jeff grew up in a Yokuts village. Latta wrote about his life, first as a series of newspaper articles, then as a book, Uncle Jeff's Story: A Tale of a San Joaquin Valley Pioneer and His Life with the Yokuts Indians (1929). Latta's first work to focus on Native Americans in the San Joaquin Valley was California Indian Folklore (1936). In it he described the culture of the many bands of the Yokuts. Also in 1936 Latta published El Camino Viejo √° Los Angeles. He described the route and history of El Camino Viejo, the old Spanish road and the settlements along it on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, from Los Angeles to what is now Oakland. Born near where that road crossed Orestimba Creek, Latta had traced the route on his trips through the valley; he had also taken photos of many of its features and landmarks. In 1938, Latta was honored with the presidency of the League of Western Writers. Latta helped found the Kern County Museum in Bakersfield in 1941. He worked both as a curator and as its director from 1945 until 1956. He also continued his research into the Yokuts, interviewing more than 200 elders and a number of settlers. From this information gathered for more than a half-century, Latta compiled and published the Handbook of Yokuts Indians (1949). The first edition was published in a limited issue of 500 copies, through the Kern County Museum. A revised and enlarged edition was published by Coyote Press in 1977. Also in 1949, Latta published his book Black Gold In The Joaquin, the story of the oil industry in the San Joaquin Valley. He explored Native American use of the oil, to the discoveries and the development of the extraction technology from the mid-19th century to 1900. In 1956 Latta moved to Santa Cruz, purchasing the Gazos Ranch in southern San Mateo County. This was formerly known as the Steele Ranch and was located south of Pescadero near Gazos Creek. He and his wife Jean intended to retire there. They wanted to develop the ranch as a historical museum to house his extensive collection of items and artifacts he had collected. He also intended to develop an 80-acre picnic and camping area, which would extend for a mile along the coast between Ano Nuevo Island and Pigeon Point. He expected to install a reconstruction of a California Indian village and a pioneer town. Half Moon Bay Memories & El Granada Observer, by June Morrall, 1957; Historical Museum at Pescadero After going through official county procedures, Latta thought he was ready to begin this larger project, but it was delayed in the late 1950s. He did establish the Rancho Gazos Historical Indian and Early Californian Museum.\\"Yokuts Indian Artifacts From The Collection of Frank F. Latta,\\" by Courtney Puffer, NewsBlaze, April 14, 2007  Later life  Late in his life, Latta published a series of books dealing with historic outlaws and other items. The Dalton Gang Days and the Saga of Rancho El Tejon were published in 1976.
