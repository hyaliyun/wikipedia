Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 1. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, pp. 257‚Äì258. Name Planina was attested in written sources in 1300 as Moun√ß in foro (and as Ren√ß miles de Albinus in 1321, czu der Alben in 1333, and pey der Albn in 1341). The Slovenian name of the settlement is derived from the common noun planina 'treeless mountain; mountain pasture', referring to the local geography and semantically corresponding to Middle High German albe in the medieval transcriptions of the name.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 309. History The Planina area was already settled in prehistoric times, along a trade route from ≈†mihel pod Nanosom to Vrhnika. The hill with ruins of Haasberg Castle has the remains of prehistoric and Roman-era fortifications, and graves dating to the Bronze Age and Roman era have been excavated on a hill slope closer to Unec. Medieval Planina developed around a castle belonging to the lords of Alben (). A toll house belonging to the Counts of Gorizia was attested in Planina in 1217. As a town, Planina was granted the right to a market day every Saturday and an annual fair on Saint Margaret's Day. The town was later under the control of the Haller and Eggenberg noble families. By the 17th century, Planina had developed into an important trade connection between Carniola and the Adriatic, with routes connecting it to Pivka, Cerknica, and Logatec. A major postal station was established in Planina in 1728, and a road to Trieste was laid through the town in 1830. In the early 19th century an amadou factory was established in Planina and it exported its products throughout Europe. A district court was established in Planina in 1867 (and transferred to Logatec in 1875). After the First World War, the Treaty of Rapallo split the town: the hamlet of Kaƒçja Vas, the source of the Unica River (at the mouth of Planina Cave), the Ravbar Tower of Little Castle, and Haasberg Castle lay on the Italian side of the border. During the Second World War, the Partisan Dolomite Detachment was active in the area. The Partisans destroyed an Italian outpost near Planina on 17 May 1943, and then burned Haasberg Castle on 27 March 1944, resulting in the loss of all the castle's furnishings.≈Ωor≈æ, Grega. 2012. \\"Alpski zid.\\" In: Kladnik, Drago (ed.) Slovenija VI, pp. 59‚Äì64. Ljubljana: Ljubljansko geografsko dru≈°tvo, p. 63. The Partisans also burned the Windischgr√§tz archive and destroyed the nearby family crypt and castle park. Mass grave Planina is the site of a mass grave associated with the Second World War. The Liplje Cave Mass Grave () is located on the slope of Mount Planina (), northeast of the peak. It contains the remains of undetermined victims based on skeletal remains discovered by spelunkers. Churches The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Margaret and belongs to the Ljubljana Archdiocese. It is a Baroque church that was built at the site of an older predecessor in 1771. Another church stands in Gornja Planina and is dedicated to Saint Roch. It was built in the Baroque style in 1763. The chancel was painted in 1852 by Franz Kurz zum Thurn und Goldenstein. There are a number of churches near the village belonging to the same parish. Holy Cross Church is built next to the cemetery north of the village.

In 2006 the school was designated a Business, Commerce and Management (BCM) Focus School. As such, Gardens Commercial is part of an education intervention that aims to redress the Apartheid education system. The school is a lead institution that supports learners with exceptional interest, talent, interest or aptitude in the field of business, commerce and management. Gardens Commercial offers the following focus field subjects: Accounting, Business Studies, Economics and Computer Applications Technology.  History  Gardens Commercial High School is a fine mixture of the old and the new. The five original houses which still form parts of the school buildings were built in 1882 and were used as University of Cape Town residences during the 1920s. Since then they have housed a private hotel, the offices of the Provincial Administration (1939‚Äì1944) and the offices of the Department of Inland Revenue and the Rent Control Board (1944‚Äì1967). In 1967 the demolition of Avenue Terrace - as the buildings were then known ‚Äì was planned. In its stead a new school would be built to house the pupils from the Day School of Commerce (est. 1961) which, until then, had been a department of the Cape Technical College. These plans, however, were shelved and the original buildings were adapted for use as a school. In 1968 the school came under the jurisdiction of the Cape Education Department and a year later it was renamed Gardens Commercial High School. The Avenue Terrace buildings survived intact, a second time, when demolition plans were again mooted. When Louis Karol Architects were commissioned in 1976 to build the new school, their decision to incorporate Avenue Terrace finally guaranteed the survival of these buildings. The intriguing blend of old and new in this design earned the architects an Award of Merit from the Institute of South African Architects. In 1984 - two years before the school's silver anniversary - the Twistniet Sports Complex was opened in Upper Orange Street. It offered facilities for hockey, tennis, basketball, netball and athletics. The school is proud of its historic links with the city of Cape Town. In 1993 the old School buildings, the wall and the ground were declared a National Monument. The original deeds of transfer of the ground, are part of the Uitvlugt, date to 1732.  Sport & Culture  Learners participate in at least one extramural activity throughout the year.

It is five km inlandward from present shore line. It was first reported by P. P Pandya and later thoroughly explored by Y. M. Chitalwala. The excavations revealed two periods of occupation. Period I is assigned to the Mature Harappan phase (c. 2200‚Äì1900 BCE) and the Period II is assigned to the Late Harappan phase (c.1900‚Äì1700 BCE).Ray, Niharranjan (gen. ed.) (2000).

He brought the flute to the mainstream Indian Carnatic concert stage ‚Äì until then, it was almost exclusively a folk instrument. To Sastri goes the credit of promoting the flute to the status of a primary concert instrument from being a mere 'second fiddle' to dance.  Early life and background  Sri Sarabha Sastrigal was born in 1872 to Viswanatha Sastri and Smt. Dharmambal. His mother's native place was Tiruvadi and She lived next door to Saint Tyagaraja. His father died when he and his brother (Rao Sahib)Sivakumara Sastrihttp://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/newnow/viswaindex.htm were very young. Blind at a young age, he was initiated into a career in music under the guidance of his maternal uncle Sri Kuppusamy Sastri of Tiruvadi near Thiruvaiyaru and later by Manambuchavadi Sri Venkatasubba Iyer, one of the disciples of Saint Thiyagaraja. Sri Govinda Nayanakkar unravelled the mysteries of flute to young Sarabha Sastri. Sri Saraba Saastrigal lived in Soliappa Mudali street in Kumbakonam and was married to Ambu Ammal.  Penance at Eraharam  Sastri undertook penance in ErAharam -Sri Sankari Samedha Skandanadha Swamy temple, obtained divinity and brought peace and happiness to local population. Later, he organised \\"Sarba Kavadi\\", \\" Macha Kavadi\\" etc. and spread the fame of this temple.http://www.vedas.com/eraharam/main.htm Carrying kavadi is a practice of penance or prayaschittam. Thaipusam is a festival that is marked by acts of penance such as carrying the Kavadi.http://www.myhindupage.org/index.php/thaipusam.Kavadi The Kavadi itself is a physical burden through which the devotees implore for help from deity.  Achievements  Blindness in childhood could do nothing to blunt the musical genius of Sarabha Sastri. By experimenting with the flute, he evolved a fingering technique by which he could produce the entire range of Indian ragas on it. Sri Sarabha Sastrigal composed more than 500 Sahityas for Nayanmar charithrams, in various languages. Sri Saraba Saastrigal taught a unique technique in playing the Flute (with Tu-Tu kaarams). He was also able to play the Thaanam on the Flute. Sri Saraba Saastrigal was also called \\"Eka Chandra Graahi\\", since he had the uncanny ability to grasp anything by just listening once. Palladam Sanjiva Raohttp://www.thehindu.com/features/friday- review/music/a-star-in-his-time/article4856358.ece was a direct disciple of Sri Saraba Saastrigal. Palladam Sanjiva Rao passed this on to H Ramachandra Shastry who taught Carnatic flute at Kalakshetra until 1992. Some of the notable musicians practising this art form include G. S. Rajan, Ludwig Pesch and T. Sashidhar. Sastri was always sought after by fans, but he never practised the flute at home. Sastri who never practised would however warm up within a few seconds from the commencement of a concert and readily get into his stride. He was a confirmed believer in emotional purification through music. He was invited to serve as the \\"Asthana Vidwan' of Mysore samasthan by the erstwhile Maharaja of Mysore which was refused by Sastri.He was also against commercialisation of music.http://kumbakonamramabhajanaisabha.blogspot.in/2013/03/the-hindu- dated-22nd-oct-1993-by-sri.html  Origin of the Carnatic Flute  Until the late 19th century, the Carnatic flute (better known in Tamil as the pullanguzhal), an 8-hole bamboo flute, the South Indian equivalent of the North Indian 6-hole bansuri flute, had never been used in Carnatic concerts. Sharaba Shastri has been characterised by his followers as a musical genius after experimenting and creating the Carnatic flute. He is also known for bringing the Carnatic flute to the fore of Carnatic music concerts as an influential instrument. The Sharaba Shastri style or bani of playing was established and was carried on by his disciple Sanjeeva Rao. However it was the self-taught \\"Mali\\" who brought a revolution in popularising the Carnatic flute and whose legacy was carried on by Ramani and other national and international disciples of Mali.N. Ramani The fingering technique invented by Sarabha Shastri was as highly scientific, and as accurate as a keyboard. The minutest oscillations required for the intricate gamakas of Carnatic music were covered by this fingering system. By progressing from playing only simple tunes to the ability of producing full-fledged kritis complete with the nuances of every raga, the flute came on par with the veena as a concert instrument. No recordings of his playing survive, and apart from stray references in larger works, little has been written about his music. We only know his music through his student, the legendary Palladam Sanjiva Rao.http://www.planetradiocity.com/musicopedia/article-instrument/Sarabha- Sastri/1984http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/a-star-in-his- time/article4856358.ece  Sanskrit Scholar  Sastri was a great scholar and used to have discussions with other scholars such as Thirupalanam Panchapakesa Sastrigal, Sulamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar and others. Music scholars such as Thirukodikaval Krishna Iyer, ‚ÄúFiddle‚Äù Govindasamy Pillai, Pattanam Subramaniya Iyer, Thanjavur Krishna Bhagavathar, Mridangam Narayanaswamy Appa, Mridangam Azhaga Nambi Pillai, Kumbakonam Sivakolundu and Tirumarugal Natesa Nayakarar were his contemporaries and used to accompany him in his concerts.http://kumbakonamramabhajanaisabha.blogspot.in/2013/03/the-hindu- dated-22nd-oct-1993-by-sri.html  Death  Sri Sarabha Sastrigal died at the young age of 32 years in the year 1904 at Kumbakonam. Sarabha Shastri, like many a great genius, lived only a short life. Upon his death at the age of 32, his work was carried on by his most celebrated disciple, Palladam Sanjeeva Rao, who perfected and elaborated on the fingering system and popularised the flute as a solo concert instrument. However the original contribution of Sarabha Shastri upgrading the flute onto the concert platform remains immortal  Sastri‚Äôs Flute  The flute he handled is still on display at Sri Rama Bhajanai Sabha at 110, Solaippan Street, Kumbakonam. Sri Sarabha Sastrigal's flute has been preserved for more than 100 years from Sastri‚Äôs family members.http://kumbakonamramabhajanaisabha.blogspot.in/2013/03/the-magical- flute-of-sri-sarabha-sastri.html  Venuganam Sri Sarabha Sastrigal Memorial Trust  A trust under the name and style of \\"Venuganam Sri Sarabha Sastrigal Memorial Trust\\" has been formed and functioning, organising music, cultural and service-oriented programs, and the trust is managed by leading personalities. Ekadasi Bhajans and Radha Kalyanam are conducted fortnightly, during the month of Margazhi.

The aim is to evade discovery by passive sonar by eliminating superfluous noise: nonessential systems are shut down, the crew is urged to rest and refrain from making any unnecessary sound, and speed is greatly reduced to minimize propeller noise. The protocol has been in use since the latter part of World War I, when hydrophones were invented to detect U-boats. The propellers have a characteristic RPM band in which no cavitation noise arises. Since this rotation speed is usually relatively low, the first electric submarines had special \\"silent running\\" engines designed for optimum performance at reduced speed. These required less active cooling (further reducing noise), and were generally equipped with plain bearings rather than ball bearings. These engines were also acoustically decoupled from the hull, as they employed belt transmission rather than direct coupling to the propeller shaft. Nuclear submarines can run even more quietly, at very low speeds only, by turning off active reactor cooling during silent running. The reactor is then only cooled by natural convection of the water.

It was founded in 1967 following the signing of the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and is one of more than 1,000 independent Community Action Agencies across the country. It is sponsored by United Way of Utah County. The agency's purpose is to assist the disadvantaged in meeting critical basic needs such as food and housing while working with families on a long-term basis to help them increase their potential for financial and social self-sufficiency. It is dedicated to fostering self-reliance in individuals, families and communities. This is accomplished by providing a variety of programs and solutions designed to address local needs and issues. CASFB has been a pioneer in the development of publicly and privately sponsored programs designed to address the needs of the disadvantaged. The organization has a trained staff with many community contacts to help low-income persons evaluate their problems and lead them to resources that can help in solving those problems. Programs Food Bank The Community Action Food Bank is the second largest food bank in Utah and is the only food bank serving Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. It is often confused with the Utah Food Bank, which is a separate organization that primarily serves Salt Lake and Tooele counties but also assists food pantries in other counties in the state of Utah. Community Action Food Bank annually distributes more than 2.3 million pounds of food to thousands of families and many local service organizations. Community Action employees and volunteers work to alleviate hunger by providing eligible families with food boxes, counseling, budgeting and referrals. They collect and distribute donated food and hygiene items on a regular basis to more than thirty other agencies, including local pantries, community agencies, churches and senior centers. The Community Action Food Bank also operates five food pantries located in Utah communities Payson, American Fork, Heber, Kamas, and Coalville. An additional satellite office in Park City relies on Community Action for food and other donated items. Family Development Program The Family Development Program helps families become self-reliant by providing short-term assistance to resolve immediate crises, such as help paying for rent or bus tokens, followed by continued support to assist them in attaining financial stability and self- reliance. Support includes haircuts for job applicants, help with resumes and references. The program works with families to increase their potential for social and financial self-sufficiency through goal setting, case management, self-empowerment/self-esteem training, and advocacy assistance. Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program The Home Buyer and Mortgage Counseling Program helps families obtain long-term home ownership through education and counseling. It works toward strengthening communities by identifying resources, advocating ethical practices and assisting with dispute resolutions. Community Action Services and Food Bank is approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as a housing counseling agency. The program provides the following services free of charge: pre-home ownership counseling, home buyer education classes, mortgage default counseling, reverse mortgage counseling, refinance counseling, and predatory lending counseling. HEAT Program Community Action Services and Food Bank administers the Utah State Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT) Program for Utah, Wasatch and Summit counties. The HEAT Program provides approximately 4,200 eligible low-income households with a once-per-year utility payment to help ease the burden of electricity and heating costs while promoting energy conservation. An energy conservation class is required for first time applicants. Community Services Program Community Action Services and Food Bank helps improve the quality of life for elderly and disabled individuals by connecting them to programs and resources through home and community visits. Community service specialists are available to assist local senior citizens and disabled residents by assessing individual situations and determining eligibility for specific programs. Referrals are also given for other resources that may be beneficial to each individual. Help is provided in completing the forms to apply for the HEAT Program, the Circuit Breaker Program, a property tax abatement, veteran‚Äôs abatement, blind abatement, mobile home abatement, or renter refund. Outreach workers are available in local senior citizen centers several times each month. In addition, home visits are arranged for those who are homebound. Youth Program Community Action Services and Food Bank directs the Utah Valley chapter of Trips for Kids, a national program that provides mountain bike experiences and training to local, underprivileged youth. The program helps youth from low-income families resist negative peer pressure and become contributing members of the community by providing mentor support and skills training. Trips for Kids Utah Valley currently holds three six-week sessions each year. Youth ages 12 to 17 who are accepted into a session attend weekly workshops and go on two to three rides in the nearby mountains. Scholarships for registration fees and equipment are available for those who qualify. Community Garden Starting in April of each year, Community Action Services and Food Bank leases small garden plots in its community garden in located behind the Boulders Apartments in Provo. The CASFB Community Garden allows families with limited yard space to grow their own fresh produce alongside their neighbors and other community members. Garden plots are measured in 4-foot by 20-foot rectangles with 4-foot walkways between plots. Watering is provided as a service of the garden, but gardeners are responsible for providing their own tools and seeds. Advocacy and Building Community Solutions Community Action Services and Food Bank works with other community organizations to develop solutions to the problems faced by low and moderate-income Utah residents. It also works to bring about change in local, state, and national policies. Organization The Community Action Services and Food Bank board of trustees provides direction and guidance to staff regarding community needs, future planning, and fiscal oversight. It is a tri-partite board consisting of 1/3 public, 1/3 private, and 1/3 low-income representatives, thereby giving low-income residents an opportunity to provide input to agency programs and operations. The agency's annual budget exceeds $1.5 million, and independent external audits are conducted for each fiscal year. Approximately 75 percent of the agency's funds come from grants such as the Community Services Block Grant. Remaining funds come from local sources including the United Way of Utah County and corporate and private donations. Several local autonomous organizations in Utah had their start at Community Action Services and Food Bank, including Information and Referral, the Volunteer Center, Crisis Line, and others. The agency has also served as a catalyst to coordinate efforts and encourage other organizations to deliver needed services. CASFB is recognized locally for its leadership capabilities, expertise in regard to poverty issues, and ability to provide quality services.

Adopted on August 21, 2004, in Berlin, the document supersedes the ILA's earlier \\"The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers\\", which was limited in its scope to international drainage basins and aquifers connected to them. Background In 1966, the ILA adopted \\"The Helsinki Rules on the Uses of the Waters of International Rivers\\", an unenforceable guideline governing the usage of rivers and connected groundwaters that crossed national boundaries. As the guideline did not address other aquifers, various other guidelines were subsequently drafted and adopted by other organizations to replace or supplement them, including the United Nations' \\"Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses\\" and the ILA's own \\"Rules on International Groundwaters.\\" However, these documents were restricted to addressing international waters. In 1996, the ILA appointed Joseph Dellapenna to produce a compilation of water related laws, following the production of which in 1997 it decided to create a comprehensive document, addressing all freshwater resources as well as issues affecting the climate that impacts them. Provisions The document requires that nations take appropriate steps to sustain and manage water resources, in conjunction with other resources, and minimize environmental harm. In addition to setting out various regulations for nations to follow with respect to water within their boundaries and water they may share, it regulates behavior in wartime, including damage to water installations such as dams and dikes. Nations are not permitted to take action that may result in a shortage of life-sustaining water for civilians, unless a nation being invaded is compelled by military emergency to disable its own water supply, or that may cause undue ecological damage. Poisoning water necessary for survival is in all cases forbidden. Where water resources are internationally shared, it regulates equitable use with reasonable consideration of such factors as past customary usages of the resource and balancing variant needs and demands of all bordering nations. It mandates that the first consideration in weighing needs is satisfying the requirements of human beings for water to sustain life. It requires that nations sharing water make reasonable efforts not to cause harm to one another by the ways in which the water is used. It permits free navigation by all nations sharing a water system, although it allows reasonable restriction by a nation of water navigation within its jurisdiction for security. Nations are expected to work together as needed to sustain shared water resources. The document requires a reasonable openness to the international community of information related to water resources and their usage, particularly in those cases where nations sharing a water resource may be impacted. Except in cases of emergency, usage that may significantly impact others should be discussed in advance with all interested nations, with disagreements resolved by appeal as necessary to international governing committees. Regardless of the location of water, and whether or not a water resource is shared, it asserts the right of every individual to equally access water to sustain life without discrimination, even in times of war. It requires states to enable their citizens to participate in decisions affecting water access by providing reasonable information about the water resource and plans impacting it. It also mandates the compensation of those who are displaced in the interests of securing water preservation. It requires that nations be mindful of the environmental factors that affect water resources and preserve them appropriately, such as by preventing water pollution and preserving native ecosystems, even if they are occupying foreign territory during a time of war. It requires appropriate measures to address flooding and drought, both in communicating quickly about these to nations sharing a water resource and in working to eliminate or prevent harm to a water resource and the population dependent on it. The Berlin Rules on Water Resources provides that nations must enforce its provisions through local legislation and also submit to international review as necessary to ensure that they are compliant.

Early life and education She was born in Seneca Falls, New York, the daughter of Eunice Newton, a scientist and women's rights campaigner, and Elisha Foote, a prominent lawyer and judge, and the niece of Senator Samuel A. Foot of Connecticut and numerous other aunts and uncles. Mother Eunice born in Bloomfield, New York described the Greenhouse Gas effect in 1856 and also held several patents. Eunice was also a signatory of the \\"Declaration of Sentiments\\" at the first Women's Rights Convention and a member of the Editorial Committee in 1848. Elisha moved his family to Washington, D.C. during the Civil War while he served as Commissioner of the US Patent Office. Mary Henderson was educated at Temple Grove Ladies Seminary (now Skidmore College), Saratoga Springs and at Ashgrove Seminary, in Albany, finishing at a French school in New York City. She was fluent in French and had a lifelong interest in painting and art collecting. Career In June 1868, she married John B. Henderson, Senator from Missouri (1862‚Äì1869) who introduced the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution that abolished slavery and one of seven Republicans who voted against the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in May 1868. That unpopular decision ended his career as senator, and he and his new wife moved back to Missouri, living first in the town of Louisiana and then in St. Louis. Life in St. Louis Mary Henderson pursued many interests in St. Louis. Like her mother before her, she believed in woman's suffrage, and became president of the Missouri State Suffrage Association. She studied art at Washington University, and co-founded the St. Louis School of Design as well as the St. Louis Women's Exchange with Rebecca Naylor Hazard. Known as an excellent hostess, she wrote a guide to fine entertaining, Practical Cooking and Dinner Giving, in 1877. In 1885, Henderson published a second cookbook, Diet for the Sick, A Treatise on the Values of Foods. The Hendersons became very wealthy, when John Henderson bought up enormous quantities of supposedly worthless bonds that Missouri counties had issued after the war. Purchased at ten cents on the dollar, the bonds became valuable when the courts ordered counties to pay Henderson their full face value. Life in Washington, D.C. Henderson's Castle in Washington, D.C., built in 1888 and razed in 1949. In 1889, after accumulating a fortune, the Hendersons moved back to Washington D.C., where they built a castle-like mansion on Sixteenth Street called \\"Boundary Castle\\" or \\"Henderson's Castle.\\"National Park Service article The Hendersons bought up dozens of lots outside the northern boundary of the city in the area known as Meridian Hill.

Smith in 1900, to construct a colossal presidential mansion on Meridian Hill to replace the White House. In addition to these plans, she also had a home constructed on 16th Street and offered it to the government as use as the Vice President's mansion. She also lobbied for the Lincoln Memorial to be built on the site of Meridian Hill Park. Personal life In June 1868, she married John B. Henderson (1826‚Äì1913), who served as a Senator from Missouri from 1862 until 1869. Together, they were the parents of one son: * John Brooks Henderson Jr. (1870‚Äì1923), who married Angelica Schuyler Crosby (1872‚Äì1907), daughter of John Schuyler Crosby and granddaughter of Clarkson F. Crosby and Stephen Van Rensselaer IV, in 1903. Henderson became a strong advocate for temperance and vegetarianism, and published a book on health and diet called The Aristocracy of Health. When her husband died in 1913, she had his entire wine cellar, a thirty-year collection of costly wines, emptied into the street.http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/authors/author_henderson.html accessed February 12, 2009 She died aged 90 in Bar Harbor, Maine. Descendants She was the adopted grandmother of Beatrice Van Rensselaer Henderson (1906‚Äì1992), who was married to Joseph Wholean (1894‚Äì1971) in 1926. Legacy In 1925, Henderson also donated land to the District of Columbia for the construction of the Mount Pleasant Library at 3160 Sixteenth Street. Henderson's most well known crusade was to change the name of 16th Street to \\"Avenue of the Presidents,\\" and to line the street with busts of all the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the United States. While she actually succeeded in having legislation passed to change the name of the street in 1913, the Commission of Fine Arts denied her request to construct the busts. One year later, because the name \\"Avenue of the Presidents\\" proved to be unpopular, the original 16th Street name was restored. Following her death at Bar Harbor, Maine in 1931, the Commission of Fine Arts praised her efforts and her vision of Meridian Hill. A report by the Commission stated: > Persistently she labored during four decades, persuading and convincing > Senators and Representatives; single-handed and alone she appeared before > committees of Congress to urge approval for the work of development.

Independent reports by Mondo Times and Echo Media have put the Daily Banner's circulation at 3,561 copies and 5,600, respectively. The Daily Banner was first published on September 22, 1897 by Lindsay C. Marshall and Armistead R. Michie. In the September 22, 1902 issue, Michie is given full credit for establishing the Banner after studying law at the University of Virginia and practicing law for a few years in Charlottesville, Virginia. The paper notes, \\"To Mr. Armistead R. Michie, however, belongs the credit of the idea, the execution of which gave Cambridge her first and only daily paper. He it was who, looking over the field for towns large enough for ventures of this sort, decided on Cambridge as the most suitable and promising place.\\" A year later, the Banner was combined with a local weekly paper, The Chronicle, under the ownership of Harrington, Henry & Company. Marshall remained editor until around 1910, when brothers Edward F. and P. Watson Webb assumed ownership of the paper through their publishing company, Webb & Webb Publishing Company. Edward Webb later went on to become the principal of Hemlock High School in Cambridge. The Daily Banner stopped publishing in 2008.

Since August 2008, the Banner had been a twice-weekly publication published on Wednesdays and Fridays. Prior to that, the Daily Banner published daily except Saturdays and Sundays. The switch from daily to twice-weekly editions was attributed to a lack of news to report and diminished advertising revenue.

He was a friend and protector of a young Sam Houston. Background Jolly \\"was a wealthy merchant and planter. Jolly spoke no English, and dressed in buckskin with a hunting shirt, leggings and moccasins,\\" according to the Cherokee Nation website. John Jolly was headman of Cayuga town (on Hiwassee Island in present-day Hamilton County, Tennessee), after his brother, Tahlonteeskee's, departure for 'the west' in 1809. He eventually followed his brother to the Arkansaw Territory. There, Jolly was elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation--West upon the death of his brother, in 1819. Black Coat, who served with Jolly as Second Chief, died in the spring of 1835, and was succeeded by Joseph Vann. Friendship with Houston When the young Sam Houston came to live with the Cherokee on Hiwassee Island in 1809, Jolly adopted him and acted as his father in the Cherokee Nation. Jolly gave Houston the Cherokee name of Ka'lanu, meaning 'the Raven'. Houston later returned to his family in Maryville, Tennessee, but he lived once again with the Cherokee in the west during the late 1820s and early 1830s. Achievements as Principal Chief The Arkansaw Territory's evolution into Arkansas and Indian Territory. In 1828, during Jolly's term of office, the Cherokee Nation‚ÄîWest adopted a constitution establishing a tripartite government, much like that previously adopted by the Cherokee Nation‚ÄîEast (1827). Jolly established a capital city, Tahlonteeskee, named in honor of his brother. That same year, most of the western Cherokee were moved from Indian Reserve areas in the Arkansas Territory to the newly established Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). > In his role as leader, Jolly frequently raised issues of security and treaty > rights with both U.S. government officials in Washington D.C. and with > Arkansas territorial authorities.

One writer states that much of Jolly's success as Chief \\"was due to the counsel and support of John Rogers\\", his brother-in-law and Cherokee headman. Jolly served as Principal Chief until his death in December 1838. He was succeeded by John Looney, who had been his assistant principal chief.

Moore was the bank's Head of Group Regulatory Risk and was fired from the role by HBOS Group Chief Executive Office James Crosby following his warnings to the Board about HBOS's risky sales strategies. In 2009 Moore's evidence about HBOS was presented to the UK House of Commons Treasury Select Committee and resulted in James Crosby resigning as Deputy Chairman of the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). Crosby, who was also an adviser to the then British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, later gave up his knighthood and part of his pension after a Parliamentary report was highly critical of his, HBOS Chairman Lord Dennis Stevenson and HBOS CEO Andy Hornby's management of the bank. Since his dismissal Moore has been shunned by the financial community and has been unable to find another job in the sector. He has continued to fight for change in the financial system and to bring those responsible for the 2008 crisis to justice. Early life Paul Russell Moore was born in Bristol, England on 30 October 1958. He was educated at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire and studied law at Bristol University. Early career After becoming a barrister he became the in-house lawyer in the product development department of Allied Dunbar in December 1984. He left in December 1988 to join Kleinworth Benson as its in-house lawyer but was only there until April 1989 when he was headhunted by start-up firm Ellastone. In February 1990 he moved to American Express subsidiary Acuma as General Counsel and Head of Compliance and was there until February 1994. In February 1995 Moore joined accountancy firm KPMG becoming its top- performing Partner. HBOS Moore joined HBOS in July 2002 as Head of Risk in the Insurance and Investment Division. He was appointed to the role of Head of Group Regulatory Risk at the end of 2003. He had formal responsibility for the bank's policy and oversight of executive management's compliance with FSA regulation. It was during 2004 whilst conducting reviews of the bank's sales culture and selling practices that Moore and his team uncovered mis-selling and other unfair customer sales tactics. However, when Moore reported these findings, as his job demanded, he was fired on 8 November 2004. Moore's complaints were investigated at the time (before the crisis) by accountancy firm KPMG, who concluded that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place; this was accepted by the Financial Services Authority. In November 2004 Moore was dismissed by HBOS. He claimed this was because he had told HBOS's board that the bank was taking excessive risks with its aggressive sales culture which was out of balance with its systems and controls. He passed his concerns about HBOS to the FSA, who had it investigated by KPMG, whose conclusion, that HBOS had appropriate risk controls in place, was accepted by the FSA.The Choice. (2009). BBC Radio 4. Tuesday 3 November 2009 Following his dismissal the bank replaced him with a retail sales manager. He sued HBOS for unfair dismissal on the basis that the reason for his dismissal was actually his warnings of excessive risk, which if followed would have reduced the bank's profits while protecting it from what proved to be the all-too-real risk. The bank settled his claim for over half a million pounds in mid-2005. In 2008, HBOS was forced into a merger and then bailed out by a multibillion-pound infusion of capital from the Treasury. Although Moore had agreed to the non- disclosure agreement as part of his settlement, he decided to speak out after the crisis because he believed it to be in the public interest and on 10 February 2009 Moore submitted a memorandum of evidence to the UK's Treasury Select Committee, which was investigating risks taken by UK banks prior to the credit crunch. After HBOS Moore ran a risk consultancy, Moore Carter and Associates, and was the non-executive Chairman of Assetz Capital, a peer-to- peer lender aimed at SMEs and property developers in the UK. Moore was married with three children and last lived in North Yorkshire. Moore announced his intention to publish a book about the HBOS whistle blowing and subsequent events called \\"Crash, Bank, Wallop\\". The book was co-authored by Mike Haworth, edited by Guy Mankowski and published in November 2015. Moore also launched The New Wilberforce Movement to \\"free the world from the slavery of greed\\".

Set in the hills of Shropshire, it features children whose camping holiday seems to engage the prehistoric past. Porter won the annual Carnegie Medal for excellence in British children's literature. Roy Publishers issued the first US edition in 1967, retaining the original illustrations.  Plot summary  Six children plan a camping trip during the Easter holidays, deciding on Brown Clee Hill as it is out of the way of summer visitors. They set up camp on the top of the hill, which turns out to be the site of an Iron Age hill fort, Nordy Bank. Bronwen is particularly susceptible to the atmosphere of the place, and shows unexpected knowledge about its construction. Her personality begins to change, as from a quiet good-natured girl she becomes argumentative, then increasingly withdrawn and sullen. Bron is aware of the change and frightened by it. Her friend Margery believes she is possessed by the spirit of an Iron Age woman. Meanwhile an Alsatian dog of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps escapes while on his way to retraining by the National Canine Defence League after being retired due to partial deafness. Being muzzled, he is unable to hunt and becomes increasingly hungry. When the dog appears lurking round the camp, the dog-loving Bron reacts with fear and hostility, calling him a wolf. However, his forlorn state eventually rouses her true self and she befriends him.  Characters  ;Campers * Peter Furness, a 15-year-old boy, clever, a natural leader and inclined to be sarcastic * Margery Furness, Peter's younger sister, kind-hearted and a peace-maker * Robin Furness, their 10-year-old brother, keen on fossils * Anne Turner, their cousin, visiting from Bristol, a good cook but scared of dogs and worms * Bronwen Owen (Bron), Margery's friend, an only child, a shy but sensible girl, who loves animals * Joe Catlin, Peter's friend, a 15-year-old farmer's son, very competent and an experienced camper ;Adults * Dr Furness, a busy GP * Mrs Furness, who breeds Dalmatians * Mr Owen, Bron's father, whose work forces his family to move frequently * Mrs Owen, Bron's over-protective mother * Mr Catlin, Joe's father, a farmer * Arthur and Edward, farming brothers who give permission for the camp and supply the campers with milk and water * Mrs Pritchard, shopkeeper and postmistress in the village of Clee St. Margaret, where the children buy supplies * Corporal Smythe of the RAVC, the Alsatian's handler * Mr Kirby of the National Canine Defence League ;Animals * Lucy, Margery's Dalmatian, who has puppies during the story * Spotted Dick, the smallest of Lucy's litter * Griff (as named by Bron), an Alsatian, a former army dog  References to actual history and geography  The novel is set primarily in a precisely described location, Nordy Bank on Brown Clee Hill in Shropshire. The surrounding countryside, the Shropshire Hills, the village of Clee St. Margaret, and the market town of Ludlow also feature prominently.\\"Nordy Bank by Sheena Porter\\" . Literary Heritage: West Midlands. Shropshire Council. 14 September 2003. (As of 2007 Porter lives in Ludlow.) The ancient hill fort at Nordy Bank was designed for defence against men or wolves. The novel describes the differences between Roman, Iron Age and Stone Age camps on the site.  References to other works  Margery and Bron quote from A. E. Housman's poem \\"The Welsh Marches\\" while looking at the surrounding landscape. The novel echoes the theme of the poem, the long history of warfare in the region, the \\"war that sleeps\\" in the land itself. For reading in camp, Bron takes Rosemary Sutcliff's novel Warrior Scarlet, about a boy in Bronze Age Britain whose test of manhood is the single-handed killing of a wolf. When the army dog first appears, she is reading aloud to the others a wolf attack on the boy's sheep.  Literary significance  In The Nesbit Tradition, Marcus Crouch calls Nordy Bank Sheena Porter's finest book. He describes the camping scenes as beautifully done, conveying a sense of adventure and good companionship, but he regards the novel as primarily concerned with the development of personality. \\"In Nordy Bank Sheena Porter shows how self-discovery can go hand-in-hand with the discovery of society. It is an effective lesson, the more so because the lesson is contained in an absorbing and dramatic story and the inner and outer themes are inseparable.\\"Marcus Crouch, The Nesbit Tradition: The Children's Novel in England 1945‚Äì1970, Ernest Benn, 1972, p. 210.

Military formation Guard mount is a pre-shift official formation among designated United States Air Force Security Forces or United States Army Military Police Corps members. This meeting is usually held after all security personnel have \\"armed up\\" or received their weapons and equipment for the shift. During the formation, the senior NCO (non-commissioned officer) such as the flight leader (known as the flight chief) or the First Sergeant will discuss topics such as current unit, base or other service (air force or army) level news, current terrorism warnings or military intelligence, and weapons, vehicle and ground safety. Members also will be inspected and assessed on their appearance, uniform and checked for required equipment. When held in a deployed combat threat environment, guard mount is somewhat akin to US Army pre-combat checks and pre-combat inspections, PCC and PCI respectively. Bugle call \\"Guard Mount\\" is a bugle call which sounds as a warning that the guard is about to be assembled for guard mount. :Guard mounting score References Category:Bugle calls ","title":"Guard Mount"},{"id":"21508086","text":"\\"Mail Call\\" is a bugle call which signals personnel to assemble for the distribution of mail. \\\\header { title = \\"Mail Call\\" tagline = ##f } \\\\paper { #(layout-set-staff-size 18) } \\\\score { \\\\relative c { \\\\tempo 4=176 \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"french horn\\" c8-. c16 c16 c8-. g8-. c8-. c16 c16 c8-. g8-. c8-. e8-. c8-. e8-. c8-. c8-. g4\\\\fermata \\\\bar \\".\\" } \\\\layout { } \\\\midi { } } Category:Bugle calls ","title":"Mail Call (bugle call)"},{"id":"21508107","text":"\\"Mess Call\\" is a bugle call which signals time to go to the mess hall. \\\\header { title = \\"Mess Call\\" tagline = ##f } \\\\paper { #(layout-set-staff-size 18) } \\\\score { \\\\relative c { \\\\tempo 4=152 \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"french horn\\" c8-. e8-. c8-. e8-. c4 c4-. c8-. \\\\times 2/3 { c16 c16 c16 } c8-. e8-. c4 r4 e8-. g8-. e8-. g8-. e4 e4-. e8-. \\\\times 2/3 { e16 e16 e16 } e8-. g8-. e4 r4 g,8-. c8-. g8-. c8-. g4 g4-. g8-. \\\\times 2/3 { g16 g16 g16 } g8-. c8-. g4. r8 \\\\bar \\".\\" } \\\\layout { } \\\\midi { } } \\"Mess Call\\" is associated with the following lyrics: :Soupy, soupy, soupy, without a single bean: :Coffee, coffee, coffee, without a speck of cream: :Porky, porky, porky, without a streak of lean.

Di'wali was born around 1765 in Little Hiwassee, a Cherokee town in current- day North Carolina. His mother was Cherokee, and his father was a Scottish trader. Emmet Starr, an early historian of the Cherokee, describes Bowles as \\"being decidedly Gaelic in appearance, having light eyes, red hair, and somewhat freckled.\\" Di'wali was a follower of Dragging Canoe, one of the founders of the Chickamauga Cherokee who supported the British during the American Revolutionary War, and Di'wali fought under Dragging Canoe and John Watts during the Cherokee-American Wars. During this time, Di'wali had attained the chief of the Running Water Town (present-day Muscle Shoals, Alabama). After the destruction of the Chickamauga settlements by the Americans in 1794, Di'wali returned to Little Hiwassee. In order to enjoy better hunting grounds and escape the pressures of growing white settlements in the southern states, Di'wali led the first large Cherokee emigration west across the Mississippi River in 1809, where he and his followers settled in the St. Francis River valley, near present-day New Madrid, Missouri. When the government was organized the next year, he was elected the first Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation‚ÄìWest. In 1812-13, Di'wali moved his people south into the Arkansaw Territory near present-day Conway, Arkansas. Di'wali was succeeded as the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation‚ÄìWest in 1813 by Degadoga. Responding to the increased white settlers in the Arkansas Territory, Di'wali led 60 Cherokee families into Spanish Texas in the winter of 1819-1820, settling for two years in northeast Texas along the Red River. The community elected Di'wali as Head Chief (ugu). Fleeing the influx of white settlers into the Red River area, Di'wali moved his community into the forks of the Trinity River (near present-day Dallas) and, the following year, into a region fifty miles north of Nacogdoches. At this time, Richard Fields succeeded D'wali as the leader of the \\"Cherokee and their associated bands.\\" After entering into an agreement with Jos√© Felix Trespalacios, the governor of the province of Texas, for \\"peaceful possession\\" of lands in east Texas on November 8, 1822. Fields and Di'wali then traveled to Mexico City in early 1823, petitioning and winning the consent of the First Mexican Empire to settle there. In his 1898 essay, \\"the Cherokee Nation of Indians,\\" V. O. King reports: Enforcement of the agreement with Mexico was difficult, and on April 15, 1825, a white immigrant, Benjamin Edwards, was given a grant by the Mexican government to settle in Cherokee lands in east Texas. The dissatisfaction with the Mexican authorities found an outlet when a number of aggrieved white settlers in nearby Nacogdoches revolted against the Mexican government in what became known as the Fredonian Rebellion. While Fields, as war chief, and John Dunn Hunter, the civil chief, opened negotiations with the Fredonian leaders, Di'wali urged the Cherokee not to cooperate in the rebellion. He believed that loyalty to Mexico would lead to enforcement of the 1822 treaty and recognition of Cherokee lands. Di'wali was convincing, and the Cherokee remained loyal to Mexico during the rebellion. Fields and Hunter were executed by the Mexican government for their support of the Fredonian Rebellion on May 8, 1827, and Di'wali succeeded Fields as war chief. In remaining loyal to Mexico, Stephen F. Austin and other Mexican officials praised Di'wali and the Cherokee in the wake of the Fredonian Rebellion. Di'wali was summoned to Nacogdoches and given a commission of lieutenant- colonel in the Mexican army on July 19, 1827. By 1830, an estimated 800 Cherokee lived in three to seven settlements in Texas. They became known as the Texas Cherokee, or Tsalagiyi nvdagi. During this time, Di'wali continued his work in securing a written guarantee to rights over the Cherokee lands from the Mexican government, but the Mexican government repeatedly withheld written agreement. When the Texas Revolution came, the Texas Cherokee decided to remain neutral, but Sam Houston (who had married into the Cherokee tribe and had a long-standing relationship with Chief Di'wali) sought an alliance with the Cherokee. Seeking to give them what the Mexican government had refused and empowered under authority of the new government, General Houston negotiated a treaty with the Cherokee and other associated groups, granting over 2.5 million acres of land in east Texas: Given the prospect of finally having a secure homeland, they agreed, and Di'wali signed the treaty on behalf of the Texas Cherokees near present-day Alto, Texas on February 23, 1835. Consequently, the Texas Cherokee remained supportive of the Texans against Santa Anna. On December 20, 1836, within the first two months as President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston told the Texas Senate, I \\"most earnestly recommend [the treaty with the Cherokee]'s ratification. You will find upon examining this treaty, that it is just and equitable, and perhaps the best which could be made at present time.\\" The Senate of the Republic of Texas, however, refused to ratify the treaty, citing that the Cherokee had not actively fought with Texans in the revolution and that the treaty conflicted with a grant given to David G. Burnet. Over Houston's objections, the Senate formally nullified the treaty on December 16, 1837. Almost immediately, the Land Office began issuing patents to lands within the Cherokee Nation. Though the relations between the Texas Cherokee and the Republic of Texas was strained, Houston and Di'wali remained close friends, and Di'wali served ‚Äì at Houston's request ‚Äì as a representative of the Texas government in negotiations with the Comanche in the western plains. In a further attempt to secure permanent recognition of Indian lands in east Texas, Di'wali again looked to Mexico when Vicente C√≥rdova attempted an insurgency against the Republic of Texas. The government of Mexico sought an arrangement with the Cherokee for their support in an insurgency in exchange for title to their land. Di'wali permitted C√≥rdova's militia to operate within Cherokee lands in 1838. When a member of the C√≥rdova militia had been killed in May 1839, documents were uncovered by Texas officials that suggested a conspiracy between the pro-Mexican forces and the Texas Cherokee. Though the C√≥rdova Rebellion had been suppressed quickly, coming to a head in August 1838, the newly discovered documents led the new President of the Republic of Texas, Mirabeau Lamar, to charge in December 1838 that Di'wali had surreptitiously collaborated with C√≥rdova. In 1839, in his first formal address as president, Lamar urged that the Cherokee and Comanche tribes be driven from their lands in Texas, believing that the ‚Äútotal extinction\\" of the Indian tribes was necessary to make the lands available to whites. Lamar instructed the Texas military to construct a military post on the Great Saline (in the southwest corner of present-day Smith County), with Di'wali warning that such a move would provoke a violent response. Lamar sent word that the Cherokee were to depart or suffer removal by force, but Di'wali was resolute that Texas should honor its 1836 treaty. John H. Reagan, an emissary of Lamar's administration, met with Di'wali in early July, delivering Lamar's charges and providing a few days for Di'wali to consult with his Council. Of the second meeting with Di'wali, Reagan writes: On July 14, Lamar sent troops, under the command of Gen. Thomas Rusk, to occupy the Indian territory. Fleeing their town and forced northward into present-day Van Zandt County, the Cherokee halted on July 15 and prepared defenses at the confluence of Warrior Creek and Kickapoo Creek on the Neches River. The ensuing battle proved indecisive. On the morning of July 16, though severely outnumbered, Di'wali made every effort to win. Di'wali \\"exhorted the Indians to fight bravely. During the last battle he could be heard repeatedly encouraging them, and more than once urging them to charge.\\" But eventually, with his troops depleted of ammunition, Di'wali ordered retreat, though he remained. Sitting on his horse, wearing a military hat and sword given to him by Sam Houston, Di'wali faced the advancing Texans. The Texan forces shot his horse and then injured the chief, shooting him in the thigh and the back. Unable to walk but raising himself to a sitting position on the ground, Di'wali was singing a war song when Capt. Robert W. Smith approached Di'wali and shot him in the head. Smith then took the sword from D'wali's body and swaths of skin from his arm as souvenir. Of Di'wali, John H. Reagan recalls, \\"I had witnessed his dignity and manliness in council, his devotion to his tribe in sustaining their decision for war against his judgement, and his courage in battle.\\" As he had requested, Di'wali was left on the battlefield according to tradition. A historical marker now stands at the site of Chief Di'wali 's death. A funeral for Di'wali was held by the descendants of the tribe in 1995, on the 156 anniversary of his death.

Shepherd Professor of History at Columbia University until December 2017. He is the author of numerous groundbreaking monographs on the Greco-Roman world, he is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and he was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Award by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2008. Life and career William V. Harris was born on 13 September 1938 in Nottingham, England. He attended Bristol Grammar School (1949‚Äì1956) and then was an Open Scholar in Classics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He earned first class in Classical Moderations in 1959, then first class in Literae Humaniores in 1961. From 1961 he pursued graduate studies as a State Student at Oxford, spending the year 1961-1962 in Rome (where he worked with J.B. Ward-Perkins), and was then the T.W. Greene Scholar in Classical Art and Archaeology. His dissertation supervisor was M. W. Frederiksen, and he received his D. Phil. in 1968. From 1964 to 1965 Harris served as Lecturer in Ancient History at Queen's University, Belfast. In 1965, he joined the faculty of Columbia University where he chaired the History Department from 1988 to 1994. In 1995 he was awarded the William R. Shepherd Professorship in History at Columbia. Beginning in 2000, he was director of Columbia's Center for the Ancient Mediterranean, which he co-founded. In 2002 he became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and in 2008 he was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Award by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In 2011 he was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. Harris's work first attracted wide attention with his 1979 book War and Imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 BC, which contradicted several received doctrines about the nature of Roman imperial expansion across the Mediterranean world. One reviewer wrote: \\"In the process of evolving his interpretation, he treads on the toes of a majority of the living scholars (and a large number of deceased ones) who have interested themselves in this problem.\\" The book has remained continuously in print. He then turned towards social history and published in 1989 what is probably his most controversial book, Ancient Literacy, in which he maintains that while the Greeks and Romans created deeply literate cultures, the mass of the Greek or Roman population remained illiterate. In the same period Harris began to work extensively on economic history, publishing a series of papers about slavery, money and other issues that were collected in Rome's Imperial Economy (2011). During his two three-year terms, covering 1988 to 1994, as the elected chair of the Columbia University History Department‚Äìhe was acting chair again in 2005‚Äìthe department moved to correct its gender imbalance. In the 1990s he began to work intensively on psychological aspects of ancient history, and in 2001 he published Restraining Rage: the Ideology of Anger Control in Classical Antiquity. Columbia College's undergraduates awarded this book its Lionel Trilling Award. It was one of the first studies in the history of emotions in antiquity.  Sexual harassment complaint  In October 2017, a Columbia University doctoral student, identified as Jane Doe, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for Southern New York against Harris and the trustees of Columbia University, alleging that Harris had repeatedly sexually harassed her throughout the years 2014 and 2015. The complaint also alleges that when the student rejected Harris's advances, he disparaged her to colleagues and fellow graduate students and that, as a result, the student withdrew from Columbia for the 2015-2016 academic year. The student claimed that university administration was aware that Harris had a history of harassment towards female students, but had taken no steps address the situation. The complaint was brought under Title IX and the New York City Human Rights Law. On 30 October the University notified History Department faculty and graduate students via email that Harris \\"agreed with the university to withdraw from his teaching, advising and other student- related activities\\". It called the allegations in the lawsuit \\"a subject of considerable discussion and concern\\". A representative for the University said Harris remained an employee. In December 2017, two women reported similar incidents with Harris when they were graduate students at Columbia, Jennifer Sheridan Moss, now an associate professor at Wayne State University, in the 1980s; and Jennifer Knust, now a professor at Duke University, in the 1980s. They and four unidentified women have indicated they are willing to testify in the lawsuit brought in October. Moss said she has successfully sought help in preventing Harris from retaliating against her from Roger Bagnall, then a Columbia professor and now professor emeritus at New York University. According to the New York Times, Bagnall said he \\"was aware of Dr. Harris's reputation for pursuing and harassing young women\\". He said: \\"even in the mid-80s, that just wasn't acceptable\\". After Harris had stepped down from his teaching and student-related duties in October 2017, he retired voluntarily on 18 December as part of the settlement in the lawsuit filed in October. Columbia University stated that he would not be granted emeritus status or involved in any University activities. Harris has so far retained his status as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the British Academy.

Recognized by its flattened, purple, cup-like fruitbodies, this widespread fungus typically grows scattered or in clusters on burnt ground. Taxonomy The fungus was first described scientifically in 1897 by Giacomo Bresadola. Description Fruitbodies resemble flattened cups with diameters of up to . The inner spore-bearing surface, the hymenium, is purple to purple-brown, but lightens to brown in age. The exterior surface is pale purple and scurfy (covered with small flakes or scales that are shed from the underlying surface). This species is sessile, and does not have a stipe. The flesh is thin and mauve-colored. Microscopic characteristics Spores are elliptical, hyaline, with small, fine warts on the surface, and have dimensions of 12‚Äì14 x 7‚Äì8 Œºm. They are biguttulate, containing two oil droplets at either end of the spore. The asci are 250‚Äì300 x 10‚Äì12 Œºm. Like other Pezizales, the asci open at maturity by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are club-shaped, filled with violet granules, and have bent tips; they are up to 7 Œºm wide. Edibility The edibility of the Pezizaceae family is largely untested. Habitat and distribution Peziza praetervisa is a widespread fungus that grows in scattered clusters on burned soil, and is often found on the remains of old campfires. It is found in Europe and North America. Similar species Depending on humidity and other environmental factors, P. praetervisa can resemble Peziza violacea, but may be distinguished from the latter by its dark purple hymenium, and microscopically by its biguttulate, warty ascospores. Pachyella babingtonii also has a purple brown hymenium, but is smaller and translucent in appearance.

The synagogue, in mannerist-early Baroque style, was built in 1642.  History  During the Nazi occupation of Poland in 1941, the synagogue was desecrated and then set up as a warehouse. After the end of the war, it remained in use as a warehouse for fertilizers. In 1965, a fire damaged the interiors. The synagogue was thoroughly restored in the late 1970s. The historic wall paintings, most of which are decorative texts of Hebrew prayers, were restored. The elaborate, decorative ceiling was not reconstructed although some idea of the style can be gleaned from the design of the Torah Ark. A former Beit Medrash (study and prayer hall) located across the street has been restored and is in use as a city museum. Although no Jews now live in Tykocin and the town has no other tourist attractions, 40,000 tourists a year come to see the old synagogue, which towers over the remote village \\"in lonely and unexpected splendor\\".

At the invitation of a friend, Utterback joined the design department of Playboy in the mid-sixties.[1] Utterback was asked to illustrate some caricatures for publication after an art director saw a birthday card Utterback had created for a fellow employee.

Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction,Ohio Department of Transportation \\"Update of Abandoned Underground Mine Activities in Ohio\\" and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests. History The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 established a national mine map repository.U.S. Dept. of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration \\"Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act\\" The repository was funded by and assigned to the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines (BOM) in 1970. A repository was set up at a BOM office in Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and covered all states east of the Mississippi River with the exception of Louisiana and Minnesota. These two states, together with Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Missouri, and Kansas, were covered by a separate repository at the BOM Intermountain Field Operation Center in Denver, Colorado. A fourth repository, in Spokane, Washington, held the mining archives for the western states of Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho. In 1982 the responsibility of maintaining the repository and its staff was formally transferred to DOI's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Later, when BOM was dissolved in 1996, all of the maps from the BOM offices were consolidated into the current OSMRE Pittsburgh repository.

The mission of the repository has always been to obtain authoritative maps on past and current mining operations and preserve them on microfilm. Higher priority is given to maps of mines in areas where the potential for adverse impact to the environment is more significant. The NMMR, in addition to being an archival entity concerned with the preservation of mine maps, is also a basic reference file of information on mines. The information is made available to federal and state geological surveys, state mining bureaus, mining companies, oil and gas companies, conservationists, research and planning organizations, water pollution boards, city and industrial planners, highway engineers, building contractors, real estate developers and private citizens. Today the NMMR facility is equipped with modern map scanning and archiving capability to digitize maps.

Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee (December 1, 1998 ‚Äì September 25, 2012), better known as Stump, was a male Sussex Spaniel who won Best In Show at the 2009 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Stump was the first of his breed to win that honor and, at 10 years old, the oldest dog ever to win the prize. He also won the Sporting Group at Westminster in 2004, the first such victory for his breed, and amassed 51 Best in Show awards throughout his career. One of his owners described him as \\"the most famous Sussex (Spaniel) that has ever lived\\". Stump's breeders were Douglas Horn, Douglas Johnson, and Dee Duffy, and he was owned by Cecilia Ruggles and Beth Dowd. He was handled by Scott Sommer, who also trained 2001 Westminster Best in Show winner J.R., a Bichon Frise with whom Stump lived for most of his life. Stump became seriously ill in 2005 with a body-wide bacterial infection, infection on his heart valves, and other ailments often fatal for dogs. He was so sick that euthanasia was considered. Stump spent 19 days in hospitalization, including 12 in intensive care at Texas A&M; University's Small Animal Hospital, and he ultimately survived. It took Stump two years to fully recover from the effects of the illness, and he was retired from competition for four years with no expectation to return. In 2009, Sommer entered Stump in the 133rd Westminster Kennel Dog Show, a last-minute decision made less than a week before the show began. Little was done to prepare Stump for the show, and his owners and trainer had little expectation that he would perform well; Las Vegas odds indicated he had only a 275-to-1 chance to win. Nevertheless, he became a crowd favorite and ultimately won the top prize. Stump retired to Sommer's home in Houston, Texas after the 2009 Westminster show. He died on September 25, 2012, at age 13, as the result of an illness. Several of Stump's descendants have competed in dog shows, including Bean, a crowd favorite who won the Sporting Group in both the 2018 and 2019 Westminster shows. Early life and show career Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee was born December 1, 1998. His sire was Ch. Three D Genghis Khan, also known as \\"Gus\\", and his dam was Ch. Clussexx Sprinkled With Dew, also known as \\"Sprinkle\\". Stump is a descendant of Ch. The Vicar of Lexxfield CD, who won the first Best in Show in the breed and placed fourth in the Sporting Group at the 114th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1990. He was nicknamed \\"Stump\\" because he was brown with stubby legs and a wide, sturdy body that resembled a tree stump. His breeders were Douglas Horn, Douglas Johnson, and Dee Duffy; the \\"Three D\\" portion of his name represents Duffy's kennel, named for the three breeders, and indicates his blood line. Johnson also bred Brady, the Clumber Spaniel who won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Best In Show award in 1996. Stump was owned by Redding, Connecticut resident Cecilia Ruggles and Southern Pines, North Carolina resident Beth Dowd and handled by Scott Sommer of Houston, Texas. Dowd had been showing various breeds of dogs at Westminster since 1999 and was a member of the Moore County Kennel Club in Moore County, North Carolina. In 2003, Stump began living with Sommer in Houston, along with J.R., a Bichon Frise who won the Westminster Dog Show in 2001 and was also trained by Sommer and co-owned by Ruggles. Stump regularly displayed a positive personality; Sommer said \\"I love his temperament and attitude toward life.\\" Dowd described him as \\"the epitome of the standard for his breed\\". On April 5, 2003, Stump won Best in Show at a show sponsored by the Kennel Club of Yorkville, held at Arlington Park in Arlington Heights, Illinois. On July 20, 2003, Stump won Best in Show at the Galveston Kennel Club show in Galveston, Texas, defeating 3,986 other dogs over the course of the three-day event. In August 2003, Stump won Best in Show Reliant Park World Series of Dog Shows in Houston. By 2004, when Stump was five years old, he had amassed 50 Best in Show awards as well as the Sporting Group at the 128th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which was decided by noted dog show judge Judith Goodin. This marked the first time a Sussex Spaniel won that group. Richard Sandomir of The New York Times wrote that Stump's \\"tail wagged constantly (as he) defeated a variety of elegant pointers, field dogs, gun dogs, hunters and retrievers, some with water-repellent coats, others with wire-haired coats\\". According to Brian J. Lowney of The Herald News, audiences and members of the media were \\"dumbfounded\\" by the fact that Stump defeated other better-known and more attractive sporting dogs. Dowd felt Stump deserved to win overall Best in Show at Westminster that year as well, but the prize ultimately went to the Newfoundland Josh. Despite not winning the top prize, Stump attracted national media attention and appeared on the morning television show Good Morning America. On January 15, 2005, Stump won the Sporting Group at the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship, organized by the American Kennel Club at the Tampa Convention Center in Tampa, Florida. Sommer entered Stump in several other Texas dog shows throughout 2005, including the Reliant Park World Series of Dog Shows in Houston in July 2005. Sommer's 16-year-old nephew, Brian, showed Stump in that show, and they won in the junior showmanship category. Serious illness and recovery Stump became seriously ill in 2005, so much so that euthanasia was considered. Stump was initially taken to the Brittmoore Animal Hospital in Houston, but he did not respond to treatment there. In January 2006, he was transferred to Texas A&M; University's Small Animal Hospital for treatment by veterinary specialists. Stump was hospitalized for a total of 19 days, including 12 in the intensive care unit of A&M;'s Small Animal Hospital. He had a body-wide bacterial infection as well as infection on his heart valves, fluid in his lungs, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, a blood coagulation disorder. The conditions were uncommon, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal for dogs. As Sommer explained to the media: \\"His insides stopped working.\\" Stump was treated with antibiotic therapy, heart medications, oxygen, and anticoagulant medications, and ultimately had a full recovery. Katherine Snyder, the medical resident in charge of his case, said: \\"He really pulled through like a champion.\\" The exact cause the illness was never determined. It took Stump about two years to fully recover from the effects of the illness. According to Sommer, Stump spent most of this time sleeping in his handler's bed. Due to the seriousness of Stump's illness, his owners were reluctant to ever show him again, and Sommer vowed to never do so. Westminster's Best in Show After four years of retirement, Sommer entered Stump in the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden on February 10, 2009, and included approximately 2,500 dogs and 170 breeds, from as far away as Russia, Brazil, and at least five other countries. Entering Stump in the competition was a last-minute decision, and Sommer did not enter him in the competition until February 4, 2009, less than one week before the show began. Even after registering Stump, Sommer thought he might not take him, and would decide based on how good he looked in the day or two before the flight to get there. Prior to the 2009 Westminster contest, Stump had not attended another dog show or even worn a leash since his illness. Sommer did little more to prepare him than walking him around his Houston driveway, and said his only goal was for Stump to have a good showing. Beth Dowd said, because Stump's health seemed had improved since his illness, they entered him in Westminster as \\"a trial run for possible competition in an upcoming special show\\". Carol Dowd said they had little expectation he could win: \\"He was just an extra dog entered, and we just planned to have fun.\\" Westminster Judge Sari Brewster Tietjen said of the dog's long absence from the showing scene: \\"To bring a dog into the Garden who hasn't been showing, (Sommer) was a little insane.\\" Stump's co- breeder Dee Duffy had another Sussex spaniel named Ch. Three D Lock and Load that she planned to enter into the competition, but once it was determined Stump would compete, she withdrew his entry, saying: \\"For me that was going to be like competing against yourself. Stump was characterized in the media as a crowd favorite at the 2009 Westminister show; Katie Thomas of The New York Times wrote: \\"Stump was greeted with deafening applause each time he plodded around the ring.\\" Likewise, David Frei, who had been announcing Westminster shows for 20 years, said of him: \\"Stump was a big crowd-pleaser. It's his look. He looks like a pet dog that would be sitting next to you on the couch.\\" However, Las Vegas odds indicated the dog had only a 275-to-1 chance to win Best in Show. Stump won in his breed category, where his son, Ch. Lexxfield Twilight Hunter, was among the competing dogs he defeated. He also won the Sporting Group, where Judge Robert Ennis chose him over 27 other competing dogs. Even after these victories, Sommer did not believe Stump would win the top prize. On February 10, 2009, Stump was named Best in Show, in part because judges felt he had a \\"cheerful and tractable disposition\\" in keeping with the breed's standard. Among the finalists Stump defeated were Spirit, a Giant Schnauzer who was ranked the No. 1 show dog in the nation at the time, and Lincoln, a Griffon Bruxellois who was also widely considered a favorite. Other group winners Stump defeated for the top prize included Yes, a standard poodle with 94 Best in Show wins; Sadie, a Scottish terrier; Tiger Woods, a Scottish deerhound; and Conrad, a Puli. The victory marked Stump's 51st career Best in Show win. Sommer said because the expectations for Stump were so low, there was very little pressure during the competition: \\"This was like going for a walk with my pet.\\" Judge Tietjen, who had been judging for more than 40 years, said she did not decide to crown Stump the victor until the last moment: \\"I didn't know who he was or how old he was. He's just everything that you'd want in the breed, and I couldn't say no to him.\\" Sommer said of Stump's victory: \\"I was more surprised than most people.\\" Stump became the first Sussex Spaniel to win Best in Show, and the oldest dog to ever win the title, a distinction previously held by 1999 winner Kirby, an eight-year-old Papillon. Two other dogs co-owned by Dowd placed in 2009's Westminster show: a Lakeland terrier named Ranger won Best of Breed, and Pixie, a Bichon, took fourth in her group. Stump made appearances on MSNBC and such television programs as Today, The Early Show, The Martha Stewart Show after his victory. Later life and death Unlike the previous Best in Show winner, the Beagle Uno, who spent a full year touring the country after his victory, Stump was expected to return home and do little traveling because of his advanced age and past health problems and he retired to Sommer's home in Houston very shortly after the Best in Show win. However, some travel was planned for Stump representing the Moore County Kennel Club and participating in publicity for the New York-based therapy dog program Angel on a Leash. According to The Wall Street Journal, as of May 2009 Stump had accumulated over 440,000 miles from Continental Airlines frequent flyer program. He was also a representative of Take the Lead, an organization that provides services and support for people in the purebred dog business who have suffered life-threatening or terminal illnesses. He appeared on the cover of May/June 2009 issue of AARP The Magazine and attended Houston's Reliant Park World Series of Dog Shows in July 2009. In February 2010, Stump returned to New York City to participate in a benefit show two days before the start of the 134th Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Stump became ill in September 2012; he stopped eating and required veterinarian visits nearly every day. Sommer said on his final week: \\"He just didn't want to do it anymore, and it wasn't much of a quality of life.\\" Stump was euthanized on September 25, 2012, in Houston with Sommer. He was 13 years old. J.R., the Bichon Frise who won the Westminster Dog Show in 2001, had still been living with Stump and Sommer, and died just six days earlier than Stump. Cecelia Ruggles said of Stump: \\"He's the most famous Sussex (Spaniel) that has ever lived\\". Several descendants of Stump have participated in dog shows as well. Stump sired three pups: two males named Root and Forest, and a female named Myrtle. All three were owned by Carol Dowd, the daughter of Stump's co-owner Beth Dowd. All three of the pups compete in dog shows. Pooh Bear, Stump's great grandson, was owned by Cindy Read of Milwaukee and began participating in shows at age one in 2014, including the Burlington Kennel Club dog show in Burlington, Iowa in August. Stump's grandson GCh. Kamand's Full Of Beans @ Erinhill, better known as \\"Bean\\", won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show's Sporting Group category in both 2018 and 2019. Bean was owned by Karen and Amanda Toner, of Hampden, Massachusetts. His sire, GCh. Erinhill Cpnwy Mr Fuzzywrinkles, was Stump's son. Like Stump, Bean was considered a crowd favorite, and some commentators felt he should have won the overall Best in Show award. In popular culture Stump was the favorite of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the celebrity sex therapist, who witnessed his Best in Show victory at Westminster. Randy Levine, president of the New York Yankees baseball club and a regular Westminster attendee, was also particularly impressed with Stump. During the February 11, 2009 episode of The Colbert Report, Stephen Colbert, whose character often complains when passed over for awards, expressed anger Stump won the Westminster dog show instead of him; Colbert said of the Sussex Spaniel, \\"What does he have that I don't have? Look, my ear is floppy. Look how firm my haunches are! Look how silky my coat is! The secret? I crack a raw egg in my bowl.\\" References External links * MSG.com photos of Stump at the 133rd Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Category:1998 animal births Category:Individual dogs Category:Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show ","title":"Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee"},{"id":"21508524","text":"Clothes-Line was an early BBC television programme broadcast live in six parts between 30 September and 3 December 1937. It is notable for being the first television programme dedicated to the history of fashion.Taylor, Lou, Establishing Dress History, chapter 2 (Manchester 2002) It was produced by Mary Adams, and co-presented by the fashion historian James Laver and Pearl \\"Polly\\" Binder.

Concept Clothes-Line illustrated the development of fashion history through live models in original costumes from C. Willett Cunnington's collection. Laver provided verse commentary on the garments, while Binder drew lightning sketches and illustrations at an easel. After the first episode was broadcast, The Listener commented: \\"we were left wondering quite what it was we had just seen and heard ‚Äî a poetry- reading, a lightning-artist display, a mannequin parade, or what?\\" As they went on to acknowledge, Clothes-Line in fact used features of all three to create a new type of television programme. Controversies Pregnancy In addition to being the first television programme to deal with fashion history, Clothes-Line may well have been the first television programme to feature a heavily pregnant woman. Binder had been pregnant with her first child when discussions for the programme first began, and a conscious decision was made to have her as a presenter. As she got closer to her due date, and had to stand further back from her easel, the noticeability of Binder's condition caused consternation amongst the BBC. Binder's daughter Josephine was not born until 6 January 1938, almost a month after the last episode aired on 9 December 1937. Nudity The last show episode, Grandmamma Looks Back, aired on 9 December 1937 and a fashionable backless evening dress worn by Micheline Patton, the actress playing the granddaughter to Nesta Sawyer's grandmother, was the cause of an accusations of public nudity due to the filming angle from behind. Binder recollected in her diary that outraged viewers wrote in to complain. Repeats (Clothes Through The Centuries) The first series was, as with so many early BBC programmes, broadcast live. The controversy of the final episode notwithstanding, it was so well received that it was decided to repeat the programme in early 1938. Laver, Binder, Adams, Patton and Sawyer all returned to reprise their roles for the second (revised) version, which consisted of three parts, and was renamed Clothes Through The Centuries. The episode titles were: * Episode 1.

An islet lies east of the island.  Geography  The island is an outcropping of rocks as a continuation of the Cuchilla Grande, in an area of the Atlantic Ocean immediately at the mouth (outer limit) of the estuary of R√≠o de la Plata. Administratively, it falls under the jurisdiction of the province of Maldonado, although it constitutes a natural reserve. Somewhat to the northwest is the smaller Gorriti Island which is the secondmost southerly place in Uruguay. Isla de Lobos was exploited economically until 1992. Hunting the island's marine life was prohibited by law in 1991. Today it constitutes a nature reserve that is integrated into the \\"Coastal Islands National Park\\" administered by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries.  History  It was first documented by Spanish navigator Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s in 1516 and named \\"San Sebastian de C√°diz\\". In 1527, it was visited by the Venetian navigator Sebastian Cabot during his expedition to the R√≠o de la Plata and Paran√°. In 1528, Diego Garc√≠a de Moguer sailed to the region and named it the \\"Island of the Snapper.\\" In 1599, the island was visited by Laurens Bicker.Journal of dagregister on line Lighthouse In 1858 the Uruguayan government erected a lighthouse on the island, which was rebuilt in 1906. With its height of 59 meters above sea level, From the balcony outside, which is accessed by 240 steps, there is a wonderful panoramic view of the island and the coast of Punta del Este. In July 2001, it became the first automated lighthouse in Uruguay, using solar energy and other new technology. It has a siren that runs on compressed air to provide an alternative signal on days of thick fog.  Animals  Isla de Lobos and Gorriti Island are parts of a nature reserve, holding the largest colony of South American sea lions and South American fur seals in the western hemisphere: in 2005 there were 250,000 sea lions of the species called \\"two hairs\\" and 1,500 of the species known as the \\"wig.\\" Fewer in numbers, southern elephant seals also appear around the area.Seis orcas se pasean por las aguas de Punta del Este Punta del Este is one of the most famous wintering area for southern right whales in Uruguay and shore-based whale watching is becoming a popular attraction.Gigantes D.T.. 2016.

The album is sometimes referred to as Bananamoon and it was also reissued as a Gong album. The album features Allen's former Soft Machine bandmate Robert Wyatt on drums and Archie Legget on bass, along with numerous guests including Gary Wright from Spooky Tooth, Maggie Bell from Stone the Crows and Gilli Smyth & Christian Tritsch from Gong. Guest drummer Pip Pyle would go on to join Gong soon after this recording. Some of the musicians on the album would subsequently contribute to Kevin Ayers' 1973 album Bananamour. The song \\"Memories\\", sung by Wyatt, was initially demoed in 1967 by Soft Machine (with Allen on guitar) and later covered by Material on their 1982 album One Down, with a lead vocal by a young Whitney Houston. \\"Stoned Innocent Frankenstein\\" was re-recorded in 1977 by Allen in collaboration with Here and Now as Planet Gong on their Floating Anarchy Live 1977 album. The original French release featured Didier L√©on's painting on both the front and back of the gatefold cover, with notes and drawings by Daevid Allen on the inside surrounding a photo of the band. A BYG Actuel reissue, also from 1971, credits the album to Gong and has the band photo as the front cover. The first UK pressing, in 1975 on Virgin subsidiary Caroline Records, had an alternative cover drawn by Daevid Allen, featuring a peeled banana/moon playing a guitar.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . Presentation Hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2, or Clouston syndrome (referred to as HED2 throughout this entry) is characterized by partial or total alopecia, dystrophy of the nails, hyperpigmentation of the skin (especially over the joints), and clubbing of the fingers. Sparse scalp hair and dysplastic nails are seen early in life. In infancy, scalp hair is wiry, brittle, patchy, and pale; progressive hair loss may lead to total alopecia by puberty. The nails may be milky white in early childhood; they gradually become dystrophic, thick, and distally separated from the nail bed. Palmoplantar keratoderma may develop during childhood and increases in severity with age. The clinical manifestations are highly variable even within the same family. Genetics HED2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals with HED2 have an affected parent; de novo gene mutations have also been reported. Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and being affected. Diagnosis HED2 is suspected after infancy on the basis of physical features in most affected individuals. GJB6 is the only gene known to be associated with HED2. Targeted mutation analysis for the four most common GJB6 mutations is available on a clinical basis and detects mutations in approximately 100% of affected individuals. Sequence analysis is also available on a clinical basis for those in whom none of the four known mutations is identified. Screening Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation in an affected family member is known; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as HED2 are not common. Treatment Treatment of manifestations: special hair care products to help manage dry and sparse hair; wigs; artificial nails; emollients to relieve palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.

Background Philip Sheedy, an architect, was involved in a road traffic accident in March 1996 at the Glenview Roundabout, Tallaght Bypass, County Dublin which resulted in the death of Anne Ryan. It transpired that Sheedy, who was driving a high performance sports car that he had purchased the previous day, was intoxicated. Sheedy plead guilty to causing death by dangerous driving before Judge Cyril Kelly (as he was then) in Dublin Circuit Criminal Court in October 1997 and also admitted to driving with excess alcohol. On the day of sentencing Judge Joseph Mathews was asked by Judge Kelly to step-in and sentence Sheedy. Judge Matthews imposed a four-year sentence on Sheedy with leave to apply for a review of the sentence after two years (20 October 1999), as well as banning him from driving for twelve years. On 6 November 1997 Judge Mathews granted an application on Sheedy's behalf to vacate the order which set 20 October 1999 as the review date of Sheedy's sentence. Sheedy, after initially being incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison, was moved to Shelton Abbey, an open prison, after six months' imprisonment. There he was visited by his friend Joe Burke, a former Fianna F√°il councillor and a member of the so-called \\"Drumcondra Mafia\\", who had loaned the then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern 3,500 Irish pounds as part of the \\"dig outs\\" Ahern received around the time of his marriage break-up. Burke, who worked as a building contractor, had employed Sheedy as an architectural advisor to his company J&H; Burke and Son. In July 1998 the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern contacted then minister for justice John O'Donoghue to ask him whether it would be possible for Philip Sheedy to get day release. Initially, Ahern had vehemently denied that he concealed his representations to the Department of Justice on behalf of Philip Sheedy. Sentence review and release Supreme Court judge Hugh O'Flaherty intervened on Sheedy's behalf after an \\"entirely by chance\\" encounter between the judge, who was walking his dog, and the son of a neighbour Ken Anderson and Anderson's girlfriend, who was Philip Sheedy's sister, in October 1998. After the encounter, Dublin County Registrar Michael Quinlan was called to Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's chambers to have Sheedy's case re-listed. On 12 November 1998, after O'Flaherty's intervention, Sheedy's sentence was reviewed before Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly, and not Judge Matthews, as would be the correct procedure. After the brief hearing Mr. Justice Kelly remitted what was left of Sheedy's sentence. Neither the garda√≠ nor the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) were told of the review or the fact that Sheedy was released. The only representation by the state was the appearance of a clerk in the Chief State Solicitor's office who saw a listing for the matter and brought the file to court but did not know for what purpose. Fallout High Court challenge The DPP brought a High Court challenge to Mr. Justice Kelly's decision to release Sheedy in February 1999. Prior to the case being heard Sheedy had voluntarily returned to prison. Hamilton Report On the basis of the DPP's High Court challenge John O'Donoghue, then Minister for Justice asked Chief Justice Liam Hamilton to investigate the affair. The Chief Justice's report was published 16 April 1999. In it, Chief Justice Hamilton stated that Mr. Justice Kelly's handling of the matter and Mr. Justice O'Flaherty's intervention compromised the administration of justice. Resignations The first person to resign was Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty. In his report, Chief Justice Hamilton was critical of O'Flaherty whose actions he deemed to be \\"open to misinterpretation.\\" Initially, O'Flaherty refused to resign, and instead wrote to the Chairman of the Oireachtas's Justice, Equality and Women's Affairs Committee asking to make a statement to the committee as soon as possible, however, the next day he resigned from the Supreme Court. On 20 April, Mr. Justice Cyril Kelly and Michael Quinlan, the Dublin County Registrar, resigned their positions. O'Flaherty appointment to EIB After his resignation Hugh O'Flaherty was nominated by Charlie McCreevy, then Minister for Finance, to be Ireland's representative to the European Investment Bank (EIB), taking the position of vice-president. This appointment resulted in a massive public outcry. The appointment was eventually withdrawn by the government.

It is primitively eusocial, not showing the same bias in brood care seen in other social insects with greater asymmetry in relatedness. The species employees a variety of colony founding strategies, sometimes with single founders and sometimes in groups of variable number. The queen does not use physical dominance to control workers; there is evidence of pheromones being used to suppress other female workers from overtaking queenship. Taxonomy and phylogeny R. marginata was originally described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793 under the name Vespa' ferruginea, but that name was previously applied to a different species, so the oldest available name for the species was given by Am√©d√©e Louis Michel le Peletier in 1836. One of its subspecies, R. marginata jocund from New Guinea and Australia, was described in 1898, and two others, R. marginata rufitarsis from Myanmar and R. marginata sundaica from Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula, were described in 1941. R. marginata is an insect, having six legs. It is in the order Hymenoptera, containing wasps, ants and bees. It is in the family Vespidae, with wasps, yellow jackets, and hornets. It is in the subfamily Polistinae, containing eusocial wasps and it is in the tribe Ropalidiini. On the Indian subcontinent, there are 22 recognized species of the genus Ropalidia. The species R. travancorica, once thought separate, was determined synonymous with R. marginata after intensive specimen comparisons in 1989. R. marginata is most closely related to R. spatulata and R. brevita. The male antenna and genitalia are similar between R. brevita and R. marginata. Description R. marginata are a dark reddish color (slightly lighter than Ropalidia revolutionalis), with yellow spots on some joints and a yellow ring around the lower abdomen. Males differ from females by having a weaker mandible and lacking a stinger. The female workers are not morphologically different from the queen and are more distinguishable by behavior. Females Females are hard to distinguish morphologically except for their level of ovary development, which generally increases with their age. Females are the default workers of R. marginata, but they may also rise to queenship by taking over a resident queen, founding a new colony, or adopting an abandoned one. = Workers = Female workers forage to feed themselves and non-foragers, such as the queen, larvae, and males. They help to build the nest and care for the larvae. Workers may mate with males and remain inseminated even if they are never able to attain queenship and produce offspring. Worker-worker relatedness is not asymmetrically higher than relatedness between workers and males or workers and the queen. This is because of overlapping matrilines and patrilines within the colony which decreases relatedness overall between individuals. = Potential queens = When a queen is lost, a worker has the ability to take her place. The mechanism by which the next-in-line-queen is chosen is cryptic; neither age nor dominance accurately predicts the successor. The potential queen may or may not be inseminated or have developed ovaries. The only certainty is that after the queen is gone, the worker who is the potential queen will become very aggressive. The aggressiveness subsides after about two days. The potential queen seems to require this heightened aggression in order to boost her own development. = Queens = Primitively eusocial societies are typically headed by behaviourally aggressive queens, who use aggression to suppress worker reproduction. However, the queen in R. marginata is a \\"docile sitter\\" who does not use physical aggression to maintain her reproductive monopoly in the colony. The queens are suspected to control workers through pheromones. She uses these pheromones to signal her presence and fecundity to her workers, who perceive these signals and refrain from reproducing. The tenure length, age, and productivity of a queen vary greatly on a case by case basis. The exact mechanisms by which the queen is recognized by her colony are not fully understood. One possibility is that there are chemicals in the queen's Dufour's glands that signal her queen status and influence workers who are on the nest with those chemicals. A potential queen who is acting aggressively can be experimentally subdued by applying the old queen's Dufour's gland's chemicals to the nest. The queen interacts with her workers primarily through chemical communication; physical interactions between the queen and workers do not serve a communicative function. She does not regulate worker behaviors such as foraging and nest matienance. Males Males are produced less frequently and in less quantity than females are produced. After eclosion males remain on the nest for up to a week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give them an opportunity to do so in natural populations. Nests R. marginata makes gymnodomous nests with up to 500 cells and up to 10 pedicels. The nests are made of paper, which are produced by wasps masticating cellulose and mixing it with saliva. The nests are usually found in closed spaces with small openings in natural and man-made structures. Nest of Ropalidia marginata Distribution The distribution of R. marginata extends as far west as Pakistan and as far east as New Guinea, Queensland, and some eastern Pacific islands. They are the most common social wasp in India. Although R. marginata has been studied extensively in India, there is a lack of literature about the animal in other parts of its range. Colony cycle In India, Ropalidia marginata has an aseasonal, indeterminate and perennial colony cycle, which means that nest initiation starts throughout the year, and nests are active throughout the year.Chandrashekara, K., Bhagavan, S., Chandran, S., Nair, P., and Gadagkar, R. (1990). Perennial indeterminate colony cycle in a primitively eusocial wasp, In: Social Insects and the Environment: Proceedings of the 11th International Congress of IUSSI, Bangalore, Ed. G. K. Veeresh, B. Mallik, and C. A. Viraktamath, p. 81. New Delhi: Oxford & IBH Publ. Co. Colonies are started more frequently from May to July when food is abundant and less frequently from December to February when temperatures are colder. Each colony has one reproductive female, a queen, and that position can be taken by adopting an abandoned nest, taking over queenship at an existing nest, or starting a new nest alone or with other foundresses. Brood development The amount of time it takes for a brood to fully develop is highly variable and is complicated by occurrences of nest cannibalism, which is often undetected as replacement eggs appear. Males leave the nest 2‚Äì7 days after eclosion. Tenure on the nest for a worker female is more variable. Their residence time ranges from 1‚Äì60 days. Foundress variation Colonies can be started by as many as 20 foundresses, but most frequently they are started with four or less. Studies on wild and captive populations indicate that it is most common for colonies to start with three or more foundresses, rather than two foundresses; single foundress colonies are the least common. Although the multiple foundress colonies were less likely to fail, all colonies, regardless of number of foundresses, had the same per capita productivity. Only one individual acts as an egg layer in each colony. *Single Foundress colonies :If there is only a single foundress, she will work alone to build the nest and care for larva until they reach adulthood. The adult offspring will help her rear future broods. Single-foundresses produce much less offspring, average of two, than the queen of a multiple-foundress colony, and in many cases a single foundress colony fails before any of the brood reach adulthood. *Multiple Foundress colonies :Of the females in multiple foundress colonies, only one takes the role of queen and is the sole egg layer. The others work on the nest and care for the brood. Multiple foundress colonies do not have a greater per capita production rate but do have greater productivity overall compared to single-foundress colonies. It is suspected that competing interests of taking care of the queen's brood (indirect fitness) and seeking queenship and the chance to reproduce (individual fitness) prevent the efficiency that would lead to higher productivity in multi-foundress groups. Colonies with more than one founder are more likely to survive overall, which may be why individuals migrate into them more frequently than starting single-foundress colonies, even when the chances of taking over the role of queen are lower. Switching colonies Individuals may migrate from their birth or founded colony to take up residence in another. This is most common during the pre-emergence phase and when there are around forty to fifty adults on the home nest. Migrant wasps are more likely to be accepted while they are younger, which is generally less than six days old. Age has been shown to be the determining factor for whether the resident wasps react with hostility or tolerance. Age might be an indicator of ovarian development (reproductive threat) or of other important qualities such as plasticity for role specialization. Multiple- foundress colonies are preferentially selected by migrant wasps, despite the fact that individuals are more successful at becoming a queen in a single- foundress colony. Young migrants become fully integrated into the new colony, becoming foragers and sometimes taking over the role of queen. Colony adoption In some cases, all adult wasps will be absent from a nest when a migrant finds it. Females sometimes adopt these abandoned nests and take over queenship in variable numbers of foundresses. This has been observed to be more common in predator-protected vespiaries than in the field. Behavior Larval feeding Females feed larvae by masticating acquired solid food for three to four minutes before feeding it to the larvae. She feeds about two larvae the solid food and then grooms herself. Then she feeds six larvae with a liquid of regurgitated food and grooms herself again. Females also engage in behaviors such as fanning wings, antennal drumming, and body jerks which are sometimes synchronous between many females. These behaviors are expected to be related to adult/larval communication. Female feeding behavior is more complicated than that of males, who do not use liquid food or this set of behaviors. = Male feeding behavior = Males have been experimentally shown to be capable of deliberately delivering food to larvae when females are absent and food surplus is available. Males feed the larvae with the same proportion of individuals as females. They are, however much less efficient than females at feeding. They spend over 90% of feeding bouts masticating and end up feeding far fewer larvae. The males also preferentially feed the largest larvae, resulting in the death of many smaller and younger larvae. It was only possible to observe this behavior by removing all females from a nest and hand feeding the males, as the males cannot forage on their own and have no opportunity to care for larvae if females occupy this role. While males are typically not responsible for feeding larvae in naturally occurring populations, they are capable of doing so. Aggression Aggression in the form of chasing and sometimes stinging is needed to defend the nests from predators and non-nestmates. Older females from different nests are chased away, as are predators such as Vespa tropica. Dominance relationships, mediated by aggression, control foraging amidst workers. Aggressive behavior is a crucial part of the transition from worker to queen. Dominance Behaviorally dominant queens are standard among other primitively eusocial wasps, but in R. marginata, it is the workers who engage in subordinate- dominant behavior. Among the workers, the dominance hierarchy does not relate to reproductive competition or accurately predict individuals to take over queenship. Worker dominant-subordinate interactions seem to regulate foraging behavior. This is supported by the fact that dominance is received more by foragers and that frequency of received dominance correlates with foraging rate. It has been experimentally shown that dominance frequency is related with hunger of the colony, suggesting that dominance interactions are a system of peer regulation to support the survival of the colony. Recognition Nestmates act tolerantly towards their fellow nestmates, which can still be recognized after days of isolation. Ropalidia marginata can distinguish nestmates from nonnestmates, and react aggressively to nonnestmates that are older, while younger foreigners may be accepted into the colony. Discriminating nestmates from non-nestmates is dependent on acquiring and encountering odors from the nest post-eclosion. Individuals removed from a nest before eclosion will not recognize, or be recognized by, members of that nest. There is no indication that there is any recognition based on genetic relatedness. Foraging These predatory wasps are solitary foragers (that means each forager finds the prey, kills it and brings that back to the nest all alone). Foragers typically forage within about 300 to 700 m from their nests, though if food is scarce, they can travel up to about 1.5 km from their nest. With experience, they acquire a vivid familiarity with their foraging range; they perhaps remember the sites from where they have collected food previously. Such familiarity with the foraging landscape eventually helps them to reduce their search for food. Mating system The haplodiploid genetic system creates asymmetry in relatedness of most Hymenoptera species. R. marginata, however, have increasingly unrelated workers and broods because of \\"simultaneous production of several different patrilines and matrilines within a colony.\\" Serial polygyny works against the inclusive fitness benefits workers have of caring for broods because of reduced relatedness. Gadagkar devised a unified model that makes predictions about what proportion of the population of R. marginata \\"should opt for a selfish solitary nesting strategy and what proportion should opt for an altruistic worker strategy\\" (853). From this, he was able to predict that 5% should opt for the selfish solitary nesting strategy while 95% should opt for the altruistic worker strategy. Gadagkar et al. genotyped R. marginata mothers and daughters at a \\"few non- specific esterase loci\\" to infer the genotypes of the haploid fathers or estimate the number of fathers needed to produce the daughters observed (850). The researchers ultimately found, \\"R. marginata queens mate with 1‚Äì3 different males and the average relatedness among their daughters thus drops from the theoretically expected 0.75 to about 0.50, thus entirely negating the advantage of haplodiploidy for social evolution, as predicted by Hamilton\\" (851). Gadagkar \\"found no evidence for intra-colony kin recognition\\" (851). Mate choice To avoid inbreeding, most taxa recognize kin and do not consider them in mate selection. R. marginata however show no indication of discriminating against nestmates for mate choice in both males and females. Because males disperse and live nomadically after leaving the nest and breeding does not occur on the nest, inbreeding is relatively unlikely in this species even without the anti-incest behavior. Body size is arbitrary in mate choice for both males and females of this species. Serial polygyny Colonies of R. marginata often outlive the queens; workers may serve different queens throughout their lifetimes. This creates overlapping matrilines within the colony where workers end up caring for the brood of different mothers, yet again decreasing the relatedness amidst workers.Gadagkar et al. Serial polygyny in the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata: implications for the evolution of sociality. Predation Vespa tropica, a hornet species, is a key predator of R. marginata brood in Indian populations. As a predator avoidance strategy, nests are often built to only be accessible through small openings, thus, preventing hornets from getting through.  References   Other sources  * Das, B.

They were an important family from Lesser Poland (Ma≈Çopolska), active in Polish politics of their time. Family's history and importance According to a legend, the family traced its origins to the 12th century magnate, Sieciech, krzeszowice or even to some older individuals, rumored to be powerful \\"princes\\" before Mieszko I created the Polish state. Tƒôczy≈Ñscy h. Top√≥r - genealogia rodziny, herbarz According to historians, the first verifiable member of the Tƒôczy≈Ñski family was Naw√≥j z Morawicy (d. 1331), castellan of Krak√≥w, who laid the foundations of his family greatness. Tƒôczy≈Ñscy, PWN Encyklopedia They used the Top√≥r coat of arms. His son Andrzej Tƒôczy≈Ñski (d. 1369), voivode of Krak√≥w, begun the construction of the family's castle, continued by his descendants. Jan Tƒôczy≈Ñski (d. 1405), starost and castellan of Krak√≥w, was also one of the most important advisers to the first King of Poland of the Jagiellon dynasty, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. Jan Tƒôczy≈Ñski (d. 1470), castellan of Krak√≥w, voivode of Krak√≥w and Lublin, was recognized as one of the two most important Polish magnates of his time (the other one was cardinal Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki. Andrzej Tƒôczy≈Ñski (d. 1536), castellan of Krak√≥w, voivode of Krak√≥w, Lublin and Sandomierz, in 1527 received a hereditary title of a count from the Holy Roman Emperor. The family had numerous possessions, most of them in the Lesser Poland, Krak√≥w Voivodeship (including a large latifundia near Krak√≥w). Its members often held the posts of castellan of Krak√≥w and voivode of Krak√≥w. The family, recognized during the 14th to mid-17th centuries as one of the most important in Lesser Poland, lost influence after the death of its last male member, Jan Magnus Tƒôczy≈Ñski in 1637. The family seat was the Tenczyn Castle (also known as Tƒôczyn Castle), now a ruin in the village of Rudno. The castle would fall in ruin after being pillaged by the Swedes, looking for rumored treasures of the Tƒôczy≈Ñski family, during The Deluge in the mid-17th century. Subsequently, rebuilt, after a fire in mid-18th century it was never rebuilt again.

Rebuilt in 1866 in a style similar to the Saxon building it replaced, it is the parish church of Keymer and now lies within a combined parish serving three villages in Mid Sussex. The church bears a very rare dedication to the twin Saints Cosmas and Damian, Christian martyrs of the 4th century. It is a grade II listed building. History The medieval manor of Keymer was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as being held by William de Watevile for William de Warenne, who built the nearby Lewes Castle. A church existed on the present site at that time; it was associated with Lewes Priory, which had been given it by a successor of de Watevile in 1093. The present building incorporates some 12th-century structural elements: the chancel walls and apse date from that time. Until the rebuilding in 1866, there had been little change to the structure since the 14th century. The reconstruction was undertaken by Brighton-based architect Edmund Scott, who was responsible for several churches in his home town; he matched the church's largely 14th-century style rather than redesigning the building significantly. Six bells were added at various times: one in 1791, another in 1866 and a peal of four in 1911. Hassocks Burial GroundGarden of Remembrance The church has a large graveyard with several war graves and a war memorial. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission identifies five soldiers‚Äîthree from the First World War and two from the Second World War‚Äîwho are buried there. There is no longer enough space for burials to take place in the original churchyard, so a new burial ground has been established in a field opposite the church. Mid Sussex District Council acquired the land on behalf of the Parish of Keymer and Clayton, and transferred ownership to Hassocks Parish Council. The latter now manages the area, which is called the Hassocks Burial Ground and Garden of Remembrance. The patron of the church, and holder of the advowson, is Brasenose College, Oxford. Dedication The dedication of the church, to the twin Saints Cosmas and Damian, is extremely rare in the Church of England. Only three other extant churches in England bear their names: at Challock in Kent; Blean, two miles to the north of Canterbury, Kent; and Sherrington in Wiltshire. A redundant church with the same name exists near Leominster in Herefordshire. The saints are believed to have been twin brothers who worked as doctors in the Roman province of Syria. They were well-educated in science and medicine, and treated people without expecting any payment. They were known to have been put to death in 303 during the Diocletianic Persecution. Architecture The church walls are built of flint in an irregular style reminiscent of crazy paving. There is a small tower and steeple topped with a small, two-stage spire at the southwest corner. The plan consists of a chancel with Norman-era apse, nave, aisles, and a porch at the south end. The south aisle was built in the 1866 reconstruction, but its counterpart on the north side was added in 1890. The ancient stone dressings in the east window were preserved during the rebuilding. The remains of what may be an original piscina, which lacks its basin, is in the apse. The church today Although the churches at Clayton and Keymer have been connected since their founding, the parishes were not officially united until 25 July 1978 by means of an Order in Council. St Cosmas and Damian Church is now one of three churches in this parish, which includes the 11th-century, Grade I-listed St John the Baptist's Church‚ÄîClayton's parish church‚Äîand St Francis of Assisi's Church in Hassocks, built in 1975. The parish covers the three villages and the surrounding rural area; its eastern boundary follows the border between West Sussex and East Sussex. English Heritage granted the church Grade II listed status on 21 June 2007. There are two Sunday services most weeks (the first Sunday of the month has no early-morning service). Other services take place on Wednesdays and alternate Saturdays. The church is always open during daylight hours. The area around the church was designated a Conservation Area in January 1989. Mid Sussex District Council, which was responsible for granting this status, stated that \\"the church [being] sited on higher land which can be seen from all approaches\\" was one of the character-giving features of the area, which covers the old central area of Keymer village.

Family Tunku Naquiyuddin is married to the Perlis-born Tunku Puan Muda Tunku Dato' Seri Nur ul-Hayati binti Tunku Dato' Bahadur. They have two sons and two daughters: * Tunku Mohamed Alauddin bin Tunku Naquiyuddin (born 9 February 1978). * Tunku Alia Nadira binti Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1980). * Tunku Nadia Sahiya binti Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1982). * Tunku Khair ul-Zaim bin Tunku Naquiyuddin (born in 1985). Bypassed to the Throne On 29 December 2008, The Council of Undang proclaimed Tunku Muhriz as the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Almarhum Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman who had died on 27 December 2008. This decision was made following intense discussions among the four Undangs. At least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed Tunku Muhriz's candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Jaafar's eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Naquiyuddin also had two younger brothers. Together with Tunku Muhriz, these four princes were the main heirs to the throne when Tuanku Jaafar died. However, Tuanku Jaafar had replaced his elder brother whose son, Tunku Muhriz, at the time was barely out of his teens. Tunku Muhriz was considered too young to replace his father and the throne was given to his uncle Tuanku Jaafar. Due to a lifelong habit of keeping a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan compared to Tunku Naquiyuddin, who was very media friendly. However, Tuanku Muhriz established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state a few years ago. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the then serving former Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad among his supporters. Known for his charitable activities, Tunku Naquiyuddin was also a keen sportsman and a top corporate figure popular with the public, making him an ideal candidate to be the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan. However, he was ultimately bypassed when the four Undangs, or territorial chiefs, of the state chose his cousin Tuanku Muhriz to ascend to the throne.

The commune covers an area of 211 square kilometers and includes ten villages.. In the 2009 census it had a population of 6,701. The village of N'Tjila, the administrative center (chef-lieu) of the commune, is 94 km west-northwest of Sikasso. History The name Wateni was given to the commune by a meeting of the eleven village chiefs in memory of the founder of the historical kingdom of Ganadougou: Wateni Diallo (pronounced waat-e-nay djia-low) The rural commune Wateni was created on November 4, 1996 by law No 96-059, for the creation of communes in Mali.Plan Quinquennal de Developpement Economique Social et Culturel de la Commune Rurale de Wateni, 2011-2015, Republique du Mali, December 2010. Geography The Rural Commune Wateni is located North-West of Niena. The commune is bordered in the north by the commune of Benkadi and in the south and south-east by the rural commune of Niena, and in the north-east by the commune of Blendio, and in the west by the cercle of Bougouni. The commune is composed of ten villages: N'tjilla (commune capital), Bougoulaba, Tiala, M'pankourou, Fougani, Diegui, Miambougou, Mononomo, Sibirila, and Chokoro. Map of the Rural Commune as posted in the CSCOM in N'tjilla. The capitol of the commune, N'tjilla, is located 7 km off Route 7 from Bamako to Zegoua. N'tjilla is 23 km from Niena, 98 km from Sikasso (the capital of the Sikasso region or cercle), and 295 km from Bamako, the national capital. The commune covers an area of 200 square kilometers. It is situated in the Sahel WITH two main seasons: dry season (from the end of October to the end of April) and rainy season (from May through the beginning of October). The annual rain fall varies between 800 and 1500 mm. Demography As of a 2009 Census, the commune has a population of 6,701. The population consists of 3352 men and 3349 women. In 1998, it had a population of 5,152, which is a rate of 2.4% growth per annum. The population is composed of a majority of Fulani and Bambara ethnic groups who co-habitate peacefully. They are farmers and animal breeders. Social situation The social structure is dominated by a traditional chief, or dugutigi. Beneath the village chief, each village has various cultural associations divided by gender and age group. In addition to village associations, there are youth associations, women's associations, and development associations. Although Bambara language is the official language in the commune, the primary language is Gana, named after the kingdom of Ganadougou. The illiteracy rate is very high. Stories, history, and legends are transmitted orally between generations. The caste responsible for keeping the oral tradition alive is called the griot. Traditional musical instruments are often played at parties and holidays: balafon, boli, kamale n'goni and guida. The commune contains several tourist sites: Djinemini, belekeli, kokoni, sacred forests, and the resting place of Ganadougou's founding father Wateni Diallo. Civil society CMDT (Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpement du Textile) has created a Village Associations in every village in the commune. These groups are charged with growing, harvesting, and selling cotton to CMDT. Former citizens of the Commune Wateni have an association called the \\"Association des Ressoritissants de Wateni\\" (ARW) which is located in Bamako. Economy The principal economic activities in the Commune are agriculture, fishing, bee-keeping, gardening, and small business. The main crops are: dry cereals (millet, sorghum, rice, and corn) and revenue generating crops (cotton, peanuts, and beans). Animal breeding is the second largest activity after agriculture. Animals bred in the commune include cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry. The cattle are traded as close as Niena and Koumantou and as far away as Bamako and C√¥te d'Ivoire. There is a local market for crafts, including pottery, cloth, and leather work. These products are not of a quality that can be traded much outside of the commune. Fishing in the area is often done by Bozo people from neighboring regions who come to fish in the river Bogoe and sell their products in neighboring Niena. The commune Wateni has two weekly markets: N'tjilla has a market every Wednesday and Bougoulaa has a market every Saturday. The roads in the commune, except for the road connecting N'tjilla to Dougoukolobougou on the main paved road, are poorly maintained trails which are insufficient for transport in large vehicles. The lines of communication between the villages are also poor due to erratic cell phone coverage. The road between N'tjilla and Dougoukolobougou is the only road that is passable during all seasons without difficulty. This 7 km road was leveled, widened, and had drainage installed in 2004. Religion Although Islam is the dominant religion, there are also Christians and Animists present. References External links *.

She attended college for medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women. From 1907 to 1912, Maud studied forensic medicine and pathology, graduating with a Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1912, and a Master of Science degree in 1920. In addition to those degrees, she also completed a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1914, and began working in the medical field short after. She held positions in general practice such as being a house surgeon, where she worked for Sir Harold Stiles, another surgeon. Maud obtained a three year long scholarship in 1923 called the William Gissane Research Scholarship, allowing her to travel to orthopaedic clinics in the United States and Europe, and even translate medical journals to English so that they would be of use to many more individuals. Once back in England, Sir Harold Stiles recognized Maud's skills and offered her a job as resident surgeon at the Bath and Wessex Orthopaedic hospital in 1925. Her efforts while working at this hospital lead it to become widely known by improving its reputation in Orthopaedics. She began publishing medical journals as early as 1920. In her published work called \\"Results of Operations for Nerve Injury at the Edinburgh War Hospital,\\" she wrote about surgeries she had completed and the results of the studies. One of the studies were tendon transplants, which she said had a 99% success rate in terms of restoring function to the damaged limb. In 1921, she chose to become part of the British Orthopaedic Association, which was established for orthopaedic surgeons who resided in Britain. After 16 years, she was appointed Secretary of the same organization. With her experience, she established children's hospitals in three different counties in England. She noticed the areas that were being neglected within the medical field and focused her research on those specialties, such as defects and deformities that were not being resolved until the children were older and stronger. She trained her own staff for the clinics and taught them her unique individual skills, which made her clinic stand out from the existing clinics of the time. To improve deformities of children, she convinced the schools to implement better seating and desks, and even collaborated with a shoe company to make shoes better fitted for the spine. This was also designed to prevent the deformities before they arose. In 1931, the Annual Meeting for the British Medical Association was held, which Maud was a member of for over 50 years, and she was appointed Secretary. Seven years later, in 1938, the association decided to appoint her vice-president of the Orthopaedics section. From 1948-1949, she was a member of the Executive Committee within the British Orthopaedics Association. She retired at the age of 65 in 1951, and ten years later was given the title of Emeritus Fellow, which allowed her to retain the title she held before retirement. Even in retirement, she still visited hospitals and clinics, and continued to do research and publish her results.

Piers was also known for his assistance to other authors. In 1893 he edited Mary Jane Katzmann's Akins Prize-winning History of the Townships of Dartmouth, Preston and Lawrencetown, Halifax County, N.S. posthumously for publication.\\"Lois K. Kernaghan, \\"Katzmann, Mary Jane (Lawson)\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, Web, May 5, 2011. History and fiction writer Thomas Raddall received crucial encouragement and assistance from Piers who became Raddall's mentor for historical research.Thomas Raddall, In My Time McClellend and Steward (1976 ), p. 116 Harry Piers (centre) conducting field work with a Mi'kmaw family Piers worked with precision and diligence for many years as virtually a one-man-museum for Nova Scotia. His obituary in the Halifax Chronicle Herald noted, \\"Many called him a 'human book of knowledge'. His tall stately figure was familiar in the community life of Halifax and he played a prominent role in numerous activities in the City and Province.\\".Halifax Chronicle Herald January 24, 1940 Piers' museum work was multi-disciplinary, collecting artifacts and specimens for human and natural history. His collection documentation set high standards of research and description that were ahead of their time and stand out today as instructive examples of museum work. A Parks Canada historian in recent times lauded him as a \\"renaissance man of this province's cultural history. It matters not where the modern researcher penetrates ‚Äî history, archaeology, material culture, geology, botany ‚Äî it is almost certain that you will find his footprint of decades ago. At a time when nobody else cared, he and his museum did, and between them they preserved and recorded much that would otherwise have vanished utterly.\\"William D.

It is most commonly used at Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, although occasionally seen at other tracks as well, such as Dover International Speedway and Watkins Glen International. Coining the phrase Typical three-wide pack at Daytona International Speedway in 2015. 252x252px Until the 2000s, massive crashes were referred to as \\"major\\"ESPN SpeedWorld ‚Äì 1989 Winston 500, May 7, 1989,CBS Sports ‚Äì 1992 Daytona 500, February 16, 1992,NASCAR on ABC- 1998 DieHard 500 telecast, 4/26/98 or \\"terrific\\"ESPN SpeedWorld ‚Äì 1994 Pepsi 400, July 7, 1990, crashes. By the mid-1990s, competitors and media began taking note of the multi-car wrecks at Daytona and Talladega. In 1997, Dale Earnhardt described a final-lap crash at the 1997 Pepsi 400 as \\"the Big Wreck\\". News articles began using the term \\"Big Wreck\\" to describe such crashes in 1998, and by 1999, its use was widespread. Drivers began to openly admit they were apprehensive of its possibility. One of the first times the term \\"The Big One\\" was used on-air was during the Winston 500 on ESPN October 11, 1998. Commentator Bob Jenkins said during the crash on lap 134 \\"This is the big one that we had hoped we would not have.\\" One of the first published instances of the term \\"The Big One,\\" was an April 18, 2000, article on ESPN.com about a crash in the DieHard 500. The term was also being used informally by fans on message boards. During the 2001 Daytona 500, Fox commentator Darrell Waltrip used the term on-air to describe an 18-car crash in the backstretch on lap 173, as saying \\"It's the big one, gang, it's the big one. It's what we've all been fearing in this kind of racing is going to happen.\\" By 2001, the phrase was widely used by competitors, fans, and in print and broadcast media. It soon became standard NASCAR vernacular, and it became a retronym to describe past such accidents as well. The Big One has been the subject of criticism of NASCAR. Some have complained that the sanctioning body, promoters and media have celebrated the crashes. By 2009, Talladega Superspeedway marketed itself on the notorious crashes, with a one-third-pound frankfurter sold at the track called \\"The Big One\\". The video game NASCAR 14 has an achievement called The Big One which can be obtained by getting involved in a crash at Talladega Superspeedway. Examples NASCAR Cup Series *2001 Daytona 500: On the back straightaway on lap 173, fifth-place Robby Gordon got into the back of fourth- place Ward Burton, turning Burton left into third-place Tony Stewart's right rear. Stewart's car went straight into the wall, catching air, landing on its side on top of Gordon's car, and tumbling across the track while getting hit by other cars. The car briefly landed on top of Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Bobby Labonte before falling onto the track and rolling to a stop in the infield grass. Burton's and Stewart's cars blocked the track, starting a chain reaction crash that collected 18 cars in total, including Burton, Stewart, Labonte, Gordon, Rusty Wallace, Steve Park, Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Jerry Nadeau, Jason Leffler, Elliott Sadler, John Andretti, Jeff Burton, Andy Houston, Jeff Gordon, Kenny Wallace, Buckshot Jones, and Dale Jarrett. This crash, however, was later overshadowed by Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash on the last lap. Incidentally, Earnhardt had narrowly escaped being caught up in the lap 173 crash, nearly being hit by the spinning Ward Burton. *2002 Daytona 500: Second-place Kevin Harvick attempted to block the advancing Jeff Gordon going into turn one on lap 149, resulting in the two making contact and Harvick being spun down to the apron. Harvick slid up the track, hit the wall, and slid back down the track, collecting an additional 17 cars (18 in total). Matt Kenseth, Ricky Rudd, Ken Schrader, John Andretti, Kenny Wallace, Casey Atwood, Johnny Benson Jr., Bobby Labonte, Jeremy Mayfield, Joe Nemechek, Mike Wallace, Jimmie Johnson, Bobby Hamilton, Todd Bodine, Dave Blaney, Jerry Nadeau, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (his third incident in the race). Eventual race winner Ward Burton barely made it to the inside of the spinning Harvick to avoid the crash. *2002 Aaron's 499: On lap 164, Jimmie Johnson shuffled Kyle Petty out of line in turn 1. Coming on to the backstretch, Petty found a spot in line, but the whole field stacked up behind him, causing Mike Wallace to force Tony Stewart against the outside wall, collecting 24 cars: Steve Park, Rusty Wallace, Mike Skinner, Terry Labonte, Mark Martin, Casey Atwood, Bill Elliott; Johnny Benson, Jr.; Matt Kenseth, Bobby Labonte, Jeremy Mayfield, Elliott Sadler, Kevin Harvick, Robby Gordon, Ricky Craven, Jimmy Spencer, John Andretti, Steve Grissom, Bobby Hamilton, Dave Blaney, Geoff Bodine and Ricky Rudd. Sadler took the biggest hit in the wreck by slamming the corner of the inside wall on the right side, while Benson had to be pulled out of his car after it caught fire on pit road. However, all of the drivers involved escaped injury. * 2002 Pepsi 400 : On lap 134, Dale Jarrett blocked Jeff Burton below the yellow line. Burton tried to come back up before the turn but clipped Jarrett, Collecting Brett Bodine, Mike Skinner, Jeremy Mayfield, Bobby Labonte, Joe Nemechek, Steve Park, Matt Kenseth, Terry Labonte, Ricky Rudd, Jimmie Johnson, Geoff Bodine, and Kyle Petty. Nemechek hit the outside wall hard and Brett Bodine caught on fire *2003 Aaron's 499: On lap 4, entering turn one, Ryan Newman blew a tire, bounced off Mark Martin, and smashed hard into the turn one wall, almost turning over. One of Newman's tires came off as he spun back down the track, and the tire bounced off Ricky Rudd's hood, causing it to bounce over the catch fence and land in a restricted access area outside the track. Mayhem ensued as cars checked up behind attempting to avoid Newman, who spun across the middle of the track, resulting the largest recorded wreck in modern Cup Series competition. The crash collected a total of 27 cars: Newman, Rudd, Jack Sprague, Jerry Nadeau, Hermie Sadler, Mike Wallace, Steve Park, Rusty Wallace, Mike Skinner, Mark Martin, Jimmy Spencer, Johnny Benson Jr., Greg Biffle, Matt Kenseth, Bobby Labonte, Tony Stewart, Jeff Green, Casey Mears, Jamie McMurray, John Andretti, Kyle Petty, Ken Schrader, Todd Bodine, Dave Blaney, Dale Jarrett, Jeff Burton, and eventual race winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., who received minor front-end damage. *2005 Aaron's 499: On lap 132, Mike Wallace, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. got together at the pit road exit in the tri oval, forcing Scott Riggs and Wallace to careen into the wall hard, and collecting 28 other cars (31 in all): Kyle Busch, Dave Blaney, Mark Martin, Kurt Busch, Ryan Newman, Matt Kenseth, Bobby Labonte, Tony Stewart, Rusty Wallace, Ricky Rudd, Bobby Labonte, Kasey Kahne, Mike Bliss, Brian Vickers, Scott Wimmer, Bobby Hamilton, Jr., Sterling Marlin, Jeff Green, Jason Leffler, Boris Said, Casey Mears, Joe Nemechek and Carl Edwards. Fox studio analyst Jeff Hammond estimated the total damage at $8 million. The race was halted for about 43 minutes for extensive cleanup. *2012 Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500: On lap 189, the last lap of a green-white-checker restart following Jamie McMurray's spin with five laps to go, Tony Stewart tried to block the advancing draft of Michael Waltrip and Casey Mears in turn four. As Stewart moved down to block Waltrip, he was passed on the outside by Matt Kenseth (the only car ahead of the crash; would go on to win the race). Stewart came across the front of Waltrip's car, turned sideways, and spun up into the pack, collecting 24 other cars (25 in all): Waltrip, Mears, Kevin Harvick, Marcos Ambrose, Sam Hornish Jr., Aric Almirola, Jimmie Johnson, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Paul Menard, Clint Bowyer, David Ragan, Regan Smith, Dave Blaney, Jeff Burton, Kasey Kahne, Brad Keselowski, Bobby Labonte, Martin Truex Jr., David Gilliland, Terry Labonte, Travis Kvapil, and Denny Hamlin. Stewart's car went upside down and landed on top of Kahne, Menard, and Bowyer before flipping back over and coming to rest at the exit of turn four. Most of the cars were caught in the initial pileup; however, five cars (Keselowski, Truex, Bobby Labonte, Travis Kvapil and Gilliland) were swept up as the others cars began the spin down into the infield and another (Hamlin) spun out by himself and sustained front-end damage. Jeff Gordon and Kyle Busch, who were running the bottom in 16th and 19th when the accident started, avoided it entirely and finished 2nd and 3rd. Greg Biffle and Ryan Newman avoided the wreck at the back of the pack to take top-ten finishes. Following this crash, Earnhardt, Jr., who had taken a few hard hits in the crash, was diagnosed with a concussion, requiring him to sit out the next two races (Charlotte and Kansas). He was replaced by Regan Smith at both of them. *2014 Sprint Unlimited: On lap 36, going through the tri-oval, Matt Kenseth attempted to move to the inside to carry his momentum around the slightly slower car of Brad Keselowski; however, he didn't have enough room and was turned by Joey Logano. As Kenseth came back up the track, he collected Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Kurt Busch and Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.. Stewart and Gordon ended up pinned against the wall, with Busch's front end under Gordon's car and Stenhouse's front end under Busch's car. Danica Patrick spun out while trying to miss both the larger crash and the spinning car of Edwards, but she did not hit anything. As her car came to a stop, she was t-boned by the accelerating Stenhouse, who couldn't see because of front-end damage and was trying to make it back to the garage. Kevin Harvick was also involved in the crash, but his damage was only from running through debris. *2014 Budweiser Duels: Coming through turn four on the final lap of the second duel, Jimmie Johnson ran out of gas, got loose after being tapped in the left corner panel, overcorrected and hit the wall, collecting Jamie McMurray in the process. Martin Truex, Jr. had no way to avoid the wreck and rear-ended McMurray. While slowing to avoid the wreck, Clint Bowyer got rear-ended by Ryan Truex, and slid to the runoff area taking David Ragan with him. Bowyer flipped over in the air and landed on all four wheels with the only damage being a destroyed drive-train. Ragan and Michael Waltrip were also caught in the wreck and both hit the inside wall head-on. Carl Edwards was caught by McMurray, but sustained minimal damage. McMurray made contact with Johnson again as they continued on into the grass, destroying the front ends of their cars. *2014 Coke Zero 400: **On lap 20, coming out of turn 4, Stenhouse and Johnson got loose and came down the track. Johnson then made contact with Tony Stewart who then turned up and clipped Stenhouse. The ensuing incident collected an additional 12 cars, 15 in total. **On lap 98, coming down the backstretch on a restart, Greg Biffle bumps into Kasey Kahne off-center, sending him squirly into Joey Logano who then spins up the track, collecting Biffle. At the same time the contact with Joey sent Kahne spinning back up the track, blocking the entire field which was still compact from the initial restart. As a result a total of 26 cars, a track record, piled up heading into turn 3. The wreck ended with a slow roll over by Kyle Busch after Cole Whitt hit him on the track banking. *2015 Coke Zero 400: **On lap 3, David Gilliland tried to drop in behind Dale Earnhardt, Jr. on the inside line, failing to see Clint Bowyer, and got turned around by Bowyer, and ten cars piled in, including Michael Annett, Greg Biffle, Sam Hornish, Jr., Bobby Labonte, reigning Daytona 500 winner Joey Logano, and Danica Patrick. **On lap 105, Matt Kenseth got loose in front of Kasey Kahne out of turn 4. Kenseth's car then washed up the track, collecting nine additional cars: those of Aric Almirola, Kyle Larson, Martin Truex, Jr., Jamie McMurray, Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Sam Hornish, Jr., David Ragan and Trevor Bayne. **On lap 161, the final lap of a green-white-checker finish, second place Denny Hamlin got tapped by Kevin Harvick, spinning him in front of the 27-car lead pack as they crossed the finish line. Hamlin drifted back up into traffic and was hit by Austin Dillon, causing Dillon's car to fly over two other rows of cars, flip, and hit the catch fence. The crash collected 25 cars, with the only uninvolved cars from the lead pack being race winner Dale Earnhardt, Jr., second place Jimmie Johnson, and fifth place Kurt Busch. Twenty-four cars from the lead pack, as well as the trailing car of Brad Keselowski, were swept up in the melee. The crash occurred after the cars crossed the finish line, as Hamlin finished third and Harvick fourth, while Dillon finished seventh. *2016 GEICO 500: The race was marred by four Big Ones. **On lap 96, Austin Dillon got turned into the outside wall by the car of David Gilliland, and in the ensuing check-up Jimmie Johnson spun out, and Chris Buescher flipped several times down the backstretch. Also involved were Jamie McMurray, Carl Edwards, and Michael Annett. **On lap 161, Kurt Busch attempted to give Johnson a push going into turn 1, which sent Johnson into the outside wall and back into traffic, collecting an additional twenty cars. Greg Biffle, Kyle Larson, Dillon (his second crash of the afternoon, as was Johnson's), Ryan Blaney, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman. **On lap 181, Michael McDowell bumped into Danica Patrick, sending her into Matt Kenseth, sending Kenseth into the air and into the inside wall before he flipped back over. While this took place, McDowell slid up into the outside, catching Aric Almirola, sending him spinning down into Joey Logano. All told, this crash caught 12 cars, many of whom had some damage already from the lap 161 crash. **On the last lap, headed through the tri-oval, when Landon Cassill hooked Cole Whitt into Kevin Harvick, sending Harvick into the outside wall and into Ricky Stenhouse Jr., putting Harvick on his side before landing back on four wheels. Also collected were Martin Truex Jr. and A. J. Allmendinger as Brad Keselowski crossed the line to take the win. All told, 35 of the 40 cars received some damage on the day, and the first car a lap down at the end of the race was Johnson, who finished 6 laps behind in 22nd. *2016 AAA 400 Drive for Autism: On a restart on lap 354, race leader Jimmie Johnson was unable to get his car into third gear and was rear ended by Martin Truex, Jr., stacking up the field behind him. A total of 18 cars were collected in the wreck. In addition to Johnson and Truex, Jr., Kevin Harvick, Jamie McMurray, Ryan Newman, A. J. Allmendinger, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr., Kyle Busch, Aric Almirola, Denny Hamlin, Greg Biffle, Casey Mears, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Clint Bowyer, Trevor Bayne, Paul Menard, and Michael McDowell were involved. *2017 Daytona 500: **On lap 129, Jimmie Johnson went from the outside lane to block Trevor Bayne on the inside, as a result, Johnson was spun around, provoking a 17-car melee that involved drivers like Denny Hamlin, Clint Bowyer, Chris Buescher, Danica Patrick, Parker Kligerman, among many others. **On lap 143, after Chase Elliott almost went around in front of the field, Jamie McMurray was turned around, detonating an 11 car crash that involved drivers like Brad Keselowski, Jeffrey Earnhardt, Ryan Newman, Daniel Su√°rez, Landon Cassill and Ty Dillon. *2017 GEICO 500: **On Lap 169, as A. J. Allmendinger tried to bump draft Chase Elliott down the backstretch, Allmendinger inadvertently rammed into Elliott, and both cars went airborne off Turn 2, turning the 47 of Allmendinger over (after contact from Joey Logano), and collected an additional 15 cars including Erik Jones, Trevor Bayne, Austin Dillon, Matt Kenseth, and Danica Patrick. Others in the wreck, including Brad Keselowski, were able to beat the five-minute crash clock to rally and finish 7th in the race. The race was red- flagged while crews extricated Allmendinger from his car. *2017 Coke Zero 400 **On lap 71, Kyle Busch, plagued by a flat tire, spun in front of the outside lane of the pack. The crash collected 10 cars, which included Austin Dillon, Joey Logano, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Larson, Kurt Busch, Paul Menard and Danica Patrick. *2017 Alabama 500: **On Lap 171, entering turn 3, Martin Truex, Jr. tried to go four wide and clipped David Ragan, causing Ragan to spin into Kurt Busch and Jimmie Johnson and collect an additional 16 cars including Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick, Matt Kenseth, Austin Dillon, Landon Cassill, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Matt DiBenedetto, Danica Patrick, Ty Dillon, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Brendan Gaughan, and Michael McDowell. Denny Hamlin and race winner Brad Keselowski were among a few lucky drivers to drive through the crash unscathed. Earnhardt Jr. spun into the infield grass at the start of the crash, but avoided contact with other cars and was able to recover to finish 7th in his final restrictor plate start. This resulted in a lengthy red flag for cleanup. *2018 Daytona 500: The race was marred by 3 big ones **On Lap 60 coming to the end of stage one, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was clipped by Ryan Blaney, although Stenhouse was able to regain control, Erik Jones got loose behind him and spun around, collecting 9 cars in total including William Byron, Ty Dillon, Jimmie Johnson, Martin Truex Jr., Kyle Larson, and Daniel Su√°rez. **On lap 103, Brad Keselowski and Chase Elliott made slight contact, sending Elliott into the wall spinning wildly collecting 7 cars in total, including Danica Patrick (in her final race in NASCAR), Kevin Harvick, Kasey Kahne, David Ragan and Martin Truex Jr. **On lap 199, Kurt Busch was unable to block Ryan Blaney from passing him, resulting in Busch spinning and collecting 10 additional cars, which included Matt DiBenedetto, Martin Truex Jr., Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Brendan Gaughan, Alex Bowman, Jeffrey Earnhardt, Ryan Newman, A.J. Allmendinger, Darrell Wallace Jr., and Joey Logano. *2018 GEICO 500: **On lap 165, Jimmie Johnson attempted to duck down into a line of cars, that resulted in Johnson getting into William Byron, they both spun and collected 13 additional cars including Austin Dillon, Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski, Ryan Blaney, Clint Bowyer, Kyle Busch, Michael McDowell, Paul Menard, Brendan Gaughan, Darrell Wallace Jr., Cole Whitt and Kasey Kahne. *2018 Coke Zero Sugar 400: **On Lap 54, on the backstretch, William Byron blocked Brad Keselowski, causing him to slow. Ricky Stenhouse Jr., however, failed to do the same, ramming into Keselowski's bumper and sending him into the outside wall, setting off a 26 car melee. This was one of two big wrecks set off by Ricky Stenhouse, who would later have to be escorted by security after the race for protection due to the negative backlash. **On lap 65, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. attempted to side draft Kyle Busch, resulting in Stenhouse Jr. clipping Busch and shooting his car up into the wall, collecting 7 cars in total including William Byron, Trevor Bayne, Jamie McMurray, Erik Jones (who went on to win), and Corey LaJoie. **On lap 163, as Martin Truex Jr. was coming to take the white flag, Clint Bowyer was turned by Darrell \\"Bubba\\" Wallace, causing 10 other cars to crash behind him including Kevin Harvick, Matt DiBenedetto, Jimmie Johnson, Ray Black Jr., Ryan Newman, Ross Chastain, Trevor Bayne, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Brendan Gaughan, and Alex Bowman. *2018 Bank of America Roval 400 **On a restart, Brad Keselowski went too hard into Turn 1, collecting William Byron, Paul Menard, Kyle Larson and Kyle Busch. Busch went up the track and Daniel Hemric was hit. Hemric spun and collected Trevor Bayne, Ty Dillon, Aric Almirola, Darrell Wallace, Jr, Michael McDowell, Ryan Blaney, who would win, Ryan Newman and Ross Chastain. *2019 Advance Auto Parts Clash: **On lap 55, Jimmie Johnson attempted to pass Paul Menard for the lead entering turn 3. However, the two drivers made contact and Menard spun out across the track, triggering a massive 16-car wreck that also involved Kyle Busch, Martin Truex, Jr., Brad Keselowski, Kyle Larson, Jamie McMurray, Ryan Newman, Daniel Suarez, Denny Hamlin, Clint Bowyer, Kevin Harvick, Erik Jones, Chase Elliott, Aric Almirola, and Austin Dillon. Shortly after the wreck, the race was called short due to rain, and Johnson was declared the winner.https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/02/10/menard-johnson-set-off- massive-wreck-in-clash-battling-for-the-lead/W *2019 Daytona 500 **On lap 190, Paul Menard and Matt DiBenedetto got tangled up and caused a 21-car crash which involved the likes of defending Cup Series champion Joey Logano, Martin Truex, Jr., Jimmie Johnson and Chase Elliott, among others. *2019 Coke Zero Sugar 400: **Threatening weather became an issue late in the race as the race had become official on Lap 101. Upon the ensuing start of the third stage, drafting packs had become intense was lightning was moving into the area at a fast clip. Austin Dillon and Clint Bowyer were involved in a spirited battle, and as Dillon passed Bowyer on lap 119, he moved down in an attempt to get back in a draft line. It failed, and 15 other cars were involved in the crash, involving the entire Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota team, the two remaining Team Penske Fords, two Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolets, among other works teams. In the ensuing caution, teams pitted for fuel, and in some instances, tires, in anticipation of an attempted restart, knowing that it would be their last pit stop as cars could reach the scheduled distance of 160 laps. Kurt Busch took the lead, but he and Landon Cassill among others pitted when NASCAR officials gave the one to go signal as it was given on Lap 127, just before the safety truck reached the pit commit line. As the cars reached the backstretch on Lap 128, the safety truck turned on its lights aborting the restart after lightning was detected within the 13 km radius of the venue, a rule used in most sport to cause an event to be suspended, and the field, with Justin Haley leading, was sent back to pit lane. The race was never restarted as a step of lightning was detected again inside the radius just as the 30-minute clock had expired and drivers had entered their cars, then more rain struck the circuit, and was ended prematurely. With no countback rule in NASCAR when a race ends because of a red flag used in the FIA Code that reverts scoring back to the last fully completed lap, Haley was declared the winner. *2020 Daytona 500: With 17 laps to go, Joey Logano attempted to push Aric Almirola forward down the backstretch into Brad Keselowski. Keselowski lost control of his car upon contact, and a 19-car wreck ensued that also involved Martin Truex, Jr., Bubba Wallace, Alex Bowman, Tyler Reddick, Matt DiBenedetto, Ross Chastain, Austin Dillon, Kurt Busch, Justin Haley, Ryan Blaney, Ty Dillon, Chris Buescher, Brendan Gaughan, John Hunter Nemechek, and Jimmie Johnson, who was racing in his last Daytona 500. Kyle Busch also dropped out at that point, but he was not part of the wreck; his engine died. This wreck brought out the first of two red flags not caused by rain and was overshadowed by Ryan Newman‚Äôs fiery crash on the final lap of the race. Xfinity Series * 1999 Touchstone Energy 300: On lap 68, a massive melee involving 23 cars erupted in turn one. It started when Kelly Denton rammed into Ken Schrader, spinning Schrader four times before his car burst into flames. The other 22 cars who were trying to evade Schrader got into a huge pile-up when Mike Dillon blew a tire. *2002 Aaron's 312 at Talladega: On lap 14, the largest crash in modern NASCAR history (1972‚Äìpresent) took place at the exit of turn two, with 31 cars being involved. Three cars (Stacy Compton, Jason Keller and Kenny Wallace) had cleared pole-sitter Johnny Sauter as the field started down the back- straightaway. Scott Riggs (fourth on the outside) tried to pass Wallace on the outside, but checked up, causing Shane Hmiel to get in the back of him. Subsequently, Kevin Grubb bumped Hmiel, causing both Riggs and Hmiel to turn sideways down the track and hit the right-rear of Sauter and the right-front of Joe Nemechek, respectively. The impact from Riggs' car caused Sauter's car to turn sideways and flip twice in the middle of the track, thus blocking the track and causing a massive pile-up behind. The drivers involved were Riggs, Hmiel, Sauter, Nemechek, Jack Sprague, Jimmy Kitchens, Randy Lajoie, Kerry Earnhardt, Tony Raines, Bobby Hamilton, Jr., Ashton Lewis, Mike McLaughlin, Lyndon Amick, Greg Biffle, Jamie McMurray, Scott Wimmer, Ron Hornaday, Jr., Shane Hall, Tim Sauter, Jay Sauter, Michael Waltrip, Joe Ruttman, Jimmy Spencer, Mike Wallace, Mike Harmon, Jeff Fuller and Coy Gibbs. At the time of the crash, 41 of the 43 cars were on the track. Of those, only Compton, Keller and Wallace (who were in front of the crash), and C. W. Smith, Hank Parker, Jr., Casey Mears, Andy Kirby, Tim Fedewa, Larry Gunselman and Chad Chaffin (all of whom either got slowed down in time to miss the crash or had lost the lead draft altogether and were elsewhere on the track) made it through without damage. This crash brought out a 40-minute red flag and caused one minor injury to Mike Harmon (required stitches for biting through his tongue). *2008 Aaron's 312: On lap 70, Kevin Lepage had returned to the track following a pit stop and merged onto the track right in front of the field. A few of the lead cars went around Lepage on the outside, but Carl Edwards ran over the back end of Lepage's car, causing Edwards to catch air and set off a 15-car pile up. The drivers involved were Lepage, Edwards, Kyle Busch, David Reutimann, Reed Sorenson, Brad Keselowski, Cale Gale, Patrick Carpentier, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace, Steve Wallace, Marcos Ambrose, Stephen Leicht, Kyle Krisiloff and Kelly Bires. *2012 DRIVE4COPD 300: In turn 4 on the last lap, leader Kurt Busch attempted to block the two two-car drafts of Joey Logano and Trevor Bayne, and Tony Stewart and Elliott Sadler, both of whom had runs on Busch and drafting partner Kyle Busch. They all made contact, with Kurt Busch ending up sideways against the outside wall, Stewart and Sadler being pinned to the wall by Bayne, and Logano being sent spinning across the track as a result of left- rear contact with Kurt Busch's sideways car. Kyle Busch and Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. both moved to the bottom of the track, but Stenhouse turned Busch into the outside wall as they tried to miss the spinning Logano. A similar fate befell Kasey Kahne and Cole Whitt (who were just behind Busch and Stenhouse), with Kahne moving down into and spinning Whitt. Brad Keselowski, who was behind Whitt, received contact from Kahne and Whitt, causing his car to become out of control. James Buescher, who was 11th when the crash started, got through the crash on the track apron and slipped around Keselowski (as he was trying to regain control of his car) to win, followed by Sadler and Keselowski. *2013 DRIVE4COPD 300: In the trioval, coming to the checkered flag on lap 120, leader Regan Smith was turned into the outside wall by second-place Brad Keselowski. Chaos ensued behind as 14 out of the 15 lead cars crashed in total. After hitting Smith, Keselowski himself was turned around by Sam Hornish, Jr. and went up the track in front of Kyle Larson, with Larson being turned sideways after he was hit in the back by Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. Larson pushed Keselowski's car right-side first into the wall just as two cars (Brian Scott and Justin Allgaier) from behind this crash impacted the right side Larson's car after they had hit the spinning Regan Smith, causing Larson's car to go airborne and fly up into the catchfence. The front tires and the engine of his car were torn out and landed on the spectator side of the fence as part the fence was torn down by the impact of Larson's car. Simultaneously, Elliott Sadler impacted Regan Smith's spinning car, almost causing it to go airborne as well. Also, past the start-finish line, Alex Bowman spun through the infield and across the track, making hard contact with the outside wall. After Bowman hit the wall, Earnhardt Jr. drove under him, jacking the rear of Bowman's car up in the air (very similar to Kyle Busch's crash in the 2009 Coke Zero 400 when Kasey Kahne drove under him). The drivers involved were Smith, Keselowski, Earnhardt, Hornish, Larson, Scott, Bowman, Sadler, Allgaier, Travis Pastrana, Parker Kligerman, Eric McClure, Robert Richardson, Jr. and Nelson Piquet, Jr.. Race winner Tony Stewart cut down through the infield and back up on the track to escape the melee. 28 spectators were injured, 14 of whom were treated at the infield care center and 14 of whom were taken to nearby hospitals, including seven taken to Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach, six more being taken to Halifax Health Medical Center in Port Orange, and one being taken to another area hospital. Six of those spectators sustained serious injuries. * 2018 PowerShares QQQ 300: Lap 122: During a NASCAR overtime, on the back straightaway of one of the five overtimes that occurred during the race, Aric Almirola was turned into the outside wall by second-place Kyle Larson, triggering a massive 18 car melee that collected big names including Justin Allgaier, Joey Logano and Brandon Jones. The race was eventually had a photo finish in the fifth overtime, between Elliott Sadler and Tyler Reddick. *2018 Coca-Cola Firecracker 250: On lap 83, in the middle of three wide racing, Austin Cindric attempted to move down and block Matt Tifft, resulting in Tifft spinning Cindric into the front of the field and soon barrel rolling after making contact with Tyler Reddick, collecting 17 cars in total including Daniel Hemric, Tyler Reddick, Joey Gase, Jeremy Clements, Alex Labb√©, David Starr, Chad Finchum, Brandon Jones, Ryan Reed, Ray Black Jr., and Garrett Smithley. *2019 Circle K Firecracker 250: ** On lap 74, amidst a battle going on mid- pack, Scott Lagasse Jr. was turned by Brandon Brown, Lagasse bounced off of the wall and collected 9 other cars, which included Chad Finchum, Shane Lee, Chris Cockrum, David Starr, Sheldon Creed, Christopher Bell, and B. J. McLeod. ** On lap 88, Michael Annett was clipped and turned into the wall by Christopher Bell, this caused the field to stack up and 15 cars were collected in the crash, which included Joe Graf Jr., Josh Williams, Timmy Hill, Noah Gragson, A. J. Allmendinger, Austin Cindric, Cole Custer, Chad Finchum, Caesar Bacarella and more. IndyCar Series * 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship: On lap 11, Wade Cunningham clipped James Hinchcliffe and then made contact with J.R. Hildebrand, initiating a 15-vehicle collision that killed Dan Wheldon and seriously injured Hildebrand, Pippa Mann, and Will Power. Wheldon was racing at when he was trying to avoid the collision, but his car went airborne about after running into Charlie Kimball and hit the catch fence cockpit first before landing back on the racing surface and coming to a stop near the SAFER barrier. * 2017 Rainguard Water Sealers 600: After a series of incidents with both the INDYCAR (part of the race was run on one day, then the other half a few months later) and NASCAR (rain and weepers) in 2016, Texas Motor Speedway officials repaved and reconfigured the circuit to reduce weeper issues. On lap 152, Tony Kanaan made contact with James Hinchcliffe, triggering a major collision that forced seven other drivers to leave the race. During the ensuing red flag that followed, INDYCAR officials and Bridgestone engineers agreed to use competition cautions and mandatory tire changes for the remainder of the race in response to continuing issues with blistering tires from the repaved circuit. Kanaan was assessed a 20-second hold penalty for his role in the crash.

She is best known for the interior portraits she made of her twelve successive homes in S√∂dermalm, where she spent most of her life. She also did a series of interiors from churches and retirement homes for women.  Biography  Sj√∂berg was born in Stockholm, Sweden. She came from a family in the upper ranks of the bourgeoisie. Her mother, (1771-1831), was an actor and singer who spent most of her time reading. Her father, Nils Sj√∂berg. was a Chancellor at the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration (Krigskollegium), although he may have been musically talented as well.Olson, Stina: Hem ljuva hem. En ogift kvinnas bost√§der p√• S√∂dermalm i Stockholm √•ren 1847 - 1874 (2000) Johanna died when Josabeth was eighteen and Nils followed two years later, leaving her without a means of support. As a result her older brother, Nils, who was a Master Builder's apprentice, became her guardian. They shared an apartment with a widow until she got married, then Josabeth lived by herself. At that time, it was common for young women of that social stratum to receive music and drawing lessons. It would appear that she was otherwise self-taught. Living very frugally and moving frequently, she was able to support herself doing occasional illustrations for the publisher, (1827‚Äì 1909), and giving music lessons for the guitar and piano. She may also have worked as a governess. An inheritance in the 1860s did little to change her lifestyle, although a change in her painting style indicates that she may have used some of the money for drawing lessons. Little is known of her social life, although it is assumed that she kept in touch with her two sisters, Sophia and Emilia, and her childhood friends. Ferdinand Tollin (1807-1865), an artist who was a family friend, may have been the one who suggested that she take up painting. One of her nieces recalls the visits of \\"Mamsell\\" Sj√∂berg (as she was known) and remembers her as always wearing a large black hat and carrying a box of watercolors. It was said that she was also quite clumsy and was generally in poor health. One of her watercolors shows her receiving medical attention from Doctor (1818-1888) for what was likely a breast tumor. Shortly before her death in Stockholm during 1882, she had become so ill that she was moved to a combination poorhouse and nursing home known as ' on Kungsholmen. After her death, her paintings passed to the family of a friend, apparently per her will. By the 1930s, they had become dispersed, but they were collected by the Stockholm City Museum in 1936 and have been displayed several times in art exhibitions, including the 700-year jubilee of the city of Stockholm.

According to Karl Marx, labour process refers to the process whereby labour is materialized or objectified in use values. Labour is here an interaction between the person who works and the natural world such that elements of the latter are consciously altered in a purposive manner. Hence, the elements of labour process are three-fold: first, the work itself, a purposive productive activity; second the object(s) on which that work is performed; and third, the instruments which facilitate the process of work.Bottomore, Tom. (1991) A Dictionary of Marxist Thought.Blackwell Publishers: Massachusetts The land (economically speaking this also includes water) in its original state in which it supplies man with necessaries or means of subsistence ready to hand is available without any effort on his part as the universal material for human labour. All those things which labour merely separates from immediate connection with their environment are object of labour spontaneously provided by nature, such as fish caught and separated from their natural element, namely water, timber felled in virgin forests and ores extracted from their veins. If on the other hand the object of labour has so to speak been filtered through previous labour, we call it raw material; for example, ore already extracted and ready for washing. All raw material is an object of labour, but not every object of labour is raw material; the object of labour counts as raw material only when it has already undergone some alteration by means of labour. According to Marx: The labour process is purposeful activity aimed at the production of use values. The labour process is sometimes loosely termed \\"work organisation\\". That which is produced can either be useful in supporting human existence and so have a use value or it can be traded and attain an exchange value. The latter value presupposes the former. As a consequence of humans wanting to improve their material condition, a surplus is generated in the labour processes; that is, an enhancement of the value between inputs and outputs. Labour processes exist in all societies, capitalist or socialist, and it is argued that the organisation and control of a labour process is indicative of the type of society within which it exists.Michie, Jonathan. (2001) Encyclopedia of Social Sciences Volume II. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers: London The labour process theory critiques scientific management as authored by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the early 1900s and uses central concepts developed by Harry Braverman in the 1970s. Recent attempts have been made to use labor process theory to explain workers' bargaining power under contemporary global capitalism. The labour process theory has developed into a broader set of interventions and texts linked to critiquing new forms of management strategy of an exploitative nature.Braverman, Harry. (1974) Labor and Monopoly Capital. Free Press: New York In Labor and Monopoly Capital: Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century, Braverman seeks to retrieve and update Marx's critiques of the capitalist labour process through an attack upon bourgeois accounts of work in the industrial society. Although Braverman's primary focus is the degradation of work in the twentieth century, which he associates with the relentless tightening of management control, Labor and Monopoly Capital also contains at least two other loosely related elements: an outline of developments in the wider organization of monopoly capitalist societies, and an examination of changes in their occupational and class structures.Knights, David. and Willmott, Hugh. (1990) Labour Process Theory. Macmillan press limited: London Braverman was an industrial worker for most of his life in the United States during the height of Fordist labour management and production techniques in manufacturing. In Labour and Monopoly Capital, he examines his own experiences through a Marxist perspective, drawing attention to the very small processes of work that were ignored by Marxists for much of the 20th century. His studies coincided with the autonomist Marxist theory in Italy which paid similar attention to the factory floor. The labour process theory looks at how people work, who controls their work, what skills they use in work and how they are paid for work. Braverman posits a very broad thesis, namely that under capitalism management steals workers skills, reduces the pleasurable nature of work and the power workers have through controlling skill while cutting their wages by reducing their wages to those of unskilled workers and increasing the amount of exertion required from workers. Braverman primarily pays attention to the class-in-itself or the working class as the subject of management and capitalist brutality, acknowledging his inability to attend to working class self-emancipation in this context. Following in Braverman's footsteps, others have criticised his deskilling thesis as not universal and have attended to working class resistance to the imposition of Fordism. A key element of the labour process theory is an analysis of the local systems of management and control and an examination of how these are used to reduce the power of sections of the working class who hold work skills that are not reproducible by unskilled labour or machine power.

The ship was initially assigned to the Home Fleet, although she was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935‚Äì36. Crescent was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in late 1936 and renamed HMCS Fraser. She was stationed on the west coast of Canada until the beginning of World War II when she was transferred to the Atlantic coast for convoy escort duties. The ship was transferred to the United Kingdom (UK) in May 1940 and helped to evacuate refugees from France upon her arrival in early June. Fraser was sunk on 25 June 1940 in a collision with the anti-aircraft cruiser while returning from one such mission. Design and construction Crescent displaced at standard load and at deep load.

Crescent collided with her sister at Chatham on 21 July and was under repair until 27 August. Crescent was refitted at Chatham between 30 March and 6 May 1933, before deploying to the West Indies between January and March 1934. She was given another refit at Chatham from 27 July to 3 September 1934. Crescent was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis, and deployed in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936.

Mable left her Ohio factory job and headed to Chicago in pursuit of a husband. There in Chicago, she met John Nicholas Ringling. They wed in Hoboken, New Jersey when Mable was 30 and John was 39 years old. John and Mabel, in 1924, began the creation of their dream home in Sarasota, Florida. They called the house C√† d'Zan, meaning 'House of John'. Mable, however, played a much larger role in the creation of the home. In fact, the blue prints were titled Mrs. John Ringling's Home. Two years and two million dollars later the home was finished. Mable hand picked items for her home at estate auctions and on her travels to Europe. She filled the home with Venetian style decor and several shades of green, because green was her favorite color. Her rose garden was her passion, and she chose to have her room face her beloved rose garden rather than face the Sarasota Bay. John and Mabel never had children, but they had a passion for their animals. Mable had gates installed in the home, so the pets could roam through the house while being kept out of the eating areas. She died on June 8, 1929, at the age of fifty-four due to Addison's Disease and Diabetes. In 1991, John and Mable Ringling and his sister, Ida Ringling North, were moved and buried at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, just in front and to the right of the Ca d'Zan.

The fruit bodies of the fungus are dark purple brown with a bright yellow margin, crust-like and attached to the growing surface by numerous root-like yellow rhizoids. R. undulata has a cosmopolitan distribution, and commonly occurs on clearings or burned areas throughout central and northern Europe, North America, northern Asia, and southern Africa. It is parasitic on conifer seedlings, and has caused considerable damage to tree plantations worldwide. Taxonomy The fungus was first described in 1774 as Helvella inflata by the German polymath Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer. It acquired its current name in 1815 by virtue of its publication in Elias Magnus Fries's Observationes Mycologicae. The specific epithet undulata means \\"wavy\\" or \\"undulating\\". Common names that have been used to refer to the species include \\"crust-like cup\\", \\"pine-fire cushion\\", \\"doughnut fungus\\", and \\"pine firefungus\\". Description Fruit bodies, which may be up to wide, are flat, with irregular lobes, and are attached to the growing surface on the entire lower side by numerous whitish to yellowish rhizoids resembling plants roots. The hymenium is dark purple brown to blackish, while the margin is pale yellow (like the underside), and wavy and irregular. When moist, the surface is sticky. The fruit body has a leathery texture when old. In very young fruit bodies, the surface is white; the brown color initially appears in the center and expands rapidly thereafter. The spores of Rhizina undulata are fusiform (fuse-shaped), apiculate, minutely verricose at maturity, with one or two oil drops, and have dimensions of 30‚Äì40 by 8‚Äì11 ¬µm. The asci are roughly cylindrical, and 250‚Äì280 by 14‚Äì18 ¬µm. Like most other Pezizales, the asci open at maturity by means of an apical, lid-like flap of tissue termed an operculum. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, tips encrusted with tubular setae, thin-walled, brown, aseptate and parallel-sided, tapering to a blunt point, and are 7‚Äì11 ¬µm wide. Similar species Discina ancilis is a lookalike Disciotis venosa has an overall similar blistered appearance, but can be distinguished by its distinct bleach-like odor. Discina ancilis bears a general resemblance to Rhizina undulata, but its fruit bodies lack rhizoids on their undersurface, and are attached to the substrate at a central point. Habitat and distribution This is a widespread fungus that grows on burned soil or conifer debris. It prefers growing in acidic soil. Although it is regarded as a saprobic species, it can also attack conifers of varying age parasitically. Its parasitic nature was recognized by scientists in the late 1800s and early 1900s, in particular, through several studies by German forestry scientist and mycologist Robert Hartig. He determined that the fungus can cause the death of four-year-old seedlings of several conifers, including European silver fir (Abies alba), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), European larch (Larix decidua), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii, and sweet chestnut (Castanea vesca). Later research determined that the fungus also attacks conifers between 15 and 60 years old. The roots of seedling attacked by R. undulata are matted together with a white mycelium that penetrates all parts of the cortical and bast tissues. Hartig grew the fungus in culture, and was able to follow the growth of the mycelium using light microscopy. He wrote: The mycelial strands surrounding the diseased roots are continuous with the rhizoid strands that originate from the fruit body underside and attach it to the substrate. Rhizina undulata attack in recently established conifer plantations in areas where slash burning after clearcutting has been performed is a well-known phenomenon. Because the optimum temperature for spore germination is high (), the spores may lie dormant in soil for two years. As a result of these fires, the underlying soil is heated so that suitable conditions are created for the germination of ascospores. The use of hot asphalt () for paving new roads has also been observed to cause the same deleterious effect on neighboring conifers. Rhizina undulata has been recorded in northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It has been introduced into southern Africa. Rhizina undulata is a homothallic fungus, and so it can produce fruit bodies without mating with another individual. Fruit bodies can occur prolifically in favorable habitats. In one recorded instance there were over 300 fruit bodies found within a radius of of a single pine stump. Some studies have suggested that the fungus spreads radially from a single starting point, so that the fruit bodies appear in wider circles in successive years (similar to growth observed in a fairy ring), but other studies have not noticed this phenomenon. The spread of the fungus stops four to seven years after the initial infection.

It is one of many Italian giallo films to be inspired by Dario Argento's successful debut thriller The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The film was shot on location in Rome, Italy, in 1970. It starred Giancarlo Giannini, Barbara Bouchet, and Barbara Bach. Ennio Morricone did the music score for the film. Though fairly obscure for many years the film has recently made a comeback thanks to the rising fan base for the giallo genre. The film has gained much praise from the horror community, one writer at Horrorview.com cited it as the best giallo ever made. Blue Underground Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2006. Plot A mysterious killer is attacking women associated with a blackmail conspiracy. The deranged murderer, wearing surgical gloves, kills his victims by paralyzing them with a needle and then slicing open their bellies with a knife (in the same way tarantulas are killed by the black wasp or spider wasp). The victims are conscious and can feel the pain, but they are unable to move, resist or scream. One victim (Barbara Bouchet) is wearing a yellow nightie when she is killed, an obvious nod to the giallo covers of the lurid Italian murder mysteries on which the films were based. It is up to the reluctant Inspector Tellini (Giancarlo Giannini) to find out who the killer is, before he or his girlfriend become the murderer's next target.

It was their first studio album in three years (since Rather Ripped), making it the band's longest delay between studio albums. The album peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard 200 and was the band's highest charting album of their career in the United States and highest charting album since Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star (1994). Background After Rather Ripped (2006), the band's contract with Geffen Records had expired and the two parties decided to go their separate ways. At the same time, Jim O'Rourke was gradually replaced with ex-Pavement bassist Mark Ibold. Gordon suggested recruiting him for live shows after having played with him in Free Kitten. Moore found that Ibold \\"immediately locked in, and had really prepared himself to the point where he knew the songs better than we did\\". Recording When the band decided to record, it seemed natural to include Ibold. The process involved rehearsing the songs during the week in the basement of Moore and Gordon's house and subsequently recording them over the weekend. Shelley recalled, \\"It was like having a different project every week [and] it felt like we were doing a single every weekend. You kind of have to keep on your feet, the speed aspect to this album was very enjoyable\\". Eventually the band signed with Matador in 2008. However, the band had begun writing much of the material before changing record labels. On the pop-rock aspects of the album, Moore noted, \\"I can sort of see a relationship between some of The Eternal and Dirty in terms of the dynamic\\". He argued that the band \\"definitely wanted to make songs as opposed to doing an avant-garde opus\\". On the choice of Matador, he explained that \\"we decided that they're a really strong song-supportive label\\". Ranaldo noted how they found inspiration in their earlier recordings on Daydream Nation, which \\"had an energy that we'd kind of forgotten about, and some of that energy and the experience of doing those songs impacted on the new record.\\" Content The cover art was painted by John Fahey. The album was dedicated to Ron Asheton of the Stooges. Release The Eternal was released on June 9, 2009 by record label Matador. The album was released digitally, on CD and as a double vinyl LP, in both a standard and a \\"Buy Early Get Now\\" (BEGN) edition. In 2009, it was awarded a silver certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 30,000 copies throughout Europe. http://www.impalamusic.org/arc_static/docum/04-press/2009/PR%20-%2020091006.htm Reception The Eternal currently holds an approval rating of 79/100 on review aggregator website Metacritic, signifying \\"generally favorable reviews\\". An early review by Clash said \\"the album shows signs of life and heart-wrenching vitality that secures its makers‚Äô position at the forefront of American rock music\\". In a \\"Critic's Choice\\" review for The New York Times, Ben Ratliff compared the album to two of their albums from the 1990s,Washing Machine and A Thousand Leaves; he pointed out that the album demonstrated Kim Gordon's continued rise as a singer, saying that she \\"sings all the best stuff\\" on The Eternal, particularly the album's last song, \\"Massage the History\\", a song he called the \\"record's sleeper stunner\\". The addition of Ibold in the studio was praised by Monday Field of Frank Booth Review, likening the album's basslines to \\"a 1AM, alcohol-soaked punch in the gut\\". Many reviews were positive: musicOMH gave the album 5 of 5 stars and said that it \\"acts as a fitting and timeless aide-memoire of everything this mighty band has ever achieved.\\" Los Angeles Times gave it 4 of 4 stars and said, \\"The music remains ageless and weird, fueled on chaos and clarity, but these are songs, not sound experiments for their own sake\\". Chicago Tribune gave the album 3.5 out of 4 stars and said: \\"Back on an independent label after nearly two decades with a major, the post-punk quartet returns to its '80s foundation with an album that breaks little new ground, but sounds thrilling all the same. [...] It casts aside some of the band's fondness for the warped digression and simply moves from one thrill ride to the next, rarely pausing for breath\\". The A.V. Club gave it a B+ and said that the songs \\"are more conventionally rock-oriented than any in Sonic Youth's career, yet the album doesn't really sound like a departure\\". Other reviews were very average: The Austin Chronicle gave it a score of 3.5 stars out of 5 and said, \\"The three- guitar interplay, moderated by bassist Mark Ibold and Steve Shelley on drums, is confident if briefly indulgent ('Walkin Blue'), but Sonic Youth reigns in those tendencies for the most part, making The Eternal its most straightforward album yet\\". Yahoo! Music UK gave the album 6 of 10 stars and said it was \\"well-built, yes, but almost too well built, many parts sounding like they've been lifted directly from SY's vast back catalogue and slotted into place, like a jigsaw that needed completing, rather than the sprawling documents of noise and confusion this band's name is built upon\\". Tiny Mix Tapes gave it 3 of 5 stars and said the album was \\"accessible, listenable, and all the rest: another consistent album from the consistent rock band Sonic Youth\\".

Moral suasion is an appeal to morality, in order to influence or change behavior. A famous example is the attempt by William Lloyd Garrison and his American Anti-Slavery Society to end slavery in the United States by using moral suasion.Tunde Adeleke, \\"Afro- Americans and moral suasion: the debate in the 1830s,\\" The Journal of Negro History, 1998: 127-142. In economics, moral suasion is more specifically defined as \\"the attempt to coerce private economic activity via governmental exhortation in directions not already defined or dictated by existing statute law\\". The 'moral' aspect comes from the pressure for 'moral responsibility' to operate in a way that is consistent with furthering the good of the economy.Investopedia, What does moral suasion mean, http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moralsuasion.asp (accessed June 1, 2010). Moral suasion in this narrower sense is also sometimes known as jawboning.Paul R. Verkuil, \\"Jawboning administrative agencies: Ex Parte Contracts by the White House,\\" Columbia Law Review, 1980: 943-989. There are two types of moral suasion: * \\"Pure\\" moral suasion is an appeal for altruistic behaviour and is rarely used in economic policy * \\"Impure\\" moral suasion, which is the usual meaning of \\"moral suasion\\" in economics, is backed by explicit or implicit threats by authorities in order to provide incentives to comply with the authorities' wishes Pure moral suasion William Lloyd Garrison, who attempted to end slavery through moral suasion. The Assembly of Shimer College, which \\"governs by virtue of the moral suasion established by communal deliberation\\". Moral suasion has been applied in many different fields. In early educational thought, it was often paired against corporal punishment as a means of achieving school discipline. Similarly, in parenting, writers from the 19th century through Benjamin Spock have advocated the use of moral suasion with children as an alternative to physical violence. In politics, moral suasion has frequently been employed by movements for social change, but its effectiveness has varied widely.  Examples  = Temperance movement = In the temperance movement of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Britain and North America, moral suasion was initially a key part of the strategy for reducing the prevalence of alcohol in society. As the movement began to face the limitations of this strategy in the late 19th century, its members turned to legal coercion, leading to the rise of prohibitionism. = United States civil rights movement = In the American Civil Rights Movement of the twentieth century, moral suasion was one of three major prongs of the movement, the others being legal action and collective nonviolent protest. After initial victories, this nonviolent strategy began to struggle in the 1960s, and largely ended with the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.. = Promoting religious tolerance = Moral suasion has sometimes been effective in resolving religious disharmony, especially if the Government is actively involved as a mediator. Moral suasion has been effective in Singapore in the creation of religious harmony among different religious groups. When conflicts do arise, the Government of Singapore's approach is to mediate or resolve the issue through common sense, and moral suasion using the collective efforts of the community, grassroots and religious leaders.Straits Times, \\"Govt will step in when efforts fail,\\" Straits Times, March 6, 2010 = Protecting the environment = Usage of moral suasion in environment regulation consists in making polluters feel responsible for the negative externalities that they cause.S. Zekri, \\"Analyse comparative d'instruments de lutte contre la pollution,\\" in S√©minaire de l'Association Tunisienne des Anciens de l'Institut Agronomique M√©diterran√©en de Zaragoza (Tunis: CIHEAM- IAMZ, 1993), 61-73 Moral suasion can be very efficient from an economic standpoint since economic agents are free to use any cost-minimising solution deal with their negative externalities instead of having to rely on a government-prescribed regulation or tax. Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low. A study of marine debris regulations in the United States from 1989 to 1993 revealed that moral suasion can be an effective tool to limit the discharge of trash into water in spite the offenders' low probability of being detected. The evidence on the effectiveness of moral suasion methods to induce environmentally desirable behaviour, however, is not strongJames M. Coe and Donald B. Rogers, Marine Debris, Sources, Impacts, and solutions (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1997) unless it is coupled with other instruments. For example, Canadian policymakers advocates for moral suasion in their endeavour to achieve environmental and wildlife policy objectives, a course of action likely to fail if little regard is placed on the accompanying incentives.G.C.van Kooten & Andrew Schmitz, \\"Preserving Waterfowl Habitat on the Canadian Prairies: Economic Incentives versus Moral Suasion,\\" American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 1992: 79-89 Impure moral suasion Headquarters of the Bank of Canada, a central bank. Central banks often use impure moral suasion to control the credit supply. As a policy tool, impure moral suasion differs from direct suasion using laws and regulations in that penalties for non-compliance are not systematically assessed on non-compliers. This has led some authors to criticise moral suasion as immoral, since compliers get penalised for cooperating with the stated government agenda (thus incurring extra costs) while non-compliers are not punished. Other objections to the use of moral suasion include the fact that it constitutes extra-legal coercion by the government, that it adds uncertainty to the regulatory process, and that it can undermine or delay the implementation of effective legislation.  Effectiveness  Moral suasion will be \\"an effective economic policy whenever the expected costs of noncompliance is made to exceed the cost of compliance\\". There are 2 necessary conditions for this to happen. * First, citizens must support the Government's policy, thus entailing objective congruence between the promoter of moral suasion and the target whose behaviour should be changed. That support emanates from such factors that determine compliance as; potential illegal gain; severity and certainty of sanctions; individual's moral development and their standards of personal morality; individual's perceptions of how just and moral are rules being enforced; and social environmental influences. For example, during the hyper-inflation in Zimbabwe, most business people were accepting foreign currency as a medium of exchange in violation of the country's Exchange Control rules and regulations despite calls by the Central Bank to persuade stakeholders to accept only the local currency as medium of exchange. The business community felt that the rules being enforced through moral suasion were not just and moral. Thus in cases where factors that determine compliance are in line with Government's objectives, the cost of non-compliance increases as behaviours which are contrary to social moral values suffer social reputation if members know about the non compliance. * Second, the population of economic agent to be persuaded must be small. Fewness entails the easy identification of economic agents to persuade, and increase the perceived likelihood that non-compliers will be identified and punished. Even when those two necessary conditions are not fully met, moral suasion, if only partially effective, can be a valid choice of policy instruments if the alternatives are doing nothing or taking actions with high opportunity or administrative costs. Although neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition, a low level of competition amongst suppliers in the economy contributes to increased effectiveness of moral suasion. Indeed, companies that have been \\"persuaded\\" to adopt morally superior but more costly behaviour, will be less competitive and could be driven out of the market by competitors who are not fettered by such constraints if competition is too fierce.Andrei Shleifer, \\"Does Competition Destroy Ethical Behavior?,\\" The American Economic Review (American Economic Association) 94, no. 2 (May 2004): 414-418  Examples  = Regulating the financial sector = The Bank of Canada defines moral suasion in central banking as \\"a wide range of possible initiatives by the central bank designed to enlist the co-operation of commercial banks or of other financial organisations in pursuit of some objective of financial policy\\".John F. Chant & Keith Acheson, \\"The Choice of Monetary Instruments and the Theory of Bureaucracy,\\" Public Choice Vol. 12 (Spring, 1972), 1972: 13-33 It could also be defined more generally as \\"a process whereby commercial banks co- operate with the central bank either for altruistic reasons or out of fear of administrative or legislative sanctions\\".Albert Breton and Ronald Wintrobe, \\"A theory of 'moral' suasion,\\" The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue canadienne d'Economique, 1978: 210-219 Formal moral suasion is characterised by explicit (though non-contractual) commitments to \\"refrain from activities judged to be in conflict with policies of the central bank\\". Informal moral suasion is more difficult to define and is carried through various conversations and interactions between the central bank and the commercial financial institutions, during which commercial institutions can be made to understand the central bank's policy objectives on various matters. The oligopolistic competition in the British banking sector has witnessed the success of moral suasion as a monetary policy instrument, allowing the central bank to control by persuasion and directive. Given that only five major banks need to be persuaded in England, a moral suasion policy instrument is very effective because non-compliers can be immediately identified and held up for censure, while in the United States where there are many commercial banks, the Federal Reserve needs to use legalistic controls to pursue the same ends. = Curbing inflation = Moral suasion has been effectively used in the management of inflation in a number of countries and is also referred to as \\"open mouth operations\\" in the financial sector.Donald T. Brash, \\"Inflation targeting 14 years on,\\" Speech to the American Economics Association by the chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Atlanta, January 5, 2002). The common factor for the success of moral suasion is the trust that stakeholders have on the Central Bank. For example, New Zealand has experienced high inflation in the early and mid eighties which however drastically reduced as the bank managed to anchor stakeholder inflation expectation through moral suasion. Monetary policy to a great extent is the management of expectations,Lars E. O. Svensson, http://people.su.se/~leosven/, January 26‚Äì27, 2004, (accessed May 28, 2010). influencing inflation expectations of business and labour. Researchers have found that inflation expectations greatly influence future inflation, hence the use of moral suasion to anchor inflation expectations has been an important instrument in reducing New Zealand's inflation rate.Editor in Chief Hama Saburi Financial Gazette, \\"http://www.newzimbabwe.com,\\" http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-2111-Interview+Gono+on+Indigenisation/opinion.aspx, March 26, 2010, (accessed May 28, 2010) Moral suasion has also been widely and successfully used to curb moderate price increases in countries as Great Britain and Sweden where a principle of \\"democratic socialism\\" has been in place for some time.Carl H. Madden, \\"Government Control versus Market Discipline,\\" Academy of Political Science, 1979: 203-218 Wage and price increases were agreed upon by the Government, Labour and businesses. The public ownership of the whole exercise enhanced compliance.  In different political regimes  Although moral suasion can theoretically be used in any political regime, it has a higher chance of being effective in cases where the political authority is centralised and effective. Centralisation of authority contributes to the effectiveness of moral suasion as a policy tool since it makes the government's positions clearer and more consistent. Attempts by governments to influence the behaviour of companies and citizens can therefore be understood more clearly. Effectiveness of authority refers to the ease in which the intentions of the political executive can be transformed into legislative or regulatory action. This is important because the governments and agencies can use implied threats of price controls, additional regulation or taxation to induce certain behaviours from companies. Such threats will only have credibility if companies think that these threats will be carried out if they do not comply. As fewness of economic agents to be persuaded is a necessary condition for moral suasion to be effective, this policy instrument is more adapted to countries with a higher concentration of suppliers, both in terms of number and of geography. Studies suggest that moral suasion is usually not effective in environmental matters in advanced economies. It can, however, still be used for developing countries since there are still easy environmental gains that could be made without heavy-handed regulation.  Interaction with other policy instruments  Moral suasion is rarely used in isolation. Governments can use moral suasion in conjunction with a variety of other policy instruments to reach its objectives. = Regulation = Firms may alter their behaviour in order to reduce the probability that they will be subject to additional regulations. In fact, they may respond more to the threat of being regulated than to the actual imposition of regulations, as illustrated by the fact that US oil companies froze wholesale petrol prices when the 1991 Iraq war started, even without being prompted to do so.Amihai Glazer and Henry McMillan, \\"Pricing by the Firm Under Regulatory Threat,\\" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1992: 1089-1099 = Price cap = Governments can also implicitly or explicitly threaten to establish price caps to make moral suasion more likely to succeed. This was illustrated in 1979 when the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, Paul Volcker, warned banks against raising prime rates above a certain level, and in the 1960s when US President John F. Kennedy caused U.S. Steel to reverse its decision to increase prices by sharply criticizing the company.John A. Vernon and Carmelo Giaccotto, \\"The impact of indirect government controls on U.S. drug prices and R&D;,\\" Cato Journal, 2006: 143-158 = Additional taxation = Moral suasion, in the form of public exhortation, was used to curb the bonuses paid to certain employees in the financial sector, without much success.The Economist, \\"Moral outrage,\\" The Economist, October 22, 2009. The threat of additional, specific taxesWall Street Journal, \\"House Passes Bonus Tax Bill\\" Wall Street Journal, March 20, 2009. was later used in conjunction with moral suasion to make compliance more likely. = Open market transactions and other interventions by central banks = Central banks and governments who let markets know what they consider ranges of \\"appropriate\\" values for its currency has impacts on the trading of the currency, even if intervention never occurs.John Williamson, \\"The case for Roughly Stabilizing the Real Value of the Dollar,\\" The American Economic Review, 1989: 41-45 Central banks can buy or sell various securities if the currency value falls outside its desired range. = Information provision = Governments can choose to publish information in order to \\"shame\\" certain market participants into altering their behaviour. The threat of information provision, and of shaming drug companies that were charging \\"excessive\\" prices in the eyes of the US government, was used by the Clinton administration to curb increases in drug prices. The government of Singapore's decision to publish comparative cost data from different hospital to encourage them to be more efficient is also an example of where moral suasion was used in conjunction with information provision.Kai Hong Phua, \\"Privatization and restructuring of health services in Singapore,\\" IPS occasional paper series (Singapore: Institute of Policy Studies, 1991). = Service provision = The threat of a public option, i.e. direct government provision of goods and services in a sector that is deemed under-serviced can be a powerful motivator for private companies to modify their behaviour in order to prevent the government from entering their market. = Privatisation and deregulation = Large monopolies, sometimes deemed unresponsive to citizens or consumer wishes, can be threatened with privatisation or with deregulation depending on whether the monopoly is government-owned or not.

Commissioned by his brother John (far left) after his 1727 confirmation of mastership, this painting depicts Thomas Cockman (centre) and his supporters celebrating their victory against Dennison. Revd Dr Thomas Cockman, Doctor of Divinity (1675‚Äì1745) was an Oxford academic and administrator. He was Master of University College, Oxford. Cockman was an undergraduate at University College, Oxford, matriculated in 1692, then a Fellow of the College during 1701‚Äì13, before becoming Master of the College later. Thomas Cockman was Rector at Chidingstone in Kent, in 1705. Cockman's mastership at University College was a contested one, with William Dennison, who also served as Master between 1722‚Äì29. There were two disputed elections held in 1722. Cockman appealed to the Crown and was declared Master of University College in 1729. The success of Thomas Cockman's appeal involved accepting that King Alfred had founded the College. This myth originated from the late 1380s but it was widely believed by Cockman's time. The ruling at the court hearing meant that the Visitor of University College, who is responsible for resolving such disputes, should be the Crown rather than the University. This event acted as the impetus for the college antiquary, William Smith, to write a history of the college, refuting this medieval myth. This materialised as The Annals of University College (1578), the first scholarly Oxford history. Cockman received this book coldly, dismissing it as \\"the private opinion of a partial disgusted old man, who was always famous for opposition and confounding thing\\". In 2008, University College acquired a painting including Thomas Cockman. The painting had remained in Thomas Cockman's family, but was auctioned at Sotheby's. The picture is presumed to be a celebration of the success of Cockman's appeal to the Crown to be declared Master of University College in 1729. The painting was probably commissioned by his brother, John Cockman, who is also in the picture along with a number of Fellows of University College. It was painted by Benjamin Ferrers.

He was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, a magistrate, and a captain of the 6th Cinque Port Artillery Volunteer Corps. Life Sheridan was the son of Garrett Sheridan of Cavan, Ireland and his wife Jane Juliana Darnley, daughter of Sir Richard Perrot, Bart. He was born in London in 1820 and was educated at Brighton. He entered the Inner Temple on 18 February 1852 and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1856. He was a captain of the 6th Cinque Port Artillery Volunteer Corps and a J.P. for Middlesex, Westminster, Kent, and the Liberties of the Cinque Ports. Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 Sheridan wrote a poem entitled St. Lawrence's Well which was published in 1845. Sheridan married Elizabeth Frances Wood, eldest surviving daughter of the Rev. John Wood on 10 December 1850. The marriage took place at Walworth. Sheridan was stated to be living at Brompton at this time. In 1855, Sheridan moved into Belfield House in Fulham, residing there until 1863. Sheridan was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Dudley in 1857 after the sitting MP, Stafford Northcote, decided not to contest the general election of that year. Northcote had fallen out politically with Lord Ward, the owner of Dudley Castle and influential local landowner. Sheridan was unopposed at the election as both Radical and Tory factions in the town combined to support him in order to lessen the local political influence of Lord Ward. He subsequently won contested elections in 1859 and 1865. In 1868 he was elected unopposed. At the general election in February 1874, Sheridan won but the election was declared void on 28 April 1874 on the grounds that rioting took place at the poll. At the subsequent by- election held on 21 May 1874, he was again returned, defeating the ironmaster, Noah Hingley. He won the seat again in 1880 and 1885. He finally lost the seat in 1886, beaten at the election by Brooke Robinson. Around the time that his parliamentary career was coming to an end, it was reported that he had expended the sum of ¬£24,000 in order to \\"consolidate the Liberal interests of the town\\". Sheridan was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of London in June 1860. He was on the council of the Kent Archaeological Society. He owned property at Litton Cheney in Dorset.Litton Cheney Village Website In the 1860s, Sheridan became involved in lending money to the government of Mexico, becoming chairman of the Mexican Bondholders' Committee. In 1861, he was made a First Lieutenant of the 6th Cinque Ports Artillery Volunteers.

An already-completed five-year financial forecast and two assumptions are all that is necessary to create a first draft of a comprehensive LBO valuation of the business. From a processing standpoint, the model makes a copy of the already completed five-year forecast and uses that copy (and any changes one makes to it) for projecting future operating results. As such, the original forecast is preserved. The model analyzes the value of a business from the point of view of a \\"financial buyer\\" who owns no other businesses in your industry and, therefore, expects all of its investment return to result solely from the future operations of the business. The LBO valuation model assumes that the buyer has investigated a business and operating plan and believes the business will achieve the financial results one has forecast. From a timing standpoint, the LBO valuation model assumes that the financial buyer intends to purchase the business at the beginning of year two of a five-year forecast and intends to own the business for the ensuing four years, and then sell the business. In order to generalize the analysis across a potentially infinite range of \\"deal\\" attributes, the model assumes the financial buyer is buying only the assets of the business and assuming none of its liabilities. Therefore, the seller of the business needs to pay off all of the liabilities of the business (and in all likelihood, the income tax owed as a result of the gain realized on the sale of the assets) from purchase price paid to the seller by the financial buyer.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 10, 2010. It was promoted as the 450th episode of the series, but is actually the 451st, and aired alongside The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special ‚Äì In 3-D! On Ice!. The episode is dedicated to posthumous guest star Eartha Kitt, who died December 25, 2008, over one year before the episode first aired. In the episode, The Krusty the Clown Show is once again reconstructed. This time, in a bid to get girls to watch the show, a female character named Princess Penelope is hired as Krusty's latest sidekick. Meanwhile, a corporate recruiter persuades Homer, Lenny, and Carl to work for a nuclear plant in Capital City, after Mr. Burns announces a moratorium on free doughnuts. The episode was written by Stephanie Gillis and directed by Matthew Nastuk. The episode has received positive reviews from critics, and in 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.https://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2014/08/20/5-things-essential-simpsons- episodes/ It received a Nielsen rating of 6.9/17 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and in 2010 was nominated for two awards at the Primetime Emmy Award, winning one for Anne Hathaway's voice-over performance. Plot Krusty the Clown is informed by his producers that his show is dropping in ratings with the demographics of young girls, and therefore they will introduce a new character named Princess Penelope. Her act features singing, glitter, and a unicorn, which -- though immediately attracting a youthful female audience -- disgusts the series' predominately male audience, as well as Krusty himself. Soon, the Krustylu Studio becomes almost completely filled with girls (including Lisa), and all of Krusty's merchandise is replaced by that of Penelope's. However, Bart does not like it and complains that \\"...women ruin all the great things\\" (the Army, the Fantastic Four and American Idol \\"what would be better with only Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson\\"). Bart demands that Krusty will do something in order to restore the show. Krusty follows Bart's advice and confronts Penelope in her dressing room. Penelope admits she has followed Krusty ever since she was a young girl, who grew up in Mineola, Long Island, New York. They consequently discover that they share a mutual attraction towards one another. Subsequent episodes of The Krusty the Clown Show feature the two singing love songs to one another, culminating in Krusty's marriage proposal to Penelope and the latter's acceptance. On the wedding day, Bart and Milhouse attempt to sabotage the marriage by showing Penelope Krusty's former wives, Holly Hippie and Eartha Kitt (who divorced Krusty six hours after they got married), who both despise him. Penelope still wants to get married, but Krusty decides that he is not good enough for Penelope and cancels the wedding. Penelope moves to France, only to discover that Krusty is there and apologizes for leaving her behind. She accepts and the two float down the Seine River together into the night. In the subplot, budgeting issues cause Mr. Burns to eliminate donuts from the lunch room, shocking Homer, Lenny, and Carl. While at Moe's Tavern, a corporate recruiter named Gator McCall offers them a job at the Capital City Nuclear Power Plant. The trio agree to take a tour, where they discover there are luxurious working conditions, including free massages, sushi, and cartoonist Gary Larson, who has come out of retirement to draw The Far Side cartoons for plant employees. They accept the offer. As Homer, Lenny, and Carl carry their personal possessions from Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Burns confronts them. After begging is unsuccessful, Burns offers to reinstate even better donuts if they return to work at his power plant. The trio then accepts the offer. Production Anne Hathaway guest starred as Princess Penelope The episode features Anne Hathaway's return to the show, this time voicing Princess Penelope. Jackie Mason returns to voice Krusty the Clown's father Rabbi Hyman Krustofski. This is one of Eartha Kitt's final TV appearances, who posthumously guest-starred as herself, being an ex-wife of Krusty's. Hathaway said that she grew up watching The Simpsons with her brothers, and said that \\"it stuck with me...high school, college, post, everything. I always stop whenever it's on.\\"Hathaway, 0:00 ‚Äì 0:15 Cultural references The opening chalkboard gag makes a reference to the 2012 phenomenon in which the world was supposed to end on December 21, 2012. Homer, Lenny, and Carl get to see a comic from the comic series The Far Side (but not the audience) which includes a lion and an X-ray. While Penelope is playing the guitar in Paris, Tintin and Captain Haddock are listening at one table, crying and hugging. Penelope is not a real princess, despite her full name being Penelope Mountbatten Habsburg Hohenzollern Mulan Pocahontas. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\" earned a 6.8 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. In all, the show was watched by 21.07 million viewers and an 18‚Äì49 rating of 8.8/22. The larger-than-normal viewership was a result of the episode following the National Football League playoffs. It was the most watched episode of the show since season 16's \\"Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass\\", which aired after Super Bowl XXXIX. The episode ranked 8th in the ratings becoming the second highest viewed show on Fox and top rated scripted show on Fox. The episode also came in 5th for the 18‚Äì48 rating becoming the top rated scripted programming of the week with a rating of 9.084 million watching and rating of 6.9. The episode has received positive reviews from critics. IGN's Robert Canning wrote that \\"it may not be turning out classic after classic after classic, but The Simpsons can still deliver smart and solid entertainment\\" and rated the episode 8/10. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, while writing that the plot was \\"something the show has done many, many times before\\", stated that the episode was \\"funny [...] with a nice amount of heart\\", and graded it a B. Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Hathaway's performance, but said that he was \\"a little disappointed\\" because the anniversary episode did not focus on the Simpson family. Tom Maurstad of The Dallas Morning News gave the episode a positive review writing \\"tonight's 450th episode, 'Once Upon a Time in Springfield' is rock solid.

It is one of 2,509 Carnegie libraries worldwide; 1,689 built in the United States. It was the sixth library commissioned by Carnegie in the U.S. and the seventh to open. Completed in November 1898, it is the third oldest Carnegie library in continuous operation in its original structure in the U.S. after the Main Branch and Lawrenceville Branch of Pittsburgh. The library is an independent entity; it is not a \\"branch\\" of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which operates one main facility and 19 branches within the city of Pittsburgh. The building houses a library with a collection of over 34,000, the 1,047-seat \\"Carnegie Library Music Hall\\" and an athletic club with a heated indoor pool. History The library was constructed on a hill in Homestead, Pennsylvania (now Munhall) overlooking the Homestead Steel Works, the site of an 1892 labor strike where Pinkerton agents fought with union workers, resulting in 16 deaths. A library had been under consideration for several years before the strike, but unlike those at Carnegie's Homestead plant, laborers at the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock had capitulated to his wage concession demands in 1887; the Carnegie Free Library of Braddock was founded the following year. \\"Our works at Homestead are not to us as our works at Edgar Thomson. Our men there are not partners,\\" Carnegie said. Groundbreaking for the $300,000 project took place in April 1896. The French Renaissance design was the work of Pittsburgh architects Frank Alden and Alfred Harlow. Contractor William Miller and Sons used Pompeian brick for construction of the 220 by 132 foot facility. Renovations and modifications have not altered the original physical arrangement of the building, that of three separate facilities- library, music hall and athletic club- under one roof. While Carnegie required communities to use public funds to subsidize the operation of his libraries, Homestead was one of the few exceptions. Operation of the libraries in Braddock, Homestead and Duquesne were originally funded by Carnegie's plants in those towns. After the sale of his business to U.S. Steel in 1901, Carnegie established a $1 million trust to support the three facilities. In the 1960s, the Braddock and Duquesne libraries were turned over to the school districts in those communities by the Board of the Endowment for the Monongahela Valley. The Homestead library is now the sole beneficiary of Carnegie's gift. Main Entrance Staircase of the Library USX Corporation, the successor to U.S. Steel, continued to provide major support until 1988, when the corporation terminated its regular donations and the Borough of Munhall assumed responsibility for the library. Despite the closing of the Homestead Steel Works two years earlier and the precipitous decline in employment and tax revenue, the library remained open and operational with grants secured by community volunteers and the investment income from Carnegie's endowment. When the financial crash of 2008 reduced the value of the endowment by $300,000, the library board furloughed its executive employees and assumed management responsibilities rather than cut services. Fundraising efforts, revenue from athletic club memberships, music hall rentals, and concession sales have maintained the library's viability. Homestead Library & Athletic Club In the early 20th century, the Homestead Library & Athletic Club football team, composed of many former star Ivy League players, was considered one of the top semi-professional teams in the country. Hall of Famer Rube Waddell played for the Club's baseball team. The amateur teams at the library also won national championships in wrestling and track & field.Ruck, Rob Sandlot Seasons: Sports in Black Pittsburgh. University of Illinois Press, 1993. pgs. 28‚Äì29 In the 1920s and 1930s, four Olympians trained in the library's swimming pool. Susan Laird swam in 1928, winning a gold medal with the 4 √ó 100 meter freestyle relay team; Josephine McKim won a bronze medal in 1928 and gold in 1932; Anna Mae Gorman competed in the 1932 Summer Olympics at age 16; and Lenore Kight won silver in 1932 and a bronze in 1936. Gorman first swam in 1927 while on vacation. When she returned to Homestead she purchased a three-month membership at the library and pool for $1. At age 92 in 2008, Gorman still swam at the library.

The designer of the Cembalet was Ernst Zacharias. The Cembalet was a reed-based electric piano intended for home use. It was the first keyboard produced by Hohner as a piano-like instrument rather than an instrument having the sustained note of an organ. It was adopted by popular musicians for recording and performance in the early 1960s due to its portability and ability to be amplified by electronic means. General description The Cembalet is an electro- mechanical piano requiring amplification to produce a usable sound level. Cembalets have 61 keys and a keyboard range of C2 to C7 (65.4 Hz ‚Äì 2093 Hz). The Cembalet had ground stainless steel reeds and a pick-up using variable capacitance. The keyboard action is very simple. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a plectrum and damper pad can be mounted close to the tuned spring steel reed. This plectrum lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The unique playing feel of a Cembalet comes from the resistance of the steel reeds as they reach and exceed their point of release. Comparison with Pianet After introducing the Cembalet, Hohner produced a variation of the mechanical design named the Pianet. These two instruments were sold in parallel until the late 1960s. Case styles were identical for models C and N through the 1960s causing many to misidentify these instruments. The most obvious point of visual difference is the differing keyboard range, C to C for the Cembalet and F to F for the Pianet. Reed-based pianos have voices that differ markedly depending on the material and geometry of the reeds, the way they are excited, and the way the vibrations are converted to electrical energy. The Cembalet pushed the tip of the reed upward until it cleared the plectrum, where as the Pianet pulls the reed upward using a pad adhered over a length of around one quarter inch positioned back from the tip of the reed. The attack of the note and the harmonics produced vary significantly. In addition the plate of the capacitive pickup is to the side in the Cembalet producing further differences in the way the vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal. Models During the production life of the Cembalet the case, mechanical features and electronics changed to keep pace with developments in electronics manufacture, reductions in manufacturing costs, and fashion. Changes to the Cembalet were also applied to Pianet production. Dating the manufacturing envelope and availability of the various Cembalet models is confused by misidentification of Pianet models as Cembalets and by the differences in sales availability of models between Europe and the United States.

Today Ternopil pond is surrounded by a park. It is a favorite walking place of residents and visitors of the city. Only two European cities have the lake in the center and one of them is Ternopil. On the embankment of the Ternopil Lake takes place the festival of forge art. The Church of Exaltation of the Cross which is the architectural monument of the 16th century is situated near the lake. History It was created in 1548 by Crown Hetman Jan Tarnowski as one link in a chain of fortifications encircling his residence, the Tarnopol Castle. In the 16th century the pond stretched for up to the high dam carrying the Lw√≥w Highway. At the beginning of the 20th century, the pond was leased by Ternopil businessman Volodymyr Trach, who exported fish to Poland. In addition it was also used for fish breeding. The pond, formerly renowned for its fisheries, had silted up by the mid-20th century and was further damaged during the Second World War. During the Second World War, Ternopil pond was completely destroyed. It was reconstructed and expanded in 1952 to include a network of marshes bordering the Seret River during the massive rebuilding of Ternopil. At that time, it was decided to transfer the water resources to the local authorities in 1956, which began to recover the Ternopil pond. A new dam was built resulting in a higher water level than before. The mended pond had taken a much larger area - more than 300 hectares, and was subsequently named as Komsomol lake. Shevchenko Park was established between the pond and the city center in 1953, which stretched along the eastern shores of the lake. In the 1960s, the beach near the Old Castle was eliminated and in its place a central pier was built. A local version of the Jet d'Eau was inaugurated in 1975. In the 1980s the landscaping around the Komsomolsk lake continued to be developed. A hydropark \\"Pioneer\\" behind the dam was created, which later was renamed as \\"Topilche.\\" Hotel \\"Moscow\\" was also built at the foot of the Forest Park \\"Zagrebellya\\". Subsequently, the hotel's name was changed to \\"Halychyna\\". Also, Ternopil pond has two islands: the Island of Love and \\"The Seagull\\" (‚ÄúChayka‚Äù). An old Soviet motor ship, \\"The Hero Tantsorov\\" still operating on the pond. In 1968, the ship appeared in Ternopil named in honor of Gregory Tantsorov - one of the liberators of the city from German occupation. The ship originally was called \\"Zalishchyky\\" and was built in 1963 in Belarus. The overhaul of \\"The Hero Tantsorov\\" was made in 2006. In 1966 a small motor ship \\"PT-50\\" appeared on the pond (\\"Passenger ship - Fifty Project\\"), built in 1964. In 2005, the two ships were passed to the ownership of municipal enterprise ‚ÄúTernopilelektrotrans‚Äù. The pond has significant economic importance in the 21st century, operating four mills that bring profits to the city. There are a lot of fish in the lake such as pike, perch, carp, and others. There are also a lot of algae and the yellow water lily that blooms in late June. To the west of the pond near the village Pronyatyn, various types of willows are existent. Also, wild ducks and gulls swim and breed in Ternopil pond.

In 1788, his brother, Old Tassel, was chief of the Cherokee people, but was killed under a truce (negotiating peace) by frontier rangers. In 1791 Doublehead was among a delegation of Cherokees who visited U.S. President George Washington in Philadelphia. After the peace treaty at the Tellico Blockhouse in 1794, Doublehead served as one of the leaders of the Chickamauga Cherokee (or \\"Lower Cherokee\\"). Upon the death of his nephew, Principal Chief John Watts, in 1802, Doublehead was chosen as leader of the Chickamauga (taking on the title Chuqualataque). Personal life It is thought that Doublehead's father was Great Eagle (or Willenewa), a nephew of Chief Old Hop and a cousin of Chief Attakullakulla (or Little Carpenter). One of his brothers was Old Tassel, killed while treating with the lost State of Franklin. Two of his relatives, Tahlonteeskee and John Jolly, were also leaders among the Chickamauga and both later became Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation. Doublehead's last wife was Nancy Drumgoole. Their youngest son, Bird Doublehead, was only twelve years old at the time of Doublehead's assassination. Living in the Overhill Towns on the Little Tennessee River, he took only sporadic part in the campaigns of Dragging Canoe, until the murder of his brother, and another pacifist chief, Abraham of Chilhowee, under a flag of truce during an embassy to the State of Franklin in 1788. Thereafter he became one of the most vicious fighters and most capable leaders of the Cherokee at war. Beginnings as a war leader His first act in his new crusade was to lead a party of warriors in concert with those of Dragging Canoe in an assault on White's Fort in East Tennessee that same year. Thereafter, he and his warriors operated somewhat independently, though occasionally joining Dragging Canoe's campaigns, operating from his new settlement of Coldwater at the head of the Muscle Shoals on the Tennessee River in what is now the state of Alabama. The location at the time was within the territory claimed by the Chickasaw, but Doublehead solved that problem by marrying two daughters to George Colbert, the chief of the Chickasaw town at the foot of the Shoals. Doublehead's band included not only Cherokee, but Muskogee, Shawnee, and renegade Chickasaw (whose council and chiefs were adamantly opposed to the wars). Activities in later years of the wars Beginning in 1791, he began operating closely with the parties of his great- nephew, Bob Benge, who was to become one of the most feared warriors on the frontier, and Benge's brother, The Tail, who were then based in Willstown. Following the death of Dragging Canoe in 1792, he became part of a triumvirate of leaders among the Chickamauga, along with Bloody Fellow and his nephew, John Watts, who was recognized as the chief of them. In September 1792, Watts orchestrated a large campaign into the Cumberland region of combined Cherokee and Muskogee forces which included a contingent of cavalry. It was to be a three-pronged attack in which Tahlonteeskee (or Talotiskee) of the Muskogee (who was either a Creek chief or a relative of Doublehead by that name) led a force to ambush the Kentucky road; Middle Striker led another to do the same on the Walton road; while Watts himself led the main army which was made up of 280 Cherokee, Shawnee, and Muskogee warriors and cavalry, against a settlement on the Cumberland River known as Buchanan's Station on Sept. 30, 1792. Among the attackers were the Shawnee Warrior (also known as Chiksika, or Cheeseekau), Tahlonteeskee, and Dragging Canoe's brother, Little Owl, all of whom died in the encounter. Also killed in the attack was Pumpkin Boy, a younger brother of Doublehead. One an earlier occasion, Doublehead, Pumpkin Boy, and their nephew Bob Benge, had led a raid into southwestern Kentucky during which their warriors, in an act initiated by Doublehead, cannibalized the enemies they had just killed. Their act was in imitation of the Iroquois, particularly the Mohawk, who were alleged to have done so to intimidate their enemies (especially during the Beaver Wars). Though every warrior present partook, Benge never operated with Doublehead afterward, sickened at his actions and at his own, nor did the later leader, The Ridge, who also took part.Langguth, p. 31 Beginning of his troubles with James Vann In 1793, a delegation of Shawnee stopped in Ustanali, the principal city of the Cherokee, on their way to call on the Muskogee and Choctaw to punish the Chickasaw for joining St. Clair's army in the north. Watts sent envoys to Knoxville, then the capital of the Southwest Territory, to meet with Governor William Blount to discuss terms for peace. This party, which included Bob McLemore, Tahlonteeskee, Captain Charley of Running Water, and Doublehead, along with the white delegation, was attacked by militia during a stop at the Overhill town of Coyatee. Hanging Maw (one of two men claiming the title of \\"First Beloved Man\\") was wounded, and several others, including his wife, daughter, and one of the white delegates, were killed. The Cherokee (and, amazingly, Watts' hostile Chickamauga warriors) agreed to await the outcome of the subsequent trial, which proved to be a farce. This was in large part because the man responsible was a close friend of John Sevier. Watts responded by invading the Holston area with one of the largest Indian forces ever seen in the region --over one thousand Cherokee, Muskogee, and Shawnee --intending to attack Knoxville itself. On the way, the Cherokee leaders were discussing among themselves whether to kill all the inhabitants of Knoxville, or just the men, James Vann advocating the latter while Doublehead argued for the former. Further on the way, they encountered a small settlement called Cavett's Station. After they had surrounded the place, Benge negotiated with the inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muskogee allies attacked and began killing them over the pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muskogee for safe- keeping. Unfortunately, one of the Muskogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later. Because of the above incident, Vann called Doublehead \\"Babykiller\\" for the remainder of his life. This incident also began a lengthy feud which defined the politics of the early 19th-century Cherokee Nation. After the wars Doublehead, as well as being one of the leaders of the Lower Towns, was elected first Speaker of the Cherokee National Council, when the Cherokee formed its first nascent national government, in 1794. He became one of the foremost advocates of acculturation and one of the richest men in The Cherokee Nation --the Lower Towns then being the wealthiest section of the entire country. He was also a chief advocate of land sales, along with several older chiefs in the Lower Towns, whose number included Dragging Canoe's brother, Turtle at Home. This only increased the enmity between him and his chief rival, James Vann, who was the richest man in \\"The Nation.\\" Death In August 1807, because of his ongoing machinations with U.S. Indian Affairs Commissioner Return J. Meigs, Jr. regarding under-the-table land deals, as well as personal animosity going back nearly two decades, several of the younger leaders of the Nation, led by James Vann, conspired to assassinate Doublehead. Meanwhile, Doublehead lost part of his thumb in a scuffle with a Cherokee named Bone Polisher. Vann, because of his personal animosity toward Doublehead going back nearly two decades, had initially planned to lead the assault, but had become too drunk to take part. The Ridge (later known as Major Ridge) and Alexander Sanders, shot the injured chief in McIntosh's Tavern at the Hiwassee Garrison near the Cherokee Agency (now Calhoun, Tennessee). The badly wounded Doublehead sought safety in the attic of schoolmaster Jonathan Blacke's house, where the assassins finished the job with knives and tomahawks.Hicks, pp. 20-24 Thomas Clark was a close friend of the Cherokee Indian Chief Doublehead, and when a treaty was signed on 25 October 1805 for the location of a Fort opposite and below the mouth of the Hawassee River and on the North Bank of the Tennessee River. The Hiwassee Garrison, 1805 to 1817, as part of this treaty, a secret article was applicable to a small tract of land at and below the mouth of the Clinch River, to the one mile square at the foot of the Cumberland Mountains, and to the one square mile on the north bank of the Tennessee River where Cherokee Talootiske lived. The first mentioned tract was also intended for the benefit of Chief Doublehead, who leased it on 19 February 1806 to Thomas Clark for 20 years. When Chief Doublehead was killed at the site of the Hawassee Garrison in August 1807 by rivals who accused him of being a traitor to the Cherokees, the State of Tennessee assumed to grant the tract to Thomas Clark on 10 December 1820. At the time of the murder of Chief Doublehead, Thomas Clark, John D. Chisholm, and Major Return J. Meigs had been appointed the executors of the estate by Chief Doublehead, and he wished that his estate be disposed of in the manner of white people and his wishes were read and approved by the Cherokee Council. Chief Doublehead's son Birdsong Doublehead, who was twelve years old and living in the Clarks' home at the time of his father‚Äôs murder, stayed there until his father‚Äôs estate could be settled, and then Clark took him down to Mussel Shoals Alabama to be with his mother Nancy Drumgoole, last wife of Chief Doublehead. A historical irony deserves mention here. Walker's Ferry on the Hiwasssee River was owned by John Walker, Jr., a mixed blood who was one of Vann's associates. In July 1834, because of his advocacy of removal in the years leading up to the Treaty of New Echota, Walker was assassinated on the road home from Red Clay, TN after a meeting of the Cherokee National Council. His killers were James Foreman and his half brother Anderson Springston. In June 1839, after the Cherokee Removal to Indian Territory, Major Ridge, his son John Ridge, and nephew Elias Boudinot (Cherokee) were accused of the same crime as that of Doublehead and themselves became the targets of assassins. Among the killers of Major Ridge were James Foreman, Anderson Springston, Isaac Springston, and Bird Doublehead. In traditional Cherokee matrilineal worldview, these men were all full brothers. They each shared the same mother: Nannie Drumgoole, last wife of Doublehead. Drumgoole was a descendant of Alexander Drumgoole, a trader to the Cherokees. Bird Doublehead, Nannie's son with Doublehead, was twelve years old and residing at the home of Thomas Clark when his father was killed by the Cherokee assassins, Alexander Sanders and The Ridge (later known as Major Ridge, after the Creek War). A fictional version of his execution is in Dee Brown's novel Creek Mary's Blood. See also *Sequoyah References Sources *Evans, E. Raymond. \\"Notable Persons in Cherokee History: Bob Benge\\".

The 17th and final storm of the 2005‚Äì06 Australian region cyclone season, Monica originated from an area of low pressure off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 16 April 2006. The storm quickly developed into a Category 1 cyclone the next day, at which time it was given the name Monica. Travelling towards the west, the storm intensified into a severe tropical cyclone before making landfall in Far North Queensland, near Lockhart River, on 19 April 2006. After moving over land, convection associated with the storm quickly became disorganised. On 20 April 2006, Monica emerged into the Gulf of Carpentaria and began to re-intensify. Over the following few days, deep convection formed around a wide eye. Early on 22 April 2006, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) assessed Monica to have attained Category 5 status, on the Australian cyclone intensity scale. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also upgraded Monica to a Category 5 equivalent cyclone, on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. The storm attained its peak intensity the following day with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 916 hPa (mbar; 27.05 inHg). On 24 April 2006, Monica made landfall about west of Maningrida, at the same intensity. Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved over land. Less than 24 hours after landfall, the storm had weakened to a tropical low. The remnants of the former-Category 5 cyclone persisted until 28 April 2006 over northern Australia. In contrast to the extreme intensity of the cyclone, relatively little structural damage resulted from it. No injuries were reported to have occurred during the storm's existence and losses were estimated to be A$6.6 million (US$5.1 million). However, severe environmental damage took place. In the Northern Territory, an area about 7,000 km2 (4,300 mi2) was defoliated by Monica's high wind gusts. In response to the large loss of forested area, it was stated that it would take several hundred years for the area to reflourish. Meteorological history Severe Tropical Cyclone Monica originated from an area of low pressure that formed early on 16 April 2006 off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The low quickly became organised, with deep convection developing over the low-pressure centre. Later that day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as the system became increasingly organised. Early the next day, the Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane, Australia declared that the low had developed into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone scale, with winds reaching 65 km/h (40 mph 10-minute sustained). Upon being classified as a cyclone, the storm was given the name Monica. At the same time, the JTWC designated Monica as Tropical Cyclone 23P. Monica tracked generally westward, towards Far North Queensland, in response to a low to mid-level ridge to the south. Low wind shear and good divergence in the path of the storm allowed for continued intensification as continued westward. Late on 17 April, Monica intensified into a Category 2 Cyclone, with winds reaching 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute sustained). By 1200 UTC on 18 April, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Monica to a severe tropical cyclone, a Category 3 on the Australian scale. This followed an increase in the storm's outflow and a fluctuating central dense overcast. Several hours later, the JTWC upgraded Monica to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. During the afternoon of 19 April, the storm made landfall roughly south- southeast of the Lockhart River with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph 10-minute sustained). At the same time, the JTWC assessed Monica to have intensified into a Category 2 equivalent storm with winds of 155 km/h (100 mph 1-minute sustained). Shortly after making landfall, convection associated with the storm deteriorated and the outflow became fragmented. A shortwave trough to the south caused the ridge steering Monica to weaken, leading to the cyclone moving slower. After moving over land, the storm began to weaken, with the Bureau of Meteorology downgrading the storm to weaken to Category 1 cyclone and the JTWC downgraded the cyclone to a tropical storm. The following day, Monica moved offshore, entering the Gulf of Carpentaria. Once back over water, favourable atmospheric conditions allowed the storm to quickly intensify. Within 24-hours of moving over water, Monica re-attained severe tropical cyclone status. Following a shift in steering currents, the storm slowed significantly and turned north-westward. Steady intensification continued through 22 April as the storm remained in a region of low wind shear and favourable diffluence. Early on 22 April the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Monica to a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the third of the season. By this time, a wide eye had developed within the central dense overcast of the cyclone. Later that day, the JTWC assessed Monica to have intensified into a Category 5-equivalent storm. Severe Tropical Cyclone Monica on 24 April Cyclone Monica attained its peak intensity on 23 April near Cape Wessel with a barometric pressure 916 hPa (mbar; 27.05 inHg). Maximum winds were estimated at 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute sustained) by the Bureau of Meteorology while the JTWC assessed it to have attained winds of 285 km/h (180 mph 1-minute sustained). Using the Dvorak technique, the peak intensity of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale. However, since the JTWC, SAB and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial. On 24 April, the mid-level ridge south of Monica weakened, causing the storm to turn towards the southwest. Following this, the storm made landfall in the Northern Territory, roughly west of Maningrida, as a Category 5 cyclone with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 10-minute sustained). Soon after making landfall, the storm weakened extremely quickly. Most of the convective activity associated with the storm dissipated within nine hours of moving onshore. This resulted in the storm's maximum winds decreasing by 155 km/h (100 mph) in a 12-hour span. After this rapid weakening, the storm turned sharply west moving over the town of Jabiru as a Category 2 cyclone. Within six hours of passing this town, the Bureau of Meteorology downgraded Monica to a tropical low, as the storm was no longer producing gale-force winds. The JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm at 1800 UTC that day. The remnants of Monica persisted for several more days, tracking near Darwin on 25 April before turning south-east and accelerating over the Northern Territory. The remnants eventually dissipated on 28 April over central Australia. Uncertainty in peak strength The Bureau of Meteorology uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds. The Bureau of Meteorology's peak intensity for Monica was 250 km/h (155 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 285 km/h (180 mph) one-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Monica was 285 km/h (180 mph) one-minute sustained, or 250 km/h (155 mph) 10-minute sustained. While the storm was active the Bureau of Meteorology's Darwin Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre estimated that Monica, had peaked with a minimum pressure of . However, during their post analysis of Monica, the Darwin Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre estimated using the Love-Murphy pressure-wind relationship, that the system had a minimum pressure of . However, since then the BoM has started to use the Knaff, Zehr and Courtney pressure-wind relationship, which has estimated that Monica had a minimum pressure of . Other pressure estimates include the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's post analysis estimated pressure of and the University of Wisconsin- Madison's Advanced Dvorak Technique which estimated a minimum pressure of . The Advanced Dvorak Technique pressure estimate would suggest that the system was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide as the pressure is below that of the current world record holder, Typhoon Tip of 1979. In 2010, Stephen Durden of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory studied Cyclone Monica's minimum pressure and suggested that the system likely peaked between and strongly refuted claims that Monica was the strongest tropical cyclone on record. Preparations and impact alt=Satellite view of a large, well- developed tropical cyclone near northern Queensland. A pronounced, yet cloud- filled eye and curved rainbands mark the characteristics of a mature storm. Queensland Upon being declared as Tropical Cyclone Monica on 17 April, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a gale warning for areas along the eastern coast of Far North Queensland. Several hours later, a cyclone warning was issued for north-eastern areas as the storm intensified. An estimated 1,000 people were planned to be evacuated in Far North Queensland before officials shut down major highways in the area. Ferry services in the Great Barrier Reef and flights in and out of the region were cancelled. However, no evacuations took place according to the Emergency Management in Australia. An aborigine community of 700, located around the mouth of the Lockhart River, were in the direct path of the storm. The chief executive officer of the community stated that they were ready for the storm, having suffered no losses from Cyclone Ingrid which impacted the same area in 2005. Little damage was recorded in Queensland, despite Cyclone Monica being a Category 3 cyclone, as the storm impacted a sparsely populated region of the Cape York peninsula. A storm surge of was recorded in Mossman and waves were recorded up to in Weipa. Heavy rainfall was also associated with the storm, exceeding near where Monica made landfall. Wind gusts up to were recorded as the storm traversed the peninsula. Officials reported about 15 percent of the structures along the Lockhart River sustained minor damage. Minor coastal flooding was also reported due to Monica. Three Torres Strait Islanders were rescued after 22 days drifting at sea in the wake of the cyclone passing through the Torres Strait, north of mainland Queensland. Northern Territory Officials closed schools throughout the region in advance of the storm on 24 April and advised people to evacuate. A 10 pm curfew was also put in place to keep people off the streets during the night. Local tours in the territory were postponed or cancelled due to the storm. Several flights in and out of Darwin were also cancelled, as was the Darwin Anzac Day march. Alcan, the world's second- largest aluminium producer, warned customers of potential interruptions to supplies on contracts from its Gove refinery. Rio Tinto's Ranger Uranium Mine ceased operations on 24 April, \\"as a precautionary measure\\". At one point, Monica was forecast to pass directly over Goulburn Island. In response, officials evacuated the island's 337 residents to shelters set up in Pine Creek. Numerous schools in the threatened region, especially in Darwin, were closed ahead of Monica's arrival. Several shelters were opened in Darwin early on 24 April in anticipation of an influx of evacuees. Stores throughout the area reported increased sales for storm supplies, with some reducing prices on specific items. The same day, the Darwin Returned and Services League of Australia cancelled all ANZAC Day services and marches in Darwin that were to be held the next day, to ensure the safety of prospective participants. alt=A sprawling mass of clouds obscuring much of northern Australia. The Wessel Islands, located off the coast of the region, suffered significant damage from the storm. Mangrove trees were uprooted throughout the islands and sand dunes were destroyed. An outstation located on one of the islands was destroyed by the cyclone. The highest 24-hour rainfall from the storm was recorded near Darwin at . A storm total for the same area was recorded at , surpassing the rainfall record for the entire month of April set in 1953. Although the storm made landfall at peak intensity in Australia's Northern Territory, the impacted areas were sparsely populated. Around the region where Monica made landfall, evidence of a 5‚Äì6 m (16.4‚Äì19.6 ft) storm surge was present in Junction Bay. Wind gusts up to felled power lines in Maningrida; 12 homes sustained damage from fallen trees in Jabiru; and extensive damage was reported in Oenpelli. Roughly 1,000 people also lost phone service in the region. Several highways were blocked by fallen trees throughout the area. A resort in Jabiru sustained significant damage and was closed for two weeks following the storm. Insured damages to the national parks amounted to A$1.6 million (US$766,000). According to the Northern Territory Insurance Office, structural damage from Cyclone Monica amounted to A$5 million (US$4.4 million). The remnants of Monica produced significant rainfall over parts of the Northern Territory several days after the system weakened below cyclone status. Flash flooding was reported throughout the Adelaide River basin as up to of rain fell in a 24-hour span. On 26 April, the remnants of Monica spawned a small tornado near Channel Point; several mangrove trees were snapped and branches were thrown to nearby beaches. Environmental impacts alt=Aerial view of deforestation. Dead trees lay scattered about the ground. The full- force of Monica's estimated wind gusts were felt in the unpopulated tropical savanna regions of northern Australia. A large-scale windthrow event affected approximately 10,400 km2 (4,000 mi2) of forest, resulting in the damage or destruction of 140 million trees. Damage extended north and south of Monica's centre and progressed inland. The affected areas primarily consist of Eucalyptus (namely E. miniata and E. tetrodonta) and Corymbia (namely C. dichromophloia, C. latifolia, and C. foelscheana) tree species. Common grasses in the savanna area include Triodia bitextura and Sorghum. Areas near the cyclone's landfall point‚ÄîJunction Bay‚Äîalso comprise wetlands and Melaleuca swamp forests. The heaviest damage occurred just east of the landfall point, with more than 85 percent of vegetation severely damaged; it spanned 139 km2 (53.7 mi2). In this area, trees were completely defoliated, snapped, and/or uprooted. Within of Junction Bay, 77 percent of all trees were uprooted or snapped at the trunk, while 84 percent suffered total defoliation. In the Melaleuca swamps, 60 percent of trees were snapped or uprooted once wind gusts exceeded . Approximately 12.7 million tonnes of vegetative debris was created by the storm. The Goomadeer River catchment, which flows into Junction Bay, was entirely denuded. The prolific loss of trees led to hydrologic changes in the region, with flood events likely becoming more severe as groundwater flow increased. Farther southwest, the Magela Creek catchment in Kakadu National Park suffered a direct hit from the weakening cyclone. Gusts up to impacted the Ngarradj sub-catchment, destroying 42 percent of the tree canopy cover. Long-term losses in the sub-catchment reached 23 percent. Less rainfall than would normally be expected with such a storm lessened tree loss in the area, with soils largely not becoming saturated enough to allow trees to topple over. The large amount of debris left behind contained approximately 51‚Äì60 million tonnes of greenhouse gases‚Äîprimarily carbon dioxide‚Äîor roughly 10 percent of Australia's annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. With Monica occurring just before the onset of the dry season, widespread brushfires were anticipated in the affected regions owing to the large amount of kindling. However, analysis of satellite imagery revealed only slightly above-average fire activity in the months following the cyclone. Recovery Within weeks of the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began planting seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, a review of the growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4 million (US$6.6 million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in flowing water had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100 years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60 cm (23.6 in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region. Aftermath The Queensland Government State Disaster Management Group dispatched relief helicopters to remote communities for evacuation of people in flood zones and transport of relief workers. Relief efforts were already underway in relation to Cyclone Larry which caused significant damage in Queensland. The Government of Australia assisted affected business by providing disaster loans up to A$25,000 for severely impacted areas and A$10,000 for less affected areas. Farmers were also provided with up to $200,000 in loans over a period of nine years. Following the impacts in the Northern Territory, two cleanup teams were dispatched from Darwin to assist in cleanup efforts in the hardest hit regions. Despite the minimal damage caused by Monica, the name was retired from the circulating lists of tropical cyclone names for the Australian Region.

History US Army Base Minnesota Vikings Cheerleader Lissa Steffen experiences first-hand how it feels to be taken down by a military working dog at the Camp Liberty kennels, May 20, 2010 Camp Liberty first came into existence during the 2003 invasion of Iraq as Camp Victory North, and was renamed (its Arabic translation is \\"Camp Al-Tahreer\\") in mid-September 2004 to its later name of Camp Liberty (in Arabic \\"Camp Hurriya\\").Abu Ghurayb Presidential Site. GlobalSecurity.Org, Retrieved 12 February 2009. Other camps that made up the Victory Base Complex include Camp Victory (formerly known as Camp Victory South), Camp Striker, Logistics Base Seitz, and Camp Slayer. The renaming was part of an effort to give U.S. facilities around Baghdad friendlier connotations, and an attempt to resolve the issue of constantly changing facility names. During the Iraq War, following the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the base was a large coalition military installation located northeast of the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP), becoming part of the U.S. military's Victory Base Complex (VBC). Camp Liberty was twice the size of Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo, and one of the largest U.S. overseas posts built since the Vietnam War. Camp Liberty killings On 11 May 2009, an American soldier, U.S. Army Sergeant John M. Russell, opened fire on his fellow service members within the camp at a counseling clinic center, killing five before being subdued and taken into custody. Forcible eviction of PMOI residents from Camp Ashraf to Camp Liberty Under strong pressure by the Iraqi government, whose declared will is to expel the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI/MEK) from Iraq, but who was aided as well by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) under the pretext to preserve their security, near all of the 3,400 MEK residents of Camp Ashraf were forcedly moved to Camp Liberty in 2012.Tahar Boumedra (2013), The United Nations and Human Rights in Iraq.

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the UN Human Rights Council has categorized, in his Opinion of May 2012, the status of the MEK residents in Camp Liberty/Camp Hurriya as Arbitrary detention and called the Iraqi government for the \\"immediate release and lifting of all restraints upon the free movements of these persons\\".A/HRC/WGAD/2012/16, Opinions adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its sixty-third session, 30 April‚Äì4 May 2012 - No. 16/2012 (Iraq) http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=20900 It reiterated and extended this vote in his Opinion of August 2012, additionally considering it \\"appropriate to refer the allegations concerning conditions in Camp Ashraf and Camp Liberty to the relevant human rights mechanisms for appropriate action\\".A/HRC/WGAD/2012/32, Opinions adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its sixty-fourth session, 27‚Äì31 August 2012 - No. 32/2012 (Iraq) http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/alldocs.aspx?doc_id=20900 2013 rocket attacks A rocket and mortar attack left at least eight dead and nearly 100 wounded occurred at Camp Hurriya on 9 February 2013. Iranian residents of Camp Liberty and their representatives and lawyers appealed to the UN Secretary- General and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they say is 80 times larger than Liberty and has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection. They argue that this move is all the more imperative because according to the UN Refugee Agency and the US embassy in Baghdad, resettlement will take anywhere from three to 10 years. So, the residents would be at risk of further attacks and the move to Ashraf would not hinder their resettlement. The United States has been working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the resettlement project. On 29 April 2013, 20 explosions hit Camp Liberty/Camp Hurriya.

In hemifusion only the outer bilayer leaflets mix. In full fusion both leaflets as well as the internal contents mix. In membrane biology, fusion is the process by which two initially distinct lipid bilayers merge their hydrophobic cores, resulting in one interconnected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, an aqueous bridge is formed and the internal contents of the two structures can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. In hemifusion, the lipid constituents of the outer leaflet of the two bilayers can mix, but the inner leaflets remain distinct. The aqueous contents enclosed by each bilayer also remain separated. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, particularly in eukaryotes since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub- divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysosome are a few of the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Fusion is also an important mechanism for transport of lipids from their site of synthesis to the membrane where they are needed. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell. Lipid mechanism There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process, although each of these steps actually represents a complex sequence of events. First, the involved membranes must aggregate, approaching each other to within several nanometers. Second, the two bilayers must come into very close contact (within a few angstroms). To achieve this close contact, the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated, as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel at this distance. Third, a destabilization must develop at one point between the two bilayers, inducing a highly localized rearrangement of the two bilayers. Finally, as this point defect grows, the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact. Depending on whether hemifusion or full fusion occurs, the internal contents of the membranes may mix at this point as well. Schematic illustration of the process of fusion through stalk formation. The exact mechanisms behind this complex sequence of events are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These studies have shown that divalent cations play a critical role in the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing electrostatic repulsion and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since zwitterionic lipids are not susceptible to this effect. In the fusion process, the lipid head group is not only involved in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent of the effects of ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close apposition more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly curved bridge must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted micelle phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a curved structure present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase. Fusion proteins Diagram of the action of SNARE proteins docking a vesicle for exocytosis. Complementary versions of the protein on the vesicle and the target membrane bind and wrap around each other, drawing the two bilayers close together in the process. The situation is further complicated when considering fusion in vivo since biological fusion is almost always regulated by the action of membrane- associated proteins. The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an enveloped virus to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Broadly, there are two classes of viral fusion proteins: acidic and pH-independent. pH independent fusion proteins can function under neutral conditions and fuse with the plasma membrane, allowing viral entry into the cell. Viruses utilizing this scheme included HIV, measles and herpes. Acidic fusion proteins such as those found on influenza are only activated when in the low pH of acidic endosomes and must first be endocytosed to gain entry into the cell. Eukaryotic cells use entirely different classes of fusion proteins, the best studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion. Even once the role of SNAREs or other specific proteins is illuminated, a unified understanding of fusion proteins is unlikely as there is an enormous diversity of structure and function within these classes, and very few themes are conserved. Fusion in laboratory practice In studies of molecular and cellular biology it is often desirable to artificially induce fusion. Although this can be accomplished with the addition of calcium as discussed earlier, this procedure is often not feasible because calcium regulates many other biochemical processes and its addition would be a strong confound. Also, as mentioned, calcium induces massive aggregation as well as fusion. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) causes fusion without significant aggregation or biochemical disruption. This procedure is now used extensively, for example by fusing B-cells with myeloma cells. The resulting ‚Äúhybridoma‚Äù from this combination expresses a desired antibody as determined by the B-cell involved, but is immortalized due to the myeloma component. The mechanism of PEG fusion has not been definitively identified, but some researchers believe that the PEG, by binding a large number of water molecules, effectively decreases the chemical activity of the water and thus dehydrates the lipid headgroups. Fusion can also be artificially induced through electroporation in a process known as electrofusion. It is believed that this phenomenon results from the energetically active edges formed during electroporation, which can act as the local defect point to nucleate stalk growth between two bilayers. Assays to measure membrane fusion There are two levels of fusion: mixing of membrane lipids and mixing of contents. Assays of membrane fusion report either the mixing of membrane lipids or the mixing of the aqueous contents of the fused entities. Assays for measuring lipid mixing Assays evaluating lipid mixing make use of concentration dependent effects such as nonradiative energy transfer, fluorescence quenching and pyrene eximer formation. (1.) Illustration of lipid mixing assay based on F√∂rster resonance energy transfer. (3.) Illustration of lipid mixing assay based on Fluorescence self-quenching. #NBD-Rhodamine Energy Transfer: In this method, membrane labeled with both NBD (donor) and Rhodamine (acceptor) combine with unlabeled membrane. When NBD and Rhodamine are within a certain distance, the F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) happens. After fusion, resonance energy transfer (FRET) decreases when the average distance between probes increases, while NBD fluorescence increases. #Pyrene Excimer Formation: Pyrene monomer and excimer emission wavelengths are different. The emission wavelength of monomer is around 400 nm and that of excimer is around 470 nm. In this method, membrane labeled with Pyrene combines with unlabeled membrane. Pyrene self associates in membrane and then excited pyrene excites other pyrene. Before fusion, the majority of the emission is excimer emission. After fusion, the distance between probes increases and the ratio of excimer emission decreases. #Octadecyl Rhodamine B Self-Quenching: This assay is based on self-quenching of octadecyl rhodamine B. Octadecyl rhodamine B self- quenching occurs when the probe is incorporated into membrane lipids at concentrations of 1‚Äì10 mole percent because Rhodamine dimers quench fluorescence. In this method, membrane labeled Rhodamine combines with unlabeled membrane. Fusion with unlabeled membranes resulting in dilution of the probe, which is accompanied by increasing fluorescence. The major problem of this assay is spontaneous transfer. Assays for measuring content mixing Mixing of aqueous contents from vesicles as a result of lysis, fusion or physiological permeability can be detected fluorometrically using low molecular weight soluble tracers. (1.) Illustration of content mixing assay based on fluorescence quencing pair ANTS/DPX. (2.)Illustration of content mixing assay based on fluorescence enhancement pair Tb3+/DPA. #Fluorescence quenching assays with ANTS/DPX: ANTS is a polyanionic fluorophore, while DPX is a cationic quencher. The assay is based on the collisional quenching of them. Separate vesicle populations are loaded with ANTS or DPX, respectively. When content mixing happens, ANTS and DPX collide and fluorescence of ANTS monitored at 530 nm, with excitation at 360 nm is quenched. This method is performed at acidic pH and high concentration. #Fluorescence enhancement assays with Tb3+/DPA: This method is based on the fact that chelate of Tb3+/DPA is 10,000 times more fluorescent than Tb3+ alone. In the Tb3+/DPA assay, separate vesicle populations are loaded with TbCl3 or DPA. The formation of Tb3+/DPA chelate can be used to indicate vesicle fusion. This method is good for protein free membranes. #Single molecule DNA assay. A DNA hairpin composed of 5 base pair stem and poly- thymidine loop that is labeled with a donor (Cy3) and an acceptor (Cy5) at the ends of the stem was encapsulated in the v-SNARE vesicle. We separately encapsulated multiple unlabeled poly-adenosine DNA strands in the t-SNARE vesicle. If the two vesicles, both ~100 nm in diameter, dock and a large enough fusion pore forms between them, the two DNA molecules should hybridize, opening up the stem region of the hairpin and switching the F√∂rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency (E) between Cy3 and Cy5 from a high to a low value.

An inspirational African-American athlete, Drew was once considered the \\"world‚Äôs fastest man\\", known as the first great black sprinter, and went from being an Olympic track athlete to serving in World War I to becoming a judge in Hartford, Connecticut later in life.  Early life  Born in Lexington, Virginia, Howard Drew and his family settled in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1904. His father was a Baptist minister, and both parents agreed they did not want to raise Howard in the Jim Crow south. A graduate from Springfield (Central) High School, Drew showed exceptional athletic abilities even upon entering high school. Known for winning track meets‚Äîregardless of sporting apparel‚Äîhe soon became recognized nationally, later setting world records in the 50, 100 and 220 yard dash. In his early years in high school it had ‚Äúbeen said that he often raced the horses going to a fire, since few men in the area would compete with him‚Äù (Davis-HarrisJeanette G. Davis-Harris (1976). Springfield's Ethnic Heritage: The Black Community. An Interpretation of the Black History of Springfield, Massachusetts ‚Äì from the mid 1600s through 1940. U.S.A. Bicentennial Committee of Springfield, Inc., p. 32.). This all took place while in high school. Drew scored more points individually than other high school teams during track meets, and he had already tied world records at the midpoint of his high school athletic career. He is known for winning his first two races in high school (age 15) wearing his own shorts that he made and, on top of this, he won one race barefooted and one race wearing what would today be called cleats. But for him, these cleats were his own creation of inserting nails into his track shoes and cushioning this with leather. Drew impressed everyone by winning the first 100-yard dash with these cleats, and the next 440-yard dash on cinder track without anything on his feet at the Fourth of July ‚ÄúSpringfield City Games‚Äù that year (AAR).  Life and legacy   Athletic career  Drew's multi-faceted life served as a powerful model for young black men, especially considering the bravery and fortitude he exemplified during his time of maturity. Drew's career begins as someone who dropped out of high school to support this family, only to return in 1910 (age 20) to begin setting track records and dominating both baseball and football opponents. He was a star football athlete, playing running back on the Springfield Football Team made up of players from all high schools in Springfield. He, alongside Bertram Smith and Hobart Johnson were the starts in the years of 1907-1910 (Davis-Harris)). Drew won the Harvard Stadium Olympic qualifiers and went on to win the US Trials in Michigan through the personal support of Jack Sullivan, current head of the National AAU, as well as donations received from the Springfield newspapers bringing Drew's name to fame. He set the world record at the time for the 100yd dash, as he cruised past one of the fastest Americans at the time, Ralph Craig. Ongoing support, even from the Mayor of Boston, enabled Drew to go to Sweden for the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. Here he won the initial races but threw out one of his legs while stepping on a soft spot on the track as he still won first place in the 100m semi-final. Nevertheless, Drew didn't have the fastest time at Stockholm - healthy or not - that went to D.F. Lippincott who ran 10.6 for the Olympic record in a heat which lasted until 1932. Lippincott finished second to Ralph Craig in the 100 final. The next year Lippincott tied Drew's 100 yard record of 9.6. While at USC (1913-1916) he, quite naturally, tied or set the world records (ranging from 30 to 250 yd dashes) and caught the attention of the press as the first person to ever be called ‚Äúthe fastest man in the world‚Äù‚Äîas well as ‚ÄúCrack Colored Sprinter,‚Äù ‚ÄúNegro Dash Man‚Äù and more. And were it not for World War I there would have been an Olympics in 1916. Drew was pushing his 30s in 1920 and did not make the cut.  Education, enlisting in the U.S. Army  Drew had always strove to be a strong student academically and athletically. He frequently wrote as a journalist for the local newspaper, and he received all A's on average during his college years at USC. Later doing graduate studies at Drake University, he blended his abilities, serving as a motivational speaker and track coach while at Drake. Around this time it is noted that in 1915 he was captured in the ‚ÄúEducation Number‚Äù special of the NAACP's The Crisis, and also met Booker T. Washington‚Äîwhich was one of the signifying moments in defining the status of Howard Porter Drew (Coach Larry‚Äîsee pdf below). But Drew never let go of his intellectual abilities, even though he took time off to enlist in World War I. He later became the Victory Medal award-winning sergeant for the Supply Company, 809th Pioneer Infantry Regiment, and the 88th Division of the U.S. Army. He coached Army track teams while in France and was Honorably Discharged in 1919‚Äîreceiving the Victory Medal and a defensive bar for his actions and service.  Later years  Having been honorably discharged, he relentlessly went on to take advantage of this time to pass the bar exam in 1920 in Connecticut. He soon moved to Hartford to become one of four black attorneys at the time. He married Dora Helen Newcomb. They welcomed Howard Jr. and Jean into their lives shortly after. His reputation in Hartford grew as he was both assistant clerk and a judge. He had been the Justice of the Peace in the 1940s, setting records in the arena of being the first Black man in Connecticut to do such things. During World War II he served on the local draft board. Drew died at the U.S. Veterans Hospital in West Haven, Connecticut (Black Past), and he now rests just north of Hartford, near where he raised his family. References External links * Howard P.

The jet intakes are located at the sides of the fuselage and the tricycle undercarriage is retractable. Construction throughout is of composite materials.. Development Originally conceived to use a piston engine driving a five- or six-blade pusher propeller, brothers Scott and Dan Hanchette commenced work on the prototype, then known as the ViperFan,Freeze 2005, p. 10C in February 1996.Saywers 2006, p. 14 However, concerns about the difficulty and cost associated with eliminating vibration from the drivetrain led the Hanchettes to choose turbojet propulsion instead, and they installed a Turbomeca Marbor√© engine in place of the Continental flat-6 they had originally envisaged as a powerplant. The Viperjet prototype flew late in October 1999. and made its public debut at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh in 2000.Hitchman 2000, p. 44. The Hanchette brothers, however, were unhappy with both the low powerSaywers 2006, p. 1 and the high fuel consumptionFreeze 2005, p.11C of the Turbomeca engine, and soon swapped it for a General Electric T58 turboshaft engine with the power turbine removed, turning it into a turbojet. While this worked, it still did not produce as much thrust as the Hanchettes hoped for, and eventually, they selected the General Electric J85. With this engine producing around four times the thrust of the previous powerplants tested in the Viper, the Hanchettes substantially redesigned the aircraft, dubbing the J85-powered version the MKII. The prototype was dismantled and rebuilt, with parts of the canopy and fuselage center section all that remained of the original design.

The MKII prototype flew on 12 June 2005 and Viper Aircraft offered replacement MKII parts to all customers who had purchased kits of the original version, now dubbed the MKI. In 2006, the base MKII kit cost US$182,000, but since builders can purchase additional components already pre-made by Viper Aircraft, customers spent an average of $350,000 on their kits. They would then have to spend approximately another $300,000 and around 3,000 to 3,500 hours to complete the aircraft.

It was built in the 16th century to protect the southern border of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The castle originated as the residence of a Polish nobleman, Jan Amor Tarnowski, in 1540. Construction works (1540‚Äì1548) on the marshy bank of the Seret River were authorized by King Sigismund the Old. The castle, around which the modern town has developed, was encircled by a wooden fence and a deep moat. The latter was connected in 1548 to the castle pond (see Ternopil Pond).  History   Construction  King Sigismund granted land ownership and rights erecting the castle to the great Polish Crown Hetman, Jan Tarnowski. Concurrently in the valley of Seret river a levee and dam with a bridge crossing were constructed, resulting in the stream pooling, thus filling a new lake. Out from the north the castle and the city was protected by the Rudka river harboring a boggy holm, while on the southern side would be Bavorovsky pond which vanished in a later time. A narrow, dry strip of land factually being a moat banked by a mound with inside masonry reinforced with an oak stockade would set the castle ground apart. Rectangular-shaped towers housing embrasures stood tall on the outer fringes. The entrance was permitted from the east via stone gatehouse secured with a chain hoist drawbridge. The principal castle building represented by the residential palace, due to natural fortress placing, possessed varied floor levels: besides three main floors visible from the city outskirts, two underground levels being revealed out of a lake steep bank altogether with the two rows of embrasures. The first record in Ternopil's annals entered on April 15, 1540 was related to the king's ascent given to Krak√≥w nobleman Jan Tarnowski regarding constructing the castle over the Seret river. This fortification had to seal nomad advancement through the wide plains from Terebovlya (then known as Trembowla) to Busk. At the same time the natural terrain of the environment would permit security provisions for a given locale. Castle construction lasted for 8 years and completed in 1548. Perquisites of 1566 mention Ternopil's fortress and its founder. Due to significant losses sustained on construction project, the city was relieved of much of the taxation burden. Consequently, the castle was reinforced and upgraded by Tarnowski's son, Krzysztof. Sizable expense was credited towards enlargement and improvement by Tomasz Zamoyski, who received the city as his wife's dowry, daughter of renowned Ruthenian maecenas and statesman, Konstanty Ostrogski. In the early 17th century, Ternopil, known then as Tarnopol, passed through inheritance in the female line to Tomasz Zamoyski who commissioned extensive renovations. It was besieged by the Turks in 1544, 1575, 1589 and 1672. The Ottoman army under ≈ûi≈üman ƒ∞brahim Pa≈üa reduced the castle to ruins in 1675. Count Korytowski revived it in the 1840s as his summer residence; he also had its towers, walls and other fortifications dismantled.16th century map of Ternopil Castle location  Tatar invasion  In the course of its history Ternopil Castle was a subject of frequent attacks and destruction. No sooner development projects began, as Tatars attempted inroads on the city. Owing to the town home guard spearheaded by Bernard Pretwicz, Jan Gerburt, and Prokyp Sieniawski, the horde was held back until a force of knights arrived from the vicinity of Sandomierz. The castle sustained significant damage in 1575, 1589, and 1672. In 1675 ≈ûi≈üman ƒ∞brahim Pa≈üa broke a camp next to Ternopil and besieged the city. As Tatars and Turks committed assaults, town dwellers sought refuge in the castle cellars accommodated to withstand prolonged confrontation. A network of underground passageways connected the bulwark with Nadstavna, Serrednya to Monastirska churches, Dominikan, and Jesuit cathedral and synagogues. Underground networks event possible from under the lake to Zagrebelia. In 1621 Tomasz Zamoyski, the castle owner, completed restoration and entertained prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa. Knowledge about the castle, town, and the vicinity became available from the journal of German explorer and traveler, Ulrich von Werdum, who used to traverse the countryside near Ternopil between July 1671 and January 1672. In 1675 Turks burned the outpost, destroyed fortifications, blew up both towers that have never been rebuilt anew. The castle was reconstructed at the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th.  19th century  19th century Ternopil Castle outlook In 1810 Russians accommodated the castle to a \\"dance casino\\", where Mayor Tails would arrange societarian receptions. At the beginning of the 19th century, Count Korytowski rebuilt the structure into a palace having demolished defense bulwarks, towers, and gates while raising masonry walls instead. On the southern perimeter the three-story New Castle was constructed, a new Gate House was erected incorporating narrow wicket-gate and two masonry pylons. In 1843 the last owner of Ternopil City, Turkul, sold the castle to the town community that in turn was transferred to the Austrian army having utilized it for barracks.  20th century  The Russian army, in their retreat from the city on July 21, 1917, burned the Old Castle. On April 15, 1931 the building was restored anew and a religious blessing ceremony was held. It was occupied by an Officer Cadet Reserve School and a Science Committee of Baborovski that secured a valuable collection of manuscripts and documents. During the Second World War the fort-post was the last defense foothold of the German army as it was being decimated by the advancing Red Army. The ruins of a new castle were cleaned out and on its place the hotel \\"Ternopil\\" was built.  Restoration  The Old Castle was rebuilt in 1956 and then utilized for sporting events held by a regional sports establishment. In 1969 a Greco-Roman School of wrestling had its base there. From original castle what remained was only ground work retained in the form of the foundation with its walls thickness of 2, 5-4, and 5 meters.

Its first chapter was released in 2005, and it was produced until 2010. The story is of a middle-schooler named Gangryong Ma, who is saved one day by a remarkably strong man, Lightning Tiger, who becomes his master, and teaches him a martial art known as the Enlightenment Of Thunder and Lightning (or EOTL), thereby introducing him to a world of power that will change his life forever. Plot Gangryong Ma was the boss of his middle school, getting in fistfights almost every day. He thought that winning those fistfights was what it meant to be strong. That all ended when he met Lightning Tiger, a man whose power dwarfed that of any man Gangryong had ever met before. After arguing, begging, and jumping through hoops for a year to prove his loyalty, Gangryong convinced Lightning Tiger to be his master. For two months, Lightning Tiger taught Gangryong the secret of ki manipulation by way of the Enlightenment Of Thunder and Lightning (EOTL), a traditional Korean martial art passed on through the centuries to one student at a time. By properly refining and focusing his Ki, Gangryong learned not only to increase his overall physical strength, but he gained the ability to create devastatingly powerful lightning attacks. When the two months were up, Lightning Tiger left Gangryong, warning him of an inevitable battle against a strong enemy and hoping that they might one day see each other. Months later, Gangryong was approached by an ominous group of men. He was presented with a box, and was told that it contained the arm of Lightning Tiger, whom they had supposedly killed. These men were from Reunion, a multinational organization whose main goals were the collection, evolution and eventual perfection of traditional martial arts and the creation of artificial ki, or natural energy, which could be used to make people more powerful. They forced Gangryong to enter a special school designed to train suitable fighters in the fighting styles that had been collected and created by Reunion. Now, within Reunion, Gangryong finds himself a flash-point for controversy. As student of a sworn enemy of Reunion, there are many who want him dead. As the sole practitioner of EOTL, there are many who desire to see his success, so that they may use his techniques. All the while, Gangryong must work to uncover the secrets in the training he was given, so that he may achieve the power he seeks, and finally avenge the presumed deceased Lightning Tiger.

The law was established by French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1653 and published in 1663.Blaise Pascal, Traitez de l'Equilibre des Liqueurs (Treatise on the Equilibrium of Fluids), Paris, 1663. Definition Pressure in water and air. Pascal's law applies for fluids. Pascal's principle is defined as This principle is stated mathematically as: : \\\\Delta p =\\\\rho g \\\\cdot\\\\Delta h\\\\, : is the hydrostatic pressure (given in pascals in the SI system), or the difference in pressure at two points within a fluid column, due to the weight of the fluid; :œÅ is the fluid density (in kilograms per cubic meter in the SI system); :g is acceleration due to gravity (normally using the sea level acceleration due to Earth's gravity, in meters per second squared); : is the height of fluid above the point of measurement, or the difference in elevation between the two points within the fluid column (in meters). The intuitive explanation of this formula is that the change in pressure between two elevations is due to the weight of the fluid between the elevations. Alternatively, the result can be interpreted as a pressure change caused by the change of potential energy per unit volume of the liquid due to the existence of the gravitational field. Note that the variation with height does not depend on any additional pressures. Therefore, Pascal's law can be interpreted as saying that any change in pressure applied at any given point of the fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid. The formula is a specific case of Navier‚ÄìStokes equations without inertia and viscosity terms.Acheson, D. J. (1990), Elementary Fluid Dynamics, Oxford Applied Mathematics and Computing Science Series, Oxford University Press, Explanation If a U-tube is filled with water and pistons are placed at each end, pressure exerted against the left piston will be transmitted throughout the liquid and against the bottom of the right piston. (The pistons are simply \\"plugs\\" that can slide freely but snugly inside the tube.) The pressure that the left piston exerts against the water will be exactly equal to the pressure the water exerts against the right piston. Suppose the tube on the right side is made wider and a piston of a larger area is used; for example, the piston on the right has 50 times the area of the piston on the left. If a 1 N load is placed on the left piston, an additional pressure due to the weight of the load is transmitted throughout the liquid and up against the larger piston. The difference between force and pressure is important: the additional pressure is exerted against the entire area of the larger piston. Since there is 50 times the area, 50 times as much force is exerted on the larger piston. Thus, the larger piston will support a 50 N load - fifty times the load on the smaller piston. Forces can be multiplied using such a device. One newton input produces 50 newtons output. By further increasing the area of the larger piston (or reducing the area of the smaller piston), forces can be multiplied, in principle, by any amount. Pascal's principle underlies the operation of the hydraulic press. The hydraulic press does not violate energy conservation, because a decrease in distance moved compensates for the increase in force. When the small piston is moved downward 100 centimeters, the large piston will be raised only one-fiftieth of this, or 2 centimeters. The input force multiplied by the distance moved by the smaller piston is equal to the output force multiplied by the distance moved by the larger piston; this is one more example of a simple machine operating on the same principle as a mechanical lever. A typical application of Pascal's principle for gases and liquids is the automobile lift seen in many service stations (the hydraulic jack). Increased air pressure produced by an air compressor is transmitted through the air to the surface of oil in an underground reservoir. The oil, in turn, transmits the pressure to a piston, which lifts the automobile. The relatively low pressure that exerts the lifting force against the piston is about the same as the air pressure in automobile tires. Hydraulics is employed by modern devices ranging from very small to enormous. For example, there are hydraulic pistons in almost all construction machines where heavy loads are involved. Pascal's barrel An illustration of Pascal's barrel experiment from The forces of nature by Am√©d√©e Guillemin (1872). Pascal's barrel is the name of a hydrostatics experiment allegedly performed by Blaise Pascal in 1646. In the experiment, Pascal supposedly inserted a long vertical tube into a barrel filled with water. When water was poured into the vertical tube, the increase in hydrostatic pressure caused the barrel to burst. The experiment is mentioned nowhere in Pascal's preserved works and it may be apocryphal, attributed to him by 19th-century French authors, among whom the experiment is known as cr√®ve-tonneau (approx.: \\"barrel-buster\\");perhaps first in an educational context; the attribution is found under this name in A. Merlette, L'encyclop√©die des √©coles, journal de l'enseignement primaire et professionnel (1863) p. 284 : l'exp√©rience du cr√®ve-tonneau r√©alis√©e pour la premi√®re fois par le c√©l√®bre Biaise Pascal.

The score was composed by Carter Burwell. Plot In 1955, drifter Clay Hewitt (Vince Vaughn) wanders into a small Kansas town seeking employment to finance a visit to his older brother in California. He develops a relationship with local beauty queen Kitty (Ashley Judd) and befriends farmhand Earl (Paul Rudd), who gets him a job at a local cattle farm owned by wealthy widow Delilah Ashford Potts (Kate Capshaw), known for maintaining sexual relationships with her young employees. Delilah‚Äôs husband committed suicide after catching her cheating on him. Clay rejects Delilah‚Äôs advances, and quickly develops a rivalry with her latest lover, Joel Carter (Daniel Meyer). Clay befriends Delilah‚Äôs sensitive and introverted son, Joseph ‚ÄúFlyboy‚Äù Potts (Jeremy Davies), who has just returned from a psychiatric institution and whose only companion is his late father‚Äôs aging pet bull. Flyboy was institutionalized for eight years after finding his father‚Äôs corpse as a child, and is constantly emasculated by Delilah by being forced to cook and clean for the farmhands, who frequently mistreat him. Clay takes Flyboy under his wing and confides to him that his older brother died in an accident two years prior. At Clay‚Äôs suggestion, Flyboy asks Delilah to be allowed to work with the animals at the farm. Delilah responds by having Joel tie up Flyboy and force him to watch as she castrates Flyboy‚Äôs pet bull, which bleeds to death. Horrified by Delilah‚Äôs cruelty, Joel ends their romance and leaves the farm, and Delilah departs soon afterwards for a business trip. Clay admits to Kitty that he is on the run from the authorities after being wrongfully blamed for the death of an old girlfriend in his hometown ‚Äì They were having sex in a pool when she slipped and broke her neck. He plans to skip town, and enlists her help to teach Flyboy how to stand up for himself before leaving. Kitty sets Flyboy up with one of her friends, but when she attempts to get intimate, Flyboy breaks down and admits to Clay that Delilah sexually abused him when he was a child and arranged for his father to catch them, driving him to suicide, for which Flyboy blames himself. Disgusted, Clay decides to take Flyboy with him. While Flyboy and Kitty wait for him at the lake, Clay returns to the farm to retrieve his payment and is confronted by Delilah, who has learned about the criminal charges against him. Delilah reveals that she became pregnant from being raped by her father, whom she killed in a fit of rage. Her husband, an old friend of her father, agreed to marry her and raise Flyboy as his own child to spare her the shame, but Delilah could never bring herself to love either of them, and instead sought to destroy them. She blackmails Clay into having sex with her in exchange for not turning him in. Flyboy returns to the farm to search for Clay and finds him in bed with Delilah, as she had intended. Heartbroken, Flyboy commits suicide in the same manner as his father did. An enraged Clay goes after Delilah, but she shoots herself before he gets to her. Kitty arrives and comforts Clay as he mourns Flyboy‚Äôs death, and they then leave town together.

It was adopted on 9 June 2009 by the Montenegrin Minister of Education, Sreten ≈†kuletiƒá and replaced the Serbian Cyrillic and Gaj's Latin alphabets in use at the time. Although the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets enjoy equal status under the Constitution of Montenegro, the government and proponents of the Montenegrin language prefer to use the Latin script; it is also much more widely used in all aspects of the day-to-day written communication in the country, in education, advertising and media.

Montenegrin Latin is based on Serbo-Croatian Latin, with the addition of the two letters ≈ö and ≈π, to replace the pairs SJ and ZJ (so anachronisticly considered as digraphs). These parallel the two letters of the Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet not found in Serbian, –°ÃÅ and –óÃÅ, and could also be represented in the original alphabets as sj and zj, and —Åj and –∑j, respectively. It also uses some Latin extended letters, composed with a basic Latin letter and one of two combining accents (the acute accent or caron, over C, S, and Z), and a supplementary base consonant ƒê: they are needed to note additional phonetic distinctions (notably to preserve the distinctions that are present in the Cyrillic script with which the Montenegrin language has also long been written, when it was still unified in the former Yugoslavia within the written Serbo-Croatian language). Digraphs The alphabet also includes some digraphs built from the previous characters (that are considered as single letters for collation purpose): D≈æ, Nj, and Lj. Cyrillic alphabet The Montenegrin Cyrillic alphabet ( / or / ) is official Cyrillic writing of the Montenegrin language. It is used in parallel with Latin script. * Azbuka: –ê –ë –í –ì –î –Ç –ï –ñ –ó –óÃÅ –ò –à –ö –õ –â –ú –ù –ä –û –ü –† –° –°ÃÅ –¢ –ã –£ –§ –• –¶ –ß –è –® Its first version was developed by Vojislav Nikƒçeviƒá in the 1970s who was a dissident of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and considered Montenegrin speech to be unique and deserving of consideration as a separate language from Serbo-Croatian. The modern version was brought into official use in early 2009 by the Ministry of Education under Sreten ≈†kuletiƒá. It was called the First Montenegrin Orthography, included a new Orthographic Dictionary, and replaced the Serbian Cyrillic script which was official until then. The act is a component part of the process of standardisation of the Montenegrin language, starting in mid-2008 after the adoption of Montenegrin as the official language of Montenegro.

He was a 240-pound, former Walter Camp second-team All- American tackle from the University of Pennsylvania. He also played two years at Peddie Institute, in New Jersey, winning state championships in 1896 and 1897. During his professional playing career he was involved in almost every major event in professional football between 1902 and 1907. Over that timespan he played for the independent Philadelphia Athletic Club, the Philadelphia Athletics of the first National Football League, the \\"New York\\" team and the Syracuse Athletic Club in the 1902 World Series of Football, the Franklin Athletic Club and the Canton Bulldogs of the Ohio League. Football career 1902 NFL season In 1902, Col. John Rogers, owner of the National League's Philadelphia Phillies, decided to bankroll the Philadelphia Athletic Club football team. Upon hearing of this, Wallace approached Ben Shibe of the rival American League's Philadelphia Athletics to see whether the Athletics would be following suit and fielding a football team. Not wanting his rivals to be unchallenged, Shibe decided to form a team with Wallace as the team's player-coach. The Athletics baseball manager, Connie Mack, was then named the team's manager. The football Philadelphia Athletics finished the 1902 NFL season with a 5‚Äì2‚Äì2 record for a controversial second-place finish behind the Pittsburgh Stars. The league then folded immediately after the season. 1902 World Series of Football After the NFL season, Wallace played in the World Series of Football in 1902 at Madison Square Garden. He played on a team that consisted of former players from the football Athletics and the football Philadelphia Phillies of the NFL. The name of their team was simply called the \\"New York\\" team by Series organizer, Tom O'Rourke, expected to give his patrons the pleasure of watching a \\"home team\\" win. Syracuse defeated Wallace and the \\"New York\\" club in what has been called the first indoor pro football game. However Blondy would get a second chance winning the series after Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner of the Syracuse Athletic Club suffered a head injury and was replaced by Wallace. Syracuse would go on to win the series championship by a score of 36-0. Franklin Athletic Club In 1903, Bill Prince, the manager of the Franklin Athletic Club, loaded his team with every star football player available. That year, Wallace became the team's captain. That year Franklin posted a 12-0 record and won the 1903 World Series of Football. This accomplishment makes Blondy a winner on both the 1902 and 1903 World Series teams. Canton Bulldogs In 1905 Wallace became the second coach of the Canton Athletic Club (renamed the Canton Bulldogs in 1906). That year Wallace, signed an agreement with the Latrobe Athletic Association, led by quarterback John Brallier, to play against Canton in Latrobe. Latrobe, under Brallier, was not only the current Pennsylvania football champion, but were undefeated for the last three seasons. They were also considered the only professional team capable of competing at the same level as Canton and the Massillon Tigers. Canton would go on to lose the game to Latrobe, however the team was the runner-up in the Ohio League standings for the 1905 season. Wallace added four former Massillon players to his team in 1906. That year the Bulldogs was able to win their first game against Massillon, during a 2-game home-and-home series at Canton, however they lost the second game at Massillon, and the Tigers again claimed the Ohio championship. Shortly afterward that second game, a Massillon newspaper charged Wallace with fixing the 1906 championship game. The Bulldogs and Wallace denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to ruin the club's reputation before their final game against Latrobe. Wallace later filed a libel lawsuit against the Massillon paper. However, Wallace was in need of money, and the case was reportedly settled out of court. Referee Wallace also held the job of referee. In 1904 he served as a Head Linesman for a game between Lafayette College and Swarthmore College. Lafayette would go on to win the game 4-0.http://warner.lafayette.edu/cgi- bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/lafayette&CISOPTR;=25224&CISOMODE;=print Bootlegger Wallace later became a bootlegger in Atlantic City. Harry March his 1934 a book titled Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs, which documented the Canton-Massillon betting scandal, called Wallace \\"The King of the Bootleggers\\". In 1933 he was convicted of evading income tax payments and sentenced to one year in a federal penitentiary. He was formally accused of evading payment to the government of $4,196.72 in 1929 and $1,953.52 in 1930.

Indian Science Congress Association, Presidential Addresses By Indian Science Congress Association. Published by Orient Blackswan, 2003. Her most notable work includes research on vinca alkaloids, the development of anti-epileptic drugs, and development of anti-malarial drugs. She also authored a considerable volume of work on medicinal plants of the Indian subcontinent. She was the first woman to receive a Doctorate of Science from an Indian university. Biography Early life Asima Chatterjee (n√©e Mukherjee ) was born on 23 September 1917 in Bengal. She was the eldest of the two children of a medical doctor Indra Narayan Mukherjee and his wife, Kamala Devi. Chatterjee grew up in Calcutta in a middle-class family where she was encouraged to be in academia. Her father was very interested in botany and Chatterjee shared in his interest. She graduated with honors in chemistry from the Scottish Church College of the University of Calcutta in 1936.Some Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume Scottish Church College, 2008, p. 584Chemistry alumni of Scottish Church College Academic work Asima Chatterjee received a master's degree (1938) and a doctoral degree (1944) in organic chemistry from the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta. She was the first Indian woman to earn a doctorate in science. Her doctoral research focused on the chemistry of plant products and synthetic organic chemistry. Among her notable instructors at the time were Prafulla Chandra Roy and Satyendra Nath Bose. Additionally, she had research experience from the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Caltech with L√°szl√≥ Zechmeister. Chatterjee's research concentrated on natural products chemistry and resulted in anti-convulsive, anti-malarial, and chemotherapy drugs. She spent around forty years researching various alkaloid compounds. She also discovered anti- epileptic activity in Marsilea minuta and anti-malarial activity in the plants Alstonia scholaris, Swertia chirata, Picrorhiza kurroa and Caesalpinia crista. These agents, however, have not been shown to be clinically competitive with the medications currently used for these conditions. Her work led to the development of an epilepsy drug called Ayush-56 and several anti-malarial drugs. Chatterjee also wrote around 400 papers which were published in both national and international journals.  Achievements Chatterjee's contributions to science include the following: * Initiated chemical investigation of alkaloids in Rauwolfia canescens. * Investigated the chemistry of almost all principal types of indole alkaloids. * Contributions to the elucidation of the structure and stereochemistry of ajmalicine and sarpagine. * First suggested stereo-configuration of sarpagine. * Isolated and characterised geissoschizine, a key precursor in biogenesis of indole alkaloids from Rhazya stricta. * Carried out synthetic studies on a number of complex indole, quinoline and isoquinoline alkaloids. * Developed procedures for the preparation of beta-phenylethanolamines in connection with alkaloid synthesis. * Elucidated the structure of luvangetin isolated from Luvanga scandens. * Studied the action of various Lewis acids on prenylated coumarins and devised simple synthetic routes to a number of complex coumarin systems. * Investigated the mechanism of acid-catalysed hydramine fission of beta phenylethanol amines. * Introduced the use of periodic acid as a reagent for the detection and location of both terminal and exocyclic double bonds in organic compounds. Career She joined the Bethune College of the University of Calcutta and founded the department of chemistry there. In 1954, Asima Chatterjee joined the University College of Science of the University of Calcutta, as reader in pure chemistry.

After his return, he published a French translation of the Francis Bacon's letter Advancement of learning. First he worked as a translator at the French court, later for the Cardinal Richelieu. This made him in 1630 the Prior of the Monastery St. Pierre-Eynac in Le Puy-en-Velay. In 1634, he published a translation of another Bacon's letter Considerations Touching on a War with Spain.

Kelly joined the team during the 1943 championship and later became a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement following the conclusion of the 1947 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals and three Munster medals. Kelly was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Kelly played with the famous Glen Rovers. Playing career Club Kelly played his club hurling with the famous Glen Rovers club on the north side of Cork city. He enjoyed little success at minor level before joining the club‚Äôs senior team. In spite of the Glen going through a hugely successful period during the 1940s, Kelly helped the team to many championship titles but never played in a county final himself. Inter-county Kelly first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1941. He won a Munster medal that year following a 4-6 to 3-3 defeat of Tipperary. He later lined out in an All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny. A 5-2 to 2-2 score line gave Cork the victory and gave Kelly an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. By 1943 Kelly had joined the Cork senior team. He was unused substitute that year as Cork claimed both the Munster and All-Ireland crowns. In 1944 Kelly made his championship debut as Cork were attempting to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. No team in the history of the hurling championship had won more than three consecutive titles. The year got off to a good start when Cork defeated Limerick by 4-6 to 3-6 after a replay to give Kelly a first Munster medal. For the third time in four years Cork faced Dublin in an All- Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2-13 to 1-2 victory. It was a first All-Ireland medal for Kelly. Five-in-a-row proved to be a bridge too far for Cork, however, the team returned in 1946. A 3-8 to 1-3 defeat of Limerick gave Kelly his second Munster medal. Under the captaincy of Christy Ring, Cork subsequently faced old rivals Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. While some had written off Cork's chances, they took an interval lead of four points. With ten minutes remaining Cork's lead was reduced to just two points, however, goals by Mossy O'Riordan and Kelly secured the victory. A 7-6 to 3-8 score line gave Kelly a second All-Ireland medal. Cork retained their provincial dominance in 1947 with Kelly picking up a third winners' medal following a three-point victory over Limerick. The All-Ireland final was a repeat of the previous year with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All- Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and Kelly's side were beaten by 0-14 to 2-7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in an All-Ireland final. Kelly was ordained a priest in June 1949 and effectively brought his inter-county career to an official end.

He served as the party secretary from 2002 until 2009. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 2009 and since 2013 serves as leader of the Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs. Early life and education Kolberg was born in the city of Drammen, Buskerud. He is the son of railroad worker Kjell O. J. Kolberg (1921-) and homemaker Ruth Utengen (1921-2006). After finishing primary school, Kolberg attended Oslo Technical College, but later dropped out. He since completed training as an electrician. He held a variety of jobs, including mailman, Lab assistant at a cable wire factory and also as assistant at the local shoe-factory. Political career Kolberg served as a deputy representative in the Norwegian Parliament from 1977 to 1981. He served as a deputy representative for the second time from 2001 to 2005, and met regularly from 1 October to 19 October 2001 while Thorbj√∏rn Jagland was Minister of Foreign Affairs. In total he met 144 days as a deputy. From 13 July 1995 to 25 October 1996, Kolberg was state secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister under the third cabinet Brundtland. When the new cabinet Jagland was announced, it became clear that the new prime minister, Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, who was also Kolberg's childhood friend, had discarded him as state secretary. Kolberg reacted with anger and frustration, and the media portrayed the matter as Jagland firing his best friend. Jagland stated that \\"Martin had wanted to work for Gro [Harlem Brundtland] ... I really wanted him to work as party secretary\\". To Kolberg's reaction, Jagland stated: \\"I followed an agreement between us, and I thought he did not want the job. I am very surprised by his reaction\\". Jagland further stated that it was all a misunderstanding, because he Jagland thought that Kolberg did not want to work with \\"the Norwegian House\\". Five days later, Kolberg was appointed state secretary in the Ministry of Defence, where he remained until the cabined withdrew on 17 October 1997, following the defeat in the 1997 election. Since 2002 he has been the party secretary of the Labour Party. In 2009 he will step down, choosing instead to stand for election again, this time with the prospect of winning a seat of his own. Several people have been suggested for the vacant position as party secretary, including Geir Axelsen, Rita Ottervik, Karl Eirik Schj√∏tt-Pedersen, Raymond Johansen, Trond Giske and Bjarne H√•kon Hanssen.

Bilateral vestibulopathy causes problems in hearing balance, and motor coordination. Symptoms Symptoms typically include imbalance and visual problems.

Oscillopsia, visual symptoms of bilateral vestibulopathy, occur only when the head is moving.J.C. Living without a balancing mechanism.

Diagnosis A review of symptoms, a medical history, and a physical examination or vestibular tests in a rotary chair are needed to make the diagnosis. There are several different causes of bilateral vestibulopathy, including gentamicin toxicity, but the rotary chair test will determine the effects on both ears. Tests for syphilis, an antibody test for autoimmune inner ear disease or audiograms may also be important. Treatment Treatment differs depending on the cause. Each cause has a different treatment, and may involve either medical treatment, surgery, or therapy. If serious damage has already been done, then the focus of treatment is upon avoidance of vestibular suppressants and ototoxins including medications. Vestibular rehabilitation is important.

The music, originally in F major, is set for four singers. The words are probably by Mozart himself.Preface to Neue Mozart Ausgabe edition (External link below) Origin The work was written sometime between 1785 and 1787.The evidence for this is that the singer for whom the canon was written, Johann Nepomuk Peierl, was resident in Vienna only during this time. On 2 September 1788, Mozart entered it into his personal catalog of works as part of a set of ten canons. Although some of the canons in the set of ten have serious (that is, religious) lyrics, K. 559a was meant for fun, a gesture of mocking, scatological humor directed at a friend of Mozart's, the baritone Johann Nepomuk Peyerl (1761‚Äì1800).Peierl (Peyri, Peyerl, Peyrl), Johann Nepomuk, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich The canon begins: O, du eselhafter Peierl O, du peierlhafter Esel Oh, you asinine Peierl oh you Peierline ass. Later, the lyrics include \\"O leck mich doch geschwind im Arsch\\" (\\"Oh lick me real quick in the ass (arse)\\"\\"Ass\\" and \\"arse\\" are equivalent terms in American and British English.), a favorite expression in Mozart's scatological works. For more examples and discussion, see Mozart and scatology. \\"O du eselhafter Peierl\\" was originally intended to be sung immediately following \\"Difficile lectu\\". For the tale of how these two canons originated, see \\"Difficile lectu\\". Revised version Mozart later transposed \\"O du eselhafter Peierl\\" into G major, in versions that replaced \\"Peierl\\" with the names of two other individuals, named Martin and Jakob. There are other minor differences in words and notes. According to Link (2007), \\"Martin\\" was the composer Vicente Mart√≠n y Soler. Mozart scholar Alfred Einstein suggested a different hypothesis, that \\"Martin\\" was Philipp Jakob Martin, who served as impresario for Mozart's concerts in the and in the Augarten. The lyrics of the revised canon replace \\"Nepomuk\\" (see above) with \\"Lipperl\\", a German diminutive form of \\"Philipp\\". Autographs The autograph (original manuscript copy) of K. 559a has survived; it is a \\"tiny slip of paper\\" (Searle) on the reverse side of which is the original of K. 559. For discussion, see Difficile lectu. The later G major version, K. 560, is also preserved and is currently in the Mozarteum in Salzburg.Abert (2007, 772) Reception The canon is perhaps the most often performed of Mozart's comic canons; performances have often used bowdlerized versions of the lyrics. Zaslaw and Cowdury (1990) express admiration for the work, saying \\"it makes brilliant use of imitative and hocket-like devices\\" and \\"possesses the clockwork-like vocal interplay of a well-wrought opera buffa ensemble.\\"Zaslaw and Cowdury (1990, 105) Lyrics :{+Original F major version, K. 559a.

The school serves students primarily from the Whatcom Middle School and Kulshan Middle School attendance areas. History Bellingham High School was dedicated on February 25, 1938. It cost $912,028.63 and took 417,026 man hours to build. The school was closed for two years starting in June 1998 for a massive renovation which involved gutting the entire building and even demolishing some portions. Special care was taken to preserve the art deco facade on the west side of the building. From its inception the school mascot was the \\"Red Raider\\", a Native American chief with a massive war bonnet. In the years leading up to the school's renovation there were several occasions where questions were raised about the cultural appropriateness of such a mascot. When the school re-opened In 2000 after a two-year closure the mascot was changed to a bird of prey, but the mascot and team name \\"Red Raider\\" remained. Academics Bellingham High School offers a curriculum including Advanced Placement courses and other classes to prepare students for college, as well as offering the Running Start program which allows students to complete their high school diploma and earn college credit by attending Bellingham Technical College and/or Whatcom Community College.

In 1630, the castle's fortifications were expanded. It was so well fortified that neither Khmelnitsky's Cossacks (in 1648 and 1648) nor the Turks (in 1675) succeeded in taking it. In 1655, it was surrendered to the Swedes without a fight. The local Jewish community was made responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the walls in 1667. After Maria Zofia Sieniawska's marriage to August Aleksander Czartoryski, the castle passed to the Czartoryski family (1726), then to the Princes Lubomirski (1778) and to the Counts Potocki (1816). Those new owners allowed it to fall into such disrepair that in 1908 visitors were cautioned not to enter the castle for fear of being smashed by falling masonry. The castle was further damaged during the First World War, as was the late Gothic church from 1554 which contains a number of elaborate tombs of the Sieniawskis. The Brze≈ºany tombs were executed by Jan Pfister and other leading Polish artists of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Nothing But Logopedists) is a Serbian alternative rock band from ≈†abac.  History  1992-1998 The band was formed in late 1992, and the first lineup consisted of Miodrag Jovanoviƒá \\"Mi≈°ko\\" (vocals), Aleksandar Cvejiƒá \\"Cveja\\" (bass guitar), Aleksandar Stojanovic \\"D≈æoja\\" (drums), Igor ƒêoriƒá \\"ƒêora\\" (guitar), Darko Veljiƒá (accordion). and Dragoljub Markoviƒá (also known as \\"BlEQ\\" or \\"Dr Dra\\") (keyboard). Couple of Years later, after ƒêora, Cveja and D≈æoja left the band, their places in the group took Aleksandar Stanojeviƒá (bass guitar), Milan Kataniƒá \\"Skener\\" (guitar) and Dejan Stojanoviƒá \\"Kroka\\" (drums). From its initial era, the band had drawn attention of the public with their folk music-oriented accordion sound combined with punk rock and humorous lyrics. In 1994 the band appeared on the Zajeƒçar Gitarijada Festival and won the Audience Award as the best band. In the meantime they prepared their debut album, recorded in the Do Re Mi studio in Novi Sad, which was released during the following year. Ad Hoc Kliƒáa (Ad hoc Clitoris), available on compact cassette only, was released through L.V.O. records and featured guest appearances by Goblini guitarist Alen Jovanoviƒá, who provided backing vocals for the tracks \\"Svadbarski oma≈æ za 6 osoba\\" (\\"A Wedding Homage for 6 Persons\\") and \\"Janjine Janjine\\" (\\"Ioannina, Ioannina\\"),Ad Hoc Kliƒáa at Discogs promotional videos were recorded for both tracks, and Igor ƒêoriƒá \\"Ipi\\" who played lead guitar on half of the album tracks.Ad Hoc Kliƒáa at Discogs The songs \\"Pigs From Space\\", \\"Stao sam na Stone Called Crazy\\" (\\"I've Stood on a Stone Called Crazy\\"), \\"Janjine, Janjine\\" and \\"Jarmush Jim Rap\\" showed the band's sense of humor with lyrics dealing with pork, wedding ceremonies, an featuring quotations from school literature such as an English language beginners coursebook. In 1995, the band appeared on the various artists live compilation Gruvanje Vol. 1 with the song \\"Janjine Janjine\\", recorded live in Belgrade's Dom Omladine.Gruvanje Live Vol. 1 at Discogs During May 1996 the band toured Slovenia with the bands Svarog, Goblini and Love Hunters, but without Darko Veljiƒá on accordion. Having finished touring, they entered the Akademija studio in Belgrade to record their second album Vaspostavljanje (Restoration). The album featured many guest appearances including Block Out members, guitarist Nikola Vranjkoviƒá and vocalist Milutin Jovanƒçiƒá \\"Mita\\". The track \\"Prporu≈°a\\" featured lyrics of a folk song Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá had noted while visiting Lika, and \\"Tonski zapis\\" (\\"Sound Recording\\"), was recorded in 1996 at their appearance in Ilirska Bistrica.Vaspostavljanje at Discogs Even though the album recording was finished by September, it was released two years later by ITMM. Promotional videos were recorded for the track \\"Serbs\\" as well as for the cover of Idoli song \\"Plastika\\" (\\"Plastics\\"), renamed to \\"Metaloplastika\\". The album was well acclaimed by the critics, but the media paid insufficient attention to the album release which, beside the departure of the bassist Stanojeviƒá to the United States of America, was the reason for Ni≈°ta Ali Logopedi to disband in 1998. Accordionist Veljiƒá joined VROOM, and vocalist Jovanoviƒá, inspired by his military service during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, wrote a poetry book entitled Vi, bedni, odvratni civili (You, Disgusting, Pathetic Civilians) published in 2000, and is currently a professor at the Belgrade University Faculty of Law.

Just one was built. Development The Sprat was designed to Air Ministry Specification 5/24 for an RAF advanced trainer and Fleet Air Arm deck-landing trainer. It was specified that the aircraft should be readily convertible to a seaplane, again to be used as a trainer. The specification produced contracts for three machines, the Vickers Vendace, the Parnall Perch and the Sprat. The Sprat, though a smaller aircraft, had strong family resemblances to the earlier Velos torpedo bomber. The Sprat was a staggered, single-bay biplane with equal-span wings that could be folded for carrier stowage. The fuselage centre section was built around a tubular-steel structure which linked the engine mounting and the wooded-framed rear fuselage. The two dual-control open cockpits were both behind the trailing edge of the wing for optimum visibility. Unusually, the instruments were placed on the rear spar of the upper wing centre section, where they could be read from both cockpits. The rudder area was large compared to that of the fin and a braced tailplane was placed on top of the rear fuselage. The main undercarriage was a robust split-axle construction with the legs joining the wings at the bottom of the X-form centre-section struts. Braced stub axles carried the arrester claws required by the longitudinal arrester wires of Royal Navy aircraft carriers up to 1926. The undercarriage assembly was designed so that it could be easily removed with the aircraft on trestles, and replaced with a pair of aluminium single-step, V-bottomed round-topped floats. These carried water rudders for manoeuvring afloat. The Sprat was powered by a water-cooled 275 hp (210 kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a nose radiator, driving a four-bladed wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper engine cowling dropped smoothly away from the upper wing leading edge. Operational history The Sprat first flew at Blackburn's works at Brough Aerodrome, then went to Martlesham Heath for comparative trials with the other two contenders. In the end, though the Vendace was selected as the best aircraft for the specification, no orders were placed with any manufacturer because of economy cuts. The Sprat last appeared in public at the Hendon RAF display in July 1926.

Playing in the \\"Ohio League\\", the team was a rival to the pre-National Football League version of the Canton Bulldogs. The Tigers won Ohio League championships in 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906, then merged to become \\"All- Massillons\\" to win another title in 1907. The team returned as the Tigers in 1915 but, with the reemergence of the Bulldogs, only won one more Ohio League title. Pro football was popularized in Ohio when the amateur Massillon Tigers, hired four Pittsburgh pros to play in the season-ending game against Akron. At the same time, pro football declined in the Pittsburgh area, and the emphasis on the pro game moved west from Pennsylvania to Ohio. The team opted not to join the APFA (later renamed the NFL) in 1920; it remained an independent club through 1923, when the Tigers folded. During their time as an independent, the Tigers never played against any team in the NFL, even though several other independent teams did. The Massillon Tigers team name was transferred to Massillon Washington High School, which still uses it today. History Origins The Massillon area had fielded several amateur football teams featuring only local players since the early 1890s. However while some had performed well, the others were more likely to be defeated when they played their cross-county arch-rival, Canton. Therefore, a group of 35 area businessmen met on September 3, 1903, at the Hotel Sailor in Massillon to form the area's first professional football team. Jack Goodrich, who expected to play halfback for the new team, was named manager. Meanwhile, Ed J. Stewart, a young and ambitious editor of the city newspaper The Evening Independent, was named as the team's first coach. Stewart had playing experience while attending Western Reserve College and Mount Union College. Apart from being the team's coach, he later appointed himself as the team's quarterback. =Name origin= J.J. Wise, who was the Massillon Clerk of City Council, led a committee to secure the necessary funds for a new football and jerseys that were nearly the same color. The local venders only had a sufficient quantity of one jersey style to outfit an entire team. Those jerseys imitated the orange and black striped attire of the Princeton Tigers, so the new Massillon team was christened the \\"Tigers.\\" 1900s =Inaugural season= When the Tigers began play in 1903, several of the expected starters hadn't touched a football in eight or more years. According to locals belief, Baldy Wittman, 32-year-old proprietor of a local cigar store and a spare-time police officer, had never played the game at all. Charles \\"Cy\\" Rigler, who later became a famous major league baseball umpire started at tackle. Wittman opened at an end and was elected the team captain. Meanwhile, Stewart lined himself up at quarterback. The Tigers first game against Wooster College ended in a 6-0 defeat. A biased official was the excuse for the loss. The Tigers followed their first ever game with a 16-0 victory over Stewart's alma mater, Mount Union College, a 6-0 victory over the Akron Imperials, and a 38-0 over the Akron Blues. After a 34-0 victory over the Dennison Panhandles, the Tigers prepared for their cross-county rivals, a sandlot team from Canton. Betting on the games, during the early 1900s was common. It is believed that over $1000 was risked on the game's outcome. The Tigers held on to a 16-0 score to win the first game between the two clubs. After the Canton-Massillon game, the Tigers began to look at winning the mythical \\"Ohio League\\" championship. On Thanksgiving Day 1903, the Tigers avenged their only loss of the season against Wooster College with a 34-0 score. This outcome gave legitimacy to the belief that the Tigers were robbed by a corrupt official in their inaugural game. On December 5, an agreement was signed by Massillon and the Akron East Ends to play. The contract called for a 75-25 split of the gate, with the winner taking the 75% of the gate. However Massillon soon found itself in a troubling situation due to injuries to several of their star players. The team's management decided to replace the injured players with \\"ringers\\". Several pro football players from the Pittsburgh area soon traveled to Ohio to play for Massillon. Among them was Bob Shiring and Harry McChesney, who played in 1902 with the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. These player developments did not sit well with the Akron media, most notably the Akron Beacon-Journal. Massillon would go on to win the championship game 12-0, however the Akron Beacon-Journal later stated that most of Massillon's 75% gate money went to the Pittsburgh ringers. Plans were soon in the mix for spending $1,000 on a 1904 Tigers team. 1904 1905 Massillon Tigers, \\"Ohio League\\" Champions. In 1904 the Tigers repeated as Ohio League champions. It was during this time that at least seven teams in Ohio began hiring players for games. Most of these \\"ringers\\" were from Pittsburgh. Many players were hired on a per game basis and were never signed to any written contract. Ted Nesser, of the infamous Nesser Brothers, played for the Shelby Blues until he was hired to play one game for the Tigers. For the next two season he remained in the Tigers lineup. However, after the Tigers began the 1904 season, many Massillonians were bored with the ease of the Tigers' wins, even at this early stage. That season the Tigers defeated a club from Marion 148-0. Also keep in mind that a touchdown counted only five points until 1912. However under the rules of the time, the team that scored turned around and received the next kickoff (traditionally, onside kicks were far more commonplace‚Äîand easier‚Äîat this time, but Marion chose not to use them for reasons unexplained). During the game a Massillon end named Walt Roepke ran a punt back for a touchdown. Marion never got another chance to handle the ball, as Massillon took kickoff after kickoff and moved down the field to touchdown after touchdown. The Tigers defeated the Akron East Ends again (now renamed the Akron Athletic Club) 6-5 after Akron's Joe Fogg missed an extra point kick on the last play of the game. Bulldogs-Tigers rivalry: 1905-1906 By 1905 the Tigers were considered one of the top three teams in the country, along with the Latrobe Athletic Association and the Canton Bulldogs. Both teams were constantly fighting for the best players in football. In fact the Bulldogs, or Canton Athletic Club as it was called at the time, formed their football team in 1905 with sole objective of beating the Tigers, who had won every Ohio League championship since 1903.* =1905 championship= Massillon Tigers line up of 1905. Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers from out of town. The teams first played each other twice in 1905, with Massillon winning the first game 14-4. The second game saw a 10-0 Massillon win, however the win drew protests from Canton coach Blondy Wallace, who argued against a 10-ounce ball used by Massillon during the game, instead of the regular 16-ounce ball. The 10-ounce ball was provided to the Tigers by their owner, a Massillon newspaper editor. The protest fell on deaf ears, and Massillon was named the 1905 Ohio League champions. =1906 financial charges= In the off-season prior to the 1906 season, a news story in The Plain Dealer alleged that the Canton Athletic Club was financially broke and could not pay its players for that final game. The club denied the allegation and insisted that every dollar promised had indeed been delivered. Many Canton followers believed the story had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Massillon coach, Ed Stewart, who had newspaper connections was believed by Canton to have planted the story. However, while Canton was in fact losing money in 1905, a group of area businessmen shouldered the losses. In a counter-charge, Canton insisted that the Tigers were also deeply in debt. However, a statement by the Tigers showed $16,037.90 in receipts and only $16,015.65 in expenditures. The only problem with Massillon's figures was that they only listed salaries, including railroad fare, at $6,740.95, which means the players were getting only about $50 per game. However, it is believed, like with Canton, that Massillon's area boosters picked up whatever losses the Tigers incurred during 1905. =Recruitment= For the 1906 season, Canton coach Wallace signed the entire backfield of the Tigers to the Canton team. While in Massillion, Ed Stewart was promoted from head coach to manager. Sherburn Wightman, who played under Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago, was then named the team's new coach. 1906 scandal In 1906, the Bulldogs and Tigers were involved in a game-rigging scandal that effectively killed both teams. It was the first major scandal in professional football, and the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. The Massillon Independent newspaper alleged that the Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, and Tigers end, Walter East, had conspired to fix a two-game series between the two clubs. The conspiracy called for Canton to win the first game and Massillon to win the second, forcing a third game, which would have the largest gate. That game would be played legitimately, with the 1906 Ohio League championship at stake. Canton denied the charges, maintaining that Massillon only wanted to damage the club's reputation. Although Massillon could not prove that Canton had indeed thrown the second game, the scandal tarnished the Bulldog and Tiger names and helped ruin professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. To this day the details of the scandal consist only of charges and counter-charges. \\"All- Massillons\\" A reorganized \\"All-Massillons\\" played in 1907, after which professional football in Massillon effectively stopped. The team was made up of many of the former Tigers players and was managed by Sherburn Wightman. The team defeated the Columbus Panhandles, with the Nesser Brothers in the line- up, 13-4, and celebrated its fifth consecutive state championship. Because of the game's importance, Massillon brought in two ringers, Peggy Parratt and Bob Shiring. In 1911 a Canton-Massillon game was hyped beforehand as a return to 1905-06. However, after seeing the 57-0 Canton victory, it became apparent that this Massillon team bore little resemblance to the Tiger teams of the past, although the lineup did include Tiger greats Baldy Wittmann and Frank Bast. Resurrection =Dispute with Cusack= During the summer of 1914, members of the Massillon Chamber of Commerce asked Jack Cusack, the manager of the re-organized Canton Bulldogs, to attend a secret meeting to discuss a proposed new Massillon Tigers football team. Cusack believed that a game against a strong Massillon team and a restart of the historic Canton- Massillon rivalry was bound to bring in fans to Canton. However, in order to get the team fielded, Massillon planned to raid the Akron Indians roster of its key players. Because of this, Cusack refused to help Massillon restart their club. In 1914, an unwritten agreement existed among Ohio League managers that refrained them from raiding other teams. Also a raid of players would start a bidding war, raise players' salaries for all teams, and destroy the fragile profit margin already established. Cusack refused to provide a Canton- Massillon game if players from the Indians were raided. Plans for a new \\"Tigers\\" were put on hold until 1915. =New Tigers= 1915 The Tigers returned to the Ohio League in 1915. They were backed by local businessmen, Jack Donahue and Jack Whalen. Massillon did end up raiding the Indians team of their top players. In turn Cusack took in the Akron players, and raided the Youngstown Patricians, hoping to improve his team. Massillon hired new ringers for a new bidding war with Canton, however Cusack signed the legendary Jim Thorpe to his squad. The Tigers ended their 1915 season with a share of the 1915 championship with Canton. Both teams finished the season 5-2-0. One anonymous Massillon official revealed it had taken between $1,500 and $2,000 to bring in the Tigers lineup that opposed Canton in the final game, which included three players from Muhlenberg College, who had their college eligibility stripped when they were discovered. This would be Massillon's last \\"Ohio League\\" title, and a disputed one at that‚Äîthe very Patricians squad that the Tigers had raided earlier in the season had racked up an even more impressive 9-0-1 record against lesser talent, including a win against the Washington Vigilants, one of the East Coast's top professional teams, leading many observers to give Youngstown the title instead. 1916 The Tigers rebirth, saw the team incorporate many of the top players of the era. For example, Knute Rockne, Charles Brickley, Gus Dorais, Bob Nash, Stan Cofall, and, future Hall of Famer, Greasy Neale. The 1916 season saw the Tigers end up in second place of the \\"Ohio League\\" standings behind the Canton Bulldogs. However, despite record crowds for two Bulldog- Tigers match-ups, Massillon lost money on the season, while Canton barely made a profit. Most of the Midwestern major teams were running into debt. Since every player knew Jim Thorpe was being paid $250 a game, many players of considerably less talent were holding out for $100 or $125 a game. Team managers had to produce stars to draw crowds, but the crowds could never be big enough to pay for the stars. Teams desperately needed something like the old \\"Ohio League\\" sub-rosa agreement where the managers agreed to not raid other team rosters. Only that sort of agreement could hold salaries at a responsible level. 1917 Massillon Tigers vs. Canton Bulldogs, advertisement for a 1917 game. In 1917, Bob Nash promised an \\"Ohio League\\" championship to the fans in Massillon. In doing so he put together an offensive line that included Charlie Copley at tackle and Al Wesbecher at center. However, after storming out to a 4-0 start, the Tigers were defeated by Stan Cofall and the Youngstown Patricians 14-6. However, later that season Cofall and Bob Peck decided to play for Massillon which prematurely ended the Pats 1917 campaign. However, despite their winning seasons and star talent, Massillon was still losing money. One reason for the disparity is that Massillon was smaller than Canton, meaning it had a smaller fan base to support its football team. The Tigers had highly devoted following, however they weren't enough of them. Also the city lacked a decent ballpark. as a result many of the Tigers' biggest home games were undersold. The only way to make the Tigers profitable was to use Peggy Parratt's old Akron scheme of bringing in just enough high-priced stars to win. Even then, the Tigers would have probably operated at a loss, but one small enough that it could be made up for by the team's backers. However Massillon did upset the Bulldogs in their second game of the season series 6-0, behind two field goals kicked by Cofall. But despite the upset, Canton was regarded as the U.S. champion; Massillon couldn't make a serious claim. The Tigers had lost their first game with the Bulldogs by a larger margin and dropped two other games to lesser opponents. It had not been a good season for Massillon. They lost three games on the field, and their backers dropped $4,700 at the gate. After the season, a \\"Cleveland critic\\" chose an all-pro team from among the four major northeastern Ohio teams. The Massillon players listed on the all-pr listing were Bob Nash, Bob Peck, Pike Johnson, Charley Copley, and Stan Cofall. One of the teams Massillon would play (and defeat soundly) in 1917 was the Buffalo All-Stars, who would later join the NFL as the Buffalo All-Americans in 1917. The team suspended operations in 1918 due to a flu pandemic and the Great War, but returned in 1919. 1919 Many of the top teams of the \\"Ohio League\\" returned to action in 1919. At a meeting on July 14, 1919, the managers held a \\"get-together\\" at Canton's Courtland Hotel. The managers decided on a pay scale for officials and agreed to refrain from stealing each other's players for the upcoming season. However, the big surprise came when Massillon backer Jack Donahue refused to go along with a proposal to limit salaries. Massillon had trouble with the increasing cost of players and would profit more by a salary cap than anyone else. Donahue insisted, \\"If a manager wants to pay $10,000 for a player, that's his business.\\" The Tigers were set to begin their 1919 season in New York City against the New York Brickley Giants, organized by the same Charles Brickley that had played for Massillon in 1917. However, due to a dispute over the application of New York's blue laws, that prohibited playing football on Sundays, Brickley's Giants were forced to fold. (The Giants team would however regroup and play in the National Football League in 1921 and as an independent until 1923; a second, unrelated New York Giants would join the league for 1925 and this is the New York Giants team that is in the NFL today.) The Tigers did play well in 1919, however once again they came in second to Canton in the \\"Ohio League\\" standings. The team's backers then decided to fold the team after losing over $5,000 during the season. Stan Cofall also abandoned the Tigers after the season. He and many of the now former-Tigers players left to play for the Cleveland Tigers. =Formation of the NFL= Attempts to restart the Tigers On August 20, 1920, during the first meeting aimed at establishing the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922), there was hope that F.J. Griffiths, of the Massillon steel industry, would resurrect the franchise, but the meeting passed with no word from Griffiths. During late August and early September of that same year, Ralph Hay and Jim Thorpe tried without success to find a backer for a new Massillon team. While the Tigers consistently lost money for themselves, they were always a good draw for others. In fact it was a strong rivalry with Massillion that helped lead Jim Thorpe to Canton. Cupid Black, an All-America guard from Yale, was also rumored to restart the Tigers franchise, however he later turned down the offer. Vernon Maginnis issue On September 17, 1920, at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile dealership in Canton, the charter members of the future NFL formally established the new league. During that meeting, the first order of business was to decide the future of the Massillon franchise. It was then that the managers were confronted by Vernon Maginnis, the manager of the unsuccessful Akron Indians in 1919, who wanted to field a traveling team and call it the \\"Massillon Tigers\\". Hay and the other managers turned down the offer because they didn't feel the franchise would pan out and because nobody wanted to see the proud Massillon Tigers name demeaned and made a road attraction. The current Akron owners, now renamed the Pros, Art Ranney and Frank Nied were also associated with Maginnis during his ownership of the team in 1919, and had many problems with him during that season. Maginnis' representative was not admitted to the meeting, however the Massillon Tigers were counted as present at the charter meeting of the NFL. Hay, who'd tried to get a real Massillon team restarted, considered himself as their spokesman. Once the meeting started, he stood up and announced that Massillon was withdrawing from professional football for the season of 1920. And to resure that Maginnis wouldn't try to reestablish a Massillon \\"franchise\\", Hay told the American Professional Football Association managers: \\"Do not schedule any \`other' Massillon team\\". Charter NFL member? The 10 teams represented at the September 17 meeting are considered charter members of the AFPA, and, by extension, of the National Football league. Massillon is usually counted on a technicality: the team, under Hay, were there, they just never played in the new league.

The consolidation, authorized by the Virginia General Assembly, was approved and the new name selected by the voters of each communities by referendum. The new city is part of the current region of Hampton Roads which are linked by the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway. Formed in 1691 in the Virginia Colony, Norfolk County had originally included essentially all the area which became the towns and later cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and South Norfolk, but had seen its area frequently reduced as these cities added territory through annexations after 1871. Becoming an independent city was a method for the former county to stabilize borders with neighbors, as cities could not annex territory from each other. The relatively small City of South Norfolk had become an incorporated town within Norfolk County in 1919, and became an independent city in 1922. It was also motivated to make a change which would put it on a more equal footing in other aspects with the much larger cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth. By the late 1950s, although immune from annexation by the bigger cities, the most recent suit by the City of Norfolk against Norfolk County would have taken all of the county land adjoining South Norfolk. The changes which created Chesapeake were part of a wave of changes in the structure of local government in southeastern Virginia which took place between 1952 and 1976. Chesapeake's history goes far back into Virginia's colonial roots. The Intracoastal Waterway passes through Chesapeake. On the waterway, at Great Bridge where the locks transition from the Southern Branch Elizabeth River to the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal lies the site of the Battle of Great Bridge. This American Revolutionary War battle was responsible for removing Lord Dunmore and any other vestige of English Government for the Colony of Virginia during the early days of the American Revolution on December 9, 1775. Photograph of Lake Drummond, Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge The Dismal Swamp Canal runs through Chesapeake as well. The site of this canal was surveyed by George Washington, among others, and is known as \\"Washington's Ditch\\". It is the oldest continuously used man made canal in the United States today and has been in service for over 230 years. The canal begins in the Deep Creek section of the city branching off from the Southern Branch Elizabeth River. The canal runs through Chesapeake paralleling U.S. Highway 17 into North Carolina and connects to Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Until the late 1980s and early 1990s, much of Chesapeake was either suburban or rural, serving as a bedroom community of the adjacent cities of Norfolk and Virginia Beach with residents commuting to these locations. Beginning in the late 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, however, Chesapeake saw significant growth, attracting numerous and significant industries and businesses of its own. This explosive growth quickly led to strains on the municipal infrastructure, ranging from intrusion of saltwater into the city's water supply to congested roads and schools. Chesapeake made national headlines in 2003 when, under a court-ordered change of venue, the community hosted the first trial of convicted murderer Beltway sniper Lee Boyd Malvo for one of the 2002 terrorist-style attacks. A jury spared him a potential death sentence, choosing a sentence of \\"life in prison without parole\\" instead for the young man, who was 17 years old at the time of the crime spree. A jury in neighboring Virginia Beach sentenced his older partner John Allen Muhammad to death for another of the attacks.

It was first established as a community in the 1910s and originally centered on the intersection of Sagamore Street and San Jose Avenue. Today, the neighborhood is bordered by Orizaba Avenue to the west, Lakeview Avenue to the north, and Interstate 280 to the south and east. Ingleside and the Ocean Avenue campus of City College lay north of Oceanview; Cayuga Terrace is to the east; Daly City, California, and the Outer Mission are south; and Merced Heights is to the west. Oceanview Playground and Minnie and Lovie Ward Recreation Center are located in the middle of the neighborhood, a two-square-block area between Plymouth Avenue, Capitol Avenue, Lobos Street, and Montana Street. The Ocean View Branch Library of the San Francisco Public Library is located at 345 Randolph St. Ocean View is served by Muni Metro Routes M, 29 and 54.  History  An M Ocean View train on Broad Street Oceanview, also referred to as \\"Lakeview\\" by some natives of the community, has a rich history. Oceanview was originally an Italian-Irish- German neighborhood in the mid- to late nineteenth century; the location acted as a station for train service between San Francisco and San Jose, owned by San Francisco and San Jose Railroad, bought by Southern Pacific in 1868. Post World War II the Ocean View was one of the few places in San Francisco where African-American families could buy property. During redevelopment in the Western Addition/Fillmore in the 1960s and 70s, more African-American families moved to the neighborhood from the Western Addition and Bayview neighborhoods. Until the mid-1990s, African Americans accounted for over 50 percent of the neighborhood's residents. In the early 2000s, lower real estate prices relative to the rest of the city brought in a new influx of Asians, Latinos, and Caucasians, making Oceanview one of the most culturally diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco. At one point in time there was a lake on Geneva Ave, down the slope from the eastern side of Oceanview. Lake view refers not to Lake Merced, but the former Lake Geneva the creek coursed through this canyon and by Glen Park and then through what is now Bosworth Street until it reached the bottom over which Mission Street viaduct is built. The other source is about where Cayuga Avenue and Regent Street intersect. Its channel was what is now Cayuga Avenue and joined the other branch under the Mission Street viaduct. The creek widened between Niagara and Geneva Avenues to form what was known as Lake Geneva.  Demographics  Partly due to fairly recent waves of gentrification in the past decade, Oceanview is more ethnically and economically diverse than San Francisco as a whole. Asians now hold majority status in the once predominantly-African American enclave. Although no longer a majority in the neighborhood as in the 1960s-1990s, many blocks abutting the Broad-Randolph Street corridor remain 50% or more African- American in residency. As of the early 2010s, the block off of Orizaba Avenue and Garfield Street is 54% black, the highest concentration of Oceanview. As of the 2010 Census, Oceanview is 44.68% Asian, 22.99% African American, 20.36% Caucasian and 14.1% Latino.  Marginalization and crime  Oceanview has been described as \\"hard to find\\" due to its location situated in between two freeways in the far southwestern outskirts of San Francisco. Passenger service on the train line that established the area ended in 1904, causing business development to decline in Oceanview. Post World War II, African-Americans were encouraged to buy property in the declining district, finding less discrimination and lower cost older average age homes throughout the area. The neighborhood began to show signs of neglect and deterioration by the 1960s. By the early 1970s Oceanview had become an African American-majority neighborhood, representing over 50% of the residents. The balance of the neighborhood residency consisted of African Americans, Asians, Latinos and Pacific Islanders, with fewer Caucasians residing in the district. By the 1980s after years of widespread civic neglect, the Oceanview neighborhood declined into one of San Francisco's most crime-ridden districts. A geographically remote, socially isolated, majority-black population of displaced blue collar workers endured an environment rife with unemployment and relative poverty. These socioeconomic factors transformed the working- class neighborhood, resulting in drug trade and gang activity. Notably, the primary neighborhood corridors Broad and Randolph Streets, became a dangerously active open-air drug market. These streets were marked by high concentration of liquor stores and shuttered former businesses. Crack cocaine and heroin drug abuse became prevalent in the area throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as nearly 20 crack houses were counted in the neighborhood by police authorities at one point in the early 1990s. During the period, Oceanview and adjoining Ingleside Heights experienced some of San Francisco and the Bay Areas highest violent crime rates. Gunfire was frequently reported in the area, with a sizeable percentage of San Francisco's homicides occurring in Oceanview. One year, 12 homicides occurred on a single Oceanview intersection. Despite the neighborhood's high crime rates, local news media paid little attention to Oceanview compared to other lower-income dangerous high crime neighborhoods in San Francisco such as Bayview Hunters Point Historically, the bulk of the murders that occurred in Oceanview were killings connected to the once thriving local drug trade in the community. Murders were also the outcome of armed combat between mostly young African-American men involved in local loosely organized gangs of childhood friends from opposing rival \\"turfs\\", or majority-black low-income neighborhoods and or public housing projects, throughout San Francisco including Randolph Street in Oceanview as well as the Sunnydale projects on the fringe of the Visitacion Valley neighborhood and the Western Addition, locally known as the Fillmore district. These locally based gangs of mostly young male minorities involved in the criminal lifestyle of San Francisco often did not refer to themselves as actual gangs as there was no hierarchy, strict organization, recruiting or getting \\"jumped in\\" associated with groups whose main camaraderie was based on claiming their neighborhood, block or public housing projects. Young African- American men involved in local turf gangs or \\"mobs\\" in Oceanview, as well as most predominantly African-American areas of San Francisco and much of Bay Area seldom adopted the Blood and Crip nationwide gang culture that was founded in 1970s Los Angeles. Concurrently, in the late 1980s and 1990s, Oceanview became a hub for independently produced local underground Gangsta Rap, known in the Bay Area as Mob music. During this time, young men from the local area began articulating the harsher realities of growing up in the neighborhood through Rap music. Thus detailing the violent street crime that plagued the district as well as voicing their unsettling daily struggles while living in Oceanview. Many Bay Area Rap pioneers such as the late Cougnut and Cellski hailed from the neighborhood, some from the public housing project at Randolph and Head Streets along the areas main corridor.  Gentrification and revitalization  During the 1990s and 2000s, San Francisco experienced the most acute case of Black flight of any major city in the nation as thousands upon thousands of middle class and lower-income black families moved out of the city due to a rising cost of living as well as the disproportionately high crime rates, sub-standard public housing and poor performing schools that existed in black-majority areas across San Francisco such as Oceanview. By the early 2000s, serious incidences of violent crime had decreased significantly in Oceanview. The efforts of a neighborhood group of community activists called Neighbors In Action and the local police force had effectively curbed the street crime associated with drug dealing and gang activity that had blighted the area for decades. Most notably, long-time Oceanview resident Minnie Ward helped spearhead the changes in Oceanview by working hard in community activism with her husband to reverse Oceanview's then increasing ghettoization in the early 1990s. Both Minnie,(d: 2005) and husband Lovie (d: 2003) were honored when the Oceanview Park recreation center was rebuilt and renamed the Minnie and Lovie Ward Recreational Center. The renaming commemorated the couple's contributions to cleaning up the Oceanview neighborhood. A new library opened on 345 Randolph Street in June 2000, replacing an older and markedly smaller reading room type library that was located at 111 Broad Street. At 117 Broad, Engine Co. No.33, an architecturally restored 1890s Victorian firehouse offers riding tours on an antique fire engine throughout San Francisco. Few new businesses have opened along the residential neighborhoods once downtrodden Broad-Randolph commercial strip. However, in March 2012 Donald Andrews, a third generation Oceanview resident in his 20s, opened Broad Street's first new business in almost ten years. An independent streetwear clothing boutique called Dream Team. Despite Oceanview's gentrification and revitalization, in recent years the neighborhood has suffered occasional gang and drug related violence. As of December 2012, concerned Oceanview residents and the Inner City Youth Center on Broad Street called for the reopening of the police substation on 103 Broad Street due to an increase in homicides and gun violence in Oceanview. The Taraval Police Station refused to reopen the police substation unless the entire facility was encased in bulletproof glass. Broad Street continues to have some of the highest violent crime rates in the city. As of March 2017, there were four shootings and three homicides within a six month period around the intersection of Broad and Plymouth Streets. As of 2013, many homebuyers are choosing to purchase homes in Oceanview. This is due to housing stock selling at a much lower price point than most San Francisco neighborhoods. Housing prices continue to rise annually in Oceanview. From 2012 to 2013, the median sales price of houses in Oceanview increased 6.3% and the number of sales increased by 66.7%. The average square foot price of a house in Oceanview was $484 which was a 12.8% increase from the same time frame.

Early life Scott was born in London, and began painting in around 1720, Nothing is known of his artistic training.Manners and Morals,: p 114 He started as a maritime artist, painting men-of-war and other ships on calm seas in the style of Willem van de Velde,Manners and Morals, p 246 many of whose drawings he owned. He also painted a set of six pictures of settlements owned by the East India Company in collaboration with George Lambert. Scott painted the ships, Lambert the buildings and landscape. Writing in 1733, George Vertue included Scott among London's \\"most elevated men in art\\". From 27‚Äì31 May 1732 he made a celebrated \\"Five days' Peregrination\\" to the Isle of Sheppey in company with William Hogarth and others.Five Days' peregrination (Daily Telegraph, 27 January 2007). An account of their trip was written by Ebenezer Forrest and published in 1782, illustrated with drawings by Hogarth and Scott. In the early 1740s, Scott began making sketches of London, especially of the new Westminster Bridge, then under construction, When, following the arrival of Canaletto in London in 1746, paintings of views of the city became fashionable, he began working the sketches up into oil paintings. He painted at least eleven versions of a view of Old London Bridge, the earliest dating from 1747. Scott continued to paint copies of it after 1757, when the houses lining the bridge, shown in the painting had been demolished. The London Bridge pictures were often painted as one of a pair, with an image of the Tower of London or Westminster Bridge as a pendant.Manners and Morals,: p 188 Later life Between 1761 and 1771 he exhibited three works at the Society of Artists, one at the Free Society of artists, and one, A View of the Tower of London, at the Royal Academy in 1771. He was one of the early draughtsmen in watercolours, and was called the father of English watercolour, but his chief works were in oil. Some of Scott's most celebrated paintings were his depictions of scenes during the War of Jenkins' Ear. George Anson's Victory off Cape Finisterre, 1749. Scott earned a considerable reputation for his shore and river scenes, which were well-drawn and painted, and enlivened with figures. Horace Walpole, who had a large collection of his works, said that they \\"will charm in every age\\" and that \\"if he was second to Vandeveldt in sea pieces, he excelled him in variety.\\" His views of London Bridge, the Custom-house Quay, and other pictures of the Thames earned him the name \\"the English Canaletto\\".

The development of this discipline within psychology and the origins of the society are closely linked. The American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) jointly organized an International Conference on Work, Stress, and Health in Washington, DC in 1990. At the conference, the individuals who would form the core of SOHP began to get to know each other. Beginning with the conference in 1990, APA and NIOSH arranged a series of Work, Stress, and Health conferences in two- to three-year cycles (now two-year cycles). In 1996, with the help of some of the conference organizers, APA began publication of the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. The European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology (EA-OHP) was established in 1999. In the U.S., researchers arrived at the idea that the best way to train the next generation would be to create graduate programs in OHP. Beginning in the mid-1990s, APA and NIOSH began to furnish seed money to support graduate training in OHP. By 2001, there were OHP graduate programs at 11 US universities. Through the 1990s, momentum was developing in terms of institution-building in OHP. Many of the individuals who participated in the APA/NIOSH conferences also attended the first organizational meeting devoted to the creation of an OHP-related society in the U.S. The meeting was held at the University of South Florida. Over the next four years a series of organizational meetings took place that helped establish the society. In 2005, at a meeting held at the offices of the American Psychological Association, the Society for Occupational Health Psychology was formally founded, with Leslie Hammer of Portland State University as president. In 2006, the society began to play a role, although a small one, in organizing the Work, Stress, and Health conference held that year. Two years later, the society became a full partner with APA and NIOSH in organizing the Work, Stress, and Health conferences. In 2008, the society began to coordinate activities, including conference scheduling, with its European counterpart, EA-OHP.Schonfeld, I. S., & Houdmont, J. (2008). EA-OHP summit meeting.

The company is based in St. Louis, Missouri. The majority of the items Ralcorp makes are private-label, store-brand products. It has over 9,000 employees. Ralcorp has its headquarters in the Bank of America Plaza in downtown St. Louis. History and description A 1922 newspaper advertisement for Ralston Whole Wheat cereal Originally part of Ralston Purina, the Ralston name was more associated with food for humans; soda crackers and a farina cereal, among other products, were marketed under this name. Ralcorp can trace its ancestry to 1898 when William H. Danforth of Purina Mills, which made animal feeds, began making breakfast cereal. He sought and received the endorsement of Webster Edgerly (Dr. Ralston) who founded the Ralstonism social movement.Hoolihan, Christopher; Atwater, Edward C. An Annotated Catalogue of the Edward C. Atwater Collection of American Popular Medicine and Health Reform, Volume 1, A-L, University of Rochester Press, 2002, p. 223. Ralston cereal became so successful that Purina Mills was renamed Ralston Purina in 1902. Ralston Purina also for many years produced the familiar line of Chex and Cookie Crisp cold breakfast cereals. The animal and human food businesses were seemingly only tenuously related. In 1994, the human food business was spun off to Ralcorp Holdings, operating as Ralston Foods, which then sold its branded breakfast cereal lineup to General Mills and its Continental Baking division (Wonder Bread and Twinkies) to Interstate Bakeries. The Purina part of the company is now split. The pet-food company sold to Nestl√© is now called Nestl√© Purina PetCare. The livestock-feed company is called Purina Mills, LLC, and is a unit of Land O'Lakes. Ralcorp manufactures many store-brand foods that are sold in grocery outlets across the United States under the retailers' private labels. In late 2007, Ralcorp signed an agreement with Kraft Foods to acquire the Post Cereals brands, thus returning to the major-branded cereal business. The acquisition was completed August 4, 2008. Another brand name product Ralcorp makes and markets is Ry- Krisp crisp bread. Purchase by ConAgra In 2011, Ralcorp received an offer for the company from ConAgra Foods. Ralcorp resisted the attempt. Ralcorp also announced it was spinning off its Post Foods unit. The spinoff was completed in 2012. On November 27, 2012, ConAgra officials announced they were purchasing Ralcorp, pending Ralcorp shareholder approval, for about $4.95 billion. Stockholders of Ralcorp Holdings Inc. would receive $90 per share. The acquisition was completed in January 2013. As a result, ConAgra is the largest private-label packaged food business in the United States. Purchase by TreeHouse Foods, Inc Feb. 1, 2016 TreeHouse Foods announced that it completed the acquisition of ConAgra Foods' private brands operations. \\"TreeHouse paid $2.7 billion in cash plus transaction expenses for the business and financed the transaction through the closing of its previously announced offerings of $775 million in aggregate principal senior notes due 2024 with a 6.0% annual interest rate and common stock issuance of 13.3 million shares at a price of $65 per share (which includes the exercise, in full, of the overallotment option), aggregating $862.5 million in gross proceeds. The remainder of the purchase price was financed under the Company's revolving credit facility.\\" The rumor of the deal was first broke in October 2015. According to a FoodProcessing.com article from 10/23/2015:\\"TreeHouse Foods is rumored to be in advanced talks to purchase the Ralcorp business from ConAgra Foods in a deal valued at $2.5- to $2.7 billion, according to a report from Reuters.\\" This was a huge loss from the $5.1 Billion ConAgra paid for Ralcorp two years earlier.

Since April 2012 the zoo has been run by the registered charity Lakeland Trust for Natural Sciences. History The zoo first opened to the public on 14 April 1992 as a \\"part-zoo, part-museum\\". It featured a butterfly hall, aquarium and tropical hall which were home to common marmosets, brown rats, fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates. The zoo expanded over the years and, in 2011, acquired its first snow leopard, a male named Pavan, for which it had built an enclosure with a perspex walk-through tunnel, reportedly the UK‚Äôs first walk- through big cat exhibit. Pavan was soon followed by a female named Tara. These produced two young during 2014, which were named Loki and Luna, the first successful snow leopard breeding recorded in the North of England. In 2015, the zoo closed to the public after it was hit by severe flooding during Storm Desmond. Many animals were able to reach raised areas, whilst others, including pheasants and Azara's agouti, were moved to safety. With a lack of visitor revenue, the zoo turned to crowdfunding for donations with the money to be used for repairing damage and upgrading the flood proofing of animal enclosures. Overview The centre is divided into several sections, including a butterfly house, tropical hall and aquarium, as well as outdoor enclosures. Its layout is designed to take visitors on an evolutionary journey, beginning with marine life, amphibians, reptiles, birds and then mammals. Over 100 species are on display, including fossa, snow leopards, fruit bats, meerkats, armadillos, red squirrels, lemurs, marmosets, roul-rouls and black curassow. The centre hosts \\"animal interctives\\" and Keeper for the Day opportunities with some of these animals for an additional fee. As a member of BIAZA and through cooperation with European zoos, the centre has participated in breeding programs for several endangered species, including snow leopards, fossa, Rodrigues fruit bats and primates. Additionally, the centre has also contributed to overseas conservation projects, such as the Mountain Marmoset Conservation Programme, Money for Madagascar and the Snow Leopard Trust. The main entrance features a gift shop and allows access to a caf√©, named the Wild Caf√©, which can be accessed with or without a zoo ticket.

He, like his grandfather Wang Wujun and father Wang Shizhen before him, ruled the circuit in a de facto independent manner from the imperial government, drawing two imperial campaigns against him, both of which he withstood. After the defeat of his ally Wu Yuanji in 817, he submitted to imperial authority, and, after his death, his brother Wang Chengyuan left the circuit, ending his family's hold on Chengde.  Background  It is not known when Wang Chengzong was born, although it was known that he was born before his brother Wang Chengyuan, who was born in 801. He was the oldest son of Wang Shizhen, who was then deputy military governor of Chengde under Wang Chengzong's grandfather Wang Wujun. After Wang Shizhen succeeded Wang Wujun as military governor in 801, Wang Chengzong eventually became the acting governor of Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) as well as deputy military governor of the circuit ‚Äî effectively, Wang Shizhen's designated successor.Old Book of Tang, vol. 142.  First campaign of resistance against the imperial government  Wang Shizhen died in 809, and Wang Chengzong claimed the title of acting military governor. Soon thereafter, his uncle (Wang Shizhen's brother) Wang Shize (), fearing imperial punishments for Wang Chengzong's claiming the title without imperial sanction, fled to territory held by the imperial government and submitted to Emperor Xianzong. Meanwhile, Emperor Xianzong considered forcibly imposing another military governor on Chengde and attacking it if Wang Chengzong refused to yield. The chancellor Pei Ji and the imperial scholar Li Jiang believed such a course of action to be imprudent, pointing out that Chengde would be difficult to conquer. The powerful eunuch Tutu Chengcui, however, advocated a campaign against Chengde, as did Lu Congshi () the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. Emperor Xianzong hesitated, and considered another course of action ‚Äî making Wang Chengzong military governor, but ordering Wang to surrender two of Chengde's six prefectures, De (Âæ∑Â∑û, in modern Dezhou, Shandong) and Di (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) Prefectures, to be formed into a new circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Meanwhile, Wang was becoming apprehensive about the lack of imperial approval for his succession. When Emperor Xianzong sent the official Pei Wu () to Chengde to comfort the soldiers, Wang offered to surrender De and Di Prefectures. After Pei returned to the Tang capital Chang'an, Emperor Xianzong issued an edict naming Wang military governor of Chengde, while forming a separate circuit, Baoxin Circuit (), out of De and Di Prefectures and naming a relative of Wang's by marriage, Xue Changchao () the prefect of De Prefecture, its military governor. Wang's ally Tian Ji'an the military governor of Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), however, informed Wang that Xue had received the position by turning to the imperial government; in response, Wang had Xue arrested and brought back to Heng Prefecture. When Emperor Xianzong subsequently ordered Wang to allow Xue to assume his post, Wang refused, and Emperor Xianzong responded by stripping Wang of his titles and commissioning Tutu as the commander of the forces against Chengde. The forces of several circuits ‚Äî Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Hezhong (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Zhenwu (ÊåØÊ≠¶, headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) ‚Äî soon joined the forces of Chengde's neighboring circuit Yiwu (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) in attacking Chengde from the north, while forces commanded by Tutu attacked it from the south. Liu Ji the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) also attacked Chengde on his own. However, it was said that because the generals did not respect Tutu, his command was not successful, and after the general Li Dingjin () was killed in battle, morale was low. Meanwhile, Lu, who had advocated the campaign against Wang, was actually in secret communication with Wang. Tutu discovered this, and, under Emperor Xianzong's orders, Tutu arrested Lu. Emperor Xianzong subsequently replaced Lu with Meng Yuanyang (). After Lu's arrest, Wang submitted petitions claiming that it was Lu who alienated him from the imperial government and that he was willing to submit tax revenues and permit the imperial government to commission his subordinate officials to show submission. Wang's ally Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) also made the same request on his behalf. In summer 810, Emperor Xianzong, seeing that the campaign against Wang was unsuccessful, agreed to exonerate Wang and make him military governor, and further officially returned De and Di to Chengde.  Between the two campaigns  Meanwhile, by 815, Emperor Xianzong's forces were deeply entrenched in a campaign against another ally of Wang Chengzong's, Wu Yuanji, who ruled Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). Wu sought aid from both Wang and Li Shidao, and both sought pardons on his behalf, but the requests were rejected by Emperor Xianzong. Li Shidao reacted by having his soldiers wage guerilla warfare against imperial territory around the eastern capital Luoyang. Wang sent his officer Yin Shaoqing () to Chang'an to lobby for Wu, but when Yin met the chancellor Wu Yuanheng, Yin was insolent in his language, and Wu Yuanheng ejected him from the office of chancellors. Wang then submitted a petition defaming Wu Yuanheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Shortly after, Wu Yuanheng was assassinated ‚Äî probably by assassins sent by Li ‚Äî and another official who advocated for the campaign against Wu Yuanji, Pei Du, was nearly also killed. Suspicions fell on eight Chengde officers stationed at Chang'an, headed by Zhang Yan (). Wang Chengzong's uncle Wang Shize himself reported that Zhang and the other Chengde officers must be responsible. The Chengde officers were arrested and interrogated by Pei Wu and the imperial censor Chen Zhongshi (). Under intense interrogation, probably including torture, Zhang and the others confessed to assassinating Wu Yuanheng and were executed. In fall 815, Emperor Xianzong issued an edict declaring Wang's guilt and refusing to accept his tributes, but not declaring a campaign against Wang by this point; rather, the edict called on Wang to examine himself and repent.  Second campaign of resistance against the imperial government  Meanwhile, Tian Hongzheng (a relative of Tian Ji'an's, who had died in 812) the military governor of Weibo ‚Äî under whose governance Weibo had become imperial territory ‚Äî stationed his forces near Weibo's borders with Chengde. Wang Chengzong repeatedly harassed his troops, and in anger, Tian requested permission to attack Chengde territory. Emperor Xianzong agreed, and Tian advanced into Chengde territory, but did not advance far. Emperor Xianzong also ordered Zhenwu forces to join Yiwu forces in attacking Chengde. In response, Wang pillaged the territories of Lulong, Henghai (Ê©´Êµ∑, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), and Yiwu. Those circuits advocated a campaign against Wang, and Emperor Xianzong agreed, over the objection of the chancellor Zhang Hongjing, who thereafter resigned. Another chancellor who also opposed the campaign, Wei Guanzhi, was soon exiled. However, it was said that of the six circuits ordered to attack Chengde (Hedong, Lulong, Yiwu, Henghai, Weibo, and Zhaoyi), most of the forces did not advance far, although Zhaoyi's military governor Chi Shimei () scored some victories over Chengde forces. When Hun Gao () the military governor of Yiwu advanced deep into Chengde territory as well, Wang responded by sending operatives into Yiwu territory to burn Yiwu's towns and villages, causing Yiwu soldiers to become fearful for their families. He subsequently defeated Hun, and Hun fled back to Yiwu and was subsequently replaced by another general, Chen Chu (). He also cut off the communications lines between Henghai's capital Cang Prefecture () and Henghai troops, under the command of its military governor Cheng Quan (), forcing Cheng's withdrawal.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. By 817, the expenditures of the imperial forces in waging campaigns against Chengde and Zhangyi simultaneously were so high and the returns so low that Emperor Xianzong was reconsidering his strategy. Listening to the chancellor Li Fengji and other officials who advocated concentrating on defeating Zhangyi first, in summer 817, Emperor Xianzong ordered the circuits attacking Chengde to withdraw their forces back to their own circuits.  Submission to imperial authority  In winter 817, imperial forces under Li Su entered Zhangyi's capital Cai Prefecture () and captured Wu Yuanji, whom Emperor Xianzong subsequently executed. Wang, hearing of Wu's defeat, became fearful, and he sent his two sons Wang Zhigan () and Wang Zhixin () to Tian Hongzheng, offering them as hostages and further offering to surrender De and Di Prefectures to imperial control. With Tian interceding on Wang's behalf, Emperor Xianzong agreed, accepting Wang's submission and restoring his titles. De and Di were merged into Henghai Circuit. When Emperor Xianzong subsequently waged a campaign against Li Shidao, who made a similar offer to Emperor Xianzong but then reneged, Wang Chengzong's brother Wang Chengyuan suggested that he join the imperial campaign against Pinglu, but Wang Chengzong did not do so. In winter 820, by which point Emperor Xianzong had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong, Wang Chengzong died, although his subordinates kept the news of his death secret. With his sons Wang Zhigan and Wang Zhixin at Chang'an, the soldiers initially did not know whom to support as their new military governor. Wang Chengzong's staff member Cui Sui () issued an order in the name of Wang Chengzong's grandmother Lady of Liang (Wang Wujun's wife) naming Wang Chengyuan his successor. Wang Chengyuan accepted acting military governor authority but did not want to try to succeed Wang Chengzong permanently, and thus sent secret communications to Emperor Muzong offering to yield the circuit and then announced Wang Chengzong's death. Emperor Muzong, in response, named Tian the new military governor of Chengde and Wang Chengyuan the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan); Wang Chengyuan then left Chengde, ending the Wang family's hold on Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241.

Marriage Helen Hughes, Mary's only child, as painted by Philip de L√°szl√≥ in 1931. Campbell married William Morris \\"Billy\\" Hughes on 26 June 1911, at Christ Church, South Yarra, Melbourne. She was 37 at the time; he was 48 and a widower (his first wife having died in 1906). He did not have time for a honeymoon, so he took her on a long drive. Their car crashed where the Sydney-Melbourne road crossed the Sydney-Melbourne railway north of Albury, leading to the crossing being named after Billy Hughes; it was later replaced by the Billy Hughes Bridge. The couple had one child together, Helen Beatrice Myfanwy Hughes, born 11 August 1915. Mary also became the stepmother to the six surviving children from her husband's first marriage. However, she never developed a close relationship with her stepchildren ‚Äì they were all adults or teenagers when she married their father, and various commitments (boarding school, military service, etc.) meant they did not often see each other. Public life Mary Hughes accompanied Billy during his parliamentary sessions in Melbourne (then the seat of the federal government) and on domestic and overseas trips as Prime Minister (1916, 1918 and 1921). On the 1918 trip, he was in precarious health, and he wanted her to accompany him in order to look after him should he fall ill. Despite his insistence, officialdom did not permit her to travel on the same warship as him, and she went instead in a separate convoy with baby Helen.Australia's Prime Ministers It was during World War I that she became interested in the welfare of Australian servicemen, and she visited camps and hospitals in Britain, France and Australia. Both she and her husband became familiar faces at the Australian Imperial Force headquarters in Horseferry Road, at the ANZAC buffet at Victoria Station, and in hospitals visiting wounded Australian troops. On her overseas trips she became closely acquainted with influential British women such as Margaret Lloyd George, Margot Asquith, Clementine Churchill and suffragette leader Christabel Pankhurst. Honours In the New Year's Day Honours of 1922, she was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) for her charitable and war effort work.Australian womenIt's an Honour: GBE (Some sources say she was the first Australian woman to receive this award, but she was in fact preceded in 1917 by another Prime Minister's wife, Dame Flora Reid.) Later life Dame Enid Lyons. At the time of their marriage, her husband represented a Sydney seat, but between 1917-22 he represented Bendigo in Victoria. In 1922 he won another Sydney seat and they returned there. After the war, she continued with her charity work and became president of the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children in Sydney in 1925. She was also an advocate for women's rights. She was also an energetic worker in World War II. Death of daughter Her daughter Helen died in a London nursing home on 9 August 1937, two days before her 22nd birthday. In contemporary press reports, her death was attributed to septicaemia, but as was revealed nearly 67 years later in 2004, she actually died in childbirth, unmarried. Mary and Billy's grandson now lives in Sydney under a different name.Rewind: ABC TV Final years Hughes died in 1952, and Dame Mary outlived him by five and a half years. She died, aged 83, on 2 April 1958, at her niece's home in Double Bay. She was interred at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium with her husband and next to her daughter.

The largest festival of its kind in the state, it was founded in 1948, and takes place in April. History The Azalea Festival began in 1948 as an idea of Dr. W. Houston Moore, M.D. Dr. Moore held a meeting in Wilmington's Chamber of Commerce with civil club representatives to discuss and begin planning for the first Azalea Festival. The Festival would take place in April 1948 and would serve the purpose of showcasing the local gardens such as Airlie Gardens, Orton Gardens, and Greenfield Gardens. The following is a letter written by Mr. Morton to Gayle Ward in response to her request for information about the Festival beginnings: Arnold Palmer wins 1957 Azalea Open Golf Tournament, Wilmington, NC. A number of events have made up the Azalea Festival schedule, including the Azalea Open Invitational where Arnold Palmer took home the title in 1957. The first sidewalk show was held in 1953 and has continued as tradition since.Looking Back Through the Years The 2020 festival was cancelled in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Azalea Belle at the 2016 event Customs and traditions  Airlie Gardens  Airlie Gardens span of Wilmington property and was created in 1901. The gardens are less than a mile from the ocean and planted with various types of flora. Ownership of the gardens has changed hands several times and has gone from being a land grant from King George II in 1735 to a now comparably smaller garden open for public viewing. Garden tours are open to the public and include visits to several different areas of Airlie including the butterfly garden, a mystery grave, and the Minnie Evans Sculpture Garden. The latter has a \\"BottleChapel\\" along with both metal and ceramic sculptures. Airlie Gardens also hosts summer camps and educational programs are available to the public. Cape Fear Garden Club Azalea Belles A tradition held by the Azalea Festival is the \\"Belles\\": young ladies who serve as hostesses and guides to the gardens in the area. This tradition began in 1969 under a suggestion by the president of the Cape Fear Garden Club at that time. The first year, seven girls played the role of Azalea Belles.Azalea Festival: Belles and Queens To become an Azalea Belle, one must apply for the position; however, precedence is given to those girls who are either daughters or granddaughters of Cape Fear Garden Club members. Girls from New Hanover County High School are next to be a NC Azalea Belle. If the Belle is not a member of the Cape Fear Garden Club, she may be \\"committee sponsored\\" by applying through the belle chairman.Belle Policies New Azalea Belle policies were adopted in 2006. The number of belles needed for each year is dependent upon the size of the gardens in the tour and is determined by the belle chairman. Also, a young lady may only serve as a Belle one year and may not be in the Azalea Festival Scholarship Pageant during the year that she serves as a belle.

The presumption of a WARA is that each class of a company's asset base (such as manufacturing equipment, contracts, software, brand names, etc.) carries its own rate of return, each unique to the asset's underlying operational risk as well as its ability to attain debt and equity.Pratt, Shannon and Grabowski, Roger. \\"Cost of Capital: Applications and Examples.\\" 3rd Edition. 2008: pp. 637-38. Tangible assets, generally speaking, carry a lower rate of return due to two factors: * Debt financing‚Äîtangible assets can be provided as collateral in attracting debt capital, which typically require a lower rate of return than equity capital * Stability of earnings‚Äîtangible assets tend to provide more certainty in expected earnings, which reduces risk to the financier of the asset Intangible assets, in contrast, carry a higher rate of return due to the same factors above. Averaging these rates of returns, as a percentage of the total asset base, produces a WARA. In theory, the WARA should generate the same cost of capital as the Weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. The theory holds true because the operating entity is considered fundamentally equivalent to the combined assets of the company. Therefore, the measure of risks across each are equivalent. In the case of the operating entity, risk is measured against the WACC, while in the case of the combined assets, risk is measured by the WARA.

The business was started in his backyard, and at the time only produced table eggs from chickens, but eventually grew into a $4.1 billion company. Family and background In the 1600's, Henri Perdue, a Huguenot, left France for the Province of Maryland to escape religious persecution. Perdue settled in what is now Wicomico and Worcester Counties and his descendents continue to live in the area. Perdue was born in 1885 as the second of three children to Levin and Martha Perdue in Worcester County. His parents were devout and strict Methodists. He married Pearl Parsons in 1917 and had one child in 1920, Frank Perdue. Career In 1915, Arthur Perdue worked as a Railway Express agent in Salisbury, Maryland. By 1920, Perdue noticed that the chicken farmers on the Delmarva peninsula that were making money had shifted from selling chickens to selling table eggs. Perdue quit his job at the railroad and established his own commercial table-egg farm a few miles east of Salisbury, Maryland. Perdue began focusing on quality and brought in Leghorn breeding stock from Texas to improve the quality of his flock. He then expanded his egg market, including to New York. Legacy The Arthur W. Perdue Stadium in Salisbury, Maryland, is home to the Delmarva Shorebirds baseball team, a class A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles in the South Atlantic League. The Franklin P. and Arthur W.

Heuer, Jr. was a CIA veteran of 45 years and most known for his work on analysis of competing hypotheses and his book, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis. This is the Introduction to Heuer's book Psychology of Intelligence Analysis. The former provides a methodology for overcoming intelligence biases while the latter outlines how mental models and natural biases impede clear thinking and analysis. Throughout his career, he worked in collection operations, counterintelligence, intelligence analysis and personnel security. In 2010 he co-authored a book with Randolph (Randy) H. Pherson titled Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis. Background Richards Heuer graduated in 1950 from Williams College with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. One year later, while a graduate student at the University of California in Berkeley, future CIA Director Richard Helms recruited Heuer to work at the Central Intelligence Agency. Helms, also a graduate of Williams College, was looking for recent graduates to hire at CIA. Heuer spent the next 24 years working with the Directorate of Operations before switching to the Directorate of Intelligence in 1975. His interest in intelligence analysis and \\"how we know\\" was rekindled by the case of Yuri Nosenko and his studies in social science methodology while a master's student at the University of Southern California. Richards Heuer is well known for his analysis of the extremely controversial and disruptive case of Soviet KGB defector Yuri Nosenko, who was first judged to be part of a \\"master plot\\" for penetration of CIA but was later officially accepted as a legitimate defector. Heuer worked within the DI for four years, eventually retiring in 1979 after 28 years of service as the head of the methodology unit for the political analysis office. (Though retired from the DI in 1979, Heuer continued to work as a contractor on various projects until 1995.) He eventually received an M.A. in international relations from the University of Southern California. Heuer discovered his interest in cognitive psychology through reading the work of Kahneman and Tversky subsequent to an International Studies Association (ISA) convention in 1977. His continuing interest in the field and its application to intelligence analysis led to several published works including papers, CIA training lectures and conference panels. Presentation to the National Academy of Science, National Research Council Committee on Behavioral and Social Science Research to Improve Intelligence Analysis for National Security, Washington, DC, December 8, 2009. Structured analytic techniques Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis and key concepts Heuer's book Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis, published in 2010 (second edition 2015) and co-authored with Randy H. Pherson, provides a comprehensive taxonomy of structured analytic techniques (SATs) pertaining to eight categories: decomposition and visualization, idea generation, scenarios and indicators, hypothesis generation and testing, cause and effect, challenge analysis, conflict management and decision support. The book details 50 SATs (55 in the second edition) in step-by-step processes that contextualize each technique for use within the intelligence community and business community. The book goes beyond simply categorizing the various techniques by accentuating that SATs are processes that foster effective collaboration among analysts. =Structured analytic techniques as process= In light of the increasing need for interagency analyst collaboration, Prepared for the Sherman Kent School, Central Intelligence Agency, 28 July 2008. Heuer and Pherson advocate SATs as \\"enablers\\" of collective and interdisciplinary intelligence products. The book is a response to problems that arise in small group collaborative situations such as groupthink, group polarization and premature consensus. Heuer's previous insight into team dynamics advocates the use of analytic techniques such as Nominal Group Technique and Starbursting for idea generation and prediction markets for aggregating opinions in response to the identified problems. The book proposes SATs as not only a means for guiding collection and analysis, but also a means for guiding group interaction. =Recommendations to the Director of National Intelligence= Heuer and Pherson assert that the National Intelligence Council (NIC) needs to serve as the entity that sets the standards for the use of structured analytic techniques within the intelligence community. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) could accomplish this by creating a new position to oversee the use of SATs in all NIC projects. Further, Heuer and Pherson suggest that the DNI create a \\"center for analytic tradecraft\\" responsible for testing all structured analytic techniques, developing new structured analytic techniques and managing feedback and lessons learned regarding all structured analytic techniques throughout the intelligence community. Psychology of Intelligence Analysis and key concepts Heuer's seminal work Psychology of Intelligence Analysis details his three fundamental points. First, human minds are ill-equipped (\\"poorly wired\\") to cope effectively with both inherent and induced uncertainty. Second, increased knowledge of our inherent biases tends to be of little assistance to the analyst. And lastly, tools and techniques that apply higher levels of critical thinking can substantially improve analysis on complex problems. =Mental models and perceptions= Mental models, or mind sets, are essentially the screens or lenses that people perceive information through. Even though every analyst sees the same piece of information, it is interpreted differently due to a variety of factors (past experience, education, and cultural values to name merely a few). In essence, one's perceptions are morphed by a variety of factors that are completely out of the control of the analyst. Heuer sees mental models as potentially good and bad for the analyst. On the positive side, they tend to simplify information for the sake of comprehension but they also obscure genuine clarity of interpretation. Therefore, since all people observe the same information with inherent and different biases, Heuer believes an effective analysis system needs a few safeguards. It should: encourage products that clearly show their assumptions and chains of inferences; and it should emphasize procedures that expose alternative points of view. What is required of analysts is \\"a commitment to challenge, refine, and challenge again their own working mental models.\\" This is a key component of his analysis of competing hypotheses; by delineating all available hypotheses and refuting the least likely ones, the most likely hypothesis becomes clearer. =Recommendations= Heuer offers several recommendations to the intelligence community for improving intelligence analysis and avoiding consistent pitfalls. First, an environment that not only promotes but rewards critical thinking is essential. Failure to challenge the first possible hypothesis simply because it sounds logical is unacceptable. Secondly, Heuer suggests that agencies expand funding for research on the role that cognitive processes play in decision making. With so much hanging on the failure of success of analytical judgments, he reasons, intelligence agencies need to stay abreast of new discoveries in this field. Thirdly, agencies should promote the continued development of new tools for assessing information. Analysis of competing hypotheses \\"Analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH) is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that is consistent and inconsistent with each hypothesis, and rejects hypotheses that contain too much inconsistent data.\\" ACH is an eight step process to enhance analysis: A single-page document. #Identify all possible hypotheses #Make a list of significant evidence and arguments #Prepare a matrix to analyze the \\"diagnosticity\\" of evidence #Drawn tentative conclusions #Refine the matrix #Compare your personal conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis with the inconsistency scores #Report your conclusions #Identify indicators Heuer originally developed ACH to be included as the core element in an interagency deception analysis course during the Reagan administration in 1984 concentrated on Soviet deception regarding arms deals. The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in conjunction with Heuer developed the PARC ACH 2.0.5 software for use within the intelligence community in 2005. See also: Involvement in the Nosenko case During the 1980s, Richards Heuer was deeply involved in analyzing the controversial Yuri Nosenko case. His paper, Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment, was originally published in 1987 in the CIA's classified journal Studies in Intelligence, where it remained classified for eight years. In 1995, it was then published in Inside CIA's Private World, Declassified Articles from the Agency's Internal Journal, 1955‚Äì1992. The article is an explanation of how and why the errors associated with the Nosenko case occurred, and has been used for teaching deception analysis to analysts. Heuer outlines five strategies for identifying truth in deception analysis cases, employing the Nosenko case as a use case throughout in order to demonstrate how analysts on the case failed to conclude that Nosenko was legitimate. The five strategies presented in the article are: #Motive approach: Identifying whether or not there is a motive for deception. #Anomalies and inconsistencies approach: Searching for inconsistencies from or deviations the norm. #Litmus test approach: Comparing the information from an unknown or new source with the information from a reliable or credible source. #Cost accounting approach: Analyzing the opportunity cost for the enemy and the cost of conducting deception. #Predictive test approach: Developing a tentative hypothesis and then comprehensively testing it. Heuer states that though he was at one point a believer in \\"the master plot\\" (deep and pervasive penetration of the CIA by the Soviets) due to reasoning elaborated in the anomalies and inconsistencies approach and the motive approach, he came to discount this theory and to accept Yuri Nosenko as bona fide after exercising the predictive test approach and the cost accounting approach. Heuer maintains that considering the master plot was not unwise as it was a theory that should have been discussed in light of the information available at the time. The conclusion of the five strategies approach is that, as demonstrated by the Nosenko case, \\"all five approaches are useful for complete analysis\\" and that an analyst should not rely on one strategy alone. Contributions in personnel security During his 20 years as a consultant for the Defense Personnel Security Research Center (PERSEREC), Richards Heuer developed two encyclopedic websites: the Adjudicative Desk Reference and Customizable Security Guide and the Automated Briefing System. Both are free to use and available in the public domain for download. Adjudicative desk reference This large database supplements the Intelligence Community Adjudicative Guidelines which specify 13 categories of behavior that must be considered before granting a security clearance. Heuer's product provides far more detailed information about why these behaviors are a potential security concern and how to evaluate their severity. Though this background information is not official government policy, the reference has been approved by the Security Agency Executive Advisory Committee as a tool for assisting security investigators and managers. Appeals panels and lawyers have used it to deal with security clearance decisions, and it has also been proven useful to employee assistance counselors. Online guide to security responsibilities This tool provides an all-in-one source for introducing new personnel to all the various intricacies of security. Additionally, it provides a wealth of information for security professionals seeking to prepare awareness articles or briefings. The software covers a variety of topics including (but not limited to): protecting classified information, foreign espionage threats and methods, and computer vulnerabilities. It is an updated version of the Customizable Security Guide. In hard copy format, there are over 500 pages of material.

History  Founded in 1997 in New York City by Alex Konanykhin, Nikolai Mentchokov, and Elena Gratcheva as an advertising agency. The company later shifted focus to work primarily on website design. The company name is based on the initials of the founders' last names. The company's first headquarters were located in the Empire State Building. At that time, many of the company's employees were Russian. The company began with 35 employees based in one physical location, but has since moved to the use of a virtual office, using employees from different countries instead of just one location.  Webmercials  In 1998 KMGi introduced the use of Macromedia‚Äôs Flash Technology for online advertising. Alex Mentchoukov, the agency's chief creative officer, created a way of using vector-based graphics for Web advertisements without using as much bandwidth as pixel-based graphics. From this work, KMGi became one of the first companies to create animated, television-style \\"webmercials\\" for the Internet. In August 2000, KMGi partnered with Unicast to move from using the interstitial format for its commercials to the superstitial format, which reduced the slow-down effect of browser downloads. In 2002 the KMGi website then became the first to be carried entirely in Flash Lingo. KMGi's webmercial and other services clients have included Volvo, Pfizer, DuPont, Best Western, Verizon, and Macromedia. In addition, the agency has produced advertisements for companies including Coca-Cola, Lexus, and the New York Post.  Software and services  In 2000, the company began selling retail software and by 2004, KMGi had $1.4 million in sales of software. Part of the company's marketing plan included the distribution of free anti-spam software to consumers who watched a 30-second commercial. KMGi also created WebPresentations, a producer of online product demonstrations. In 2004 KMGi released SeePassword, a program that allowed users to recover hidden or lost passwords from Internet Explorer. In 2005, KMGi formed a subsidiary called Publicity Guaranteed, public relations firm. In 2010, KMGi then formed a subsidiary called WikiExperts, which creates and repairs English wikipedia articles for companies or advises them on how to create articles themselves. At the time of WikiExperts' creation, Konanykhin suggested that wikipedia should use advertising to generate more revenue and pay \\"qualified experts\\" to improve its content. In 2011 KMGi released TransparentBusiness software, which allows employers or clients to monitor the activity of those working for them on computers via a cloud-supported activity monitor and screenshots. In 2012 TransparentBusiness received the PC World Latin America Rising Star Award for the Best Cloud Computing Solution for Enterprise.

The wind farms were developed as a single unit after planning consent was given in 2003. Construction work began in 2006 and was completed in 2009. The farm has a maximum output of 194MW from 54 Siemens Wind Power 3.6-107 turbines with a generating capacity of 194 MW. The capacity factor of the farm has been 31 to 36%. History Planning and construction The Lynn wind farm and the Inner Dowsing wind farm were initially developed as separate projects by AMEC and Renewable Energy Systems. The projects received planning consent in 2003. At the planning stage the development was opposed by fishermen. In 2003 Centrica Renewable Energy acquired the Lynn and the Dowsing wind farm projects and merged them into a single development. Tendering for construction of the wind farm took place from 2005, with contracts awarded between 2006 and 2007. TIV Resolution installing wind turbines (June 2007) In 2006 Nexans was awarded a contract to supply inter-array and export cabling for the windfarm, consisting of of 36kV three core cables. MT Hojgaard was contracted to install the offshore foundations. Siemens Wind obtained the contract to supply 54 of its SWT-3.7-107 wind turbines for the farm, and Siemens Power Transmission & Distribution supplied the onshore 33 to 132kV substation and associated switchgear, and was contracted to lay the onshore cables. Onshore civil engineering work began late 2006 - a substation was constructed near Skegness., onshore construction including cable laying was complete by 2007. Installation of the offshore foundations was undertaken using the vessel MV Resolution - foundations were installed by 2007, and cables and turbines were installed by 2008, with the last turbine installed July 2008. Commissioning work was complete in March 2009. Finance and ownership The project cost was an estimated ‚Ç¨349 million. In 2009 TCW acquired a 50% stake in the farm (and the 26MW onshore Glens of Foudland wind farm) from Centrica for ¬£84 million ($137.5 million). In early 2016 Centrica and EIG Global Energy Partners agreed to sell the wind farm to a consortium (Green Investment Bank 51% and BlackRock 49%). The sale including the 26MW onshore Glens of Foudland wind farm was valued at c. ¬£423 million. Operations and maintenance During 2010 Siemens changed bearing on the Burbo Bank wind farm due to corrosion problems, and examined bearings at Lynn and Inner Dowsing; subsequently the company decided to replace bearings on all 53 machines in 2011. In 2012 Centrica established a maintenance base for the wind farm at No.3 Fish Dock at the Port of Grimsby.See No.3 Fish Dock in Port of Grimsby. In the first four years of full operation (2009‚Äì12) the farm had a capacity factor of between 31 and 36%. In c.2012-3 an additional 20MW of turbines were built within the wind farm, as part of the Lincs Wind Farm development - they were connected to the Lincs' export grid.See Lincs Wind Farm. In 2014 Cofely Fabricom GDF Suez was awarded the contract to carry out grouting repairs and structural modifications on the turbine foundations. By 2014 some of the initial 'under warranty' service plans were coming to an end. In early 2015 ABB was awarded a maintenance contract for the electrical generators and other electrical equipment on the wind farm. Cofely Fabricom GDF Suez was awarded a general repair contract for the farm including major repairs in March 2015.

It was created for the Early Man volume of the Life Nature Library, published in 1965, and drawn by the artist Rudolph Zallinger. It has been viewed as a picture of the discredited view (orthogenesis) that evolution is progressive. As such, it has been widely parodied and imitated to create images of progress of other kinds. The picture of progress in evolution was anticipated by Thomas Henry Huxley's 1863 Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Illustration The illustration is part of a section of text and images commissioned by Time-Life Books for the Early Man volume (1965) of the Life Nature Library, by F. Clark Howell.Howell, F. Clark and the Editors of TIME-LIFE Books (1965), Early Man, New York: TIME-LIFE Books, pp. 41‚Äì45. The illustration is a foldout entitled \\"The Road to Homo Sapiens\\". It shows a sequence of figures, drawn by natural history painter and muralist Rudolph Zallinger (1919‚Äì1995). The 15 human evolutionary forebears are lined up as if they were marching in a parade from left to right. The first two sentences of the caption read \\"What were the stages of man's long march from apelike ancestors to sapiens? Beginning at right and progressing across four more pages are milestones of primate and human evolution as scientists know them today, pieced together from the fragmentary fossil evidence.\\" Sequence of species The 15 primate figures in Zallinger's image, from left to right, are listed below. The datings follow the original graphic and may no longer reflect current scientific opinion. * Pliopithecus, 22‚Äì12 million year old \\"ancestor of the gibbon line\\" * Proconsul, 21‚Äì9 million year old primate which may or may not have qualified as an ape * Dryopithecus, 15‚Äì8 million year old fossil ape, the first such found (1856) and probable ancestor of modern apes * Oreopithecus, 15‚Äì8 million years old * Ramapithecus, 13‚Äì8 million year old ape and possible ancestor of modern orangutans (now considered a female Sivapithecus) * Australopithecus, 2‚Äì3 million years old; then considered the earliest \\"certain hominid\\" * Paranthropus, 1.8‚Äì0.8 million years old * Advanced Australopithecus, 1.8‚Äì0.7 million year old * Homo erectus, 700,000‚Äì400,000 years old, then the earliest known member of the genus Homo * Early Homo sapiens, 300,000‚Äì200,000 years old; from Swanscombe, Steinheim and Montmaurin, then considered probably the earliest H. sapiens * Solo Man, 100,000‚Äì50,000 years old; described as an extinct Asian \\"race\\" of H. sapiens (now considered a sub-species of H. erectus) * Rhodesian Man, 50,000‚Äì30,000 years old; described as an extinct African \\"race\\" of H. sapiens (now considered either H. rhodesiensis or H. heidelbergensis and dated much earlier) * Neanderthal Man, 100,000‚Äì40,000 years old * Cro-Magnon Man, 40,000‚Äì5,000 years old * Modern Man, 40,000 years to the present Intention One of many versions of the progressionist meme: Astronomy Evolution 2 by Giuseppe Donatiello, 2016 Contrary to appearances and some complaints, the original 1965 text of \\"The Road to Homo Sapiens\\" reveals an understanding of the fact that a linear presentation of a sequence of primate species, all in the direct line of human ancestors, would not be a correct interpretation. For example, the fourth of Zallinger's figures (Oreopithecus) is said to be \\"a likely side branch on man's family tree\\". Only the next figure (Ramapithecus) is described as \\"now thought by some experts to be the oldest of man's ancestors in a direct line\\" (something no longer considered likely). That implies that the first four primates are not to be considered actual human ancestors. Likewise, the seventh figure (Paranthropus) is said to be \\"an evolutionary dead end\\". In addition, the colored stripes, across the top of the figure, which indicate the age and duration of the various lineages clearly imply that there is no evidence of direct continuity between extinct and extant lineages and also, multiple lineages of the figured hominids occurred contemporaneously at several points in the history of the group. Reception Anti-war mural, Tehran, 2007 The image has frequently been copied, modified, and parodied. It has been criticized as \\"unintentionally and wrongly\\" implying that \\"evolution is progressive\\". With regard to the way the illustration has been interpreted, the anthropologist and author of the section, F. Clark Howell, remarked: Stephen Jay Gould (1941‚Äì2002) condemned the iconology of the image in several pages of his 1989 book, Wonderful Life, reproducing several advertisements and political cartoons that make use of the illustration to make their various points. In a chapter, \\"The Iconography of an Expectation\\", he asserted that The intelligent design advocate Jonathan Wells wrote in Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? (2002), \\"Although it is widely used to show that we are just animals, and that our very existence is a mere accident, the ultimate icon goes far beyond the evidence.\\" The book likens a selection of evolution theory textbook topics to the cover illustration thus qualified. Brian Switek, writing for Scientific American, argues that the idea of a \\"march of progress\\", as depicted in the 1965 Time- Life illustration, dates back to the medieval great chain of being and the 19th century idea of the \\"missing link\\" in the fossil record. In his view, to understand life and evolution, \\"step one involves casting out types of imagery which constrain rather than enlighten.\\" Writing in Wired, Switek added that \\"There is perhaps no other illustration that is as immediately recognizable as representing evolution, but the tragedy of this is that it conveys a view of life that does not resemble our present understanding of life's history.\\" Parodies and adaptations A German protest banner in Stuttgart, 2010. The caption below the image reads \\"We will not allow ourselves to be made into monkeys!\\" The March of Progress has often been imitated, parodied, or adapted for commercial or political purposes. The logo for the Leakey Foundation and the National Museums of Kenya features a small silhouette of the March of Progress image itself.Barringer (2006), Op. cit. The cover of the 1972 Doors album Full Circle references the March of Progress, as does the 1985 Supertramp album Brother Where You Bound, while the soundtrack CD for the 1992 movie Encino Man shows an ape evolving into a skateboarder. The December 2005 issue of The Economist depicts hominids progressing up a flight of stairs to transform into a woman in a black dress holding a glass of champagne to illustrate \\"The Story of Man\\". Predecessors The frontispiece to Thomas Henry Huxley's 1863 Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature was intended to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but unintentionally created a durable meme of supposed \\"monkey-to-man\\" progress. Thomas Henry Huxley's frontispiece to his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature was intended simply to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but its unintentional left-to-right progressionist sequence has according to the historian Jennifer Tucker \\"become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution\\". \\"Evolution\\" in 1889 edition of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court An illustration, with the caption \\"Evolution\\", showing two sequences of four images, each illustrating a gradual transformation of an animal into a human, appeared in the 1889 editionProject Gutenberg text, search for second appearance of the word \\"crusher.\\" Title page image shows \\"New York: Charles L.

Both events‚ÄîThe National Magazine Awards gala and the Digital Publishing Awards soir√©e‚Äîtake place each June in Toronto. Each year the NMAF relies on over 100 volunteer judges to evaluate the entries and award gold and silver winners in the NMA written, visual, integrated and special categories and in the various DPA categories. A 20-member board of directors mostly drawn from the Canadian media industry governs the NMAF. The current president of the board of directors of the NMAF is Nino Di Cara, Executive Vice President, Content Marketing for Bookmark (formerly Spafax).  History  In 1976 Andrew MacFarlane, Dean of Journalism at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), was trying to revive the university's recently defunct President's Medal for Canadian Magazine Journalism. His original idea was to create a new award divided into English and French counterparts. But MacFarlane eventually developed a proposal for a series of magazine awards, whose salient features were that the program would be bilingual ‚Äì and therefore truly national ‚Äì and would recognize individual excellence in the many aspects of the magazine industry ‚Äì writers, illustrators, editors, photographers and art directors. MacFarlane together with John S. Crosbie, president of the Magazine Association of Canada, secured the participation of the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association (CPPA), representing 193 Canadian magazines, and CPPA's former president Michael de Pencier. MacFarlane reached out to his counterpart at Universit√© Laval, Roger de la Garde, Alan Edmunds, head of the Periodical Writers Association of Canada (PWAC), and veteran newsman Pierre Berton, among others. As the collective effort began to take shape across the country, by the spring of 1977 the National Magazine Awards had developed a clear mandate. On 14 November 1977, National Magazine Awards Foundation received its charter of non-profit foundation status from the Government of Ontario. In 2015, the NMAF established the Digital Publishing Awards, to promote and reward the achievements of those who create digital publishing content in Canada. The National Magazine Awards celebrated 40 years of awarding Canadian creators in 2017. The 40th anniversary event was co-hosted by Kim Pittaway, Michael de Pencier, and D.B. Scott. Alicia Elliott delivered the keynote address.  The first awards  There were more than 1300 entries to the first National Magazine Awards for the year 1977. 62 judges evaluated the entries and awarded winners in 14 categories. The first National Magazine Awards gala was held on Thursday, 11 May 1978 at the Hotel Toronto. Pierre Berton emceed the event, where the 660 guests dined and danced to Jack Collins and his five-piece band. Before presenting the awards, Berton proclaimed to the audience, \\"In a bold departure from tradition, there are to be no thank you speeches. We can do that because we are giving money, not some cheap statuette.\\"http://www.magazine-awards.com/index.cfm/ci_id/1291/la_id/1 If any winner started to talk on stage, Berton reportedly waved a large hook in the speaker's direction. Awards were handed down in 14 categories (with separate French- and English-language winners for the President's Award for General Magazine Articles). 11 different magazines won awards. The NMAF also honoured outstanding achievement by a magazine: L'actualit√© (French) and Harrowsmith (English) took the awards.  Major winners of the National Magazine Awards  The now-defunct Saturday Night is the all-time leader in awards, with 129 gold awards. Toronto Life magazine leads all current publications with 108 gold awards. Writer Robert Fulford is the all-time individual leader with 14 gold awards. The NMAF also maintains a searchable archive of all past winners and tallies of magazines and creators who have won the most National Magazine Awards.  Categories  The NMAF has a total of 29 awards categories, including 10 categories from the Magazine Grands Prix program. There are 4 types of awards categories: Written Categories & Visual Awards: Long-Form Feature Writing, Feature Writing, Short Feature Writing, Columns, Essays, Investigative Reporting, Fiction, Personal Journalism, Poetry, Professional Article, Profiles, Service Journalism, Best New Magazine Writer, Illustration (incl. Spot & Photo Illustration), Portrait Photography, Lifestyle Photography, Photo Essay & Photojournalism, One of a Kind Storytelling. Editorial Awards: Best Editorial Package, Art Direction Grand Prix, Editor Grand Prix, Cover Grand Prix.

Still, it's possible that Aivazovsky's artistic impression simply heightened the tension in the painting by accentuating the hopelessness of the brig's situation. Paintings by other artists (Krasovskiy, Barri, Pechatin) of the same battle, though less known, portray a more realistic depiction of the battle.

Morality received the 2009 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novelette. Plot summary Chad and Nora Callahan are suffering from financial difficulties brought on by lack of employment and low-paying jobs. While they are seemingly frustrated with the influx of monthly bills and other expenses, they remain largely optimistic about the future. Chad hopes to supplement their income by writing a book based on his experiences as a substitute teacher, while Nora, a nurse, works full-time for a retired clergyman named George Winston, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair after suffering from a stroke. Nora's time spent with Winston is largely uneventful, until one day he offers Nora a solution to her money problems. Winston says that he has lived his life largely without sin and seeks to experience one major sin before he dies. However, he is unable to leave his house given his current condition, making committing any worthwhile sin impossible without aid. Winston states that he intends to commit a sin vicariously through Nora's actions and effectively \\"doubl[ing] his sin quotient\\" in the eyes of God. He makes it clear that for Nora's help and assumption of risk in this deed, he will pay her a total of $200,000. Initially, after Winston reveals what the sin involves, Nora is appalled and assumes that he must be insane. After discussing the pros and cons of the offer with Chad‚Äîand reasoning that with the money they would be able to pay off all their debts and move to Vermont‚ÄîNora agrees to the proposal. After committing the act with Chad, Nora returns to Winston with a videotape documenting their efforts. While viewing the tape, it's revealed that the sin Winston chose to commit consisted of Nora going up to a small child in a park in broad daylight and punching him in the face, causing the child to suffer a bloody nose. Seemingly satisfied with the outcome of Nora's actions, Winston agrees to pay her the money. He supposes that Nora will no longer wish to work for him now that she has seen his true face. Nora says she finds the whole situation repulsive and wonders why Winston would want to commit such a senseless act. Shortly afterward, she learns that Winston has committed suicide. Nora wonders about the videotape and whether or not it will be discovered. As time passes, Chad and Nora are wracked with guilt over their complicity. Their optimism wanes as their fear of exposure increases. Chad starts drinking, while Nora has two affairs and develops a tendency for masochistic satisfaction during sex. They eventually divorce. Chad blames the failure and poor quality of his book on guilt and Nora's lack of faith in his writing talent. Nora is happy to be rid of Chad and begins working full-time at a hospital. Nora finds an old book titled The Basis of Morality in a used bookstore; she had previously seen it in Winston's study. After reading through it, Nora sadly concludes that there is little or nothing in the book that she didn't already know.

Marcus Stewart wears face make-up in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Stairwell Theater, 2019 Theatrical makeup is makeup that is used to assist in creating the appearance of the characters that actors portray during a theater production. Background In Greek and Roman theatre, makeup was unnecessary. Actors wore various masks, allowing them to portray another gender, age, or entirely different likeness. Thespis, considered to be the first actor, used white lead and wine to paint his face. In medieval Europe, actors altered their appearances by painting their faces a different color. Performers who portrayed God painted their faces white or gold; actors playing angels painted their faces red. During the Renaissance, actors were creative and resourceful when making-over their faces. They used lamb's wool for false beards and flour as face paint. Advancements in stage lighting technology required stage makeup to evolve beyond one over-all face colour to a multidimensional craft. Originally, theatres used candles and oil lamps; these two sources of light were dim and allowed for crude, unrealistic makeup applications. Once gas lighting, limelight and electric light were introduced to theatres, a need emerged for new makeup materials and more skillful application techniques. In 1873, Ludwig Leichner, a Wagnerian opera singer, began commercially producing a non-toxic greasepaint stick, easing the application of makeup. Highlight and shadow Through the use of makeup, specifically highlighting and shading, the apparent shape of an actor's face can be changed. By highlighting the face's protruding bones, the features become pronounced; shadowing cavities can add depth. Sagging jowls, forehead wrinkles, eye pouches, and prominent veins can be created by manipulating highlights and shadows. A highlight is a base makeup that is at least two shades lighter than the base. It is applied on the bridge of the nose, cheekbones, and areas under the eyes and below the brows. Using a color two shades deeper than the base provides depth and definition. This depth is commonly used on the eye sockets, to thin the sides of the nose, to shallow the cheeks, and to minimize heaviness under the chin. Makeup and lighting Lighting controls makeup to a high degree. Makeup can lose its effectiveness due to incorrect stage lighting. Conversely, skillful lighting can greatly aid the art of makeup. Close communication between the lighting director and the makeup artist is crucial for the best possible effect. Understanding light's effect on makeup and various shades and pigments is important when designing a performer's makeup. The following are among the basic rules of light: nothing has color until light is reflected from it; an object appears black when all of the light is absorbed; an object appears white when all of the light is reflected. If certain rays are absorbed and others are reflected, the reflected rays determine the color. Light's effect on makeup *Pink tends to gray the cool colors and intensify the warm ones. Yellow becomes more orange. *Flesh pink flatters most makeup. *Fire red ruins makeup. All but the darker flesh tones virtually disappear. Light and medium rouge fade into the foundation, whereas the dark red rouges turn a reddish brown. Yellow becomes orange, and the cool shading colors become shades of gray and black. *Bastard amber is flattering because it picks up the warm pinks and flesh tones in the makeup. *Amber and orange intensifies and yellow most flesh colors. They turn rouges more orange. Cool colors are grayed. *Green grays all flesh tones and rouges in proportion to its intensity. Green will be intensified. Yellow and blue will become greener. *Light blue-green lowers the intensity of the base colors. One should generally use very little rouge under this type of light. *Green-blue washes out pale flesh tones, and will gray medium and deep flesh tones, as well as all reds. *Blues gray most flesh tones and cause them to appear more red or purple. *Violet causes orange, flame, and scarlet to become redder. Rouge appears more intense. *Purple affects makeup like violet lighting, except reds and oranges will be even more intense, and most blues will look violet. Straight makeup Straight makeup is a style of makeup that provides a natural, clean and healthy glow. Skin If a performer's skin is perfectly toned, makeup spreads smoothly and adheres easily. Dry skin or oily skin is dealt with prior to makeup application; otherwise, the makeup appears blotchy or smeared due to variations in absorption. Performers with dry skin use a moisturizer daily and after their faces have been cleansed following a performance. Performers with oily complexions use a facial toner wipe or astringent to remove the oil and allow a smooth application. Skin has four basic tones: brown, fair, pink and olive. Individuals with fair, pink, and olive skin tones use olive, beige, or suntan bases. Makeup artist and performers select shades compatible with the natural skin tone, but the base is one to several shades deeper. Performers with predominately pink or ruddy complexions use base colors with cool undertones. The character, size of the theatre, and light intensity will determine the tone depth of the foundation. A thin layer of base makeup is applied to the neck, ears, and face using a white rubber sponge or fingers. A heavy application of base appears aged and creepy. Rouge Fair complexions are enhanced by soft shades of peach and pink, while brown complexions are best accented with coral shades. The moist powder is applied before powder; dry rouge is used to accent the already powdered makeup. Eyes Eyes and eyebrows are the greatest communicative tool in an actor's arsenal. They are the most expressive feature on the face. =Eye shadow= Grease or stick shadow is applied to the eyelids and blended out toward the eyebrow bone before powder is applied; dry eye shadow is used alone or to intensify and touch up the color underneath. Dark eye shadow or grease deepens the eye sockets, creating a skull-like effect. Shades of brown and gray are best for individuals with fair complexions. Individuals with brown complexions use lighter shadows such as toast, mushroom or soft yellows. =Eye liner= Liquid eyeliner, cake eyeliner, or the eyebrow pencil is used to accent and frame the eyes. There are two ways to line the upper lid of the eye: the owl eye or the almond eye. The owl eye is used to widen the eye and involves using a heavier line in the middle of the lid. The almond-shaped eye is created by extending the line out beyond the outer corner of the eye. The lower line is created by using the same tool used on the upper lid. The line begins a quarter-inch from the inner corner of the eye. This extra space is needed to open the eye. =Eyelashes= Mascara is used to add extra attention to the eyes. Black lash mascara is the most popular and commonly used by women with fair and brown complexions. Very fair individuals and men use brown mascara. The bottom lashes are coated with mascara and to avoid using false lashes, a process of layering powder and mascara is used to provide greater thickness. Powder A generous amount of powder is needed to reduce unwanted shine. If a performer's makeup is under-powdered, his skin oils will break through quickly, producing shine and possibly running. After powder is applied to the entire face, starting under and around the eyes, it is gently pressed for thirty seconds. The excess is brushed off with a large soft brush or piece of cotton. A wet natural sponge or cotton is wiped lightly across the face to set the makeup, to remove any visible powder, and to eliminate the masky feeling. Translucent powders are used for fair complexions because they do not alter the original color of the base, the under-rouge, or the moist eye shadow. Brown complexions are set with tinted that is compatible with the base color. It is used sparingly over the under-rouge and moist eye shadow. After the powder is applied, dry eye shadow and dry rouge are added. Lips Applied makeup to the lips and cheeks assisting in the conveyance of emotion. Though the eyes are the most expressive feature of the face, the eyes and ears of the audience follow mouth movements to understand a play's progression. If a performer's lips are underdone or overplayed, they will detract from the performer and the performance. A general rule is: the larger the mouth, the deeper the lipstick tone. However, the actor should not appear ‚Äúall mouth‚Äù. Fair complexions use shades of lipstick like pink and coral. Brown complexions are enhanced by coral and orange shades. Red lipsticks are reserved for large theatres and character portrayals. An auburn or brown pencil are used to provide definition to the lips. Lipsticks on men can look doll-like. Men use natural-colored lipsticks, lightly applied. Training/Education Because stage actors are seen from farther away than actors on screen, it is crucial that their makeup is more dramatic and professionally done. Many higher-learning institutions have drama departments where all aspects of theater are taught, including the art of theatrical makeup. Some independent agencies also provide classes in theatrical makeup, and online courses are also available. Through training, makeup artists learn important techniques such as hand-eye coordination, ability to draw straight lines and consistent shapes, creativity, good grooming and personal hygiene habits, etc. Many makeup artists who specialize in theatrical makeup build portfolios to show their clients and employers. Many of them work as freelance makeup artists or work for cosmetics brands in department stores.

Darwall-Smith, Robin, A History of University College, Oxford. Oxford University Press, 2008. . He was noted for his love of society, and for his expensive way of living.:s:Charlett, Arthur (DNB00) Life He was son of Arthur Charlett, rector of Collingbourn Ducis, Wiltshire, by Judith, daughter of Mr Cratford, a merchant of London, and was born at Shipton, near Cheltenham, on 4 January 1655. After receiving his early education at the free school at Salisbury, he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 13 January 1669, having just completed his fourteenth year. He obtained a scholarship there college and proceeded B.A. on 17 April 1673, and M.A. 23 November 1676. He was chosen Fellow at the election of 1680, and the same year received deacon's orders from John Fell, bishop of Oxford. In 1683 he was chosen junior proctor. He was appointed tutor to Francis North, 2nd Baron Guilford in 1688. On 17 December 1684 he took the degree of B.D., and when in 1692 the mastership of University College was refused by internal candidates he was chosen master on 7 July, with the backing of John Hudson, and the next day proceeded D.D. Charlett saw that the Clarendon Press annually printed some classical work, and then himself presented a copy of it to each of the students of his college. He was an interfering academic politician, satirised in No. 43 of The Spectator where Charlett, under the name of Abraham Froth is made to write a letter describing the business transacted at the meetings of the hebdomadal council. He promoted the first attempt at a university newspaper, published in 1707, with the title of Mercurius Oxoniensis, or the Oxford Intelligencer. Through the influence of Archbishop Thomas Tenison, Charlett was appointed chaplain to the King on 17 November 1697, and held the office until he with other chaplains was removed in March 1717. In the spring of 1706 he was in some trouble, being sent for to London to give an account of a paper he had shown circulated, asserting that Gilbert Burnet was to receive a large sum of money when presbyterianism was established. On 28 June 1707, he was instituted to the rectory of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire. He damaged his reputation in the matter of the dedication of Edward Thwaites's Saxon Heptateuch to George Hickes, where Lords Somers and Oxford were both friends of Dean Hickes and resented Charlett's interference. In 1714 he used his influence with the vice-chancellor to get Thomas Hearne prosecuted for his preface to William Camden's Elizabeth, and so put a stop to the printing. Charlett died at his lodgings in University College, on 18 November 1722, and is buried in the college chapel. The position of Master was contested by two men, Thomas Cockman and William Dennison. The stand-off was not resolved until 1729, after an appeal to the Crown.William Carr, University College, pages 172‚Äì174. Works He published A Discourse of the Holy Eucharist, 1686, in answer to Abraham Woodhead's Two Discourses concerning ... the Eucharist, published by Obadiah Walker in 1686. He spent the long vacation 1683 in taking a tour in Scotland, where he was hospitably entertained by Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, in the county of Ross, and by other men of learning; he wrote most of the life of Sir George Mackenzie in Anthony √† Wood's Fasti (ii. 414). Charlett contributed a paper on a fatal colliery fire near Newcastle to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1708.

It is an anti-radiation drone that can autonomously home in on radio emissions. This SEAD-optimised loitering munition is designed to loiter the battlefield and attack targets by self-destructing into them.\\"Israel special - IAI's Harop ups the stakes on SEAD missions\\" The drone can either operate fully autonomously, using its anti-radar homing system, or it can take a human-in-the-loop mode. If a target is not engaged, the drone will return and land itself back at base. It has been designed to minimize its radar-signature through stealth (low- observability). This anti-radiation drone is designed to target enemy air- defense systems in a first line of attack, as the small drone (with its small radar cross-section) can evade SAMs and radar detection systems which are designed to target much larger aircraft or to intercept fixed-trajectory missiles.Israeli-made kamikaze drone spotted in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict By Thomas Gibbons-Neff April 5, Washington Post Overview The IAI Harop has a loiter (flying) time of 6 hours and a range of 1,000 km both ways. It is a larger version of the IAI Harpy and is launched from ground- or sea-based canisters, but can be adapted for air-launch. The Harop can either operate fully autonomously, or it can take a man-in-the-loop mode, being controlled by a remote operator.\\"India eyes IAI's Harop attack UAV\\" The Harop features two guidance modes: it can either home in on radio emissions by itself with its anti-radar homing system,Sweetman 2009 or the operator can select static or moving targets detected by the aircraft's electro-optical sensor. This latter mode allows the Harop to attack radars that are presently shut down and therefore not providing emissions for the aircraft to automatically home in on. If a target is not engaged, the drone will return and land itself back at base. side view. IAI is developing a smaller version of the Harop for smaller applications, which it will unveil in 2015. The smaller Harop would be one- fifth the size and have a lighter warhead. It will be cheaper and have a shorter endurance of 2‚Äì3 hours to be used tactically against time-critical targets or ones that hide and re-appear.IAI developing smaller tactical Harop loitering munition - Flightglobal.com, 28 October 2014 History Turkey may have been the launch customer for the Harop in 2005. In October 2005, MBDA submitted the Harop (under the name \\"White Hawk\\") to the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence for consideration as the system for the Ministry's Loitering Munition Capability Demonstration (LMCD) program, otherwise known as \\"Fire Shadow\\".\\"Israel Unveils Loitering Anti-Missile Drone\\"\\"Rivals unveil concepts for loitering munition demo\\" The Harop was selected as one of the finalists, but was rejected when the MoD decided that the contract should go to a British team.

In September 2009, the Indian Air Force announced that it will be inducting the Harop systems purchased for US$100 million \\"for up to 10 drones\\". The Harop was publicly unveiled to the world for the first time in India, in the lead-up to the Aero India 2009 show.

In April 2018, IAI systems were observed in a film made by the Azerbaijan Army, specifically the IAI Harop loitering munition system, resulting in criticism from the Armenian government concerning the supply of Israeli arms to the Azeri army. In 2020, Hikmet Hajiyev, an advisor to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, praised the effectiveness of the Harop in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  Combat history  It was first used in combat by Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in April 2016. IAI Harop drones operated by Azerbaijan were used to destroy buses of Armenian soldiers being transported to the frontline. The loitering drones were also reportedly used to destroy an Armenian command post. The Israeli Defense Forces Harop was also credited for destroying a Syrian Air Defence SA-22 Pantsir on 10th May 2018.

The knife has no locking system, but is a friction folder or \\"penny knife\\", using the friction of the swivel or the pressure of the user's thumb on its iconic lever or chikiri, to prevent the knife from folding during use. The handle of the Higonokami is made of a folded over sheet of metal. The handle is stamped with the name of the maker of the knife and the steel used in the blade. A distinguishing feature is that the blade has a flat grind without a secondary bevel. Higonokami refers to \\"Lord-of-Higo\\". Higo was an old province in Japan, on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´, today's Kumamoto Prefecture. \\"Kami\\", literally \\"protector\\", was used as an honorable title for samurai of very high rank bestowed upon them by the sh≈çgun.  History  The knife first appeared in 1896 as a result of smiths struggling with the lowering demand for swords with the decline of the samurai under the reforms made by Emperor Meiji in the late 19th century. The name \\"Higonokami\\" was trademarked by a Miki guild, and today only the maker KaneKoma (Nagao) is legally allowed to use that name. Other makers routinely use \\"Higo\\" or \\"higonokami style\\". Musashi is another brand that goes back to the guild days. Today a number of Japanese knifemakers make traditional styled Higonokami, or modernized versions thereof. Higonokami pocketknives proved very successful and were very popular in Japan.

It is dedicated to Saint Landry of Paris (Bishop c. AD 650). \\"The Mother Church of Acadiana\\", JStor.org, 2010, webpage: Jstor-226. The current church building, in Gothic and Romanesque Revival style, was completed in 1909. \\"Home - St. Landry Catholic Church\\", 2010, webpage: SLCC-home. The church and cemetery were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in the United States on May 5, 1982. By 1792, the church had been renamed from the original title, \\"Parish Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Post of Opelousas\\".  History  In the days of the early 18th century, the area of what is now known as Opelousas was settled by a number of Catholics, many of whom were from Nova Scotia and had no established parish in which to worship. Although there was no official church yet, there was a baptismal ritual which was recorded on May 16, 1756, by Father Pierre Didier, at the home of Jacques Courtableau (now located in Washington, Louisiana). The early records of the church, which were saved by Fr. Joseph de Arazena, the fourth pastor of the church of Opelousas from 1785 to 1789, mentions a Capuchin, Friar Valentin, as the first resident priest in 1764. By 1767 (some historians agree that a church building had been built by 1765), a cypress church had been built along the Opelousas River (today Bayou Courtableau), and it became the parish church between 1766 and 1770. It was rebuilt in 1774 just north of present-day Bayou Carron. The records also show that the church was originally called the \\"Parish Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Post of Opelousas\\". Worship at the present site was not begun until the year 1798, when the construction of a wood-frame building was completed, and the parish name was changed to \\"The Church of St Landry\\". There is no actual record of the original location of the church, but it is believed, according to Fr. Michael Bernard Barriere, pastor from 1813 to 1817, that the church was located a short distance from the present site and being on the Bayou Tesson. It is customary, in the Louisiana area, to name a bayou by appending a proper name similar to naming a lake, such as \\"Bayou Smith\\" (or Lake Smith) rather than \\"Smith Bayou\\". He noted that: \\"During the year 1798, the present church was moved from the bayou (he spells it \\"Baillou\\") in the locality called 'Ponte a M. Tesson'\\". Michel Prudhomme donated a section of land of ,An arpent is an old French measure of land, equivalent to about 0.85 acre. 3x40 arpents in width/length, and M. Tesson donated a section of . The land donated by Mrs. Tesson was located between the present site of the church and Bayou Tesson, also known as the Gully, to the west. The donation of land was made on October 16, 1796. Later the land donated by Tesson was sold to the Marguilliers and was known as the \\"Church Addition\\". A Marguillier is a churchwarden: churchwardens were a group of layman who were in charge of the church property and money. They governed the church and even controlled the salary of the priests in many cases. Michel Prudhomme is buried in the nave of the present church. Michel Prudhomme's French Colonial home, built around 1790, still stands near the church, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. By the early 19th century, the old wooden structure that was built on Bayou Tesson and moved in 1798 to the present site, was in a very dilapidated condition. It had lasted about fifty years. On an official visit by the Bishop William Louis Dubourg, a recommendation was made that a new church be built. If possible, a brick structure was to be erected. Finally, on March 4, 1828, the new brick church was consecrated by Bishop Rosati, of St. Louis, Administrator of Louisiana. The church measured , and was later expanded to wide by Fr. Gilbert Raymond. Fr. Gilbert and his brother, Fr. J. Francois Raymond, were in charge of the parish for thirty-five years. They started a school for boys which was known as St. Mary's Academy for Boys (1855). Fr. Gilbert‚Äôs next step was affording the girls the same opportunity of acquiring a solid, Christian education. After purchasing a piece of land, the Academy of the Immaculate Conception was established in 1856. During the year of 1870, Fr. Gilbert Raymond purchased another piece of land for the creation of a school for the black children of the parish. This school was known under the name of St. Joseph's School. Of Fr. Gilbert's greatest works, was the creation of the college for young men, which had an important part in the development of the entire state of Louisiana. Many men, leaders in business, professional and political life of the section, leaders of their people in general, of great intellectual ability and deep practical faith received their education in the parochial school and finished at the college. Much of the glory of Southwest Louisiana may be attributed to the training which the citizens received from the college, and moral precepts which were made an important factor in the course of instruction. In 1895, Fr. John Engberink was assigned from as past of St. Landry. He set out to build a new church building. This was a great undertaking and would prove to be a great asset to the worshipers of the parish of St. Landry. The work of removing and clearing away of the old church was started in 1902. A temporary church, which had been completed and occupied in 1900, was used until the new church was erected. The new rectory was occupied at the same time. The old bricks of the previous structure were preserved and used in the foundation of the present church. The actual work on the new church was started in September, 1903. The foundation resting on a bed of concrete , starting below the surface of the ground, was built four feet above the surface and given considerable time to harden, before the walls were started. The construction of the walls began in the winter of 1908-09 and was completed and occupied, the first Mass being said on the first Friday of April 1909. The cornerstone had been laid August 8, 1908. The size of the church was very large, being wide in the transepts, and in the body of the church. The seating capacity was about 2000. The church had been the second-largest church in the South for many years and is the second-oldest parish in the diocese. The interior of the church was not completed until the early 1920s because of a lack of funds. When in 1919, Monsignor Albeit Benedict Colliard was made pastor, after the death of Fr. Engberink, he took on the task of completing the church. Msgr. Colliard paid off the large debt incurred in building the church and added stained-glass windows. When the church was first built there was only a flat roof on the tower, however, Msgr. Colliard added the steeple in 1940. Monsignor Colliard died on May 7, 1950, at the age of 69 and is buried in the St. Landry Catholic Cemetery. Monsignor Broussard was the next pastor of the parish. Arriving in 1950, he remained until 1972. While here, Msgr. Broussard reestablished a boys' school. As a builder he moved the academy, which is now Opelousas Catholic School, from south of the church to due east of the church, had a new two-story rectory constructed north of the church, and then in 1963 had the interior of the church redecorated and air conditioned. The church and the church cemetery were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in the United States on May 5, 1982. To this date there have been 33 pastors and countless assistants who have served the people of this parish. Monsignor Russell J. Harrington is the current pastor, with John W. Miller, Sammy Diesi, and Dwayne Joubert as his Permanent Deacons. Father Joseph Verbis Lafleur, who is a candidate for sainthood within the Catholic Church, became a parish priest of this church. The patron saints of the church parish are Saint Landry the Confessor and Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.

It can be topped with sea salt, crumbled pistachios, walnuts, or almond bits. References on the internet date back at least to 2005. A variation was mentioned in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons titled ‚ÄúPray Anything‚Äù. Homer requests God come up with a new snack just before a tanker full of hot fudge and a truck full of ‚ÄúJohnny Bench‚Äôs Pre-Cooked Bacon‚Äù collide, thus sending fudge-covered bacon through the air and onto Homer‚Äôs windshield. He promptly devours the creation and says, ‚ÄúMove over eggs. Bacon just got a new best friend... Fudge‚Äù. The popularity of the dish has spread and the dish has featured on television shows about food. A variant has been served at state fairs, where the bacon is served with chocolate sauce for dipping, and the dish has been developed into a gourmet food bar. A similar food, called \\"salo in chocolate\\" originated in Albania. Candy manufacturer Confectionery Factory made an April Fool's Day version of the treat out of caramel and some rendered pork fat, giving a candy with a salty flavor similar to salo in chocolate. Reception Bacon dipped in chocolate ganache Bacon dipped in chocolate from the 2008 Minnesota State Fair Chocolate-covered bacon is sold as a specialty food across the United States. It appeared at the Minnesota State Fair under the name \\"Pig Lickers\\"; it is sold at the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in California and under the name \\"Pig Candy\\" by a chocolate maker in New York City. The dish has appeared on the television show Dinner: Impossible as one of the foods served by chef Michael Symon as part of his \\"mission\\" to turn everyday boardwalk foods into a gourmet meal at the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey. Bacon was served with a chocolate dipping sauce at the 2009 Florida State Fair. Time magazine videotaped the making of a bacon bar. Preparation and variations A melted chocolate bar drizzled over bacon Streaky bacon is used to make chocolate- covered bacon. It is first cooked, then immersed in melted chocolate; toppings (if any) are added, and the dish is allowed to cool. A variation is to dip the bacon in melted chocolate for a partial coating, leaving some of the bacon showing. A British variation is to wrap a cube of chocolate in uncooked bacon, and to cook the bacon parcel in the oven as normal. The result is a hot bacon package, with a sweet melted chocolate center. The recent popularity in the United States of bacon combined with sweet ingredients, caused by the quick (and sometimes viral) spreading of recipes in national media and on the Internet, has led to unexpected culinary inventions, such as candied bacon cubes, which are based on a recipe for \\"Candied bacon with whipped cream\\" printed in The New York Times, and bacon strips baked with brown sugar used as garnish for martinis.

This definition can be loosely extended to include collisions between sub-orbital or escape-velocity objects with an object in orbit. Prime examples are the anti-satellite tests by the US and China (see below).  Natural-satellite collisions There have been no observed collisions between natural satellites of any Solar System planet or moon. Collision candidates for past events are: * Impact craters on many Jupiter (Jovian) and Saturn's (Saturnian) moons. They may have been formed by collisions with smaller moons, but they could equally likely have been formed by impacts with asteroids and comets during the Late Heavy Bombardment. * The far side of the Moon may have formed from the impact of a smaller moon that also formed during the giant impact event that created the Moon. * The objects making up the Rings of Saturn are believed to continually collide and aggregate with each other, leading to debris with limited size constrained to a thin plane. Although this is believed to be an ongoing process, this has not been directly observed.  Artificial-satellite collisions Three types of collisions have occurred involving artificial satellites orbiting the Earth: * Intentional collisions intended to destroy the satellites, either to test anti-satellite weapons or destroy satellites which may pose a hazard should they reenter the atmosphere intact: ** Several tests conducted as part of the Soviet Union's Istrebitel Sputnikov programme in the 1970s and 80s, involving IS-A satellites intercepting and destroying IS-P, DS-P1-M and Lira target satellites launched specifically for the tests. ** The 1985 destruction of the USA P78-1 solar research satellite during a USA ASM-135 anti-satellite missile test. ** The 2007 destruction of the Chinese Fungyun FY-1C weather satellite during a Chinese anti-satellite missile test. ** The 2008 destruction of the USA-193 military reconnaissance satellite in a decaying orbit by a USA SM-3 missile. ** The 2019 destruction of Microsat-R after Indian military launched an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) to destroy an Indian telecom satellite in a move called \\"Mission Shakti\\". * Unintentional low-speed collisions during failed rendezvous and docking operations: ** The 1994 collision between the manned Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft and the Russian Mir space station. ** The 1997 low-speed collision between the Progress M-34 supply ship and the Russian Mir space station during manual docking manoeuvers. ** The 2005 low-speed collision between the USA DART spacecraft and the USA MUBLCOM communications satellite during orbital rendezvous manoeuvers. * Unintentional high-speed collisions between active satellites and orbital debris: ** The 1996 collision between the French Cerise military reconnaissance satellite and debris from an Ariane rocket. ** The 2009 collision between the Iridium 33 communications satellite and the derelict Russian Kosmos 2251 spacecraft, which resulted in the destruction of both satellites. ** The 22 January 2013 collision between debris from Fengyun FY-1C satellite and the Russian BLITS nano-satellite. ** The 22 May 2013 collision between two CubeSats, Ecuador's NEE-01 Pegaso and Argentina's CubeBug-1, and the particles of a debris cloud around a Tsyklon-3 upper stage (SCN 15890) left over from the launch of Kosmos 1666.

As an officer in the Medical Corps in the Second World War, he was Chief Aural Surgeon to the Military Hospital in Johannesburg. Political Career A United Party candidate, he became an MP for Hillbrow in 1943 when Smuts was returned to power. In Parliament he was noted for the informed content of his speeches, particularly those on financial and treasury matters, and was admired by members on both sides of the House for his quick repartee and cutting interjections and \\"brilliant presentation\\" of argument in support of press freedom.http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/A3393/A3393-E3-1-01-jpeg.pdf Friedman kept his seat until 1948 when Jan Smuts fell from power and the Nationalist Party under D.

Biography  Early life Wilhelm Eduard, son of Wilhelm senior (architect and cement factory owner) and Susanne Karoline Spinnler, grew up in Liestal. Primarily Wilhelm Brodtbeck visited schools in Liestal and then at a later age in Basel. He then studied architecture, concluding at the University of Stuttgart und at the University of Karlsruhe. Later he made various studium journeys in Germany, Holland, Austria, Italy and France, hereafter Brodtbeck worked in Lausanne. He married Susanna Elisabeth Buess from Wenslingen, Basel- Country, in 1904. Career Wilhelm Brodtbeck founded his own architect's office in 1901 in Liestal. As young architect he accomplished a large variety of residential houses. Later he expanded his horizon and realized schools complexes and industrial buildings. As from 1921, together with his partner Fritz Bohny, he managed the architecture bureau W. Brodtbeck AG. In 1952 Rolf Georg Otto was invited by Brodtbeck to take over the well recognized business. The two founders members withdrew themselves from the daily business. Bohny retired, but Brodtbeck remained in the board of directors as president until his death in 1957. The well renowned firm still exists today under the name Otto und Partner. Legacy Throughout the district of Basel, the architect's bureau W. Brodtbeck AG became famous due to their modern style buildings. Be it in partnership work with other companies, W. Brodtbeck AG were able to realise two important projects in Basel city. These are the city of Basel casino (1939‚Äì1941) and, for the chemical enterprise Sandoz, the administrative and head office building. Further important projects from Brodtbeck's architecture bureau are, for example, the school complex \\"Rotackerschulhaus\\" in Liestal, the bank \\"Kantonalbank\\" in Binningen, the mill complex, including the small power station, in Lausen, Basel-Country, (1923) and the building complex for the salt mines in Schweizerhalle by Muttenz. To the afore mentioned, addendum, the residential estate Wasserhaus (1920/21) in the sub- district ‚ÄûNeue Welt‚Äú in M√ºnchenstein. The Wasserhaus estate was developed by Brodtbeck concluding the original plans drawn by Prof. Hans Benno Bernoulli, Basel, (1876‚Äì1959). Due to the unique archetype nature and the prototypical neighbourhood, the Wasserhaus estate was taken up in the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance. Inventar der sch√ºtzenswerten Ortsbilder (ISOS). Further Activities Honorary Work Wilhelm Brodtbeck worked 20 years in the commission for the municipality (‚ÄûGemeindekommission\\") of Liestal and he was member of the board of management of the Basel protected historic site/landmark (Heimatschutzes).

It received a School Achievements Award for the third time in 2003 and has approximately 1,300 pupils attending, including over 250 sixth form students. The school was rated Outstanding in all areas by Ofsted in October 2012. History Beginnings The school opened on 8 January 1856. It was part of the Church of the Annunciation, a Roman Catholic church in Chesterfield built by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) and completed in 1854.Church of the Annunciation, Chesterfield - A Celebration of 150 Years 1854-2004 The church at the time was also known as St Mary's. The school later moved to a site on Cross Street, also in Chesterfield, around 100 meters from the church. The buildings on Cross Street are now home to St Mary's Roman Catholic Primary School, a feeder school to St Mary's Roman Catholic High School. Both schools are closely linked with the Church of the Annunciation. In 1997, the school adopted the motto that now adorns the school badge, \\"Gaudium et Spes\\", meaning \\"Joy and Hope\\". The school's mission is \\"Live, love and learn in the light of Christ\\". Present campus The campus was built on livestock fields at Upper Newbold. A former road, Water Lane, used to run through the school site before it was closed in the 1970s due to fatal accidents. The right of way as a footpath remained open, however, until it was stopped up in 2005. The school was designed by the Ellis-Williams Architecture Partnership to echo the atmosphere of an Italian village, with the original buildings located around a central courtyard, called the Precinct. The first brick was laid on 30 May 1978. Phase 1, consisting of the Gym, Drama Hall and Music room (the current IT2) Block and the Admin, Design Technology and Canteen Blocks were handed over by the developer on 27 November 1980. Work was underway on Phase 2 (Art, Chemistry, and Humanities) and this was completed by the summer of 1981. The school grounds opened to pupils in September 1981, although construction of the Biology and Language Blocks (Phase 3) was still underway. Phase 4, the Sixth Form block, was completed in 1984 along with its architectural highlight 'the Bridge'. Phase 5 was never constructed. The large playing fields were finally handed over by the developer in the mid-1980s, much later than planned, due to issues with landscaping and coal mining shafts being discovered. A primary school was marked on plans for the East 'mound' area of the field, but this was cancelled in the late 1980s. The present campus was the brainchild of Canon David Ryan. He worked for fourteen years from the time of his arrival as Parish Priest at the Annunciation to raise funds for the new school campus. The present campus was officially opened in 1982, one year after its completion. In 1996, a new Music Block and Maths/Physics Block were built, and in 2000 a new building was built to house the school's ICT facilities and sixth form study. This was dedicated to Ryan and was named the Canon David Ryan Building. Ryan died in 2003. Looking west from the Lower Precinct in the evening. In the middle of 2002, work in building an all- weather astro-turf sports pitch was completed. The pitch has facilities for football and hockey, and is floodlit for use during the evening, particularly for after-school sports fixtures and the Chesterfield Hockey Club.

In September 2003, work on a ¬£1.6 million Sports Hall was started, the building was completed in June 2004. The building was dedicated and blessed in the same month. In 2004, work started on a new building to house the school's English Department; this was completed in the middle of 2005 and features five classrooms, three offices, and toilet facilities. The new reception area was completed in June 2009. On the morning of 15 March 2011, a bus carrying pupils to school collided with a bridge near Barrow Hill. The single decker bus, which usually operated the route, was not operating that morning and so a replacement bus - a double decker prohibited from the route due to low bridges - was run instead. One student was seriously injured, with seventeen others sustaining minor injuries. In 2014, work began on a new Drama Studio next to the Music Block, to replace the original one in the Humanities Block, which is now Learning Support. The new Drama Studio was completed in the middle of 2015. The Drama Hall was also extended at this time and electronically controlled movable seating was added. In 2016, one of the language classrooms was turned into Maths 6. In 2017, Art 3 was converted into a room used as part of the Enrichment Learning Programme. The portacabins have also been converted into a 'wellbeing hub'. The reception area underwent renovation during Easter 2018. At the start of the 2018/19 academic year, Caterlink took over the Year 7‚Äì11 school canteen. The school underwent a renovation project from July 2018 to February 2019, which included the installation of a partially new tannoy system, addressable fire alarm system, LED lighting and new ceiling tiles to improve the school's energy efficiency. During the 2019 summer holidays, the front car park was redesigned to create more parking spaces.  Future of campus  The Bridge The Sports Hall from the old Water Lane There are plans to construct a two-storey Maths and Chemistry block on the lower courts 'Cage' area. A large sum of money was spent replacing the tannoy system, ceiling tiles, lights and getting a new fire alarm system installed between July 2018 and February 2019. This, combined with the solar panels installed in 2015, has greatly increased the school's energy efficiency. Sesquicentennial The school celebrated its sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) on 30 January 2015. A competition took place during art lessons to design a new logo for the school. A time capsule was buried in an alleyway between the Admin and Sixth Form blocks, to be opened in 2065. There is a plaque located above the site of it. Planting of trees also took place to replace the one destroyed by the extension of the Drama Hall. A history book of the school, written by former pupil Leonie Martin, was published in 2015 to mark the anniversary. A pupil has also written two small books about the history and rumoured ghost stories of the school site, raising money for charity.  Phoenix Garden  The school allotment near the top car park was originally created in 2009 by the Learning Support and Maths Departments. It consisted of nine vegetable beds with a small seating area nearby with a memorial dedicated to a member of staff who helped with constructing the allotment area. In the summer of 2019, a number of pupils and members of support staff began redeveloping the allotment to transform it into a relaxing sensory garden and picnic area. This coincided with St Mary's becoming an attachment aware school. In November 2019, the garden was named 'the Phoenix Garden'. Some pupils created a sign and bird box during an enrichment activity and two Year 11 pupils planted a snow goose tree.  Staff  The school has around 120 staff, including teaching assistants, plus midday supervisors, cooks, caretakers and cleaners. The head is Mrs M J Dengate, who has been the head since Easter 2017, when Sean McClafferty resigned. Mrs S Cain is the longest-serving staff member. She joined the school in September 1984 and is now the deputy headteacher. The list of the senior leadership team and pastoral staff is on the school website.  School houses  St Mary's has six school houses which compete in the school's various inter-house events (primarily sport). The house names reflect the school's Catholic ethos: *Alpha - The house symbol is the Greek letter alpha *Omega - The house symbol is the Greek letter omega *Pax - Sign of peace holy spirit and the house symbol is a dove. *Chi Rho - The symbol is the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ (chi = x and rho = p) superimposed. *Ichthus - The house symbol is a fish which was used by early Christians *Pneuma - The house symbol is a flame, signifying the everlasting flame of Christ and breath of God. The house symbols appear on the pupils' badges. The colour of the picture shows which year group they belong to and the color is retained until the pupil leaves Year 11.  Extracurricular activities and school trips  The school runs a variety of extracurricular activities at lunch times, including board games, PE, cooking and science clubs. There are many after school PE practices and clubs for local sports tournaments held at lunchtimes and after schools. Several school trips also take place throughout the year, excluding music concerts and GCSE subject trips. These include language trips to France, Germany and Spain, excursions or religious retreats to the Hayes Conference Centre and Hartington and the Hallam youth pilgrimage to Lourdes each June. There is also a Year 11 history trip to Flanders and a World War I battleground tour which took place in November 2019. Choir and drama productions The school has several choirs spanning all year groups. The school has its own male voice choir - \\"Manflesh\\" - formed after the Chamber Choir ended in the middle of 2007. The male choir made its first appearance at the 2007 Crooked Spire concert, singing 'Gaudete' and 'A La Ruru Nino'. 2008 saw Manflesh sing at the Winding Wheel, and then in July, along with the other school choirs, tour Venice singing at St Mark's Basilica and San Giovanni. In 2013, \\"Mini Manflesh\\" was added to the list of choirs, an all-male choir for lower years. The school holds concerts throughout the year at different venues and has a large band that performs in the three masses in the school year. The choir continuously tours around parts of Europe during the summer months, singing in cathedrals. The school also runs drama productions every couple of years, these have included: Grease (2016), Our House (2019) and rehearsals are currently underway for Little Shop of Horrors (2020).

The school has no specific geographical catchment area (like other schools in the area) and so can choose pupils from church parishes in Chesterfield, though all Catholic applicants are generally accepted regardless of academic ability.Criteria for Admission in September 2008 accessed 24 December 2007 The school adopted the song \\"Let us build a school\\" as their official school hymn in 2006. This was then replaced with 'Walking in faith with Mary our Mother', the current hymn which was written by Music teachers A Breedon and F Fletcher (who also wrote several hymns for the school's bi-annual masses, including the Holy Holy) In 2018, former pupils Harry and Laurence Maguire visited the school. On Wednesday 4 July 2018, Tanya Arnold from BBC Look North interviewed former teachers of Harry Maguire, Mr McKee and Mr Bradley, along with several Year 7 pupils. On Thursday 4 October 2018, Gary Lineker visited the school along with Harry Maguire as part of The Premier League Show. They visited Harry's younger sister, Daisy, in an Art lesson, joined in a PE lesson on the Astro and interviewed Martin McKee (Head of PE and Harry's PE teacher) before the interviews in the Library after school.

Despite these circumstances, Muck returns and helps his virtuous friend, Hassan, win the heart of the lovely Princess Amarza. Once Muck has finished his retrospective, the children display a newfound respect for him, and they help him with his work. Themes There are several morals to be found in the film. The film's main antagonists are agents of greed and occasionally senseless violence, such as the Sultan when he declares war on a neighbouring state for no other reason than the planet's orbit. The sultan exclaims: \\"You have the audacity to tell me that the sun comes up earlier in the neighboring country of sultan Wasil Husain than in mine?\\" The Sultan also lives a life of excessive luxury, and is largely apathetic to the misfortunes of others. He once claims \\"I counted the slaves in the bath today. There were only 31! I'm not going to have to dry myself, am I?\\" Muck's relatives are also excessively greedy and disrespectful to Muck's father. The moment the old man dies, these relatives show up and threaten an obviously traumatized Muck. Conversely, Muck remains generous and kind throughout the movie. He feels sympathy for the runner he puts out of work, he frees a slave girl, and he even defies the Sultan's orders by disregarding the declaration of war he was supposed to deliver. Despite these exploits, he is still a social pariah, up until he shares his story with everyone else. These instances of social commentary are fairly subtle throughout, and the film remains light-hearted and whimsical. Reception From the movie's release in 1953 to the fall of the GDR in East Germany, Kleinen Muck remained the number one selling film of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. It attracted 12,998,153 viewers in the country alone. Director Wolfgang Staudte was originally slotted to work on the film Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder, but due to disagreements, he never started work on the project and took up Kleinen Muck as an interim project.IMDb entry Filmic techniques and diegesis The film's fictional world is whimsical and fanciful. The colours of the sets are bright throughout the film, with the exception of a brief dungeon scene. Most of the camera-work is done at close range, and there are very few panoramas in the film. The background sets are often intentionally exaggerated. Ideal middle-eastern towns border with sand dunes and lush palaces in an escapist representation of the Orient. The costumes and make-up are equally exaggerated, probably due to the film not taking itself too seriously. The cast is for the most part German, and these German actors are tasked with portraying Arabs. The make-up is fairly obvious, while the hair-styles and clothes donned by the film's antagonists are meant to be sources of light ridicule. Special effects are also used, specifically with regards to the story's magical elements. Muck's incredible speed is shown as he runs in fast-forward. His staff hovers, and donkeys' ears grow out of heads. Despite the film's production in a totalitarian state, the film does not contain any obvious propaganda or political messages. The dialogue and events of the diegesis remain apolitical throughout.

History According to Mr. Bayard H. Christy in a report prepared for the Home and School Association of Sewickley on November 8, 1912, the Sewickley Public Library owes its origins to the arrival of a whiskey boat at the Saw Mill landing one Saturday evening in the winter of 1872-73. \\"The consequent riot and disorder...led some, interested in the welfare of the young men, to think that such things would not be, had we a place for proper and rational amusement and self- improvement.\\" The Young Men's Library Association was formed in 1873 and rented a room for library services at the Mozart Hall (corner of Beaver and Broad Streets). It was later moved to a building next door called Choral Hall. In 1880 the property of the library was transferred to the Sewickley School Board under the general school laws of the state. In 1923 the library formally moved to its present location, a building given by Mr. William L. Clause in memory of his wife Elizabeth Ann Clause. In the dedication address by Mr. Clause, he stated, \\"In presenting this library, it is my desire that it should be the property of the entire valley, yet under the existing conditions, there is no way this can be done, as there is no way the matter can be handled except to deed it to the School District of the borough of Sewickley. Of course if the boroughs ever become consolidated, or if the school districts are ever consolidated, that would solve this problem.\\" In the ensuing years, Osborne and Edgeworth School Districts also supported the library until 1956 at which time a jointure of eleven municipalities comprising Aleppo, Bell Acres, Edgeworth, Glenfield, Haysville, Leet, Leetsdale, Osborne, Sewickley, Sewickley Heights and Sewickley Hills, formed the Quaker Valley School District. In 1967, the Quaker Valley School District Board of Directors designated the Sewickley Public Library as its agency to provide public library service to Quaker Valley School District residents and taxpayers and resolved to maintain or assist in the maintenance of the library. The building was awarded Historic Landmark status by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in 2003.

The term was first introduced in an article in the Journal of Marketing Research in 2008. Henrik Hagtvedt and Vanessa Patrick, the two researchers who authored the article, demonstrated a favorable influence of artworks on consumer evaluations of non-art products that were associated with the artworks via, for instance, advertising or product design. The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of human prehistory, and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non- utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.

John Carson, and served as the McDowell County courthouse at the county's inception in 1842. Description Built in 1793, the Carson House is one of the oldest standing structures in Marion along with the nearby Joseph McDowell House. Large walnut logs were harvested from nearby Buck Creek to construct the massive three-story plantation house. Between 1804-1827, the area now known as McDowell County was a large producer of gold, and people from all over the country came to \\"strike it rich\\" before the California Gold Rush of 1849. The 1843 meeting to formally organize McDowell County out of the counties of Burke County and Rutherford County took place in the home of Col. John Carson, and the county was named after Col. Joseph McDowell, the hero of the American Revolution at the Battle of King's Mountain. Originally, the county commissioners wanted the county seat to be located around the Carson House, but concerns about disrupting plantation life led to the Carson family donating a few miles east for the county seat. Col. John Carson's son Joseph McDowell Carson, built Green River Plantation near Columbus, Polk County, North Carolina. For many years, The Carson House served as a stagecoach inn and social center, and was a stopping point for important historical figures such as Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, and Andrew Jackson, who reportedly lost money gambling on the horses that raced at the Carson Plantation. Dan Kanipe, one of only two survivors of General Custer's unit in the Battle of Little Bighorn lived in Marion, and spent some years living at the Carson House.The Carson House was bought in the late 1800s by John Seawell Brown and was preserved by three generations of the Brown family. Brown was a three term North Carolina State Senator who was instrumental in the founding of McDowell County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. After extensive renovations, the house was opened to the public as a museum and library in 1964. The Carson House maintains a unique collection of research materials and books, along with dozens of family histories in its library. The Mary M. Greenlee Genealogical Research and History Room has been a part of the house since the early 1970s, and is constantly adding to its archives. Today, The Carson House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is open to the public as a museum. In 2007, it was listed as a certified destination on the NC Civil War Trails Program.

During World War II he was a Norwegian resistance member, especially noted for his role in the heavy water sabotage 1942-1943\\\\. He continued his military career after the war, and was appointed colonel in 1968. World War II Heavy water sabotage Poulsson served as a second lieutenant in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 () during World War II. As a leader of the Grouse team he parachuted onto the Hardangervidda plateau on 18 October 1942, along with Arne Kjelstrup, Knut Haugland and Claus Helberg. The team landed at Fjarefit in Songadalen, and prepared to receive British troops of Operation Freshman at M√∏svassdammen. The Freshman operation was a failure, as the two gliders crashed. Another operation, called Gunnerside, was successful. The Gunnerside team joined the Grouse (later renamed Swallow), and the combined team succeeded in the destruction of heavy water equipment and stock at Vemork in February 1943. After the sabotage Poulsson escaped to Oslo, and later via Sweden to the United Kingdom. Poulsson was awarded Norway's War Cross with sword, after his return to United Kingdom in 1943. It was presented to him by King Haakon at a ceremony at the training school STS 26 in Scotland, near Nethy Bridge. Also R√∏nneberg, leader of the Gunnerside team, received the War Cross with sword at this ceremony, while the other participants in the heavy water sabotage received the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch. Operation Sunshine Poulsson returned to Norway in 1944, participating in Operation Sunshine led by major Leif Tronstad. Nine SOE agents, among them several from the heavy water sabotage team, were paradropped over Ugleflott in √òvre Telemark 5 October 1944. Their mission was to establish fighting groups at Rjukan, Notodden and Nore. Poulsson, along with Claus Helberg as wireless operator, was responsible for the Rjukan section. In the mountains surrounding Rjukan a military force consisting of 300 soldiers was built up, and the troops were supplied with provisions and weapons from allied aircraft. The part of Telemark which was covered by Sunshine was called Milorg district 16 (D-16). When Tronstad was killed in a shooting episode 11 March 1945, Poulsson took over as leader of the Sunshine operation (Milorg D-16). Awards For his war contributions Poulsson was decorated with the Defence Medal with rosette and Haakon VIIs 70th Anniversary Medal, in addition to the War Cross. He was also decorated with the British Distinguished Service Order (DSO) as well as the St. Olav's Medal With Oak Branch. Post war In 1960 Poulsson was leading the Danish-Norwegian battalion (Danor) in the UN force UNEF in Gaza. From 1961 he held various leading positions in the Norwegian Army, and has been a colonel since 1968. He headed His Majesty The King's Guard from 1961-1965, he was second in command for Brigade Nord from 1967-1968 and he headed the 3rd Infantry Regiment from 1980-1982. Poulsson died early February 2010 aged 91. In his funeral, King Harald V participated, in addition to historian Knut Werner Hagen, who is about to write a book about Poulsson in the near future.

There is also an AMD variant known as the Inspiron 1526. The laptop is the successor to the Inspiron 1520, and was released in January, 2008. This computer was available to purchase on the Dell website, where it could be customized to the user's specification. On June 26, 2008, this laptop was followed with the release of the Inspiron 1535, otherwise known as the Dell Studio laptop. On January 6, 2009, the Inspiron 1525 was superseded by the Inspiron 1545, which gives mostly higher-end configuration options at a lower starting price, but lacks features such as the HDMI port, LED indicator lights and two headphone jacks. The laptop was discontinued on February 26, 2009, which left the Inspiron 1545 as Dell's 15-inch budget laptop. Overview After selling in high numbers, the Dell Inspiron 1520 received widespread praise regarding its size, and small screen. The Inspiron 1525 was intended to address some of the issues with the Inspiron 1520. The 1525 has been described by reviewers as weighing approximately six pounds ‚Äì half a pound lighter than the 1520. This laptop can be considered as a mid-range Dell computer, between the small 1420 model and the expensive XPS M1530 model. The laptop also fixed a perceived flaw that had plagued Inspiron laptops for a decade; they were bulky and boxy, but the Inspiron 1525's chassis used a new edge design that appears on all of Dell's current laptops. System specifications Since the user is able to customize the unit, included hardware varies from laptop to laptop. However, there are several components which are generally fitted as standard in each unit: * Processors: Intel Celeron 540, 550 or 560, Intel Pentium Dual-Core T2370, T2390, T2330, T4200, T4500 and the original Intel Pentium or Intel Core 2 Duo T5250, T5450, T5550, T5750, T7250, T8100, T8300 or T9300 * Memory: 512 MB, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 GB of shared dual channel DDR2 SDRAM @ 667 MHz * Chipset: Intel GM965 Express Chipset * Graphics processor: integrated Intel GMA X3100 graphics (previously changed to 965 Express) * LCD display: 15.4\\" widescreen with a 1280 √ó 800 resolution, 15.4\\" widescreen with a 1280 √ó 800 resolution and TrueLife, or a 15.4\\" widescreen with a 1440 √ó 900 high resolution and TrueLife * Hard drive: 80, 120, 160, 250 or 320 GB SATA at 5400 RPM * Optical drive: 8√ó tray-load dual-layer DVD+/-RW drive, 2√ó tray-load Blu-ray disc combo drive or 2x Blu-ray disc burner * Battery: 4-cell (48 Whr), 6-cell (56 Whr), or 9-cell (85 Whr) lithium-ion * Wi-Fi: Broadcom 4312 based, Dell Wireless 1397 802.11g half mini-card (Previously changed to 1395 802.11b/g full mini-card), or 1490 802.11a/g/n full mini-card (Broadcom 4311 based), or Intel Next-Gen 4965AGN 802.11a/g/n Wi-Fi * I/O ports: 1√ó Fast Ethernet port, 1√ó 56 kbit/s modem, 1√ó S-Video output, 4√ó USB 2.0 ports, 1√ó Express Card slot, 1√ó VGA port, 1√ó HDMI output, 1√ó FireWire port(optional), and 1√ó power adapter connector The most notable difference between this laptop and its predecessor, is that the 1520 model was fitted with a dedicated graphics card whereas the 1525 is not. It has been speculated that this is an attempt by Dell to appeal to a wider market of computer consumers. In a 2008 processor speed test, the Inspiron 1525 placed 14 out of the 18 tested computers. The touchpad has been upgraded from that of the 1520, with one which is designed to allow faster scrolling through web pages. Strangely this model contains a SIM card slot underneath the battery compartment. However reading data, or using Internet from SIM cards is not possible without a separate wireless modem-card. Software The Inspiron 1525 typically comes with a version of the Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Ubuntu Operating System pre-installed. Both 32-bit and 64-bit can work. Ubuntu 12.04 and Linux Debian Wheezy are known to be working out-of-the-box on this model. Compatible Machines Compatible OS(s): Windows 2000/ME/Alpha/Trident/Neptune/Odyssey/Whistler/XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10/Ubuntu 7.10 (optional preinstalled os)/Ubuntu 12.04/Ubuntu 14.04/Ubuntu 16.04/Ubuntu 18.04/Ubuntu 20.04 Compatible Server OS(s) Windows Server 2003/2003 R2/2008/2008 R2/2012/2012 R2/2016/2016 R2/2019/2010 R2/2019/2019 R2 Compatible CPU(s): Intel Core 2 Duo/Pentium/Celeron/Core 2 Quad/ Sticks Dell.inc Sticks Upgrade The Inspiron 1525 can be upgraded to Windows 10 32-bit or 64-bit. A fresh installation of Windows 10 64-bit already provides all required drivers for this laptop, including the webcam, SD card reader, wifi adapter, DVD drive, Intel GM965 chipset, on-board Intel graphics and multimedia keys. There are however a few quirks that can be improved : * The default Microsoft touchpad driver works well, but lacks support of advanced touchpad features and customizations; A Dell touchpad driver can be forced-installed to get access to all touchpad settings (Alps_Touchpad_W8_X02_A01_Setup-W71Y8_ZPE). * A few of the keyboard Fn keys don't work (F1,F3 and F8) but full support can be added by installing the Dell QuickSet 64-bit software package (Dell_QuickSet_A07_R272666.exe). * The driver for the Dell Wireless 1505 Draft 802.11n WLAN Mini-Card that comes with the Window 10 64-bit installation is a Microsoft driver (v5.100.245.200, dated 212-03-14). This drivers works but is not very stable and suffers from frequent disconnects. This wifi adapter uses a Broadcom BCM43xx chip. Broadcom released newer driver versions for that chip in 2016, such as the BCM43xx_7.35.317.3 driver released in 2016. This newer Broadcom driver can be force-installed and provides better stability than the 2012 Microsoft driver. * The \\"Display Adapter\\" driver (for the 965 Express Chipset) that automatically comes with the Windows 10 64-bit installation (directly from Microsoft) is version 8.15.10.2697 (initially released for Windows 8.1 64-bit). This driver seems to have compatibility problems causing sporadic (but minor) graphics corruptions in the desktop UI elements, especially after coming out of sleep. Reverting to the latest driver available from the Intel website, i.e. v8.15.10.1930 (initially released for Windows 7 64-bit) seems to reduce the occurrence. But there's no proof yet the Video Driver is the source of this corruption problem. We would need more data to come with an official conclusion on this. This computer has two DDR2 SODIMM slots and can be upgraded to 6GB of RAM, with a set of 2GB and 4GB modules. Both 667Mhz and 800Mhz modules are supported (PC2-5300 or PC2-6400). There's no reliable reference online of anyone properly testing a set of two 4GB modules, so it is unsure whether 8GB total RAM is possible or not. The graphics card cannot be upgraded in part because there is no graphics card; the graphics processor is integrated into the motherboard and is not removable. The processor can be upgraded to any Socket P Intel Core2 Duo mobile processor in the T8x00 series, and to certain T9x00 series processors whose FSB speed is limited to 800 MT/Sec. It is advisable to flash the system BIOS to the latest version before attempting to upgrade the CPU. Modern Solid State Drives have been successfully installed and used in the laptop, including the Samsung 840 250GB SSD. Although this installer had difficulty installing the slimmer (7mm) SSD in place of the standard 2.5 inch HDD, nearly all SSDs now include a spacer that eliminates the problem. Moreover, this installer's problem could have easily been avoided by simply positioning the computer right side up (instead of upside down) when sliding in the new SSD. Although this computer does not support the newer SATA 3 standard, all modern SSDs are backward-compatible with the older SATA 2 standard, and work well in this application, albeit at SATA 2 speeds. Other software Other software provided with the laptop includes: * Dell MediaDirect media player * Microsoft Works office suite * Roxio Creator DVD/CD authoring software On February 18, 2008, it was announced that Ubuntu 7.10 would be available as an optional operating system for the laptop. Customization The user is able to decide which components they wish to be included, during the ordering process, by selecting from a range of hardware on the website. These possible components include a range of processors, operating systems, graphics cards, a webcam and various other peripherals. In addition, Bluetooth and an integrated mobile broadband card can also be installed upon request, and the default battery can be replaced with an alternative. Reception The Inspiron 1525 has received a great deal of positive attention. General computer users welcomed the relatively low price, as well as the easily accessible volume control keys, and hardware reviewers have praised the customizability of the laptop, as well as its system specifications and light frame. In general, users have made positive reference to the screen, with some describing the display as \\"flawless\\", as well as the inclusion of a webcam and dual headphone jacks. Some reviewers claim that the battery life is a good point of the system. Despite being a high-selling model, and receiving a large amount of positive feedback, the Inspiron 1525 has also attracted some level of criticism. Some critics feel that the sound quality is unfit for a recently produced laptop, claiming \\"raspy-sounding speakers take some of the shine off the 1525's entertainment appeal\\", whereas others have criticized the system's performance and battery life. The wireless switch is located on the right side of the bottom half, close to the front and is easily overlooked. Prominent placement near the volume and media controls would be much easier for users to find. The positioning of the cooling fans render the laptop incapable of supporting high-end graphics cards. Some users have encountered technical problems, many of which center around the webcam and built-in microphone. A common complaint is that the supplied fan is irritatingly loud, and many users have tried to rectify it on their own. The placement of the headphone jacks on the front of the unit leads to inconvenient trailing wires when external speakers are connected. A trackpad design flaw causes the button to stick, requiring the replacement of the entire palmrest assembly. Users have also reported numerous hard drive problems, many related to overheating. Noteworthy hardware issues The Inspiron 1525 utilises a single heat sink to dissipate heat away from the CPU & GPU. It was quite common during the mid-2000s to use a single heat corridor for both. While the Inspiron 1525 is not the only model that uses a single copper alloy conduit, it is one of the more common. The Inspiron 1525, models affected will combine the Intel Core 2 or Intel Dual Core CPU's. These are especially problematic when combined with the nVidia graphics GPU, although most commonly found with the \\"Intel Graphics Media Accelerator\\", the PP29L-HDCP. While it is NOT uncommon for laptops (generally) to run \\"Hotter\\" than desktops, this temperature variances should be no more than a few degrees (5-10 F). When these multiple processing chips are combined on a single \\"heatsink\\", these models may run as much as 15 to 30 F hotter.

There is no generally agreed English translation; some scholars suggest \\"book of state rites\\",\\"Yi Song-mi Note 2\\" while the Glossary of Korean Studies from the Korea Foundation suggests \\"manual of the state event\\" or \\"rubrica for a state ceremony.\\" The expression \\"Royal Protocols\\" (of the Joseon Dynasty) is widely used. The collection of Uigwe, was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme in 2007. Content Combining text and detailed illustrations, each Uigwe preserves the records of the Superintendency (dogam), set up temporarily to plan and carry out special state rites. These rites included investitures, coronations, weddings, banquets, the painting of royal portraits, funerals and ancestral rites. Each Uigwe, some in several volumes with several copies, was written either by hand but more often printed using woodblocks for the History Archive copies. Most of the Uigwe, had one exclusive edition for the king, distinguished by silk covers, high quality paper, binding, superior handwriting and overall presentation, was intended to serve as the royal viewing copy. The silk covers used exclusively for the king were made of quality silk, had superior patterns often of clouds, and usually had red decorations around its borderline. Four to nine other copied version for scholars were kept for each of the four state archives, which for most of the Joseon period were located on Mount Jeongjoksan on Ganghwa-do Island; Mount Jeoksang in Muju-gun County, Jeollabuk-do Province; Mount Odaesan in Gangwon-do Province and Mount Taebaeksan in Yeongwol-gun County. The Uigwe for funerals and weddings includes large and detailed images of processions, often involving thousands of participants. Looting and repatriation 1866: French troops In 1782, the Outer Gyujanggak library (known as Oe-Gyujang-gak) was built in the ancient royal palace on Ganghwa-do Island to accommodate an overflow of books from the main Gyujanggak library at Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul, where the royal viewing copies were kept, and most of the viewing copies were transferred there. In 1866, after the execution of a number of French Catholic missionaries in Korea, a French expeditionary force came from China to seek explanations, resulting in the French campaign against Korea. Unable to gain access to the authorities, the troops attacked Ganghwa-do Island and seized the royal books, along with a vast amount of silverware and other royal artifacts. The books were kept at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris soon after their arrival in France. They were largely forgotten until Korean scholar, Park Byeongseon, discovered them in 1975, whilst working there as a librarian. Following the discovery, the return was officially requested in 1992. In 1993, then-French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand returned one copy during a visit to Seoul to sell its high-speed TGV train technology; with the promised to return the remaining collection. The Korean Government tried to retrieve the royal documents through a permanent lease, since French law prohibits national assets to be transferred abroad. In 2010, a Seoul-based civic group spearhead the return but the request to exclude illegally obtained property from its list of national assets was rejected by a Paris court.Kwon Mee-yoo \\"NGO to Demand Return of Royal Texts From France\\" Korea Times. 26 January 2010.

They were stored at the University of Tokyo. Hence were not included in the list of artifacts to be returned compiled in 1965, when the two countries signed a treaty which normalized diplomatic ties. In November 2008, Seoul City Council passed a resolution urging Japan to return the uigwe. The looted collection is believed to have included Empress Myeongseong's state funeral protocol, that lasted for about two years following her murder by Japanese assassins in Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1895. In August 2010, then-Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced the return of the Uigwe to mark the centenary of Japanese annexation of Korea. Then in October 2011, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda returned five copies during his visit to Seoul in a bid to improve relations. The copies chronicled the royal rituals of King Gojong and King Sunjong, the last two emperors of Joseon dynasty and Korean Empire before Korea was annexed in 1910. This was followed, after a 16-month process, by the return of 1,200 volumes including 150 Uigwe in December 2011.Lee, Claire \\"Looted Korean royal texts return home\\" Korea Herald. 6 December 2011.

Gyujanggak library has the largest collection, with 2,940 volumes with 546 different Uigwe; while the latter has 490 volumes with 287 different Uigwe. National Museum of Korea The 297 copies of the Uigwes that were returned from France, are housed at the National Museum of Korea, where a special exhibition, The Return of the Oegyujanggak Uigwe from France: Records of the State Rites of the Joseon Dynasty, was held from 19 July to 18 September 2011. In June 2011, ahead of the exhibition, the Museum showcased five of the copies to the media. They were selected for their historical significance and to demonstrate the wide range of activities recorded in different kinds of Uigwe. They were: * Uigwe for a Royal Feast (1630) * Uigwe for the Ceremony of Offering Honorable Names to Queen Jangryeol (1686) * Uigwe for the State Funeral of Queen Jangryeol (1688) * Uigwe for the Funeral of Uiso, the Eldest Grandson of the King (1752) * Uigwe for the Construction of the West Palace (1831) The Uigwe for a Royal Feast is the oldest copy that was looted by the French. It recorded the royal feast held by King Injo of Joseon in March 1630, wishing for longevity and good health for Queen Dowager Inmok. It is also one of the few \\"copied\\" versions as most of them are reportedly original editions that were exclusively printed for the king. The museum stated that three of the five shown do not have any surviving copied versions. Also a couple of silk covers of other volumes were displayed separately as Biblioth√®que nationale de France removed 286 of them for restoration in the 1970s. Which were returned along with the 297 volumes. National Palace Museum of Korea The copies that were returned by Japan are housed at the National Palace Museum of Korea with a special exhibition from 27 December 2011 to 5 February 2012.

The TV show premiered in Canada on YTV on February 7, 2009, and in the United States on The CW4Kids on September 19, 2009. Its run aired until December 1, 2009. Plot The series is set in Flip City, home of eleven different RollBot tribes. The show follows Spin and the members of the Flip City Police Department (FCPD) as they fight crime. Characters Good Bots Spin (Samuel Vincent): Spin is the main character of the series and the last member of the Zushin tribe. The fastest RollBot in Flip City, Spin's bot mods include Skyv boots, hyper-speed, and boomstick. He joined the Kei'zatsu tribe, but he does not feel a sense of belonging. Described as a daredevil, Spin is known to get away with breaking rules.http://rollbots.com/spin.html Spin is fired from his job as an FCPD officer after an incident with Vertex. He is declared a criminal when he attempts to stop a robbery because the FCPD arrived at the wrong moment and believe Spin to be the robber. It is hinted that Spin may be related to Vertex. Spin is the only rollbot who suspects that Vertex is a Spiderbot, and is ridiculed by everyone else because, as far as the rollbots of Spin City are concerned, Spiderbots do not exist. Spin has the ability to absorb radiation and use its power to disperse energy blasts and perform psychokinesis. In \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\", it is revealed to Spin that he is the last member of the Zushin tribe, the only tribe that can talk to the Hub. He can use this connection to tell the Hub to do things like reset the safety net, or he can get emergency alerts on his comm, seconds before the Zoboshi or Kei'zatsu receive them. Spin is also acquainted with numerous bots around the city, including friends and enemies. He even seems to know the famous botball player, Roboto, on speaking terms. Captain Pounder (Garry Chalk): Head of the Kei'zatsu tribe and captain of the FCPD. His equipment includes a shield charger, Torvoldian throwing armour, and thunder punch. As head of the FCPD, Captain Pounder is tough and strong. Despite this, he has a secret soft side. He gives the impression of knowing Vertex intimately, but avoids discussing it. It is hinted that he is after Vertex, although the reason behind this is unknown. He does consider Vertex to be a high priority target, however, it is obvious that he does not know that Vertex is (or is now) a Spiderbot, and always dismisses the idea. He is secretly monitoring Spin.http://rollbots.com/pounder.html He consistently communicates with someone who is involved with Spin in some way, but they only communicate through Pounder's computer. The Mayor forces Captain Pounder to fire Spin after he says that Vertex is a Spiderbot. When Spin is arrested, Captain Pounder declares him to be a dangerous criminal and wants Spin behind bars; but this is only a cover so he can keep a close eye on Spin to protect him from something (presumably Vertex). In \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\", it is revealed that Pounder did know Vertex, as Vertex greeted him familiarly (such as when he called Pounder 'General'), and that Pounder can speak the Spiderbot language quite fluently. At the end of \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\", Captain Pounder and Vertex fall through a hole in the safety net; but not before Pounder tells Spin that he is a member of the Zushin tribe. It was also revealed in Spin's flashback that Pounder lost his left eye after being attacked by Vertex. Penny (Cathy Weseluck): Originally from the Kuzuri tribe, Penny is a doctor on loan to the FCPD. She was banished from her tribe after interfering with an important surgical operation on Mayor Aria's assistant. Penny is equipped with a healing glove. She is Spin's best friend and, like him, is known to break rules.http://rollbots.com/penny.html She is chosen by Captain Pounder to take command of the FCPD if anything happens to him. When Spin is declared a fugitive and escapes FCPD custody, she does everything she can to help Spin hide from the FCPD. She is seen on the field for the first part of the season, but spends most of her time running the board back at the precinct. She has been an officer for longer than Spin (though no one knows how much longer), and therefore is his superior officer. There have been hints at attraction between Penny and Spin, but there have never been any obvious incidents. She has also been shown to have a slight crush on Roboto, although this is more admiration because he is a famous botball player than actual love. Lance (Scott McNeil): An office administrator at the FCPD, Lance is from the Kei'zatsu tribe. He is not very strong, cannot roll very fast, and can get scared very easily. His only bot-mod is the force bubble, with which he protects himself. He dislikes Spin because Spin does not respect his rules. He makes fun of Spin by always calling him a \\"rookie\\", sticks him with boring jobs when he has the chance, and says that Spin will never belong to the Kei'zatsu tribe. When Spin gets fired from his job, Lance arrests him after he tries to stop a robbery in progress, to make it look like Spin was the robber. Lance has a weakness for eating lug nuts (the Rollbot version of donuts), which Spin has used against him as a distraction, and even escaped prison by doing so. He usually eats so many that he becomes exhausted and sick when he is full. Tinny (Tabitha St. Germain): A BotTot (young RollBot) from the Kei'zatsu tribe. He is in school, but spends a lot of time with Spin, who lets him try dangerous things. In \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\", Tinny battles Vett and discovers that he has the power to create force fields and project energy blasts. He has often been shown to be fully capable of becoming an officer, despite being so young. On several occasions he has shown the capability to both run the board at the FCPD independently and to be an officer on the field. Bunto (Colin Murdock): A member of the Kei'zatsu tribe and the FCPD. He is a higher-ranking officer who is often seen commanding a squad of FCPD bots. What makes him different from the other FCPD members is that his armor has blue-and-red coloured plating in place of the white of most officers. When Spin is declared a fugitive, Bunto repeatedly attempts to capture Spin, though he always fails, due to Spin either speeding away or beating Bunto in some way. Villain Bots Vertex (Colin Murdock): A notorious villain and Flip City's most wanted individual. He is suspected to be a Spiderbot. He plans to take over Flip City by shutting down the Hub and deactivating the safety net using a device called a \\"dymex key\\" that is combined with eleven artifacts hidden all over the city. Shutting down the safety net will allow an invasion of Spiderbots to control Flip City and destroy all RollBots. His tribe is unknown. Vertex has the ability to transform into a RollBot, as a disguise, and to speak in both his native Spiderbot language and the Rollbot language. In \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\", he is last seen falling through a hole in the safety net with Captain Pounder. Before he falls through the net, he states that despite his absence, the invasion will proceed to attack Flip City. Manx (Nicole Oliver): A renegade Kei'zatsu who is now Vertex's head henchbot. She has previously worked at the FCPD, though her reason for defecting and joining Vertex are unknown. Manx is equipped with pulse flares, and is very agile. Unlike other villains, Manx has a conscience. She is aware of Botch's recklessness.http://rollbots.com/manx.htmlhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0646955/ In \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2,\\" Manx leaves Vertex's forces to assist the FCPD after hearing Vertex's true plans for the RollBots. Vertex attempts to have her destroyed for knowing his true plans. She also has a rarely seen Kei'zatsu symbol on each of her legs, though they are faded and scratched out, possibly as a sign of her no longer belonging to the tribe. Botch (Brian Drummond): A renegade Zurasho, Botch is one of Vertex's henchbots. He is armed with an energy grappler and power shields. He previously worked for the Triads, Flip City's most dangerous gang. He aspires to unseat both Manx and Vertex.http://rollbots.com/botch.html Right before joining Vertex, he was arrested by Manx while she was still working for the FCPD. Despite the fact that he hates Manx, he still seems to work well with her on missions, even calling her 'Manxy' on occasion. In one instance, he is even shown to be truly worried for her safety. Botch has a Zurasho symbol on each of the sides of the piece of metal on the top of his head, but they are dented, possibly to signify that, similarly to Manx, he is no longer a part of his tribe . Macro (Colin Murdock): A renegade Hai'bu who chose to become a villain and work for Vertex. He is armed with a projectile mace on his left arm, but he sometimes uses other bot-mods in its place. Macro is strong, but very unintelligent.http://rollbots.com/macro.html Macro is the type of model known as a Hai'bu Wrecking Ball. He is the only one of Vertex's henchbots who is completely loyal to Vertex. Like Lance from the FCPD, Macro likes to eat lugnuts whenever he has a chance, but he does not consume as many as Lance does. He is apparently an ex-member of the Hai'bu Hammers botball team. Phaze (Paul Dobson): A bot who was in jail before he escaped with the help of Vertex. He is an ex-member of the Zurasho tribe who left to join the Triads, though he did not like them either. He was the member of the Triads who let Botch join before quitting and going on his own. He is soon arrested and placed back in jail, thanks to Spin. He is extremely crazy, loves destruction, and has a passion for magnetic bot mods because of the damage they can do. Phaze is the reason Manx is no longer part of the FCPD, and Manx despises him for it. He appears to have a crush on Manx. Reboot (Cathy Weseluck): A renegade Tensai who was thought to have been kidnapped, but actually chose to help Vertex with his plans to shut down the Hub. She learned everything she knows from Zilla and Bug. She is also famous for her 'holographic cake' trick used at Tensai birthday parties. She and Vertex's henchbots stole an experimental bot-mod called a \\"crontab\\" to take to the Hub to shut it down. The crontab could turn back time, and no one would remember it had happened. However, when they activated the crontab at the Hub, it almost destroyed Flip City. Spin was the only one who noticed the time flux from the crontab's repeated use; he was finally able to stop Reboot and Vertex's henchbots before they could use the crontab to turn back time again. The henchbots escaped and left Reboot to be apprehended by the FCPD. It has been rumored that Reboot has discovered a way to defeat Vertex, but she has not revealed it to anybody. Tamaki (Shirley Millner): The leader of a renagade group of pirate bots. She used to reside in Anakata Tower in Flip City, and she was once partners with Anakata, a member of the Fuzata tribe. They worked on a bot-mod that turns anything (even RollBots) into gold, but Anakata tricked her at the last minute and got all the credit for the bot-mod. Tamaki wants revenge on her former partner and her share of the profits from the bot-mod. It was soon destroyed after she reclaimed it. Her ship is called the \\"Black Dot\\". Kibi (Richard Newman): A renegade Tensai who is now a pirate. He is also Captain Tamaki's right-hand bot. Vett (Scott McNeil): An old ally of Vertex who, like Vertex, is a Spiderbot. Vett spontaneously shows up in Flip City in his ship to help Vertex complete the final stages of his master plan. Unlike Vertex, Vett does not take a stealth approach to missions, but rather attacks everyone in his way. Before Vett arrived at Flip City, he and Vertex secretly communicated with each other when Vertex was alone, similar to how Pounder secretly conversed to someone over his computer. Vett has a mask that covers his head. When he speaks, he only screeches a strange language (possibly his native tongue, since Vertex understands him), but he is able to speak regularly on several occasions. This may be because he does not speak English very well and only uses phrases and words that he already knows how to say. Vertex is his superior officer, but Vett does not think that he is capable of completing the master plan and makes it clear to Vertex that he does not particularly like him. Other Bots Mayor Aria (Cathy Weseluck): The leader of the Nisen tribe and the mayor of Flip City. She tries to improve Flip City as much as she can, but she is really concerned about making herself look good in the eyes of Flip City. Vertex tricks her into making him seem like a good citizen by staging an incident that lets him seem like her ally. She is not amused by Spin because his antics more often than not conflict with her ideas. She eventually orders Captain Pounder to fire Spin. She is frequently seen working with the Tensai tribe to come up with new ways to improve Flip City. She is not popular with some of the bots. She has an infamous \\"12 in 12\\" plan to build 12 new major suburbs in her 12 term-cycle as mayor. Aria is also a longtime ally of Pounder's; she is responsible for getting him named as head of the FCPD. She is also famous for having more statues built of herself than any other mayor in the history of Flip City. She can never remember the names of anyone she meets without her assistant reminding her and cannot even remember her assistant's own name. Chief Surgeon Koto (Brian Drummond): The leader and head doctor of the Kuzuri tribe. He is very serious with his job, but he occasionally makes sarcastic comments. He banned Penny from the tribe because she interfered during an operation on Mayor Aria'a assistant, but when he sees Penny in action when she is with the FCPD, he tells that she is welcomed back if she decides to quit the FCPD. He continues to repair Spin on almost a daily basis whenever he is damaged from a fight, and he is not too happy about it. He suspects that someone purposefully damaged Spin's internal circuits. Koto appears to be a bit protective of Penny, perhaps because she used to be a member of his tribe. This was exhibited once when he took a hit from Vett that was supposed to be aimed at Penny. He fell off the trax and climbed back up a few minutes later, so it appears that he was not thrown that far off. Gates (Brian Drummond): The leader of the Tensai tribe. He is the bot that designed the city's anti-grav jets. He once built a device that allows bots to travel to parallel dimensions, unfortunately he spilled a cup of oil on said device and has not been able to get it working since. He is easily frightened by loud noises and bots that are bigger than he is (which is everyone), and he is possibly rigging the Tensai leader elections every year so he will not lose his job. He first appeared when he asked Captain Pounder to find Reboot, a renegade Tensai with an experimental bot-mod called the crontab. He later appeared when he was testing his new maintenance robot named the Repair Online Sytheotic Entity, or R.O.S.E. After Spin destroyed R.O.S.E he demanded that Mayor Aria have him and Captain Pounder held accountable and fired from the FCPD. Commander Octo (Paul Dobson): The leader of the Zurasho tribe. He first meets Spin when he constructs a new housing complex by Mayor Aria's design. When the houses were booby-trapped by Vertex, he and Spin enter the complex to shut down the traps. He gives Spin his boomstick bot mod since he was not able to use it right. He does not like Mayor Aria at all because he thinks her ideas to help Flip City are crazy. Octo is seen on a recurring basis after that. His second appearance was when he was revealing the new and improved Nobrek Acres. He also appears when Captain Tamaki appears and tries to help Pounder take her down. His last appearance so far was in episode 26 when he complained about having to weld new plaques onto the FCPD, and he helped to try to fight off Vett. It is revealed in this episode that he fights with a big metal hammer. Fire Chief Cables (Ellen Kennedy): The leader of the Zobo'shi tribe. She and Captain Pounder have a rivalry going on and continuously argue in terms of the respective tribe's job duties. She repeatedly attempts to have the FCPD work with the Zobo'shi tribe (or rather for them), and offers to move them into the ground level of Zobo'Shi headquarters (which angers Pounder). When she first meets Spin, she is not impressed with him and mocks Pounder for hiring someone who is not a Kei'zatsu. She is also mad at Spin for getting in her way during a mission. After Spin saves Flip City from being destroyed, she realizes that she was wrong about Spin and tells Pounder that Spin is welcome to work for the Zobo'shi if he wants to be with a \\"real tribe\\". The En (Teryl Rothery): The leader of the Zogen'sha tribe and holder of the optic. The En captured Spin and Botch when Botch broke into the cathedral to steal the optic. She shackled them both to the wall and used the optic to find out who they were. She took Spin into another room and told him that he was the bot who will stand alone, and save the city. She later stated that he did not look, smell, or (oddly enough) taste like Kei'zatsu after Spin said he was Kei'zatsu. She thanked Spin for saving the cathedral by draining the energy overload. She seems to know all about what Spin is supposed to be doing and who his tribe is. Daso (Scott McNeil): A member of the Zogen'sha tribe who becomes aware of Spin's true identity. He holds a mystical amulet which allows him to connect with the cathedral. Oddball (Garry Chalk): A member of the Hai'bu tribe who has that name because he is different from the other Hai'bu members. He is quite intelligent, but sometimes forgetful, and that gets in the way of being able to properly socialize with his fellow Hai'bu tribe brothers. When he first meets Spin, his right leg was stolen by Vertex's henchbots, and it was replaced by another left leg. Spin soon finds his leg and returns it to him. Oddball is an older model of the Hai'bu tribe and his type of parts are not being made anymore. Ringo (Scott McNeil): A member of the Hai'bu tribe who, like his fellow Hai'bu tribe member Oddball, had one of his limbs stolen (his right arm). He thinks that Oddball is weird and says that he has no wits. Ringo cleans up the FCPD building and is good friends with the Kei'zatsu working there. Roboto (Trevor Devall): A member of the Zurasho tribe and the team leader of the Zurasho botball team called the Zurasho Slashers. He is considered to be the best botball player ever and is very popular. He is good friends with Spin, Penny and Tinny (who is a huge fan of Roboto). In the middle of a game with the Fuzata botball team, he was kidnapped, resulting in a city-wide riot. It turned out that his kidnappers were the botballs who were originally part of the Hai'bu tribe called the Kenchi-ku. They kidnapped him because they hated being used as botballs and wanted revenge, but they soon let him go and accepted their new job as botballs. When Vett attacked the Flip City stadium to steal the botball cup during the botball championship match, Roboto helps the FCPD to keep the cup away from Vett. Roboto is a very fast and skilled bot. Bug & Zilla (Richard Ian Cox) & (Colin Murdock): Two members of the Tensai tribe who are always seen working together. They are always working on new and improved bot mods, about which they are very excited. However, their excitement gets in the way of their better judgement about how their bot mods could hurt Flip City instead of help it; and their antics have caused trouble for the FCPD on a few occasions. Bug dreams of someday becoming Tensai chief, and is secretly building an anti-matter force field trax system in his spare time. Zilla, on the other hand is secretly reading up on how to be a Zobo'shi and likes to try to figure out what Bug does in his free time. Rigaroo (Scott McNeil): A bot who is a participant in the Flip City Grand Prix. He considers himself to be the fastest bot in Flip City. He is extremely arrogant and always refers to himself in the third person. He and Spin have a rivalry and since Spin was not allowed to be a part of the FCGP, Rigaroo makes fun of him and calls Spin a coward. After Spin saves the Grand Prix from disaster because of one of Vertex's setups, Rigaroo realizes that he was wrong about Spin, and offers him his respect. Although Rigaroo's tribe is unknown, aside from his colour, he looks just like a member of the Kei'zatsu tribe. This is odd because members of the Kei'zatsu tribe are prohibited from participating in the FCGP. Anakata (Paul Dobson): A member of the Fuzata tribe who has a tower named after him. He is a very greedy and cowardly individual. He used to be partners with Captain Tamaki. They created a bot-mod that turned anything into gold, but Anakata wanted to have it all for himself, so he had Tamaki exiled from Flip City and kept the bot-mod for himself. Tamaki returned to take revenge on him and to reclaim the bot-mod. Thanks to Spin, Anakata was rescued, but his bot-mod was destroyed, and he was not too happy. Ms Appy (Nicole Oliver): A member of the Kazoku tribe, it was she who recommended that Spin join the FCPD. She was originally Spin's teacher and is currently Tinny's teacher. She has been a teacher at Wozville Elementary School for ten cycles, and is so dedicated that she hardly ever leaves the school grounds. She takes her students on a field trip to each tribe's headquarters once a cycle. When Spin wants to find out the truth about his origins, he asks Ms Appy if she knows anything, but she tells him that she does not remember because she has taught so many bots, and even calls Spin \\"Spoon\\". When her Fangbot (a RollBot dog) Pikea goes missing after eating an invisibility bot mod, Ms Appy asks Spin to save him. While talking to Tinny, she accidentally tells him that Pikea is the last Fangbot of his kind. When Vertex catches Pikea, he says that the Fangbot looks familiar to him. After Spin saves Pikea and gives him back to Ms Appy, it appears that she knows more about Spin than she is letting on, and it also seems that she trained Pikea to protect Spin. It is revealed in \\"Paradigm Shift Part 2\\" that Captain Pounder brought Spin to her class as a BotTot after saving him from being destroyed by Vertex like the other members of the Zushin tribe. It is also revealed in Spin's flashback that Pikea fought in the battle. Tribes Fuzata: The tribe responsible for finances and the economy. The Fuzuta tribe is responsible for the wealth and prosperity of Flip City. They are best known for their keen business sense and for providing a strong economy so that all bots have a chance to prosper. Hai'bu: Sanitation and waste management are the responsibilities of this tribe. Their members are big and strong. The Hai'bu tribe keeps Flip City clean. This tribe is made up of some of the biggest and strongest bots who specialize in the transport and disposal of the city's trash. The Kenchi-ku are a sub-tribe that originated from this tribe. Kazoku: The members of this tribe educate BotTots. The Kazoku tribe grooms all new BotTots and prepares them for their eventual role within their individual tribes. Flip City is a big world, and the educators of the Kazoku tribe make sure every bot is ready. Kenchi-ku: Sub-tribe to the Hai'bu, who previously used them to help them clean in the small spaces by kicking them because of their small size. However, after a while, they were being kicked for amusement and sporting purposes, which lead to the invention of Bot-Ball, which is a RollBot version of soccer. Kei'zatsu: Kei'zatsu's mission is \\"to protect and serve\\". The FCPD is made up of members from this tribe, although not all FCPD members are Kei'zatsus. They are involved with law enforcement. Since their job is to protect Flip City, they are forbidden from participating in various activities, such as the Flip City Grand Prix. Captain Pounder is the head of this tribe. They are the police officers of Flip City, and they ensure that all bots from all tribes obey the law. Kuzuri: Members of the Kuzuri tribe are responsible for healthcare. Chief Surgeon Koto is the head of the tribe. The Kuzuri tribe supplies medical support to any bot in need. Whether it be a simple recharge or a complicated repair the Kuzuri tribe will have your back on the trax in a flash. Nisen: Members of the Nisen tribe form the government of Flip City. They live in the upper regions of Flip City. Mayor Aria is the head of this tribe and Mayor of Flip City. They are the politicians of the RollBot world and ensure that all tribes and services are running smoothly. Tensai: The scientific tribe, these are the most intelligent RollBots in Flip City. The members of this tribe are responsible for the maintenance and construction of technological material. They are the creators of the new bot mods. Gates is the head of this tribe. Zeishi: A quiet and mysterious tribe. They live in remote boot sector homes and do not interact much with other tribes. The Zeishi tribe is the most obscure of the bunch. Very quiet and bizarre, bots from this tribe tend to keep to themselves and their homes. Zobo'shi: The members of this tribe are involved in emergency services. They are firefighters, but assist in any disaster. They have a strong rivalry with the FCPD. Fire Chief Cables is the head of this tribe. Zogen'sha: This tribe lives in the Cathedral. The members provide spiritual guidance and also act somewhat like an oracle. Their rules forbid the Kei'zatsu from entering their cathedral. They appear to be aware of what Spin really is and his destiny as well. The En is the leader of this tribe. They provide insight into the past, present, and future of rollbot life and always seem to be stressed-out. Zurasho: The construction workers of Flip City. Commander Octo is the head of this Tribe. The Zurasho tribe is responsible for the construction and maintenance of Flip City. These builders are proud of their work and always look to keep Flip City growing. Zushin: The lost tribe, and the only tribe that can communicate with the Hub and override the system. The Hub will warn the Zushin directly if there is a problem anywhere in Flip City, but can limit warnings to only true emergencies on Zushin request. They also protect the other tribes, including Kei'zatsu. Spin is the only surviving member. When Spin was a BotTot, the tribe as a whole was exterminated by the Spiderbots, led by Vertex, as part of their plans to destroy all Rollbots. There are actually twelve tribes, but most Rollbots believe that there are only eleven. The Kenchi-ku is a sub-tribe of the Hai'bu.http://www.rollbots.com Episodes Debut RollBots premiered on YTV in Canada on February 7, 2009. The series first aired on The CW4Kids in the United States on September 19, 2009. Soon it will start airing reruns on Disney XD in Canada. RollBots Online The official website of the show is operated by Xenophile Media.http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/19688 It currently has three main interactive sections: * FCPD Database: A collection of files on the various characters from the show. It also contains \\"classified information\\". * HoloGrid: A map of Flip City. In the show, it is used by Penny to identify problems . Online, it has links to games known as \\"missions\\". The current missions are Tribe Challenge, Rush Hour Racing, Kei'zatsu Academy, and Spinball. * FCPD Mainframe: Details like the leaderboard are displayed here. Individual points and money (known as Flip Chips) are also shown here. There is also an application that allows visitors (who are members of YTV.com) to create and customize their very own RollBot. Another important feature of the website is the Danuga translator. Danuga is the language of the RollBots. The translator allows visitors to translate English words and phrases into Danuga, and provides the correct pronunciation in Danuga.http://1889.ca/2009/02/rollbots-online.html References External links * * * MCM's Website *RollBots at iTunes Canada Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2009 Canadian television series debuts Category:2009 Canadian television series endings Category:Canadian children's animated action television series Category:Canadian children's animated drama television series Category:Canadian children's animated science fiction television series Category:Canadian computer-animated television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Amberwood Entertainment Category:YTV (TV channel) original programming Category:CW4Kids original programming Category:Animated television series about robots ","title":"RollBots"},{"id":"21513362","text":"Bara is a rural commune and village in the Cercle of Ansongo in the Gao Region of south-eastern Mali.

Bizarra first appeared in DC Comics Presents #71 (July 1984), in a story written by E. Nelson Bridwell with art by Curt Swan. The character is a distorted version of the superhero Wonder Woman, based on the Superman villain Bizarro. She is a very simple-minded being, has reversed character traits, believes women are inferior to men, and speaks in reverse of what her true meaning is. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis Bizarro- Wonder Woman is first shown as a member of the Bizarro Justice League team of social misfit heroes that inhabit Bizarro World.DC Comics Presents #71 (July 1984) Their home base is an abandoned submarine at the bottom of the sea. The team consists of Bizarro, Bizarro Wonder Woman, Bizarro Yellow Lantern, Bizarro Aquaman, and Bizarro Hawkman. Batzarro had left the team to form the superhero group \\"The Insiders\\", a Bizarro version of the Outsiders team. In the story, Bizarro is bored being able to defeat his fellow Justice League members so he creates a Bizarro version of the villain Amazo. Amazo steals the powers of the Justice League, including Wonder Woman, and helpfully gives them to ordinary citizens of Bizarro World. After realizing the folly of his actions, Bizarro convinces Bizarro Amazo to return the powers to the proper persons. Post-Crisis In 1985, DC Comics introduced a storyline titled Crisis on Infinite Earths. That company-wide story arc erased the established history of almost all DC Comic's characters. Bizarra was then re-introduced as part of an all new Bizarro Justice League teamAction Comics (vol. 1) #856‚Äì857 (November‚ÄìDecember 2007) (which included Bizarro, Batzarro, Bizarro Flash, Bizarro Hawkgirl, and Bizarro Yellow Lantern). They live on the cube-shaped planet Htrae which is populated entirely with Bizarro-type humans. At one point, Bizarro Hawkgirl tied up Bizarra (in that story referred to as \\"Wonder Woman\\") with her own lasso. It was explained that Bizarra's lasso had the ability to force anyone tied by it to tell only lies. Bizarra seemed to be romantically interested in Bizarro but the feeling was not shared as Bizarro was in love with his world's version of Lois Lane only. During the storyline, it was shown that due to exposure to Htrae's blue sun, Bizarro gained the ability to create new Bizarro life-forms. Whether Bizarra was created by Bizarro or was a pre-existing character is unclear. Bizarra is later shown to be working for the villain Monarch.Lord Havok and the Extremists #3 (February 2008) She, along with several other variant super-heroes, torture Tracer mercilessly. Bizarra ends the battle by hanging Tracer with her lasso from a fire escape by his neck. Abilities Powers and skills Bizarra is depicted as having all the abilities of Wonder Woman, although in some incarnations several of these traits have been reversed, such as: * \\"Lasso of Lies\\", a lasso that forces anyone tied by it to lie, instead of Lasso of Truth. Other versions All-Star Superman In 2005, DC Comics released the All-Star line of comics. This line is not in continuity with the other comic book titles released through DC Comics so its storylines have no impact on Wonder Woman's generally established comic book history. In the title All- Star Superman, a Bizarro Wonder Woman is introduced.All-Star Superman #8 (August 2007) Generally she is a 4- to 5-foot-tall () statue carried around by Bizarro on various Bizarro Justice League missions. Bizarro explains that Bizarro Wonder Woman started out as a beautiful baby who turned into an ugly cheap clay statue. Thus she has the opposite life of the traditional Wonder Woman who started out as a clay statue of a child who was transformed into a flesh and blood woman. Despite being an inanimate statue, Bizarro insists that Bizarro Wonder Woman is a good team player. In other media Bizarra Wonder Woman from The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians animated series.  Television  * An earlier animated version of Bizarra was shown in an episode of the 1985 television series The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians titled \\"The Bizarro Super Powers Team\\" voiced by actress B.J. Ward, who also voiced Wonder Woman. In the episode, Bizarro decides that his world of Bizarros needs more heroes than just Bizarro Supermen. He takes a duplicator ray to Earth and makes Bizarro duplicates of Wonder Woman (referred to as Bizarro Wonder Woman), Firestorm and Cyborg. Planning on taking them back to protect Bizarro World, Mister Mxyzptlk convinces Bizarro to train his new friends on Earth, which causes havoc for the real Super Powers Team.  Film  * Bizarra appears in Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League, voiced by Kari Wahlgren. In it, she, Batzarro, Greenzarro, and Cyzarro are created by Bizarro firing a duplicating ray at Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and Cyborg.  Videogames  * Bizarra appears in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. In the Bizarro World DLC map, Bizarra is among the Bizarro Justice League members that defends Bizarro World from Darkseid's forces.

Castle and Alice H. Castle, and their non-profit charitable foundation, the Harold K.L. Castle Foundation founded in 1962. The real estate portfolio consists of land holdings on the windward side of Oahu, Hawaii, as well as other Oahu and mainland United States properties. Properties include commercial, retail, office, industrial and residential parcels. History Mid 19th century During the mid-19th century, most of the land in the area belonged to Kalama, Queen Consort of Kamehameha III and later Queen Dowager of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She and Judge Charles Coffin Harris began a sugarcane plantation on the land, but after she died in 1870 and it failed in 1871, the land eventually passed to Harris's daughter, Nannie H. Rice, who leased to J. P. Mendonca in 1894 to start Kaneohe Ranch. Late 19th-early 20th century Born in 1886, Harold Kainalu Long Castle was the descendant of prominent businessmen and missionaries in Oahu. James Bicknell Castle, his father, served as a director of his father's company and as a partner of Alexander & Baldwin, another ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù company. By the late 1890s the Castle family was accumulating much of the east side of the island. In the early 20th century Kaneohe Ranch lands were used for growing pineapple, processing sugar and for cattle operations. Harold K.L. Castle purchased Kailua in early 1917. The Kaneohe Ranch controlled nearly the entire Ko‚Äôolaupoko plain from the present Windward Community College through the present Windward Mall down to the piers at Heeia on Kaneohe Bay, all the way through Kailua to the Olomana Country Club. Its headquarters, the Kaneohe Ranch Building at Castle Junction, was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Mid-to- late 20th century Over the last half of the 20th century, Kaneohe Ranch transformed what was once natural wetlands into a suburban community. At the end of World War II, demand for affordable housing grew. The idea to build houses on long-term leased land became popular due to their lower purchase cost. As part of his development strategy, Castle donated land along Kailua Road to churches that would eventually attract congregations to migrate towards Kailua. Further donations of land to schools, universities and hospitals enhanced the attractiveness of the community. Donations of Kaneohe Ranch land *Castle High School *Castle Medical Center *Marine Corps Base Hawaii *Kawai Nui Marsh *Hawaii Loa College *Windward Community College Community development In the early 21st century, many commercial ground leases expired. Kaneohe Ranch initiated a community planning process in 2004 for re-developing properties with expiring leases. In 2004 the first phase of construction in Kailua town center included a new Longs Drugs store, of retail frontage along Kailua Road, and a 427 stall, 3-story parking garage. The second phase, completed in the summer of 2006, included a Pier 1 Imports and the Kainalu Plaza and fountain. The Kalapawai Caf√© opened in 2007 with a similar look to the Kalapawai Market. The third phase included of retail space, a new location for First Hawaiian Bank, Hawaii's second Whole Foods Market, and additional parking.

Background In the mid-1800s, Lala Chunnamal was an extremely wealthy merchant based in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi. His family belonged to the Khatri caste of Punjabi traders. Role during 1857 war During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Lala Chunnamal emerged as one of the wealthiest men in Delhi, having astutely read which way the wind was blowing, and made a vast fortune supplying provisions to the British.Hakim's haveli haven for Afghan refugees He had also refused a request for a loan from Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar himself. Having refused the Emperor, he had left the city overnight after having previously sent much of his wealth out of the city secretly. After the hostilities ended, the British ordered the exile (forcible removal) of all Muslims from the city of Delhi. The poet Mirza Ghalib specifically mentioned the name of Lala Chunnamal while lamenting that men of low birth and less honour, like Chunnamal, were crowing and exulting in their glittering \\"illuminated mansions,\\" while honourable men of old and noble families were \\"sifting the dirt\\" after being trampled down by the British.The Last Mughal, The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi 1857, William Dalrymple Saving a mosque However, the trader was to prove the poet wrong in his estimation of the man. Among the properties which Lala Chunnamal acquired during this period was the Fatehpuri Masjid, a sprawling 17th century mosque built by one of the wives of Mughal emperor Shah Jehan, and located not far from Chunnamal's mansion in old Delhi. After the Muslims were expelled from the city in 1857, the mosque was deemed redundant, and was auctioned by the British with the intention that it be demolished and the land be used for building new houses and shops. Lala Chunnamal purchased the structure at auction for the massive sum of Rs. 19,000.Fatehpuri Shahi Masjid - A mute witness to the travails of Dilleehttp://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/09/25/stories/2003092500260100.htm [Beyond the Wall] Lala Chunnamal (‚Ä†29 January 1870), a Hindu belonging to an orthodox, upper-caste family, did not demolish the mosque but preserved it. He did this in spite of the fact that there were no Muslims in the area who could pray in the mosque. He just kept the mosque locked up and waited, like a philosophical Hindu, for times to change. Twenty years later, in 1877, the British lifted the prohibition against Muslims entering (or living in) Delhi. This was done at the time of the Delhi Darbar of 1877, when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India. At this time, the mosque was acquired by the British and made available to Muslims for prayers. Lala Chunnilal family received an estate of four villages in exchange for the mosque. It is noteworthy that a similar mosque, Akbarabadi Masjid, built by another wife of Shah Jahan, did not survive under similar circumstances. That mosque had succumbed to British cannon fire during the battle and a very ruined structure had been auctioned later.mosque whtm In memory of a pious Begum The Hindu, 3 October 2005.

History This unit has a long and distinguished history that lives up to the medical corps tradition of being faithful in adversity. It is the latest in a line of Vancouver army medical units dating back to 18 Field Ambulance of World War I. World War I This unit started out initially as a local militia unit. In World War I, the field ambulance was sent to the 5th Canadian Division and stationed with the Seaforth Highlanders for a period of time. After the war, it was set up as a reserve unit and renamed 12 Field Ambulance. The unit was called to active service in World War II in 1939. World War II In 1942 the unit, now known as 12 Canadian Light Field Ambulance (the term \\"light\\" indicated that it was equipped to be particularly fast moving and so able to keep up with a swiftly advancing armoured division), sailed to England with the 4th (Canadian) Armoured Division.http://www.junobeach.org/e/4/can-tac- inf-1CA1945-e.htm#FourthArmouredDivision Providing medical support to the Division as they participated in operations within Europe. One of the unit's most significant action was in support of the 4th Armoured Division during the battle of Hochwald Forest. Captain Nathan Kaufman was Section Officer. His OBE award states that \\"On 2 March 1945, Captain Kaufman sited the most forward casualty collecting post in the Hochwald Gap and its position was responsible for the fact that early medical attention was given to the wounded in that sector. Through all operations this officer has shown a consistent devotion to duty combined with an ability to get forward and complete his job despite the personal risk involved. His willingness to serve and his efficient handling of casualties has been an inspiration to all ranks of his unit.\\" 12 Field Ambulance made Canadian medical corps history becoming the only field ambulance to engage the enemy in combat. This occurred one morning in April 1945 in the German town of Sogel. German soldiers approached, and fired upon the casualty treatment facility under cover of darkness. The Commanding Officer quickly organized two platoons, and placed them at the approaches to the dressing stations. They held off the enemy for two hours; with weapons borrowed from the wounded -at the time medics didn't carry weapons- until a squadron of tanks arrived to relieve them. During the fighting the dressing station continued treating patients. The Commanding Officer, LCol A.D. MacPherson received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership in this action; Cpl F.F. Thompson was awarded the Military Medal, and Capt Harry Jolley received the Member of the Order of the British Empire. Post-World War II to 1999 After the war, 12 Field Ambulance was reverted to the Army Reserve (Militia) and moved to Jericho Garrison in 1947. The unit was then renamed 24 Medical Company following another move to Bessborough Armoury. In 1969, the medical unit became attached to 12 Vancouver Service Battalion. In the early 1970s, the unit was disbanded along with all militia medical units across Canada. After existing as a medical station at 12 Service Battalion for several years, the unit was raised as 12 (Vancouver) Medical Company in 1980 and is relocated back to its present location at Jericho Garrison later that year. During this period, the unit has participated in numerous peace keeping missions and served on tours in Bosnia, Croatia, Cypress, Aviano and the Golan Heights. 2000 to Present 12 Field Ambulance have been involved with local operations ranging from G8 Security in 2002 to fighting BC Forest Fires in the year 2003. Recently, the unit has been awarded the Freedom of the City from the city of Vancouver in 2007. In addition to domestic operations, the unit has participated in operations overseas, most recently in Operation Athena in Afghanistan and have members that are currently training for further deployments.

Irony can be categorized into different types, including verbal irony, dramatic irony, and situational irony. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.Muecke, DC., The Compass of Irony, Routledge, 1969. p. 80 Other forms, as identified by historian Connop Thirlwall, include dialectic and practical irony. Definitions Henry Watson Fowler, in The King's English, says, \\"any definition of irony‚Äîthough hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted‚Äîmust include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same.\\" Also, Eric Partridge, in Usage and Abusage, writes that \\"Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant.\\" The use of irony may require the concept of a double audience. Fowler's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage says: > Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting > of one party that hearing shall hear & shall not understand, & another party > that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more & of > the outsiders' incomprehension.Fowler, H. W., A Dictionary of Modern English > Usage, 1926. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for incongruous and applied to \\"every trivial oddity\\" in situations where there is no double audience. An example of such usage is: > Sullivan, whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he > composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera > scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.Gassner, J., Quinn, E., The > Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama, Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. > 358. The American Heritage Dictionary secondary meaning for irony: \\"incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs\\". This sense, however, is not synonymous with \\"incongruous\\" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. It is often included in definitions of irony not only that incongruity is present but also that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of American Heritage Dictionary's usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ironic to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that \\"suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly.\\"Quoted in The Free Dictionary under ironic: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic On this aspect, The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has also:The Oxford English Dictionary, \\"irony\\" entry, second definition. Douglas C. Muecke identifies three basic features of all irony. First, irony depends on a double-layered or two-story phenomenon for success. ‚ÄúAt the lower level is the situation either as it appears to the victim of irony (where there is a victim) or as it is deceptively presented by the ironist.‚ÄùDouglas C. Muecke, The Compass of Irony (London: Methuen, 1969), 19. The upper level is the situation as it appears to the reader or the ironist. Second, the ironist exploits a contradiction, incongruity, or incompatibility between the two levels. Third, irony plays upon the innocence of a character or victim. ‚ÄúEither a victim is confidently unaware of the very possibility of there being an upper level or point of view that invalidates his own, or an ironist pretends not to be aware of it.‚ÄùIbid., 20. Origin of the term According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: According to Richard Whately:Whately, Richard; \\"Rhetoric\\", Encyclopedia Metropolitan, I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the OED entry) The word came into English as a figure of speech in the 16th century as similar to the French ironie. It derives from the Latin ironia and ultimately from the Greek Œµ·º∞œÅœâŒΩŒµŒØŒ± eir≈çne√≠a, meaning 'dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected'.The Oxford English Dictionary, \\"irony\\" entry. Types A \\"No smoking\\" sign surrounded by images of a smoking Sherlock Holmes at Baker Street tube station The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics distinguishes between the following types of irony:Preminger, A. & Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan, The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, MJF Books, 1993, , pp. 633‚Äì635. *Classical irony: Referring to the origins of irony in Ancient Greek comedy, and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term. *Romantic irony: A self-aware and self-critical form of fiction. *Cosmic irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, \\"general [irony] of the world.\\" *Verbal irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning *Situational irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect. *Dramatic irony and tragic irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another \\"I'll see you tomorrow!\\" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it. Verbal irony According to A glossary of literary terms by Abrams and Harpham, > Verbal irony is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is > sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic > statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or > evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the > speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or > evaluation.Abrams, M. H., & Harpham, G. G., A glossary of literary terms, > 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009. Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced intentionally by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, \\"I'm not upset!\\" but reveals an upset emotional state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony‚Äîspeakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic. In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus (\\"But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man\\"), while actually condemning them. \\"We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell\\". Horberry, R., A&C Black, Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life 2010. p. 135. Ironic similes are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means A but that eventually conveys the meaning not A: * as soft as concrete * as clear as mud * as pleasant as a root canal * \\"as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake\\" (Kurt Vonnegut from Breakfast of Champions) The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity. =Verbal irony and sarcasm= A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and sarcasm. Fowler's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage states: > Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of > sarcasm. This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. The Oxford English Dictionary's entry for sarcasm does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes: The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica has \\"Non- literary irony is often called sarcasm\\"; while the Webster's Dictionary entry is: Partridge in Usage and Abusage would separate the two forms of speech completely: > Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means > precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. The psychologist Martin, in The Psychology of Humour, is quite clear that irony is where \\"the literal meaning is opposite to the intended\\" and sarcasm is \\"aggressive humor that pokes fun\\".Martin, R. A., The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach, Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13. He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement \\"What a nice day\\" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites Winston Churchill, who is supposed to have said, when told by Bessie Braddock that he was drunk, \\"But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly\\", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended. Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, \\"Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you.\\" The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm. Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term sarcasm is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant & Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some psycholinguistic theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that sarcasm (\\"Great idea!\\", \\"I hear they do fine work.\\"), hyperbole (\\"That's the best idea I have heard in years!\\"), understatement (\\"Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer...\\"), rhetorical questions (\\"What, does your spirit have cancer?\\"), double entendre (\\"I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...\\") and jocularity (\\"Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.\\") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices (tropes) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt & Gibbs, 2000). =Verbal irony and echoic allusion= Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a speech act by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.Wilson, Deirdre. \\"The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?.\\" Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743. Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of paralinguistic markers such as prosody, tone, or pitch,Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. \\"Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech.\\" Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web. as well as nonverbal cues like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.Gonz√°lez-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. \\"Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony.\\" Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47. An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows: * Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know. * Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken. From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of \\"I just must have been mistaken\\" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1. Dramatic irony Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. Connop Thirlwall in his 1833 article On the Irony of Sophocles originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, A Study of Sophoclean Drama, p. 258: \\"The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, \\"On the Irony of Sophocles,\\" by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is.\\"Thirlwall's original article appears in Philological Museum (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog The Oxford English Dictionary defines dramatic irony as: According to Stanton,Stanton, R., \\"Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances\\", Modern Language Notes, Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420‚Äì426, The Johns Hopkins University Press. dramatic irony has three stages‚Äîinstallation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution) ‚Äîproducing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the contrary of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of. For example: * In City Lights, the audience knows that Charlie Chaplin's character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill) believes him to be rich. Clausius, C., The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy, P. Lang, 1989, p. 104. * In North by Northwest, the audience knows that Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is not Kaplan; Vandamm (James Mason) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.Gulino, P., Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach, Continuum, 2004, pp. 9‚Äì10. * In Othello, the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.Booth, W. C., A Rhetoric of Irony, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. * In \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.Poe, Edgar Allan, The Cask of Amontillado, The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22‚Äì23. * In The Truman Show, the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.Adams, A., Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels, Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30. * During the 1960 U.S. presidential election, an older woman reportedly teased John F. Kennedy at a campaign event for pursuing the presidency despite his relative youth, saying \\"Young man, it's too soon.\\" Kennedy had been diagnosed with Addison's disease in 1947 ‚Äì with the attending physician estimating that he would not live for another year ‚Äì in addition to suffering from multiple other chronic medical conditions that required as many as a dozen daily medications by the time of his presidency which were not publicly disclosed (or acknowledged, in the case of the Addison's diagnosis) until after his death. Kennedy responded to the older woman by saying, \\"No, ma'am. This is my time.\\" =Tragic irony= Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. The Oxford English Dictionary defines this as: Ancient Greek drama was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the legends that most of the plays dramatized. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:Colebrook, Claire. Irony. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14. Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 125. Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of paradox that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the William Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet, when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.William, J., Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. Situational irony Louisville, Kentucky. Margaret Bourke-White.The American Way of Life. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Photograph, gelatin silver print n. 1973.195 There's no way like the American Way Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation. Lars Ellestr√∂m writes: > Situational irony ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the > outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally > understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp > contrasts.Ellestr√∂m, L., Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music > and the Visual Arts, Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51. For example: *When John Hinckley attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan, all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.The Trial of John W. Hinckley, Jr. by Doug Linder. 2001 Retrieved 9 September 2008.Horberry, R., Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life, A&C Black, 2010. p. 138. *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for intelligence, only to discover he is already a genius, and the Tin Woodman longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of love. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering coward, turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in Emerald City believed the Wizard to be a powerful deity, only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all. Lenguazco, CD., English through movies. The wizard of Oz, Librer√≠a-Editorial Dykinson, 2005, p. 27. *In O. Henry's story \\"The Gift of the Magi\\", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts. The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. \\"The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled.\\" Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader, Routledge, 2007, p. 59. =Cosmic irony (irony of fate)= The expression cosmic irony or \\"irony of fate\\" stems from the notion that the gods (or the Fates) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended. According to Sudhir Dixit, \\"Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] Hardy. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile deus ex machina in Hardy's novels.\\" In Tess of the d'Urbervilles \\"there are several instances of this type of irony.\\"Dixit, S., Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles, Atlantic Publishers & Dist, 2001, p. 182. One example follows:Hardy, Thomas, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, Oxford World's Classics, p. 420. > \\"Justice\\" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in √Üschylean phrase) > had ended his sport with Tess. =Historical irony= When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s The New York Times repeatedly scorned crossword puzzles. In 1924, it lamented \\"the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern.\\" In 1925 it said \\"the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast.\\" Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than The New York Times. In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the \\"First World War\\" was called by H. G. Wells \\"the war that will end war\\",Wells, H. G., The War That Will End War, 1914. which soon became \\"the war to end war\\" and \\"the war to end all wars\\", and this became a widespread truism, almost a clich√©. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the Vietnam War, where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the Viet Cong (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the Viet Minh in its fight against Japanese occupation.Neale, Jonathan The American War, p. 17, . In the introduction to The Irony of American History, Andrew Bacevich writes:Bacevich, A., in Niebuhr, R., The Irony of American History, University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. xiv. Gunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by Chinese alchemists searching for an elixir of immortality.Jack Kelly Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World, Perseus Books Group, 2005, , 9780465037223: pp. 2‚Äì5 Historical irony also includes inventors killed by their own creations, such as William Bullock ‚Äì unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of Otto Lilienthal, who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising. In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of divine providence to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all. Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include: *In the Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling in 1856, the United States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the Bill of Rights to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the American Civil War.Fehrenbacher, D. E., Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective, Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90. *In the Kalgoorlie (Australia) gold rush of the 1890s, large amounts of the little- known mineral calaverite (gold telluride) were ironically identified as fool's gold. These mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.Kean, S., The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, Random House, 2011, pp. 226‚Äì228. *John F. Kennedy's last conversation was ironic in light of events which followed seconds later. Seated in the middle row of the presidential limousine in Dallas, First Lady of Texas Nellie Connally reportedly commented, \\"Mr. President, you can't say that Dallas doesn't love you.\\" Kennedy replied, \\"That's very obvious.\\" Immediately after, he was mortally wounded.Last words of presidents *In 1974, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission had to recall 80,000 of its own lapel buttons promoting \\"toy safety\\", because the buttons had sharp edges, used lead paint, and had small clips that could be broken off and subsequently swallowed.Wall Street Journal, December 3, 2007, Page B1: It Dawned on Adults After WWII: 'You'll Shoot Your Eye Out!' . Retrieved October 29, 2009. *Introducing cane toads to Australia to control the cane beetle not only failed to control the pest, but introduced, in the toads themselves, a much worse pest.Feral Animals Australia (Dept of the Environment) Use Comic irony Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect. This may also be combined with satire. For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice begins with the proposition \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. \\"Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial.\\"Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction, Routledge, 2006, p. 77. \\"The Third Man is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self- consciousness.\\"Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; Ethics at the Cinema, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295. Writing about performances of Shakespeare's Othello in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: \\"Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and na√Øvety in thinking he could pass for white.\\"Gordon, R., in The Shakespearean International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century, Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. Romantic irony and metafiction Romantic irony is \\"an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection\\". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel.The Oxford English Dictionary, entry \\"romantic irony\\". Joseph Dane writes \\"From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony.\\" He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: \\"But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?\\" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.Dane, J. A., The Critical Mythology of Irony, University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5. Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as Don Quixote and Tristram Shandy, Douglas Muecke points particularly to Peter Weiss's 1964 play, Marat/Sade. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, \\"The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright\\", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the \\"audience\\" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, \\"in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press\\", while \\"in England [‚Ä¶] [it] is almost unknown.\\"Muecke, DC., The Compass of Irony, Routledge, 1969. pp. 178‚Äì180. However, in a book entitled English Romantic Irony, Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:Mellor, Anne K., English Romantic Irony, Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187. Similarly, metafiction is: \\"Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques.\\"The Oxford English Dictionary, entry \\"metafiction\\". It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion. Gesa Giesing writes that \\"the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony.\\" Giesing notes that \\"There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II.\\"Giesing, G., Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark, GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6. For example, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed \\"What is metafiction?\\". These include: Additionally, The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction refers to John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman:Nicol, B., The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction, Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108‚Äì109. Socratic irony Socratic irony is \\"the dissimulation of ignorance practised by Socrates as a means of confuting an adversary\\". Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. The Chambers Dictionary defines it as \\"a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more\\". Zoe Williams of The Guardian wrote: \\"The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots.\\" A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, Columbo. The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly na√Øve and incompetent. His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion. As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating. With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.Cox, G. How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23. Irony as infinite, absolute negativity Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard, and others, sees irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.Kierkegaard, S, The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates (1841), Harper & Row, 1966, p. 278. The phrase itself is taken from Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics, and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist Friedrich Schlegel (\\"On Incomprehensibility\\"), Charles Baudelaire, Stendhal, and the 20th century deconstructionist Paul de Man (\\"The Concept of Irony\\"). In Kierkegaard's words, from On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates: > [Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, > because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or > that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates > is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, > because that which is to be established lies behind it... Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony‚Äîwhether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple litotes‚Äîmust, in Kierkegaard's words, \\"swallow its own stomach\\". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer David Foster Wallace viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other postmodern tropes as the cause of \\"great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems.\\" Irony and awkwardness The 1990s saw a cultural expansion of the definition of irony from \\"saying what one doesn't mean\\" into a \\"general stance of detachment from life in general\\",Kotsko, Adam, Awkwardness., O-Books, 2010, pp. 21 this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, Seinfeld) relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations. The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, Millennials, are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. Hipsters are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations. Opposition between Perception and Concept Schopenhauer, in The World as Will and Representation, Volume 2, Chapter 8, claimed that the complete and total opposition between what is thought and what is seen constitutes irony. He wrote: \\"... if with deliberate intention something real and perceptible is brought directly under the concept of its opposite, the result is plain, common irony. For example, if during heavy rain we say: 'It is pleasant weather today'; or, of an ugly bride it is said: 'He has found himself a lovely treasure'; or of a rogue: 'This man of honor,' and so on. Only children and people without any education will laugh at anything of this kind; for here the incongruity between the conceived and the perceived is total.‚Äù Misuse Some speakers of English complain that the words irony and ironic are often misused, though the more general casual usage of a contradiction between circumstance and expectation originates in the 1640s. Dan Shaughnessy wrote: > We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best > never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. > (Alanis Morissette's song \\"Isn't it Ironic?\\" cites multiple examples of > things that are patently not ironic.)Shaughnessy, D., Senior Year: A Father, > A Son, and High School Baseball, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92. Tim Conley cites the following: \\"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word \\"ironically\\", as it opens a sentence: # By a tragic coincidence # By an exceptional coincidence # By a curious coincidence # By a coincidence of no importance # You and I know, of course, though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun # Oddly enough, or it's a rum thing that # Oh hell! I've run out of words to start a sentence with.\\"Conley, T., Joyces Mistakes: Problems of Intention, Irony, and Interpretation, University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 81. Punctuation No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an irony punctuation mark was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or percontation point, which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or sarcasm. French writer Herv√© Bazin suggested another pointe d'ironie: the Greek letter psi with a dot below it, while Tom Driberg recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.Houston, K., Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks, W. W. Norton & Company, 2013, pp. 211-244.

Biography She was born on August 23, 1912 in Celina, Ohio, and grew up in Decatur, Alabama. Her father was a pharmacist. In 1932, she graduated from Alabama College in Montevallo. Career During the Great Depression, her art career was temporarily placed on hold, as she taught Latin and English in Alabama for a decade. She did make trips to study at the Chicago Art Institute and the Art Students League of New York. During a summer trip to Kelly Fitzpatrick's Dixie Art Colony in 1937, she met her future husband, Karl Wolfe. They married in Colorado in 1944, where she was studying for a master of fine arts at Colorado College and he was working for the Air Force as a graphic artist at Lowry Field. After World War II, the Wolfes settled in Jackson, constructing Wolfe StudioThe Wolfe Studio Official Site and becoming regionalist artists interested in depicting Mississippi. Inspired by European Masters, Impressionists, and Post-Impressionists, she mostly painted landscapes in oil or watercolor. While Karl Wolfe was most known for his portraits, Mildred also painted several well-known portraits, including one of close friend Eudora Welty that is in the National Portrait Gallery. In addition to painting, both Wolfes worked with ceramics, sculpture, and stained glass. Mildred worked in her husband's shadow for many years, first at Wolfe Studios, then at Millsaps College, where both were members of the art department. When her husband retired in 1968, she lost her teaching position. In 1978, while Karl was included in an exhibition of Mississippi art, she was not. After Karl's death in 1984, the art community of Mississippi began appreciating Mildred for her own art, not for being Karl's wife. The Mississippi Museum of Art mounted exhibitions of her work in 1994 and 2006. In addition, the University Press of Mississippi published a monograph of Mildred's work, showing examples of her paintings and public works.Mildred Nungester Wolfe at the University Press of Mississippi Death She died of congestive heart failure at her Jackson home on February 11, 2009, aged 96.

He was a chaplain and master at St Paul's School for many years, as well as being associated with the Mercers' Company and churches in the City of London. Life Rider was baptized in the church of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate in London on 14 May 1723. After studying at Mr Watkin's academy in Spital Square, Rider moved to the University of Oxford. He initially matriculated at St Mary Hall in 1739 before moving to Jesus College, holding a scholarship there from 1744 to 1749. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1745 and was ordained. He became chaplain of the Mercers' Company and of St Paul's School, lecturer of St Vedast Foster Lane and curate of St Faith's church, London. He was surmaster at St Paul's School from 1763 to 1783, when ill-health forced his retirement. He died on 30 November 1785, survived by his widow Hannah and son John. Works Rider turned his hand to various topics: history, lexicography, translations, poetry and sermons. He translated Voltaire's Candide in 1759 (the same year that it was published). He wrote A New Universal Dictionary, or, A Compleat Treasure of the English Language (1759) and dedicated it to Pitt the Elder; it demonstrated Rider's knowledge of Anglo-Saxon, Welsh and German but could not compete with Johnson's Dictionary. He also wrote the 50-volume A New History of England (1761-64, together with an accompanying atlas in 1764), which he dedicated to King George III, covering the history of England from pre-Roman times until 1763. Whilst it was designed to be an affordable and accessible history, it was not a success and was later described by William Thomas Lowndes as one of the vilest Grub Street compilations ever published. In 1762, he published (anonymously) An Historical and Critical Account of the Lives and Writings of the Living Authors of Great Britain.

He adopted a rat and named it Lucky because he believed it to be a good luck charm, but it was captured by his neighbor, \\"Jumpsuit\\" Johnson. Luther is also a C- student in class but in the episode \\"Summer School\\", Luther gets an A+ by filling in the circles on his ScanTron test sheet in such a way that it resembles a T. rex. He and Zeke become sponsored by Riot Skates as of mid- season 2. * Daniel Curtis Lee as Kornelius \\"Kojo\\" Jonesworth. Kojo is kind of a friend to Zeke and Luther but also a rival for the reputation of best skater in town. In the beginning of the series he disliked Zeke and Luther equally and referred to them as losers but later on they worked it out. He is full of himself to the point of him having his own calendar. He is sponsored by \\"Dastardly Skate\\". Kojo calls his girlfriends \\"female ladies\\". It is revealed in the episode \\"Luck Be a Rodent Tonight\\" that his mother's name is Nancy. He also thinks he is a better skater than both Zeke and Luther. When something goes well for him he will usually say \\"Watch out!\\", and then slaps his buttocks. Kojo had a crush on Zeke's cousin Mia. However, since Mia stayed in Gilroy for only a few days, he dated an extremely tall (yet pleasant and helpful) blonde model in the episode \\"Daredevils\\". As revealed in the episode \\"Kojo's BFF\\", Kojo is also a big fan of turkey jerky. * Ryan Newman as Ginger Falcone (seasons 1‚Äì2 main; season 3 recurring). She is Zeke's younger sister and the main antagonist of the series. In the episode \\"Bros Go Pro\\", she uses the boys to make money. She is smart and constantly looks for ways to torture Zeke, like telling Olivia he likes her and ratting Zeke and Luther out when they hid in the episode \\"Bros Go Pro\\". She also has a habit for making stands such as a falafel stand in the pilot episode and a lemonade stand in the episode \\"Bros Go Pro\\". She stresses personal hygiene and having a clean and sanitary surrounding as seen in the episode \\"Robo-Luth\\" She is also an accomplished flutist and can also tumble as shown in the episode \\"Skate Camp\\". Recurring characters * Nate Hartley as Oswald \\"Ozzie\\" Kepphart, a local power walker and a nerd who wears large glasses. He used to hate skateboarding but became a part-time skater, the first sport he did not quit after a day, and eventually became a good skater. He occasionally sticks his butt out as a rude gesture, which annoys Luther. When he skates, he flaps his arms as if he is attempting to fly. * David Ury as Donald \\"Don\\" Donaldson, the owner and proprietor of Don's Donuts, Zeke and Luther's favorite hangout. In the episode \\"Luther Leads\\", Luther realizes that Don is the only one that works at Don's Donuts, although he hires more people in later episodes. * Marianne Muellerleile as Dorothy Joanne \\"Nana\\" Waffles, Luther's grandmother. Nana lives in an apartment with her husband Carl. She often inspires Luther because he does not want to disappoint her loft view of him, and the boys often come to her aid when she is in trouble. * Abigail Mavity as Lisa Grubner, a young, geeky girl who has an overwhelming crush on Zeke. She lives in a pink dollhouse in her parents' driveway and is an avid flutist and tumbler. Her first appearance was in the episode \\"Donut Jockey\\". * Scott Beehner as Deputy Dingle, a bumbling police officer who is always onto Zeke and Luther's shenanigans, but is easily bribed by turkey jerky as seen in \\"Bro, Where's Our Car?\\". Although an officer, he is very stupid, and also can be strict. * Lawrence Mandley as Reginald \\"Jumpsuit\\" Johnson, Zeke and Luther's cranky ex- astronaut neighbor who commonly growls and has a gravity simulator in his garage. His nickname is because he wears a jumpsuit every day. He once called Luther a menace but made no comment about Zeke. * Ron Fassler as Dale Davis, a local television news reporter always on the scene of a big event. * Tristin Mays as Monica Lopez, Kojo's on-and-off cheerleader girlfriend. She also appears in the episode \\"Bro, Where's Our Car?\\" as a Junior Miss Gilroy candidate who, alongside Bridget, is taken to the beach by Zeke and Luther in an attempt to woo them. * Lily Jackson as Poochie McGruder (seasons 1‚Äì2), Ginger's cheerful friend who helps her to prank Zeke. She likes clapping at anything Ginger says or does, and her catchphrase is \\"Yay!\\". She wears glasses. * Juliet Holland-Rose as Olivia Masterson (season 1). Formerly the olive girl for the \\"Langley Olives\\" company, she was once Zeke's next door neighbor and crush. She tried designing him a skater look in the episode \\"Cape Fear \\" but only for it to fail, mainly to a large cape that became a safety hazard. It is noted that she has a crush on Zeke. She did not know that he liked her until the episode \\"Adventure Boy\\". She is said to like brave guys. * Andy Pessoa as Garrett \\"Stinky Cast\\" Delfino (seasons 1‚Äì2), a local boy who constantly wears the same sleeveless white shirts, jean shorts and trademark cast on his arm. He is Zeke and Luther's camera guy. He has the hugest crush on Ginger which Zeke uses as leverage to pay for Stinky Cast's videos. He had his cast removed in the episode \\"The Big Red Stacking Machine\\" which he was upset about due to losing his trademark. He then proceeded to try to injure himself to get a new cast and succeeded, thus restoring his name. * David Gore as Kirby Cheddar (seasons 1‚Äì2). He lives near Zeke and Luther. He plays the airdrums and the trombone. His mother is very overprotective. * Reid Ewing and Chris Zylka as Charlie and Doyce Plunk (entire run and seasons 1‚Äì2, respectively). Brothers that are always ready to give Zeke and Luther a hard time, and they are their archrivals. They come from a family of barbers and they play pranks on other teens by cutting their hairs. * Davis Cleveland as Roy Waffles (seasons 2‚Äì3), Luther's younger and rarely mentioned brother. He is obsessed with playing video games and stays in his room so much that he did not even know what the sun was when Zeke and Luther took him outside. When someone takes his video game away from him, he gets \\"Roy Rage\\" and becomes super strong, allowing him to bend metal bars and lift a car. He has appeared in the episodes \\"Little Bro, Big Trouble\\" and \\"Sibling Rivalries\\". * Carlos Lac√°mara as Dr. Ricardo (season 2‚Äì3), a doctor that Zeke and Luther regularly visit who sometimes does not give the best prescriptions. * Paul Tei as Eddie Coletti (season 3), the owner of Riot Skates, the company that Zeke and Luther are sponsored by. He is known to have a major sweating problem. * Claudia Lee Bridget (season 3), a waitress at Don's Donuts and Luther's love interest. She is a common-sense person surrounded by crazy characters.

This approach highlights two key aspects of literacy: linguistic diversity, and multimodal forms of linguistic expression and representation. The term was coined in response to two significant changes in globalized environments: the proliferation of diverse modes of communication through new communications technologies such as the internet, multimedia, and digital media, and the existence of growing linguistic and cultural diversity due to increased transnational migration. Because the way people communicate is changing due to new technologies, and shifts in the usage of the English language within different cultures, a new \\"literacy\\" must also be used and developed. Overview There are two major topics that demonstrate the way multiliteracies can be used. The first is due to the world becoming smaller, communication between other cultures/languages is necessary to anyone. The usage of the English language is also being changed. While it seems that English is the common, global language, there are different dialects and subcultures that all speak different Englishes. The way English is spoken in Australia, South Africa, India or any other country is different from how it is spoken in the original English speaking countries in the UK. The second way to incorporate the term multiliteracies is the way technology and multimedia is changing how we communicate. These days, text and speech are not the only and main ways to communicate. The definition of media is being extended to include text combined with sounds, and images which are being incorporated into movies, billboards, almost any site on the internet, and television. All these ways of communication require the ability to understand a multimedia world. The formulation of \\"A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies\\" by the New London Group expanded the focus of literacy from reading and writing to an understanding of multiple discourses and forms of representation in public and professional domains. The new literacy pedagogy was developed to meet the learning needs of students to allow them to navigate within these altered technological, cultural, and linguistically diverse communities. The concept of multiliteracies has been applied within various contexts and includes oral vernacular genres, visual literacies, information literacy, emotional literacy, and scientific multiliteracies and numeracy.  Application to the real world  Due to changes in the world, especially globalization and an increase in immigration, a debate has arisen about the way students are instructed and learning in school. English, and all subjects, should evolve to incorporate multimodal ways of communication. The New London Group (1996) proposes the teaching of all representations of meaning including, linguistic, visual, audio, spatial, and gestural, which are subsumed under the category of multimodal. A pedagogy of multiliteracies includes a balanced classroom design of Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice. Students need to draw on their own experiences and semiotic literacy practices to represent and communicate meaning. The changes that transpire through the field of education affect learning processes, while the application of learning processes affects the use of multiliteracies (Selber, 2004). These include the functional, critical, and rhetorical skills that are applied in diverse fields and disciplines. Educational pedagogies, including Purpose Driven Education, integrate the use of multi-literacy by encouraging student learning through exploration of their passions using their senses, technology, vernaculars, as well as alternative forms of communication.  The New London Group  The New London Group is a group of ten academics who met at New London, New Hampshire, in the United States in September 1994, to develop a new literacy pedagogy that would serve concerns facing educators as the existing literacy pedagogy did not meet the learning needs of students. Their focus was on replacing the existing monolingual, monocultural, and standardized literacy pedagogy that prioritized reading and writing, with a pedagogy that used multiple modes of meaning making. They emphasised the use of multiple modes of communication, languages, and multiple Englishes to reflect the impact of new technologies and linguistic and cultural diversity, instead of developing competence in a single national language and standardized form of English. The ten academics brought to the discussion their expertise and personal experience from different national and professional contexts. Courtney Cazden from the United States has worked in the areas of classroom discourse and multilingual teaching and learning; Bill Cope from Australia, on literacy pedagogy and linguistic diversity, and new technologies of representation and communication; Mary Kalantzis from Australia, on experimental social education and citizenship education; Norman Fairclough from the United Kingdom, on critical discourse analysis, social practices and discourse, and the relationship between discursive change and social and cultural change; Gunther Kress from the United Kingdom, on social semiotics, visual literacy, discourse analysis, and multimodal literacy; James Gee from the United States, on psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language and literacy; Allan Luke from Australia on critical literacy and applied linguistics; Carmen Luke from Australia, on feminism and critical pedagogy; Sarah Michaels from the United States, on classroom discourse; and Martin Nataka on indigenous education and higher education curriculum. The article \\"A Pedagogy of Multiliteracies: Designing Social Futures\\" published in 1996, documents the New London Group's \\"manifesto\\" of literacy pedagogy that is recommended for use in educational institutions, in the community, and within organizations.  A pedagogy of multiliteracies  The multiliteracies pedagogical approach involves four key aspects: Situated Practice, Critical Framing, Overt Instruction, and Transformed Practice. Situated Practice involves learning that is grounded in students' own life experiences. Critical Framing supports students in questioning common sense assumptions found within discourses. Overt Instruction is the direct teaching of \\"metalanguages\\" in order to help learners understand the components of expressive forms or grammars. Transformed Practice is where learners engage in situated practices based in new understandings of literacy practices.  Situated practice  Situated Practice, originally formulated by the New London Group (1996) as one of the related components of Multiliteracies Pedagogy, is constituted by immersion in meaningful practices within a community of learners who are culturally and linguistically diversified. It involves situating meaning making in real-world contexts and taking account of the affective and sociocultural needs of learners. This aspect of the curriculum needs to draw on the lifeworld experiences of students, as well as their out-of-school communities and discourses, as an integral part of the learning experience. In order to apply Situated Practice to curriculum realities, Cope & Kalantzis (2009) reframed it as ‚Äúexperiencing‚Äù (p. 184). They believe human cognition is situated and contextual, and meanings are grounded in the real world of patterns of experience, action and subjective interest. Experiencing takes two forms. * Experiencing the known‚Äìlearners bring their own, invariably diverse knowledge, experiences, interests and life-texts to the learning context. Activities of experiencing the known involve showing or talking about something familiar- listen, view, watch and visit, reflecting on learners' own experiences, interests and perspectives (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). * Experiencing the new‚Äìlearners are immersed in new situations or information, observing or taking part in something that is new or unfamiliar, but within the zone of intelligibility and close to their own life-worlds. For example, teachers introduce something new but which makes sense by immersion in experiments, field trips and investigations in projects (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). Situated Practice/experiencing connects with a tradition called 'authentic pedagogy'. Authentic pedagogy was first formulated as a direct counterpoint to didactic pedagogy in the twentieth century, initially through the work of John Dewey in the United States and Maria Montessori in Italy. It focuses on the learner's own meanings, the texts that are relevant to them in their everyday lives. When it comes to reading and writing, authentic literacy pedagogy promotes a process of natural language growth that begins when a child learns to speak, with a focus on internalized understanding rather than the formalities of rules. It is learner-centered and aims to provide space for self-expression. However, the New London Group (1996) points out limitations to Situated Practice. First, while situated learning can lead to mastery in practice, learners immersed in rich and complex practices can vary significantly from each other and Situated Practice does not necessarily lead to conscious control and awareness of what one knows and does. Second, Situated Practice does not necessarily create learners who can critique what they are learning in terms of historical, cultural, political, ideological, or value-centered relations. Third, there is the question of putting knowledge into action. Learners might be incapable of reflexively enacting their knowledge in practice. Therefore, they clarify that Situated Practice must be supplemented by other components and powerful learning arises from weaving between Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, Critical Framing and Transformed Practice in a purposeful way.  Critical framing  Critical Framing in multiliteracies requires an investigation of the socio-cultural contexts and purposes of learning and designs of meaning. Cope and Kalantzis (2001) discuss this in the context of our increasingly diverse and globally interconnected lives where the forces of migration, multiculturalism, and global economic integration intensify the processes of change. The act of meaning-making is also diversifying as digital interfaces level the playing field. Mills (2009) discusses how multiliteracies can help us go beyond heritage print texts that reproduce and sustain dominant cultural values by creating affordances for thinking about textual practices that construct and produce culture. Another dimension of this critical framing may be extended to the diverse types and purposes of literacy in contemporary society. The traditional curricula operates on various rules of inclusion and exclusion in the hierarchical ordering of textual practices, often dismissing text types such as picture books or popular fiction. Similarly, items like blogs, emails, websites, visual literacies, and oral discourses may often be overlooked as \\"inferior literacies\\". In excluding them from mainstream literacy practices, we become prone to disenfranchise groups and may lose out on opportunities to sensitize learners to consider underlying issues of power, privilege, and prejudice, both in terms of identifying these in societal practices, as well as in questioning dominant discourses that normalize these. Mills also states how some scholars such as Unsworth (2006a, 2006b) and Mackey (1998) suggest an increased blurring of 'popular culture' and 'quality literature' facilitated by classical literature made available in electronic formats and supported by online communities and forums. In addition to acknowledging increased socio- cultural contextualization and diversification of text-types, multiliteracies pedagogies also enable us to critically frame and reconceptualize traditional notions of writing, calling into question issues of authority, authorship, power, and knowledge. Domingo, Jewitt, & Kress (2014) address these concepts through a study of template designs on websites and blogs that empowers the readers through non-linear readings paths, with the modular layout allowing them to choose their own reading paths. They also discuss the varying affordances of different modes and how writing become just one part of the multimodal ensemble. Multiliteracies transcend conventional print literacies and the centrality of cultures that have historically extolled it, offering much scope for arts-based approaches in decolonizing initiatives (Flicker et. al., 2014) or reflexive visual methodologies in situated contexts (Mitchell, DeLange, Moletsane, Stuart, & Buthelezi, 2005). However, in so far as access to digital tools and infrastructures is concerned, we still need to take into account issues of agency, capital, socioeconomic status, and digital epistemologies (Prinsloo & Rowsell, 2012).  Overt instruction  Original view In the original formulation of the New London Group, Overt Instruction was one of the major dimensions of literacy pedagogy that was identified. The original view of overt instruction includes the teachers and other experts' supporting students through scaffolding and focusing the students on the important features of their experiences and activities within the community of learners (Cope & Kalantzis, 2000, p. 33). Cope and Kalantiz argue teachers and other experts allow the learner to gain explicit information at times by building on and using what the learner already knows and has achieved. Overt Instruction is not, as it is often misrepresented, direct transmission, drills, and rote learning. It includes the kinds of collaborative efforts between teacher and student in which the student can do a task that is much more complex than the task s/he can do it individually. According to Cope and Kalantzis, \\"Overt Instruction introduces an often overlooked element-the connection of the element of the importance of contextualization of learning experiences to conscious understanding of elements of language meaning and design\\" (p. 116) Use of metalanguages, Cope and Kalantzis argue, is one of the key features of Overt Instruction. Metalanguages refer to \\"languages of reflective generalization that describe the form, content, and function of the discourses of practice\\" (p. 34). Updated view After applying Overt Instruction orientation to curriculum practices for around a decade, this dimension of literacy pedagogy was reframed and translated in the Learning by Design project into the 'Knowledge Process' of conceptualizing (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, 2015). Conceptualizing involves \\"the development of abstract, generalizing concepts and theoretical synthesis of these concepts\\" (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015, p. 19). Using these Knowledge Processes, learners can categorize terms, and collect these into the mental models. Conceptualizing, according to Cope and Kalantzis (p. 19) occurs in two ways: Conceptualizing by Naming-categorization is a Knowledge Process by means of which the learner learns to use abstract, generalizing terms. A concept not only names the particular; it also abstracts something general from that particular. Activity type: define terms, make a glossary, label a diagram, sort or categorize like or unlike things Conceptualizing with theory-schematization is a Knowledge Process by means of which learners make generalizations and put the key terms together into interpretative framework. They build mental models, abstract frameworks and transferable disciplinary schemas (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, p. 185). Activity type: draw a diagram, make a concept map, or write a summary, theory or formula which puts the concepts together  Transformed practice  Transformed Practice, originally framed by the New London Group (1996) as part of the four components of Multiliteracies pedagogy, is embedded in authentic learning, where activities are re-created according to the lifeworld of learners. Transformed Practice is transfer in meaning-making practice, which involves applied learning, real-world meanings, communication in practice, and applying understanding gained from Situated Practice, Overt Instruction, and Critical Framing to a new context. Once learners are aware of how context affects their learning, the \\"theory becomes reflective practice\\" (The New London Group, 1996, p. 87). In other words, learners can reflect on what they have learned while they engage in reflective practice based on their personal goals and values in new contexts. For instance, learners design a personalized research project on a specific topic. Transformed Practice subsequently underwent reformation and was renamed \\"Applying\\" as part of \\"Knowledge Processes\\" (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009, p. 184), formerly known as Multiliteracy pedagogy. Applying is considered as the typical focus of the tradition of applied or competency-based learning (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). While learners actively learn by applying experiential, conceptual or critical knowledge in the real world, learners act on the basis of knowing something of the world, and learning something new from the experience of acting. That is, applying occurs more or less unconsciously or incidentally everyday in the lifeworld, since learners are usually doing things and learning by doing them. Applying can occur in two ways: * Applying appropriately concerns how knowledge is perceived in a typical or predictable way in a particular situation. For instance, meanings are expressed in a way that corresponds to the conventions of a semiotic or meaning-making setting (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). Applying appropriately also involves the application of knowledge and understanding of the complexity of real-world situations. Learners then examine if they are valid. Examples of activities include writing, drawing, solving a problem, or behaving in the usual and expected manner in a real-world situation/simulation (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015). * Applying creatively involves the way learners transform knowledge they have learned from a familiar context and use it in a different context, unfamiliar to learners. As applying creatively is related to being active in the innovative and creative world, learners‚Äô interests, experiences, and aspirations can be promoted. Examples of activities are taking an intellectual risk, applying knowledge to a different setting, suggesting a new problem, and translating knowledge into a different mix of modes of meaning (Cope & Kalantzis, 2015).

It hoped to establish English as the official language of the federal government of the United States. If passed it would require that all official functions and proceedings of federal and state government be conducted in English. It would also require that applicants for naturalization be tested on their ability to read and generally understand the English language. They would be tested on the laws of the United States as well as other important documents that relate to the law, including the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It would also require that all naturalization ceremonies be conducted in English. If a person became injured because of violations of this act, they would be able to file suit in court. Before this act could be considered by the House of Representatives it had to be approved by the House Judiciary, and Education and the Workforce Committees. History The English Language Unity Act is based on a similar bill, \\"The Bill Emerson English Language Empowerment Act\\", which passed in the House of Representatives in 1999. However, it never became law. It tried to amend Federal law to declare English to be the official language of the U.S. Government. If it became a law, it would have required state representatives to conduct official business in English. It would have required that all officials conduct naturalization ceremonies entirely in English as well. Conservative Republican lawmaker Representative Steve King introduced this act to the House of Representatives on March 1, 2005 it was known as the English Language Unity Act of 2005. Before the 109th session of Congress ended, the bill accumulated 164 sponsors. The last action on this bill was the introductory remarks on the proposed bill on May 19, 2006. The bill did not come up for debate during this session of Congress, so it is said to have died. Representative King reintroduced the bill as the English Unity Act of 2007 on February 12, 2007. This time it gained the support of 153 cosponsors. The last action on this proposed bill was on June 5, 2007 when the House Committee on Education and Labor referred the bill to the subcommittee on Early Childhood Education, Elementary and Secondary Education. Congress adjourned before further action could be taken, so the bill died again in 2007. Representative King alongside Senator Jim Inhofe introduced the English Language Unity Act of 2011 on Friday, March 10, 2011. In a release King defended his proposition by saying \\"A common language is the most powerful unifying force known throughout history. We need to encourage assimilation of all legal immigrants in each generation. A nation divided by language cannot pull together as effectively as a people.\\" Inhofe added: \\"This legislation will provide much-needed commonality among United States citizens, regardless of heritage. As a nation built by immigrants, it is important that we share one vision and one official language.\\" H.R. 997 had the support of 73 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 115th Congress (2017-2019), The Senate companion bill to H.R. 997, labeled S. 678 in the 116th Congress, was sponsored by Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma. It had 7 supporters in the U.S. Senate in the 115th Congress.https://proenglish.org/2019/07/17/rep-alex- mooney-co-sponsors-english-language-unity-act Controversy Repeated attempts to make English the official language of the United States have failed time and time again, though the issue never fails to spark heated debate. While appearing to focus solely on language, these attempt trigger issues related to financial burden, discrimination, patriotism, and unity. Those against the legislation argue the bill deals with a non-issue. They claim Congress does not need to establish legislation in order to teach others the importance of knowing English since the language is already spoken by a majority of Americans. Opponents of the legislation question why there is a sudden need for an official language, given that the United States government has flourished without one for the past two hundred years. They argue that it is not an official language that binds Americans together as a country, but rather the freedoms and ideals that are enjoyed by its citizens. Some opponents of the bill also argue that the legislation is unconstitutional. They assert it would limit the government's ability to correspond with all its citizens, and that by restricting federal and state employees from communicating with citizens in a language other than English, the bill violates first amendment rights of free speech. Some further contend that the bill would call for changes to the Voting Rights Act by eliminating all non- English ballots, despite the fact that nothing in the bill's language modifies the Voting Rights Act. Supporters of the legislation take the position that accommodation of non-English speakers discourages assimilation. They acknowledge that the ability to speak a language other than English is valuable, and that its use in the home, church or private place of business should in no way be discouraged. At the same time, they argue that the government should not bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that non- English-speaking individuals can participate in government solely using their mother language. They contend that as more immigrants learn English, the language barriers that divide the country into separate groups will disintegrate and lead to a decrease in racial and ethnic problems. They also believe that by learning English, individuals can become more productive citizens and members of American society. They argue that immigrants who are fluent in English have better economic opportunities, and assert that non- English speakers tend to find themselves restricted to low-skilled, low-paying jobs. Supporters of the bill also posit that the ability of immigrant groups to speak English will give them an increased political voice and allow them to participate more fully and effectively in the democratic process. Thirty-one states currently have adopted legislation similar to the English Language Unity Act.

It has undergone significant repurposing development since retirement and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. History The building and its active years The structure is a complex of three buildings located at Pratt Street and Pier 4 at Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The structures are brick with terra cotta trim and steel frame construction. It was built between 1900 and 1909 and is a massive industrial structure with Neo-Classical detailing designed by the architectural firm of Baldwin & Pennington. It was one of only 11 buildings in the zone of the Baltimore Fire of 1904 to survive that event.See HAER entry. It served as the main source of power for the United Railways and Electric Company, a consolidation of smaller street railway systems, that influenced the provision of citywide transportation and opened up suburban areas of Baltimore to power its electric street railway in the city. It later served as a central steam plant for the Consolidated Gas, Electric Light and Power Company, a predecessor of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. The boilers were coal-fired, and the plant's location on the harbor allowed easy delivery of coal by ship. The location also provided access to cooling water for the condensers, with intake on one side of the pier and discharge on the other. The plant, with by-then obsolete equipment, was used sparingly until it was returned to service to meet the World War II production demand for electricity. Baltimore Gas & Electric finally ceased use of it in 1973. Post-retirement life After the electric plant was retired from service, the building was vacant several years, eventually becoming acquired by the City of Baltimore. It has since been redeveloped and repurposed for a variety of commercial projects. The first two attempts at redevelopment - an indoor Six Flags theme park named Six Flags Power Plant (1985‚Äì1989) and a short-lived dance club called P.T. Flagg's (1989‚Äì1990) - were not successful. Since that time, other projects have had more success. The Power Plant's more recent tenants have included the first ESPN Zone in the country (opened July 11, 1998; closed June 2010 and replaced by Phillips Seafood, which moved from nearby Harborplace), Hard Rock Cafe (opened July 4, 1997), Barnes & Noble (opened 1998, to be closed August 28, 2020 Barnes & Noble Closing Power Plant Location At Baltimore‚Äôs Inner Harbor, CBS News, August 25, 2020), Gold's Gym (closed early 2010; and replaced by Pandion Performance Center in June 2015), and loft offices. Maryland Art Place, a contemporary art gallery for Maryland artists, is located in the northwest corner. It lends its name to the nearby Power Plant Live! nightlife complex.

During ancient times, it was the last on a series of difficult passes on the most common summer caravan route between Ladakh and the Tarim Basin. In recent years, besides being used by the locals, it has also become a trekking route for Chinese trekkers. History DMA, 1973) Map including Sanju Pass (labeled as Sanju Dawan) (1917) Caravan routes Historically, the main route from Northern India to the Tarim Basin led through the Nubra Valley in Ladakh across the ice-covered Sasser Pass () and the even higher Karakoram Pass () and the relatively easy Suget Pass to the staging post at Shahidulla. From there in summer the caravans normally headed north across the Sanju Pass to modern Guma (Pishan) in the Tarim Basin and then either northwest to Karghalik and Yarkand or northeast to Khotan.Hill (2009), pp. 200-203, 208. After traversing the Sanju Pass, the caravans descended to the village of Sanju from where a good road led to Yarkand, meeting up with the Kilian route at Bora and the Kilik and Kugiar routes at Karghalik.Forsyth (1875), p. 245. From Shahidula to the Tarim Basin the traveller had a choice of three passes, the Kilik (not to be confused with the Kilik Pass leading from the Hunza Valley to the north),Hill (2009), p. 200. the Kilian Pass and the Sanju; but the usual route for caravans in the 19th century was via the Sanju Pass. The Kilik Pass was reportedly once frequently used by Balti merchants based in Yarkand and had plenty of fodder and fuel at every stage. It was said to be the easiest and shortest route, but merchants were not allowed to use it for political reasons. Travellers were also often prevented from accessing it for considerable periods during hot weather due to flooding of the Toghra about below Shahidula. After crossing the pass the route joined the Kugiar route at Beshterek, one day's march south of Karghalik. Apparently, the Kilian was previously the most frequented pass, though it was little used in the 19th century except sometimes in the summer. It is higher than the Sanju Pass and also impractical for laden horses, but reportedly not so difficult to cross. The road then descends to the village of Kilian and, after two marches one reached Bora on the road between Sanju and Karghalik. The summit of the pass is always covered with ice and snow and is not practicable for laden ponies - yaks have to be used.Forsyth (1875), pp. 244-245. 19th-century Kashmiri claim During the Dungan revolt in 1862, the political status of Xinjiang as part of the Qing dynasty became uncertain. The border between British India and the semi-independent State of Kashmir with Xinjiang became a matter of some speculation. In attempt to assert control to the Kunlun Mountains, the Maharajah of Kashmir constructed a fort at Shahidulla, and had troops stationed there for some years to protect caravans. Eventually, most sources placed Shahidulla and the upper Karakash River firmly within the territory of Xinjiang. According to Francis Younghusband, who explored the region in the late 1880s, there was only an abandoned fort and not one inhabited house at Shahidulla when he was there - it was just a convenient staging post and a convenient headquarters for the nomadic Kirghiz.Younghusband (1896), pp. 223-224. The abandoned fort had apparently been built a few years earlier by the Kashmiris.Grenard (1904), pp. 28-30. There is evidence that the Chinese had mined jade in the region at least as early as the Later Han Dynasty and up until the quarries were abandoned during the Muslim Rebellion in 1863-4, just prior to Mr. Johnson's trip in 1865.Hill (2009), pp. 203-204, 616.Shaw (1871), pp. 473-475. Thomas Douglas Forsyth who was entrusted with the task of visiting the Court of Atalik Ghazi pursuant to the visit on 28 March 1870 of the envoy of Atalik Ghazi, Mirza Mohammad Shadi, stated that \\"it would be very unsafe to define the boundary of Kashmir in the direction of the Karakoram‚Ä¶. Between the Karakoram and the Karakash the high Plateau is perhaps rightly described as rather a no-mans land, but I should say with a tendency to become Kashmir property\\". Two stages beyond Shahidulla, as the route headed for the Sanju Pass, Forsyth‚Äôs party crossed the Tughra Su and passed an outpost called Nazr Qurghan. \\"This is manned by soldiers from Yarkand\\".For. Pol.A. January 1871, 382/386, para58 In the words of John Lall, \\"Here we have an early example of coexistence. The Kashmiri and Yarkandi outposts were only two stages apart on either side of the Karakash river...Aksaichin and Sino-Indian Conflict by John Lall at pages 57-58, 61, 69. Allied Publishers Private Ltd, Nav Dehli\\" to the northwest of the Hindutash in the north eastern frontier region of Kashmir. This was the status quo that existed at the time of the mission to Kashgar in 1873-74 by Forsyth. \\"Elias himself recalled that, following his mission to Kashgar in 1873-74, Sir Douglas Forsyth 'recommended the Maharaja‚Äôs boundary to be drawn to the north of the Karakash valley as shown in the map accompanying the mission report'. Whether this was ever done is doubtful. The Qing dynasty quelled the Dungan revolt in 1878. Although the Maharajah of Kashmir apparently indicated a wish to reoccupy the fort at Shahidulla in 1885, he was prevented from doing so by the British and so the territory remained under effective Chinese control. Aftermath Since the reasserting control of the whole region by China in 1878,Millward (2007), p. 130. it has been considered part of Xinjiang.Stanton, Edward. (1908) Atlas of the Chinese Empire. Prepared for the China Inland Mission. Morgan & Scott, Ltd. London. Map. No. 19 Sinkiang. and has remained so ever since. Shahidulla is well to the north of any territories claimed by either India or Pakistan, while the Sanju and Kilian passes are further to the north of Shahidulla. A major Chinese road, China National Highway 219, runs from Kargilik (Yecheng) in the Tarim Basin, south through Shahidulla, and across the disputed Aksai Chin region still claimed by India, and into northeastern Tibet Autonomous Region.National Geographic Atlas of China, p. 28.

Three years later, Sh≈ç H≈ç was named Prince of Nakagusuku and given Nakagusuku magiri as his domain. King Sh≈ç Nei died without an heir in 1621, and Sh≈ç H≈ç was selected to succeed him. As the first king to be enthroned since Satsuma's invasion in 1609, formal permission and acknowledgment of the king's authority and legitimacy was required before performing the coronation ceremony, sending heralds to China, and assuming the responsibilities of the throne. In addition, while Sh≈ç H≈ç retained powers related to organization of offices and administration of punishments, along with all the ritual prestige of the throne, Sh≈ç Nei was the last king of Ryukyu to rule personally, directly, and absolutely as monarch. Much of the decisions and behavior of Sh≈ç H≈ç's government were subject to Satsuma's approval.Kerr, George. Okinawa: The History of an Island People. (revised edition). Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2000. p185. Relations with China were also strained. At the start of Sh≈ç H≈ç's reign, Okinawan tribute ships were only welcome in Fuzhou once every ten years. The Chinese Imperial Court had reduced the tribute missions to this frequency following the Japanese invasion in 1609, claiming that it was done in consideration of the instability and poverty that the chaos of the invasion must have brought to the kingdom. In fact, these tribute missions, the only legal method of trading with Ming China, were essential to the kingdom's economic prosperity. Therefore, in 1623, when investiture missions were exchanged, the Ryukyuan officials pushed for a return to the system of sending tribute every other year; it was decided that missions would be allowed once every five years.Kerr. p180.

Early life Silahdar Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ±lƒ± Mehmed Aƒüa was born on 7 December 1658 in the district of Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ± in Galata , Mehmed Aƒüa, who entered the palace at a young age, was brought up under the patronage of Ba≈ü Musahib ≈ûahin Aƒüa at the time. He was included in Hasbah√ße gardeners on 9 February 1674 and then as page in the privy chamber. He rose to higher positions in a short time, serving under sultan Mehmed IV. Campaigns Mehmed Aƒüa personally participated in the Vienna Expedition in 1683 and expressed the troubles that were taken after he left the army with his army. In 1688, Witnessing Mehmed IV's dismissal and rebellion of janissaries, Mehmed Aƒüa, the new sultan. He was in his service at the time of S. He was found near the sultan because of his work and recorded the events with great care and detail. With this rivals, ulema masters, were admitted to the presence of the sultan in the Baƒüdad Mansion in Hasbah√ße and expressed their discomfort about ƒ∞smail Pasha. Works As stated briefly above, Silahdar Mehmed Aƒüa continued to write his work from the place where his Fezleke left because of his admiration to Katib √áelebi. Silahdar Findiklili Mehmed Agha wrote historical chronicles such as \\"Zeyl-i Fezleke\\" (\\"Postscript to the Fezleke,\\" the Fezleke being an earlier work by the historian K√¢tip √áelebi), which is today commonly known as Silahdar Tarihi (The History of Sword-Bearer). ZeyliFelekze Zeyl-i Fezleke has seven detected copies. Three of them are in various libraries in Istanbul, one in the Manisa General Library and one in Vienna.In addition, it is not known where the copy of Halis Efendi used by Ahmet Refik Bey in the publication of a work in the Turkish Historical Society Library. A second volume of his work was entitled Nusretname (The Book of Victories). These together recorded the events which occurred prior to and during his lifetime. They present both the events in Constantinople (such as the fire of 1660 which destroyed most of the city) but also his experience during the campaigns of Kara Mustafa Pasha and the battle of Vienna.Silahdar Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ±lƒ± Mehmet Aƒüa - Silahdar Tarihi - Istanbul, 1928Silahdar Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ±lƒ± Mehmet Aƒüa, (Sadele≈ütiren: ƒ∞smet Parmaksƒ±zoƒülu) - Nusretn√¢me - Istanbul, 1962 Silahdar Findikli Mehmed AgaGuboglu, Mihai; Mehmed, Mustafa A. - Cronici Turce≈üti privind ≈¢ƒÉrile Rom√¢ne - Academia Republicii Socialiste Rom√¢nia, Bucure≈üti, 1966. As we mentioned above in the resources section, Silahdar wrote the previous transfer while writing his work by referring to the resources written earlier. However, he did not transfer the information contained in these works as they were, and compared the resources with each other and completed the deficiencies from other sources. Thus, it can easily be said that Zeyl-i Fezleke contains more detailed information than any of these sources. For his own period, although he was involved in the events, he did not hesitate to use other sources from time to time and wrote the period he lived with his own observations in a very detailed way. The work of Silahdar is of particular importance for the siege of Vienna and beyond, since it was personally involved in this expedition, based on their own observations and experiences. Nusretn√¢me In Nusretname who writes about, Mustafa II's Austrian expeditions, Zenta Disaster, Karlof√ßa Treaty, Edirne Foundation and the actions of the navy are included in this section. In the second part, it deals with the events between 1704-1721. The most important of these are: Baltacƒ± Mehmed Pasha's Russian expedition, Purut Treaty and Khanate struggles in Crimea. He is more concise because he wrote this part after leaving the palace. The author evaluated what he heard more here. Silahdar Mehmed Aƒüa wrote the events in chronological order, year by year, in both of his works. In fact, giving the Gregorian dates in some cases when it deems necessary is an indication of the importance given to date determination. Death Silahdar Findklili Mehmed Agha probably died in 1726-27. The information given by the sources about the date of death and the place of his grave is different. Mehmed Aƒüa, who died at the age of seventy, was buried in Ayazpa≈üa Cemetery in Taksim. Legacy Mehmed Aƒüa, who emphasized the historian aspect with the words ‚ÄúMuharrir-i vekƒÅyi'-i hakƒ´r m√ºverrih Mehmed kemterleri‚Äù , as he mentioned in his life section, he has followed the state and sultanate news very closely as he had important services in the palace, and many events during his civil service life It was found inside. After 1703 it was part of the years when it was away from the palace service, and this part was mostly written by writing what they heard. When compared with the historical works of the same period, it is seen that the events in Zeyl-i Fezleke were more detailed than others and that many issues not found in other dates were also found in the history of Silahdar. In addition, due to the fact that Silahdar Mehmed Aƒüa is someone who came from the palace bureaucracy and took part in the events beside the sultan himself, both his developments in the palace were comprehensively addressed and many details about the private world of the sultan were included. Although it is an important source, both Zeyl-i Fezleke and Nusretn√¢me did not attract the attention of historians for a long time.

The club, also known as \\"The Shammies\\", currently field 5 teams in the 1st Grade Division of the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union competition (Subbies). Petersham RUFC was founded in 1883, making it the oldest surviving suburban rugby club in Australia. History  Early years: 1883‚Äì1907 The Sydney rugby institution that is the Petersham Football Club first took to the playing fields in the winter of 1883. At that time, Sydney club rugby was organised on two levels, known simply as Senior and Junior. The Senior club competition had been running since 1874, but Junior contests prior to the mid-1880s were somewhat disorganised. In fact, the Southern Rugby Union only started involving itself in Junior rugby in 1882, and did not get around to establishing a formal competition for Junior clubs until 1886. By that time Petersham had affiliated to the Union, and was a participant in that first official second tier competition. Over the next few years Junior football continued to grow in popularity, and the new competition had to be regularly expanded to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of clubs. Petersham became entrenched at the top level and contested every First Junior competition from 1886 to 1895, winning it in 1889 and making the semi-finals on four other occasions. During this period the club also boasted an impressive role of Junior representative players and supplied a steady stream of quality footballers to the Senior competition. Two of these, Arthur Braund and Rush Nelson, later went on to play many tests for New South Wales and, in the latter case, Queensland. By the late 1890s however, the Sydney rugby scene was changing. In 1897 a new body, the Metropolitan Rugby Union, had been formed to oversee the Sydney club competitions. A natural consequence of this was the extinction of a large number of Junior clubs, and indeed by the start of the 1898 season over twenty founding members of the new union, including the entire Fourth Junior competition, had disappeared from its books. Petersham, who had been suffering from a drain of quality players to the Senior competition anyway, was a more significant and probably unintended casualty of this policy. Fortunately however, the club was strong enough to survive the setback. While most of the Junior clubs disenfranchised by the Metropolitan Rugby Union from 1897 to 1900 simply ceased to exist, a few, including Petersham, continued to play amongst themselves outside the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan and New South Wales Rugby Unions. This competition was formalised in 1901 as the City and Suburban Association, the direct ancestor of modern Subbies rugby. Petersham is the only surviving founding member of that competition - the basis of our claim to be Australia's oldest Subbies club! Petersham played in the new competition from 1901 to 1905, winning it in 1904. In 1906, Petersham followed the example of previous City and Suburban premiers and switched to the Metropolitan Rugby Union's Borough competition, which had been established in 1902 to counter the threat of the new rebel union. Petersham played in the Borough competition for two years, until it was discontinued at the end of the 1907 season. At this time the club ceased operation for the first time since its inception, and there follows a gap of some years before becoming one of the first Sydney clubs to reform after the Great War. This is the only discontinuity in the history of the club. Subbies: 1919‚Äì1945 The re- establishment of New South Wales rugby in 1919 saw the New South Wales Rugby Union establish a new combined competition. Petersham rapidly rose to prominence, being promoted to First Grade in 1922. Unfortunately the club's only flirtation with senior rugby was anything but auspicious, with its only two competition points coming from a final round forfeit by Sydney University Football Club. Consequently, Petersham was dropped to Third Grade, which they immediately won, and were subsequently reinstated to the Reserve Grade B competition. The Kentwell Cup had been presented to the winners of this competition for the first time the previous year, and so began Petersham's long association with that coveted trophy. In 1929, the New South Wales Rugby Union split its competition in two, forming separate District and Non-District competitions. Petersham stayed with the Non-District competition, which was reconstituted in 1933 as the Metropolitan Sub-District Rugby Union. In 1934 Petersham won the Kentwell Cup for the first time, defeating Roseville in the grand final. At this time the New South Wales Rugby Union was looking fill a vacancy in the District competition, and so dominant were the Petersham and Roseville clubs that it was decided whichever of them won the Kentwell Cup in 1935 should be promoted forthwith. Needless to say the pair met in the grand final once more, but this time Roseville took the honours. They subsequently merged with Chatswood and Gordon to form the Gordon District Rugby Club. Petersham remained in Subbies. Ron McLean patronage: 1946‚Äì1992 After the Second World War, Petersham came under the patronage of the famous and mercurial Ron McLean, a veritable legend of Subbies rugby. Ron first pulled on a boot for Petersham in 1935, and later went on to serve as club president and secretary for a total of 47 years. His contributions to the club were manifest, but probably the most significant was the instigation of the famous Petersham World Tour. Petersham had been a touring club since the 1880s, but in 1967 it became the first club side in world rugby history to actually circle the globe on a football tour. The feat has been repeated on numerous occasions since, and the various touring sides have boasted many prominent New South Wales and Australian representative players. In 1971, the Sydney Sub- District Rugby Union was established and was reorganised over three divisions. Petersham entered the 1st Division, and in 1972 made the Kentwell Cup grand final for the third time, only to lose it to Hunters Hill. However they made up for it with a win over Lindfield in 1973, then backed up to exact vengeance on the black and white hoops in 1974. This side included many top quality players, and is one of only a small number ever to win back to back Kentwells. At the end of 1974 however, an internal dispute saw many of the dual premiership players leave the club, and within two years Petersham had dropped to 3rd Division. Thus began a long period of exile in the lower divisions. This was a tough time for the club, and ultimately saw it on the verge of extinction. However a century of rugby breeds resilience, and tough times seem to bring out the best in Petersham. Modern club: 1993 to present The 1993 season saw both a committee reshuffle and an influx of new players. Over the next couple of years the club progressed steadily, and eventually found itself back up in 3rd Division in 1996. There followed a period of success, winning the Campbell Cup in 1997, the Farrant and Nicholson Cups in 1999 and the Clark, Farrant and joint Campbell Cups in 2000. The latter year also saw the club win the Keith Harris Shield for the 3rd Division club championship and achieve promotion to 2nd Division. The sojourn in 2nd Division was not as successful as would have been hoped however, as the club gradually lost its recent momentum and started to slide. The period had its highlights, in particular the establishment of a highly successful U21 Colts team, but overall the club failed to live up to expectations. The adventure ultimately came to an end in 2005 after a disastrous run of injuries and plain old bad luck finally took its toll and saw Petersham relegated back to 3rd Division. 2006 was a much more successful year, with the club returning to winning form. 3rd Grade and 4th Grade both made the finals with the 3rd XV subsequently winning the Campbell Cup over Blue Mountains in one of the biggest grand final upsets of 2006. This was followed in 2007 by Farrant and Nicholson Cups. Petersham player in traditional sky blue and maroon jersey runs with the ball in traffic. 2008 was celebrated with Petersham Rugby's 125th anniversary. The multitude of off-field events celebrating the club's historic milestone was manifested with success on field with all four grades showcasing in the 3rd division grand finals in poor weather conditions in Sydney. Petersham won the Farrant and Campbell cups that day, however the entire 5 grades celebrated the history of their club.  Colours  The original 19th century colours of the Petersham RUFC are described as \\"Bismarck and Coral, 4 in. bars\\". File:Bismarck & Coral.jpg These colours were used from the club's inception in 1883 up until the disbanding of the Metropolitan Rugby Union Borough Competition at the end of 1907. After the World War I, the club reformed and played initially in Dark Green. This strip was eventually overshadowed by the Myrtle Green of Randwick however, and so when Petersham joined the newly formed New South Wales Rugby Union Non-District Competition in 1929, the colours were changed to the modern \\"Sky Blue and Maroon, 4 in. bars\\" in deference to the playing colours of the New South Wales and Queensland Rugby Unions: File:Maroon & Blue.jpg Nearly eight decades later, the only other change has been the addition of the famous Waratah flower crest of New South Wales (the only suburban club sanctioned to do so), emblazoned with the club's founding date of 1883.

Biography Dennis Cusick was born c. 1800 to the Tuscarora tribe, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. His father was Nicholas Cusick (1758‚Äì1840), a Revolutionary War veteran who had fought with the Indian Rangers. The family lived in Oneida County, New York, but moved to Niagara County, New York, when Nicholas was hired to be an interpreter and assistant to the local missions to the Tuscarora. A missionary Elkanah Holmes wrote that Nicholas promised \\"to collect materials for making up an account of the present state of the Indians, as well as for a history of the ancient tribes inhabiting the state.\\"Sturtevant, William C. \\"Early Iroquois Realist Painting and Identity Marking.\\" Three Centuries of Woodlands Indian Art. Vienna: ZKF Publishers, 2007: 129-143. . This interest in documenting the lifeways and history of area tribes must have influenced his sons, particularly Dennis' older brother, David Cusick, who wrote and illustrated Sketches of Ancient History of the Six Nations in 1828. In January 1818, Dennis joined the Tuscarora Congregational Church. He painted two watercolors to decorate collection boxes for the church. The Congregationalist mission supported a school on the Seneca Reservation at Buffalo Creek, New York. Dennis died at the age of twenty-four. Artwork James Young, a teacher at the Buffalo Creek school, wrote about Dennis, \\"in acquiring the arts he has had no instruction except what he has received from copying.\\" Dennis was praised by another teacher, who said he \\"could draw well, and made his own colors from native woods.\\" He was also praised for his skill in calligraphy, which appears in his paintings. In Cusick's art, the fusion of Native and Euro-American motifs provides an authentic visual chronicle of the material changes in Native culture that resulted from the absorption of Christian values and themes.Kramer Russell, K., & Berlo, Janet Catherine et al. Shapeshifting: Transformations in Native American Art. Salem, Mass.: Peabody Essex Museum. 2012:167. Two almost identical watercolor paintings were painted by Dennis to adorn collection boxes. \\"Seneca School House\\" is dated July 3, 1821, and \\"Seneca Mission House\\" is dated April 16, 1822. They both feature the two-storey, log schoolhouse, both with a pitched roof, smoking chimney, and bell tower. To the left is a crowd of traditionally dressed Tuscarora warriors and boys. Tall trees flank the sides of the paintings and birds fly overhead. The later painting is precisely composed and more orderly overall. A pair of 1821 watercolors features schoolchildren in class. \\"Seneca School House. July 16, 1821\\" portrays James Young teaching a crowd of Tuscarora boys. Books, desks, and windows dot the room. Dennis' flair for calligraphy in almost uncanny in its precision, as showcased in Biblical quotes, examples of script on a chalkboard, and minute vocabulary lessons in three languages, pinned on the walls. The gustoweh headdresses that adorn the older boys' heads indicate a continued Iroquois identity.Berlo, Janet C. and Ruth B. Phillips. Native North American Art. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998: 214-5. . \\"Seneca Mission House, Nov. 15, 1821\\" features girls studying in Mrs. James Young's class. Quotes about the nature of work hover over a scene of Tuscarora girls, busy as a variety of spinning wheels, overseen by an elaborately coiffed Mrs. Young at the paintings' left. Two of Dennis' other paintings survive. Dated March 4, 1822, \\"Evening Psalm\\" is a watercolor on paper, signed by the artist. The painting features two Tuscarora warriors ‚Äì one standing with a bow, the other seated with two firearms ‚Äì and a Tuscarora woman with a baby resting on her shoulder, tucked inside her robe. The three are flanked by loose, painterly foliage, and a dense tree, in which Dennis scraped the paint away to produce highlights. The background is filled with undulating blue hills, lined with evergreen trees. The narrow slice of sky is filled with a variety of cloud formations, and a minute sun tucked in the far left corner. Details of the figures' faces are minimal. Dennis relies on outlining to define shapes and cross-hatching to provide shadows and mass. Above the scene, the artist wrote a psalm in Seneca and English. The last painting, \\"Christening of the Tuscarora Asa Thompson,\\" is unsigned but dated 1821. Attribution is based on style and documentation that accompanied the painting. The watercolor painting features a Tuscarora woman handing her baby to an Iroquois man, wearing a fingerwoven sash, leggings, and moccasins. To his right in the minister, holding a Bible and extending his right hand. Both men have top hats. The background foliage is even more whimsical than that of \\"Evening Psalm.\\" Swaying trees cover rolling hills around the edges of the scene, but the center of the painting has large unpainted, negative space, providing contrast the figures. Legacy Dennis was one of the Early Iroquois Realists, who included at least five other painters, David Cusick, Thomas Jacobs (either a Tuscarora or Seneca), and anonymous artists of the Cattaraugus Seneca and Oneida tribes. They are known today only by twenty-five surviving paintings. Their work was a departure from previous Iroquois art forms and paved the way for Native Americans to use new materials from the global community to express their contemporary realities.

Porter, on 11 June 1917 and commissioned her on 13 July 1917 as USS Ora (SP-75) with Chief Machinist's Mate Charles B. Sands in command. Operating in the 7th Naval District during World War I, Ora patrolled off Key West in 1918, guarding the port, towing barges in the area, and ferrying boarding officers to various ships to check their identification. Occasionally she sighted foreign ships such as the Peruvian Penaun and the Uruguayan gunboat Montevideo. In 1919 she operated off the Florida Keys, aiding in the location of several sunken barges, delivering messages to ships, and participating in drills and signal practice. Ora was ordered sold on 30 July 1920, but was withdrawn from sale on 16 October 1920. Instead, she was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture on 6 December 1920.

Judson Dwight Collins (; Pinyin: Kƒìl√≠n; Foochow Romanized: K≈èÃ§-l√¨ng; February 12, 1823 - May 13, 1852) was the first Methodist missionary to China.  Life  On February 12, 1823, Judson Dwight Collins was born into a Methodist family in Rose, Wayne County, New York. His parents, Alpheus and Betsay Collins, were of English and German origin. After graduation from the first class of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1845, Collins served as an instructor for two years at the Wesleyan Seminary at Albion College, teaching courses in Latin, Greek, chemistry, botany, and rhetoric. left In 1847, Collins was called to New York, where he was ordained an elder and commissioned along with M. C. White and his wife to China. They sailed from Boston on April 15 and reached Foochow on September 6. To start an opening for the missionary work, Collins set up a school for boys in 1847 and another in 1848. He also worked with M. C. White on Bible translation and distribution of tracts. In 1850, he was appointed superintendent of the Foochow Mission. Collins' short tenure in China was fraught with impediments and obstacles, including the strong Chinese xenophobia, the formidable language barrier, the poor sanitation and bad living conditions, and finally an illness that compelled him to return home to Michigan in 1851. He never regained his health afterwards, and at just 29 years of age, he died at his parents' home at Gregory, Lyndon Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan, where he is buried, May 1852, leaving no children.

The stated primary purpose of these inspection stations is to deter illegal immigration and smuggling activities. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, they took on the additional role of terrorism deterrence. These checkpoints are located between of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border along major U.S. highways; near the southern border of the contiguous United States. Their situation at interior locations allow them to deter illegal activities that may have bypassed official border crossings along the frontier. The checkpoints are divided among nine Border Patrol sectors. There are a number of these checkpoints near the northern border of the contiguous U.S. as well (such as in the states of New York or Maine), within of the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border.  Role of checkpoints  The checkpoints are described as \\"the third layer in the Border Patrol's three-layer strategy\\", following \\"line watch\\" and \\"roving patrol\\" operations near the border. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, > Border Patrol agents at checkpoints have legal authority that agents do not > have when patrolling areas away from the border.

Under US law, people who enter the US without inspection (EWI) can be subjected to expedited removal if they are found within 100 miles of the border.8 USC 1357(a)(3) This power has been subject to heavy criticism by the American Civil Liberties Union. Documentation at checkpoint No documentation is required at a Border Patrol checkpoint for US citizens; however, lawful permanent residents (LPRs) are required to carry their registration cards (green cards) \\"at all times\\" according to federal law.8 USC 1304(e) People in a non-immigrant status should carry proper documentation. There has been heavy criticism of Border Patrol for arresting people in a non- immigrant status at checkpoints (especially in New York), even though the aliens are lawfully present.

This may list other checkpoints. Tactical checkpoints In fiscal year 2008 thirty-nine tactical checkpoints were in operation. Tactical checkpoints lack permanent buildings, and \\"support permanent checkpoints by monitoring and inspecting traffic on secondary roads that the Border Patrol determined are likely to be used by individuals in the country illegally or smugglers to evade apprehension at permanent checkpoints\\". A tactical checkpoint might consist of vehicles, traffic cones, signs, a portable water supply, a cage for canines (if deployed), and portable rest facilities. Due to Congressional restrictions against the funding of permanent checkpoints in the Tucson sector, all of its checkpoints are tactical checkpoints. These were required to relocate every seven days, amended to every 14 days in 2005. Due to the need for road shoulder space and restrictions on placing checkpoints near curves, the number of sites is limited, and the relocation in practice means that checkpoints are periodically shut down. In 2005, the median tactical checkpoint nationally was active for 2 hours daily, as opposed to over 23 hours daily for permanent checkpoints; however the Tucson sector's checkpoint on Highway 19 was active 22 hours daily. A draft plan for the I-19 checkpoint in 2009 proposed to model it on the largest previous permanent checkpoint, the I-35 checkpoint north of Laredo, Texas, but would surpass it in size (18 acres) and inspection lanes (8 primary, 7 secondary). A number of community concerns were addressed, such as placement of canopies for dark sky restrictions for a local observatory, off- highway location, rumble strips, signage, and mitigation of traffic congestion. A community recommendation to \\"seek to mitigate noise\\" was to be \\"researched and considered\\". Effectiveness and criticisms  Benefits  The fairly comprehensive and aforementioned GAO report entitled BORDER PATROL assigns mixed success to border checkpoints. Positive results include the apprehension of nearly 17,000 people in the country illegally at interior checkpoints in 2008. The report further states that, \\"More than 705,000 total Border Patrol apprehensions [occurred] along the southwest border in fiscal year 2008.\\" The Border Patrol also \\"encountered 530 aliens from special interest countries, which are countries the Department of State has determined to represent a potential terrorist threat to the United States.\\" There were also over 3,500 drug seizures at all southwest border checkpoints combined in 2008. Changes in 2008 Staffing levels were substantially increased in 2008. The Laredo sector, for instance, increased its number of agents from 1200 in 2007 to approximately 1636 in 2008. Upgraded infrastructure and technology increased deterrence and detection capability in the Laredo sector. Additions include cameras, license plate readers, and vehicle and cargo inspection systems (VACIS). Laredo also implemented a prosecution initiative in 2008. Named Operation Streamline, the goal was \\"to prosecute and remove all violators charged with illegal entry in target areas in the sector\\".  Shortcomings  A shortcoming cited by the same GAO report were the inaccuracies represented by the report's title. The report states, \\"Our analysis showed that the actual checkpoint performance results were incorrectly reported for two of the three measures in fiscal year 2007 and for one measure in fiscal year 2008. As a result, the Border Patrol incorrectly reported that it met its checkpoint performance targets for these two measures.\\" An analysis of the aforementioned GAO report criticized Border Patrol for its ineffective non-border checkpoints vs. actual border crossings. It stated, \\"There were 704,000 interdictions at actual border crossings in 2008; however, there were only 17,000 interdictions at internal non-border checkpoints. This 17,000 figure represents 2.4% of interdictions, but it took 4% of agents to accomplish this goal.\\" The analysis further states regarding the Tucson sector that, \\"Actual border interdictions numbered 320,000, but internal non-border checkpoint interdictions numbered 1,800. This means the number of interdictions per agent at the actual border was 116, but the number of interdictions per agent at internal non-border checkpoints was only 8.\\" The analysis finally questions why the stated goal of DHS \\"is to detect and apprehend 30% of major illegal activity [at the border].\\" It asked why 70% of illegal activity is conceded at the actual border.\\"U.S. Internal Checkpoints a Failure\\", Libertarian Party of Hawaii, Honolulu, April 2012. Some residents of Arivaca, Arizona, have stated they are regularly subjected to harassment, delays, searches, and racial profiling at the internal checkpoint near their community. They questioned the effectiveness of the checkpoint, and began monitoring it in 2014 to determine its effectiveness.  Constitutionality  Internal checkpoints have also been criticized for violating the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits \\"unreasonable searches and seizures\\", although United States v. Martinez-Fuerte has affirmed their constitutionality. The U.S. Border Patrol has stated: \\"Although motorists are not legally required to answer the questions 'Are you a U.S. citizen, and where are you headed?' they will not be allowed to proceed until the inspecting agent is satisfied that the occupants of vehicles traveling through the checkpoint are legally present in the U.S.\\"  See also  * Michigan Department of State Police v.

Early life In 1911, Stover married Clara Mae Lewis, whom he had met at the Iowa City Academy, and they moved to a farm in Saskatchewan, Canada, which they received as a wedding gift. On the farm, they raised wheat and flax but after a year, they considered the venture to have been a failure and, in 1912, they moved to Winnipeg. Stover then entered the candy industry. He first went to work for a Minnesota candy company and then for the A. G. Morris Candy Company in Chicago. In 1918, the couple moved to Des Moines, where Stover worked for the Irwin Candy Company, and then they moved to Omaha, Nebraska. Eskimo Pie On July 31, 1921, Christian Nelson of Onawa, Iowa, pitched the concept of mass-producing a chocolate-covered ice cream treat called the I-Scream Bar to Russell Stover. Seven companies had previously rejected the idea because the confection easily melted away. Stover went into partnership with Nelson, and their agreement was signed on the letterhead of the Graham Ice Cream Company of Omaha.http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/images/d8553-6.jpg Stover renamed the I-Scream Bar to Eskimo Pie and took out the stick to make it a sandwich. Stover has also been credited, through his knowledge of chemistry, with devising the formula for the chocolate shell that hardens on exposure to cold and holds the ice cream contents within. Nelson patented the confection on January 24, 1922. The Eskimo Pie immediately became so successful, the factory could not keep up with demand and the company licensed the formula to 1,500 manufacturers in exchange for a royalty of one cent per dozen sold. The treat was marketed under the brand of Russell Stover Company and, in April 1922, The New York Times stated that the partners had received US$30,000 a week in royalties in the first year. Following the success of the Eskimo Pie, competing manufacturers soon came up with similar, but different, processes for making frozen ice cream pies, and at one point Stover and Nelson were paying $4,000 per day in legal fees to defend their patent, a battle which they ultimately lost. Russell Stover Candies In 1923, Russell Stover sold his share of the Eskimo Pie company for $25,000 and moved to Denver, Colorado, where he and his wife started a new company, Mrs. Stover's Bungalow Candies, which operated out of Clara Stover's kitchen in their bungalow, making boxed chocolates. In 1925, the couple opened a candy factory in Denver and another one in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1931, the company moved its headquarters to Kansas City. During the 1940s, the name of the company was officially changed to Russell Stover Candies. When Russell Stover died in 1954, five days after his 66th birthday, the company that bore his name was producing 11 million pounds of candy annually and selling its products through 40 Russell Stover shops and in about 2,000 department stores. Clara Stover operated the company until 1960, when it was sold to Louis Ward for $7.5 million. At the time of the purchase, Mr. Ward owned a box company that had Russell Stover Candies as an important customer. The Ward family owned the brand until July 14, 2014, when the Swiss chocolate-maker Lindt bought Russell Stover Candies. At the time of the sale, Lindt reported the revenue of Russell Stover Candies at $500 million.

Biography Born in Porto Alegre, to a family of German immigrants, he began his artistic career as an amateur, helped by his brother In√°cio, who was a lithographer, and possibly also by the painter Delfim da C√¢mara. In 1878 he moved to Germany in order to study in the Grossherrzoglisch Badische Kunstschule, in Karlsruhe. There he became a pupil of Ferdinand Keller, Theodor Poeckh and Ernst Hildebrand. In 1880 Keller moved to Berlin, being followed by Weing√§rtner, who then enrolled in the local Academy. In 1882 he left Germany for France, studying in the Acad√©mie Julian under Tony Robert-FleuryBenezit dictionary of Artist and William-Adolphe Bouguereau.sites.google.com Wrecked by financial issues, he thought of abandoning his studies, but such situation was reverted by supportive friends, including Baron of Itajub√°, who got for him a special scholarship from Emperor Pedro II upon Bouguereau's advice. Then he could further his education in Rome. Thereafter for many years he divided his time between Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Rome, traveling very often and being celebrated as one of the most important Brazilian painters of his generation. In Rio Grande do Sul he was a star. In 1920 he was back in Porto Alegre, where the remained until death. His fame declined from 1925 on, facing competition from new painters and changing tastes in local art. He devoted all his efforts to a half-Realist half-Romantic approach to Academicism even while such styles were already being severely challenged by Modern tendencies.

It aired on February 2, 2009. Plot House and the team take on the case of a woman called Dana Miller who collapsed in the middle of a cooking class. When they learn that Dana gave up her career as a highly renowned cancer researcher in order to pursue her own personal happiness, the members of the team question their own happiness (or lack thereof). Dana's belly fills with blood, which turns out to be from her liver. She also develops an itch on her temple. She scratches it even in her sleep. She's scratched through her skull and brain matter starts to ooze out of it. She also starts experiencing spinal shocks. A scan reveals masses in her lungs, spine and pericardium. Later, her heart also stops and she bleeds into her pericardium. They relieve the blood from her heart, but she bleeds out of her nose, mouth, ears and eyes. While talking to Cuddy, House realizes Dana is menstruating as well as bleeding out, indicating that it's not a coincidence. He proposes that during the surgery for her myoma, endometrial cells were dispersed into the bloodstream. These cells attached to various organs, multiplied, and after reaching a critical mass, began bleeding during her menstruation. The team successfully treats Dana's endometriosis by cutting out the small masses of endometrium. Cuddy retaliates against House for making Cameron quit as Dean of Medicine and therefore making Cuddy have to leave Rachel to work. She gives him a taste of his own medicine, among other things, she steals his cane. Wilson talks to Cuddy and convinces her to stop and she returns his cane as a gesture of peace. Meanwhile, Thirteen begins to suffer serious and life-threatening reactions to her experimental Huntington's Disease clinical drug trial, becoming blind due to a brain tumor. House and Foreman successfully treat her with radiation, getting rid of the brain tumor, but Foreman faces a moral crisis of whether or not he should inform the drug company and risk losing his medical license. At the end of the episode, Foreman reveals to the clinical trial heads his tampering with trial data. The group does not suspend his medical license; he is simply forbidden from other clinical trials. The closing montage shows Taub and his wife discussing children amicably, Foreman and Thirteen in bed happily, and Wilson washing a cup with Amber's lipstick print, indicating his willingness to move on.

The company continued to create new products and techniques; in 1928, it introduced the reform kitchen, a significant innovation in the industry, and in 1930, it created the 'ten-layer polished lacquer technique'. In 1950, Poggenpohl was again an industry forerunner, as it launched the first unit kitchen, which has become the kitchen industry standard. These kitchens, created in response to what Poggenpohl saw as a desire for the modern in its customer base, offered a continuous counter-top workspace and wall units that matched.Freeman, 46.

It was an Argentine- American co-production shot on location in Argentina. Plot In 1938, Englishwoman Mary Mulligan (Julie Christie) arrives at the lavish estate of a wealthy Argentine family living outside of Buenos Aires. \\"Miss Mary\\" serves as the family's governess over the course of the next several years. As the primary caretaker of the family's three children, Mary teaches them English and oversees their childhood and adolescent development, at times both nurturing and disciplining them. As they move into their teenage years, the children mature, exploring sexuality and their place in society. Meanwhile, the aristocratic world around them is falling apart. The adults converse about Argentine politics, hinting at the impending arrival of Juan Per√≥n on the political scene, which will signal an abrupt end to their lifestyle. Compounding the problem is the state of the family itself: the patriarch, Alfredo (Eduardo Pavlovsky), becomes physically intimate with another woman. Enraged, his wife, Mecha, (Nacha Guevara) shoots a pistol blindly into the parlor where the affair is unfolding, and although the bullets cause no injury, the children are greatly disturbed. Mecha slowly deteriorates mentally and emotionally and grows stoically detached in the presence of her family. A few years down the road, Teresa, the youngest daughter in the family, proudly announces to her older sister, Carolina, that she has lost her virginity. Johnny, their older brother, has a sexual encounter with a woman more than twice his age. Confused by the experience, he rushes home despite a thunderstorm and confronts Mary in her bedroom. After a brief moment of awkwardness, they embrace and spend the night together, capping off a long, vaguely-defined relationship that has displayed both maternal and romantic tendencies. As Johnny sneaks back half-nakedly to his room in the early morning, his mother happens to see him stumble down the hallway. Immediately aware that Miss Mary has gone too far, she relays the information to her indifferent husband before returning to find Mary already packing up her things. She formally dismisses Mary, just as Mary reports that she is planning to leave the family anyway. Later, Teresa is shown preparing for her wedding, which she expresses doubts about following through with. Motivated by her support for her sister and her contempt for the shallow world in which she lives, Carolina announces her intentions to boycott the wedding. Mary is present at the wedding, and she slips Johnny a note as he walks down the aisle in a procession of the bride's family. Shortly thereafter, Mary converses with Johnny, ultimately revealing that she plans to return to England now that World War II has ended. She boards a cruise liner and departs.

Pollution is defined as the addition of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or any form of energy (such as heat, sound, or radioactivity) to the environment at a faster rate than it can be dispersed, diluted, decomposed, recycled, or stored in some harmless form. The combination of three main factors are the cause of notable unhealthy levels of air pollution in California: the activities of over 39 million people, a mountainous terrain that traps pollution, and a warm climate that helps form ozone and other pollutants. Eight of the ten cities in the US with the highest year-round concentration of particulate matter between 2013 and 2015 were in California, and seven out of the ten cities in the US with the worst ozone pollution were also in California.Schlanger, Zoe. \\"California is home to eight of the 10 cities in America where air pollution is worst.\\" Quartz Media 19 Apr. 2017 Studies show that pollutants prevalent in California are linked to several health issues, including asthma, lung cancer, birth complications, and premature death. In 2016, Bakersfield, California recorded the highest level of airborne pollutants of any city in the United States. Water pollution is defined by the Federal Clean Water Act as \\"dredge spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage, garbage, sewage sludge, munitions, chemical wastes, biological materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt, and industrial, municipal, and agricultural waste discharged into water.\\"Water, article by Arnold S. Vernick, in Mark‚Äôs Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 11th Edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 2007. In 2011, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study showed that water quality standards were not met on 1.6 million acres of California's 3 million acres of lakes, bays, wetlands and estuaries. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act governs the water quality regulation in California. History The history of California's pollution dates back to 1943, when people first recognized episodes of smog causing irritated eyes, burning lungs, and nausea, and led people to walk the city's streets wearing masks to shield the thick air. Beginning in 1967, a group of California politicians and leaders teamed up to unify statewide efforts to address the severe air pollution, creating The Mulford-Carrell Air Resources Act, which formed the California Air Resources Board (CARB). That same year, the Federal Air Quality Act of 1967 was enacted, which allowed California to set more stringent air quality rules due to its unique conditions of geography, weather, and growing population.California Air Resources Board. Retrieved 05 March 2018 from https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/about/history Despite dramatic progress, air pollution in the United States, and California in particular, continues to harm people's health and environment. Under the Clean Air Act (United States) of 1970, the EPA works with state and local governments and federal agencies to reduce air pollution and limit the damage that it causes. The Act was amended in 1977 and 1990, establishing emission standards that require the maximum degree of reduction of hazardous air pollutants. The CARB continues to work with local governments, the business sector, and the public to address California's air quality problems. In the past decade, California has become a global leader on climate change by entering agreements with several nations and linking cap- and-trade programs with Quebec. Many programs have been established to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including a Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which is planned to clean up the transportation sector and add about 1.5 million hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to the roads by 2025. The cap-and-trade program has allowed billions of dollars to be invested in reducing greenhouse gases in cities throughout California. While California has taken significant action to decrease pollution, the state remains behind the rest of the nation. The ever- growing population, abundance of cars, and sunny weather continue to foster a pollution friendly environment.  Air pollution  Looking down from the Hollywood Hills, with Griffith Observatory on the hill in the foreground, air pollution is visible in downtown Los Angeles on a late afternoon. According to the American Lung Association's recent \\"State of the Air 2017\\" report, California is a leader in air pollution among other states, with the highest ozone levels. The top three cities in the country with the highest recorded levels of ozone (smog) levels were Los Angeles-Long Beach, Bakersfield, and Fresno-Madera. Salinas, California is the only city of California that reports no days of unhealthy air quality. While the air quality in California is significantly better in northern California, more than ninety percent of Californians live in counties with unhealthy air.  Los Angeles air pollution  A graph of the top ten most polluted cities in the US Although Los Angeles remains the city with the worst ozone pollution, the state of air pollution has been improving. With a population of roughly over 10 million, the Los Angeles area is a large basin with the Pacific Ocean to the west, and several mountain ranges with 11,000-foot peaks to the east and south, Los Angeles is particularly susceptible to high ozone levels. Diesel engines, ports, motor vehicles, and industries are main sources of air pollution in Los Angeles. Frequent sunny days and low rainfall contribute to ozone formation, as well as high levels of fine particles and dust. The strong relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and ozone levels may be found on air pollution maps. Smog is formed when smoke and fog combine, and when primary pollutants, usually emitted from vehicles, react with ultraviolet rays to create secondary pollutants. When these primary and secondary pollutants combine, it creates the thick haze that can be seen hovering over the city. While ozone can protect the environment from powerful ultraviolet rays, an overabundance of this ozone can be extremely harmful to the health of people and wildlife. As the city rests in a basin between mountains and an inward-sweeping wind from the Pacific Ocean, the ozone, smog, and other toxic particles stagnate in the middle of the Los Angeles Atmosphere with nowhere to escape. Stagnate atmospheric conditions are fairly typical for Los Angeles atmosphere due to frequent atmospheric inversion (that holds multiple pollutants within over the city in the form of \\"pollution dome\\"). The effect of \\"pollution dome\\" leads to enhanced concentration of greenhouse gases as well such as methane and carbon dioxide as well. Researchers have shown that carbon dioxide enhancement in the \\"dome\\" over Los Angeles is one of the strongest in the world and it is easily detectable from the satellite observations. Air pollution in Los Angeles has caused widespread concerns. In 2011, the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) Survey on Californians and the Environment showed that 45% of citizens in Los Angeles consider air pollution to be a ‚Äúbig problem‚Äù, and 47% believe that the air quality of Los Angeles is worse than it was 10 years ago. The most recent PPIC Survey of 2018 showed that the strong majority of California adults (72%) and likely voters favor the new state law mandating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and 56% of adults support the state's cap-and-trade program. In addition, about half of Californians believe state climate policies will lead to more jobs, while the other half expects the price of gasoline to rise.Baldassare, M., Bonner, D., Lopes, L., Kordus, D., \\"PPIC Statewide Survey: Californians and the Environment.\\" (July 2017). retrieved from http://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and- the-environment-july-2017/ In 2013, the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Riverside area ranked as the 1st most ozone-polluted city, the 4th most polluted city by annual particle pollution, and the 4th most polluted city by 24-hour particle pollution. Bay Area air pollution While Los Angeles is by far the leading polluter in the nation, many of the cities in the greater Bay Area often find themselves in the top ten of several pollution charts. Los Angeles's geographical constraints and sprawling layout can be assigned partial blame for their unique pollution circumstances, but the Bay Area is an enormous cluster of large cities that collectively contribute to their own pollution problem. In the State of the Air report, published by the American Lung Association, three of the nine Bay Area counties were listed as receiving failing grades on their pollution scores, namely Alameda, Contra Costa, and Santa Clara. Furthermore, while short-term and year-round particle pollution appeared to slightly improve, ozone levels were made worse from 2014-2016. For short-term particle pollution, San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland ranked sixth in the nation, and the entire Bay Area placed 13th in ozone pollution, which experts say is due to several factors, especially climate change, wildfires, and emissions. The wildfire pollutants are particularly dangerous to the public, as these particles are usually invisible and can have detrimental effects on one's health. When considering the pollution levels in the Bay Area and in most of the Southern half of the state, California has several polluted sites that require the close attention of scientists. Pollution as an externality In economics, an externality occurs when the producer does not have to pay its full cost, and when it affects another party either positively or negatively. If the cost to society is greater than the cost the consumer is paying for it, then the externality is negative because it imposes this extra cost on society, which can lead to market inefficiencies. Solving the problem of negative externalities can be costly on its own, as it is often difficult to assign responsibility. Typically, the party who owns the property rights to the polluted area is responsible for paying the cost, but alternative strategies include taxing the producer or collecting payments from a determined group of individuals. Pollution is one of the most common forms of negative externalities present in the world economy, and this is especially true of California, which suffers from the worst pollution levels in the country. It can also arrive in many forms, such as air pollution, water pollution, farming pollution, and noise pollution. With sprawling and heavily populated cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, the state produces notable shares of every type of pollution. The negative externalities incurred from pollution are numerous, as its broad nature has the capacity to affect masses of people at once. While the health costs are the most obvious, the following sections provide more insight into the negative externalities suffered by the California public. Air pollution in California is a negative externality which arises from the combustion of fossil fuels or other forms of greenhouse gas emissions. As the graphs shows, the effects of this negative externality is a deadweight welfare loss (DWL) that results when the marginal benefit does not equal the marginal cost. There have been studies conducted that point to the possibility of fertilized land being the cause of the vast amounts of smog in suburban areas. Nitrogen, which is present in soil, leaks into the air creating nitrogen oxide in which is a main component of smog. This amount of NOx that is leaked into the air can cause the majority of health issues that are observed in California (Stolark, 2018). These health conditions were described in the introduction and can be detrimental to children and the elderly. Image A below, shows the drastic difference of the amount of nitrogen that is expelled into the air due to fertilizer. Mogenson states that 4% of the states nitrogen oxide emissions come from soil on agricultural land even though there is not any agricultural land near the hotspots of California's smog studies such as Sacramento and Los Angeles (2018). The problem lies when deciding how to combat the amount of nitrogen that is expelled from soil, when agricultural growth like fruits and vegetables are a main source of the currency California has.  Dangers to health  Both ozone and particle pollution are dangerous to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) engaged a panel of expert scientists, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, to help them assess the evidence. The EPA released their most recent review of the current research on health threat of ozone and particle pollution.American Lung Association, Ozone Pollution, 2013. http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/health- risks/health-risks-ozone.html#_edn23American Lung Association, Particle Pollution, 2013. http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/health-risks/health-risks- particle.html#ref64 EPA Concludes Ozone Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats: * Causes respiratory harm (e.g. worsened asthma, worsened COPD, inflammation) * Likely to cause early death (both short-term and long-term exposure) * Likely to cause cardiovascular harm (e.g. heart attacks, strokes, heart disease, congestive heart failure) * May cause harm to the central nervous system * May cause reproductive and developmental harm EPA Concludes Fine Particle Pollution Poses Serious Health Threats: * Causes early death (both short-term and long-term exposure) * Causes cardiovascular harm (e.g. heart attacks, strokes, heart disease, congestive heart failure) * Likely to cause respiratory harm (e.g. worsened asthma, worsened COPD, inflammation) * May cause cancer * May cause reproductive and developmental harm  Government intervention  Helping California meet the national air quality standards and improve the health of local residents continues to be a priority for the EPA. One of EPA's highest priorities is to support the reduction of diesel emissions from ships, trucks, locomotives, and other diesel engines. In 2005, Congress authorized funding for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA), a grant program, administrated by the EPA, to selectively retrofit or replace the older diesel engines most likely to impact human health. Since 2008, the DERA program has achieved impressive outcome of improving air quality.U.S. EPA., 2012. http://epa.gov/cleandiesel/documents/420r12031.pdf The EPA also works with state and local partners to decrease emissions from port operations and to improve the efficient transportation of goods through the region. Together with the Port of Long Beach the EPA and the Port of Los Angeles are partners of the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, a sweeping plan aimed at significantly reducing the health risks posed by air pollution from port-related ships, trains, trucks, terminal equipment and harbor craft. These two ports are the busiest container ports in the United States. For environmental justice, air pollution in low-income LA communities has received more attention. In 2011, the ‚ÄúClean up Green up‚Äù campaign was launched to designate four low-income LA communities- Pacoima, Boyle Heights and Wilmington. This campaign aims to push green industries through incentives, including help obtaining permits and tax and utility rebates.L. A. Times, Jan 21, 2012 http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/21/local/la-me- hazards-pacoima-20110121 Although Los Angeles air pollution level has declined for the last few decades, citizens in Los Angeles still suffer from high level air pollution. Tailpipe pollution With the modern world and the industrial expansion of gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, tailpipe emissions continue to be vital contributors to air pollution. Each vehicle that has the capability of burning fossil fuels emits some sort of harmful substances, or exhaust gases, into the air every minute that they are running. Three of the most common gasses produced by vehicles include hydrocarbons, carbon monoxides and nitrogen oxides. However different in some ways, the formation of these gases within the engine all adhere to a single basic factor which happens to be the combustion of fuel and air. Combustion in no case is ever a perfect chemical reaction. In every combustion process there is either extra fuel or not enough fuel; therefore, creating and emitting unwanted gases. Firstly, there is hydrocarbons which is the most common and a very abundant pollutant of vehicles. Hydrocarbons are the products of fuel that have not burnt through the process of combustion. In some cases of combustion, fuel remains a raw vapor as it exits the tailpipe of the vehicle. These particles of raw gasoline vapor, or hydrocarbons, go through the entirety of the combustion process without taking part in the process and manages to escape into the air we breathe. Along with raw fuel, there are other factors to vehicles emitting hydrocarbons as well. For example, in a vehicle, the fuel system is pressurized. This is because gasoline is highly volatile and any small leak can mean that the gas vapors, or hydrocarbons, will escape into the air. These small leaks can be anywhere within the entire \\"Evaporative Emission Control System,\\" or the system that houses and delivers the fuel to the engine. Any cracks in fuel lines or ventilation hoses along with even worn or loose gas caps will cause raw gasoline particle to escape into the air, polluting it with hydrocarbons. There is also the issue of the combustion taking place with a concentration that is too fuel rich. In this case, we find that there is the formation of carbon monoxides. Carbon monoxide is formed in the combustion process when there is the combustion of fuel with insufficient amounts of oxygen, preventing the formation of the normal carbon dioxide and therefore ends up forming carbon monoxide molecules, which can possibly be fatal to humans. Another harmful substance that results from the combustion process is nitrogen oxide. Nitrogen oxide is formed not as a deformity, but rather is a result of the different compositions of air. Air is composed of two main elements: nitrogen and oxygen. Therefore, as the engine intakes the surround atmospheric air for the combustion process, nitrogen happens to be one of the elements being sucked in. In the cases of regular ambient temperatures, the two gases nitrogen and oxygen are not chemically reactive with each other, yet when they are together inside the cylinder of an engine while combustion processes are occurring, they become reactive. These high temperatures inside the cylinders cause the nitrogen and oxygen atoms to bond creating the substance nitrogen oxide which is then emitted into the air through the tailpipe of the vehicle. = Effects of tailpipe emissions = On average, each vehicle emits about 250 pounds of carbon monoxides, 18.32 pounds of nitrogen oxides, 29 pounds of hydro-carbons and 9,737 pounds of carbon dioxide every year. These gases emitted by vehicles are harmful to humans both directly and indirectly. The biggest and most widely known issue caused by vehicles is due to the carbon dioxide they produce. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas because they ascend into the atmosphere and act as a blanket within our atmosphere causing the \\"Greenhouse effect\\". The \\"Greenhouse Effect\\" is a global phenomenon that is causing rises and temperatures and sea level. While the carbon dioxide continues to trap heat inside the atmosphere. With the rise of carbon dioxide gases in our atmosphere worldwide, transportation poses as one of the highest contributors to air pollution. According to the EPA, transportation produces around 29% of the Greenhouse Gas emissions worldwide. Tailpipe emissions also pose a more direct harm to humans. The majority of the gases being emitted by the tailpipe of a vehicle can lead to numerous complications and health issues. Excess ingestion of any of the gases will sever oxygen delivery to ones organs, and can lead to serious issues such as breathing and heart problems. Mass intakes of these gases will begin damaging organs within a human body immediately, disabling a persons breathing capability. High doses of these gases can also contribute to heightened levels of allergic reactions, irritations, bronchitis and even pneumonia. Yet, even if large amounts of these gases are not ingested at once, small doses of these gases can lead to numerous long term detriments as well. Continuous small doses of these gases can lead to the deterioration of one's lungs and even contribute to future heart diseases. = Emissions regulatory efforts in California = In response to the emissions effects, California has taken the initiative to put in place multiple programs and organizations to help regulate tailpipe emissions from vehicles. Two of the largest governmental organizations instituted in California to reduce emissions effects include: California's Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Bureau of Automotive Repair (BAR). Each of these organizations take continuous efforts to revise the laws to ensure that vehicles that are being driven on the streets are not over polluting the environment that we live in. CARB and BAR cooperatively instate multiple regulations pertaining to the emissions components on cars which are California specific. Due to these efforts, California is widely known as one of the most regulated states when adhering to tailpipe emissions. In order to legally operate a vehicle in California, most vehicles must be CARB compliant as well as pass the biennial smog test. The Smog Check program is one that has been instituted in most of the states throughout the United States, however, in California, the program proves to be one of the most stringent tests. The test is not stringent due to the nature of the testing procedure, but rather the emissions cut-points and defining of legal parts that California enforces. California goes about implementing different smog guidelines for different vehicle model years. For instance, according to the DMV website, vehicles of the model year 1975 and older are all smog exempt and do not need to go through the process of getting a smog inspection in California. It may be true that these older cars in actuality emit more pollutants than its newer counterparts, but from a cost effectiveness standpoint there simply aren't enough cars that are 1975 and older to implement smog tests on these vehicles. On the other hand, however, vehicles ranging from 1976 to 1996 have a multi-part smog inspection which needs to be completed once every two years. This test consists of the following: tailpipe emissions test, a visual inspection, an evaporative emissions system pressure test and a check to ensure ignition timing (on applicable vehicles). Each one of these components of the test are essential to keep a vehicle from over-polluting into the environment. The evaporative emissions system test, for example, would determine that the system is pressure tested and secured with no leaks so that excess hydrocarbons are not being emitted into the atmosphere. While on the other hand, the tailpipe emissions test directly measures the amount of pollutants that the vehicle emits. The State of California has set rigorous tailpipe emissions cut points for each vehicle that then determines whether it will pass or fail the emissions test. These cut-points are set for the amounts of hydrocarbons, carbon-monoxides, nitrogen oxides and percent carbon dioxide that a vehicle is permitted to emit before it is considered to be over-polluting. The Bureau of Automotive Repair and California's Air Resources Board conducts multiple tests throughout the year to gather enough sample data to set reasonable values for the cut-points for each vehicle within California. In doing so, the state's two main concerns are to limit air pollution, and prevent excess consumer failure rates. Therefore, through their roadside smog tests and emissions surveys California manages to maintain cut-points that reflect reasonable values. Another major factor within the smog check program is the visual test. The visual test is important, especially in California because it ensures that vehicle emissions components are not damaged or tampered with. BAR and CARB have continuously implemented strict aftermarket or tampered parts guidelines specific to each vehicle make and model. Every vehicle registered in California must be equipped with either original equipment from the manufacturer or if it does contain any aftermarket emissions-related parts it must have an executive order approved by CARB. These executive orders ensure that the aftermarket part that is being installed on the vehicle will not increase the emissions of the vehicle. CARB has an extensive database of the parts that are legal to use within California and any vehicle equipped with these parts must also be equipped with a sticker or badge that indicates the executive order number of the part. Most states will allow a vehicle to pass its smog inspection even when equipped with non-CARB approved parts installed on the vehicle, as long as the vehicle is still functioning properly. In terms of proper functionality, these states examine the vehicle check engine light and in some cases conduct a two-speed idle test in which vehicle emissions are examined at a standstill state of the vehicle. However, in California even if the vehicle is so-called \\"functioning properly\\" it will not pass smog if any emissions components are not equipped with an executive order number. The state of California enforces this because the state's set emissions cut-points are held at much higher standards than most other states. Therefore, if a part is not CARB approved there is a high chance that it leads to more than ideal emissions particles being emitted by the vehicle. By adhering to CARB legal parts, consumers are helping reduce the pollution effects of their vehicles on the Earth. = Reformation efforts = Despite the state's efforts to reduce air pollution, tailpipe pollution continued to increase as of January 2019, increasing 5% since 2013. The government of California has set a target goal of 5 million electric vehicles by 2030, but even if California is successful in meeting this goal, they won't meet their carbon reduction goal without at least a 25% reduction in per capita miles travels. Because of the layout of California's sprawling cities, the state is not well suited for public transportation and this continues to affect California's ability to meet its targets for carbon reduction. Greenhouse gas emissions are a grave danger to Californians, as the presence of these pollutants is already felt throughout the state and is difficult to combat due to the massive number of cars being driven daily. As mentioned, Los Angeles is especially vulnerable to this issue because commute by vehicle is the principal form of transportation in the city, so the emissions from cars will only continue to fill the thick, stagnant air until better solutions are implemented. As of now, two of these goals are to reduce emissions by 40% by the year 2030, and to continue searching for renewable resources, such as electricity. While ambitious, these goals are working toward a crucial goal: reduce emissions by removing a portion of the source of the problem.  Air pollution and low socioeconomic status communities in California  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's interactive online map - EJSCREEN - features the low socioeconomic communities across the country that are more vulnerable to air pollution and its associated health risks. As exhibited in this map, Southeast Los Angeles County neighborhoods, primarily impoverished areas in the San Joaquin Valley and Inland Empire, face a higher exposure to air pollution and environmental injustices. In such areas, those in poverty-stricken areas have unequal access to environmental health and safety resources. These poverty-stricken neighborhoods are frequently located in areas that are near freeways, hazardous facilities, and/or rail yards.  Instances of environmental injustice  = Diabetes in Los Angeles County Latino children = In 2017, researchers found that diabetes in Latino and Latina children living in Los Angeles is linked to air quality. A study led by the University of Southern California was the first of its kind to follow the health and residential air pollution levels of the same children over a span of several years. The subjects of the study were overweight Latino children, between the ages of eight and fifteen, residing in areas with excess particulate matter. In particular, the neighborhoods of the children were located in areas of elevated nitrogen dioxide levels, an air pollutant caused nearby power plants and high-volume vehicle traffic. The results demonstrated that the children possessed significantly increased risk factors for Type 2 diabetes by the time they turned eighteen, such as diminished efficiency in the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. The insulin resistance that results from such a condition is a direct cause of diabetes onset. Diabetes mellitus is a disease that is characterized by the body's inability to properly regulate blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. Prolonged levels of high blood sugar may lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure, blindness, or even early death. As diabetes becomes a rising epidemic, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to nearly 8 million U.S. citizens may have undiagnosed diabetes or its precursor. Conventional medical findings suggest that unhealthy or calorie-dense diets, lack of physical activity, and family history are risk factors for developing the disease; however, recent studies are beginning to trace a connection between Type 2 diabetes and the external factor of air pollution. Because socioeconomic status, race, and exposure to air pollution are frequently correlated, the CDC acknowledges certain socioeconomic conditions or races as pre-existing risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, in addition to those previously listed. Statistics suggest that Hispanic people are 50% more likely to die from diabetes than whites, and studies focusing on issues of environmental injustice are able to demonstrate possible reasons for this disparity. = Proximity of schools to vehicle traffic in Culver City = The spatial arrangement of Californian communities plays a large role in determining exposure to the concentrated air pollution of the state's southern regions. In one suburb of Los Angeles, El Marino Language School sits adjacent to the ten- lane Interstate 405. Students of schools like these, often elementary-aged, are subject to dramatically increased levels of pollution from automobile emissions, including carcinogenic compounds. Health effects of traffic pollution include the onset of cardiovascular disease, asthma, impaired lung function, premature death, and a plethora of other complications. Furthermore, the incomplete development of children's sensitive respiratory systems leads to compounded effects of air pollution when compared with the health effects of the same pollution on adults. Though the health consequences of vehicle pollution are widely recognized and some legislation has been enacted to reduce its impact, very little tangible action has actually been taken. In 2003, California passed Senate Bill No. 352, which banned the construction of new schools within 500 feet of freeways with certain exceptions. However, the bill remained largely ignored as 1 in 5 schools opened between 2014 and 2015 were still in direct violation of the ban. In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report titled \\"Best Practices for Reducing Near- Road Pollution Exposure at Schools\\", available both online and in-print. However, without any requirements regarding school siting from the U.S. Department of Education, state-funded schools are under no obligation to follow its guidelines. The reluctance of public schools to comply with safety regulations often stems from monetary limitations that encourage the use of cheap land, a dilemma that disproportionately impacts children of poorer areas; the report noted that minority and low-income students have a higher prevalence of attendance in public schools of urban areas, such as the big cities in which busy roads and schools share territory. = Fracking violations in Kern County school zones = Oil fracking is a process that involves a high-pressure injection of fluid into the ground to extract oil. The adverse environmental effects of this oil and natural gas extraction are the subject of much controversy, the primary concerns of which surround the contamination of surrounding water and air sources. These risks result when underground drinking water and surface water are exposed to discharges of the chemically-infused fracking fluid due to faulty construction or operation, disposal leaks, or other unintended byproducts like the release of hazardous volatile compounds into the air. In terms of air pollution, \\"hydrofracking\\" causes detriment to both the environment and human health. Enormous quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas, escape into the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere during the extraction process, where they accelerate the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, air contaminants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, formaldehydes, and hydrogen sulfide that are released during drilling have been shown to cause harmful effects ranging from cancer, organ failure, neurological issues, to birth defects. In 2015, a study revealed that there are forty-five fracking sites within 1.5 miles of one junior high in the town of Shafter, one of California's top ten most polluted communities. The students of this community suffer from the state's decision to allow oil companies to continue hydraulic fracturing within close proximity of their schools. Parents observe severe and unexplainable health complications amongst their children, including asthma and epilepsy, that may be correlated with air toxins from the nearby wells. In all of Kern County, in which Shafter is located, a staggering ten school districts sit within one mile of fracking wells. The situation becomes even more problematic when the fact that Kern County is predominantly Latino in racial/ethnic composition is considered; in fact, 20% or more of its residents are foreign-born emigrants of Asia and Latin America. Some argue that the concentration of fracking sites around the community's population of color is a discriminatory practice in direct violation of California Code 11135, which states that no person shall be unlawfully subjected to discrimination by any state or state-funded agency on the basis of race or ethnic group identification. = Inequalities in cumulative environmental burdens among three urbanized counties in California = In 2012, this research used the method of cumulative environmental hazard inequality Index (CEHII), which is a model developed to environmental inequality in air pollution hazards., to analyze the environmental inequality in three counties in California: Alameda, San Diego and Los Angeles (Jason et al. 2012). In addition to frequently used air pollution parameter like NO2, PM 2.5 and diesel PM, a metric of heat stress was included for the analysis because excessive heat weather comes to be an environmental problem that can threaten human health. The result indicated that colored communities bear greater air pollution including NO2, PM 2.5, PM 10, and heat stress compared to predominantly white and more affluent communities. In San Diego County, the relative heat stress inequality was founded to be the highest. Also, significant heat stress inequality was observed in Los Angeles. The result shows that in these two counties, there was a strong positive correlation between the percentage of Non-Whites in the community and heat stress inequality. However, in Alameda county, an opposite pattern was found: the community with a higher White population experienced more extreme temperature exceedances. This might be explained by the fact that the White population and the more affluent class in Alameda County mainly lived in the eastern area further away from the coast, which resulted in the higher heat stress exposure. Also, the research verified that poverty status is consistent with the trend of disproportion burden of the racial-ethnic status. As the analysis was conducted according to the poverty status instead of racial-ethnic status for air pollutants NO2, PM2.5, and diesel PM, the results indicated a similar result as the analysis to heat stress. Furthermore, from the data, a strong correlation was found between poverty and proportion of non-white population (Alameda: r=0.69, Los Angeles: r=0.77). Above all, this research demonstrates that air pollution is disproportionally distributed according to the socioeconomic and racial-ethnic status in the United States. As a future direction of study, it plans to classify the inequality that exists in African American, Hispanic, Asian, and other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the technique used in this research provided a way to assess environmental inequality and the results can be used to assist decision makers in efforts to address environmental inequality issues. = Proposed coal terminal in West Oakland = In February 2016, the city of Oakland publicly announced construction plans for the Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal, a bulk exporting facility in West Oakland. As a predominantly Latino and African-American community, the residents of West Oakland live in a community that suffers from dangerous levels of air pollution. The construction of this port and its proposed partnership with Utah's coal-mining counties would rank the city as the lead coal exporter on the West Coast. To fund such a goliath project in the face of strong resistance from city councils fighting to protect their local communities from drastically increasing pollution emissions, Utah state and county officials arranged a controversial $53 million loan. The fund, composed of taxpayer dollars intended for local projects, would allow for the annual shipping of 9 million tons of coal through Oakland and an increase in national coal exports by 19%. A movement by environmental advocates quickly grew, citing that exposure to toxic coal dust would also subject the city's residents to increased risks of bronchitis, pneumonia, heart disease, emphysema, and more. In response, thousands of Oakland residents and environmental rights activists worked together to prevent the construction of the coal terminal at the former Oakland Army Base. In July 2016, Oakland City Council voted to ban coal from being handled and stored in the City of Oakland. The decision marked a large victory for the newly established Department of Race and Equity, an organization designed to protect Oakland's predominantly African-American community from social and racial disparities. According to the \\"Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States\\" report issued by the East Bay Community Foundation, those living in West Oakland already encounter five times more toxic pollution per person than residents of the city of Oakland, and children living in West Oakland are seven times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma than the average child in California. The residents of West Oakland are more likely to face both decreased life expectancy and asthma-related emergency room visits. For a city already bearing a disproportionate amount of environmental burdens, the fight for a coal-free Oakland was a success for proponents of environmental justice.  Causes  Air pollution stems from a number of sources, and the amount of pollutant from each source differs from place to place. Particulate pollution sources are shown in the graph at right. Residential wood combustion, such as burning wood in fireplaces, is the largest source of PM 2.5 pollution. Sources of particulate pollution in California. The Clean Air Act requires the US EPA to regulate six common pollutants. These air pollutants (also known as \\"criteria pollutants\\") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. All of these pollutants have been shown to have adverse health and environmental impacts and some can cause property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants \\"criteria\\" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. Fossil fuels are a leading source of air and water pollution in the United States. The Clean Air Act estimated the economic cost of air pollution to be $9 trillion between 1970 and 2000. These costs involve pollution-induced health effects and lost productivity. Additionally, global warming is predicted to inflict a variety of other costs, and with declining rainfalls and rising temperatures, global warming can increase the formation of ozone smog and worsen pollution. Land pollution is principally caused by thoughtless or illegal disposal of wastewaters or solids containing pollutants. Dumping garbage, and littering on the ground, although unsightly, rarely cause much lasting damage unless the material contains non-degradable materials such as many plastics or is at risk of entering a watercourse and thus eventually reaching the sea.  Effects  Studies have proven there are several negative health outcomes associated with breathing polluted air. Studies have found that some pollutants have damaging effects on humans, especially during pregnancy. More specifically, results from several epidemiological studies suggest that exposure of pregnant women to air pollution results in higher risks of low birth weight in term-born infants. Studies done on humans exposed to pollutants, one of them being polychlorinated biphenyls, which causes decreased birth size, increased sexual development, and altered levels of hormones related to gland regulation. Long- term exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with mortality from heart disease and stroke. Affected populations can develop a higher risk for lung cancer by breathing polluted air. Many studies examine the effect of children's health. Some of the findings show that children's lung function growth is adversely affected by air pollution, high levels of air pollution is associated with increased amount of asthma cases or asthma exacerbations in children, and school absences from acute respiratory illnesses resulted following rises in ozone levels in student communities. Additionally, numerous problems have been found by the CA Department of Health Services in classrooms at several hundred schools throughout California such as inadequate ventilation, poor thermal comfort, high formaldehyde levels, and toxic residues in floor dust. There are also economic repercussions from the effects of pollution in California. One study suggests the health-related impacts of air pollution in San Joaquin Valley drains the region's economy of $3 billion every year. The study calculates the cost of pollution in Central Valley averages $1,000 per person per year, representing the costs of premature deaths, asthma attacks, acute bronchitis in children, school absences, lost work days, etc.  Water pollution   Gold Rush era  The Gold Rush of California left a long-lasting mark of pollution in the River systems of California. Northern California Gold mine runoff largely contributes to the elevated levels of mercury found in the river systems, such as, the Sacramento River. The mining of mercury along coastal ranges and its use in processing gold in the Sierra Nevada area is the reason for increased levels of this heavy metal. As mercury travels down the California River system it gets deposited along the river and buried under or with other sediment. Due to the burying of this heavy metal, increases in mercury in the actual river water can be seen during peak storm flow when the water is capable of holding more sediment due to its increased capacity and speed. The mercury gets unburied and reintroduced into the flow of the river water. One of the problems that arise from having mercury in the California river system is bio accumulation. As fish are exposed to mercury in the river system it begins to accumulate in their tissues. When another organism eats a contaminated fish, they ingest the mercury that was in the fish, which then accumulates in their tissues. This causes a risk to human health as fisherman or hunters catch these fish, or predators of these fish, they run the risk of exposing themselves to high concentrations of mercury.  Early 1900s  Before true water quality regulations began in the 1960s and 70's, California largely dumped their waste, such as, raw sewage, into bodies of water legally. Billions of gallons of sewage, treatable waste water and storm drain water were dumped into California streams around the 1940s. It wasn't until around 1945 that the problem of water pollution in California began to be truly noticed. 13 water wells tested positive for phenolic waste in the Montebello District. The beginning attempts at water regulations began at this point, especially when it was realized that this quality of water was not an isolated incident rather it was common across the state.  Leaded gasoline  The Use of leaded gasoline up until 1992, when it was phased out, caused a large amount of Lead to be introduced into the California Water systems. 90% of the lead emitted in California is from Leaded gasoline which is higher than the total global emissions from leaded gasoline. The reason it is greater in California is due to the high use of Cars in California. The amount of Lead in the water system is similar to Mercury in that its concentration in the water increases during peak flows. The Overall amount of Lead recorded in the California water system has been declining over the past few decades.  Increased NH4  California waste water treatment plants release large amounts of N (Nitrogen) in the form of NH4 (Ammonium). This has been shown to reduce naturally occurring spring and summer phytoplankton blooms. These creatures make up the primary source of food. With the lack of dependable Phytoplankton blooms a bottom-up effect occurs. Decreased biodiversity and overall number of species located in the water of California over time can be seen due to the large amounts of NH4. The main source of this NH4 can be traced to the Sacramento Regional Water Treatment Plant (SRWTP). SRWTP releases 90% of the NH4 seen in the San Francisco Estuary (SFE)  Regulation  Water quality regulations started in the 1960s and 1970s with the passage of the California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and the federal Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts, which prevent discharges of pollution into water bodies and control the quality of water that comes out of the tap. Pollution in water systems occurs when toxic substances enter water systems such as lakes, rivers, and oceans and cause degradation. California is faced with several water pollution issues that are unique to the state. For example, it has suffered a severe drought for many years, and researchers claim this could be a major reason for the poor water quality observed in many parts of California today. The heat and low flows of water lead to stagnant, toxic bodies of water that are warm in temperature and low in oxygen. Along with an increase in salinity in the water, these complications pose a serious threat to the marine life. However, the issue of water pollution in California is not limited to rivers and the ocean. Some counties are notorious for having toxic chemicals found in their water supply. Many counties use groundwater reserves as drinking water, which is often filled with toxins, such as nitrate. This problem is a particular hazard in the San Joaquin Valley, where 63% of California's nitrate-infested water supplies reside. Arsenic, uranium, and fluoride are also commonly found in Californian wells, posing a direct threat to public health. One reporter even recalled a story in which he stopped on the side of the road to examine the foul-smelling pools of water that were steaming from the oil toxicity. California is no stranger to having oil contaminate their water. In 2015, an oil spill occurred off the coast of Santa Barbara, sending 105,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean and killing thousands of animals and surrounding wildlife. However, this is minor in severity when compared to the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, in which an explosion caused 3 million gallons of oil to spill into the ocean. This was the largest oil spill in United States history for many years and gained national attention as images of dead animals washing ashore flooded the media. The coast is still recovering to this day.  Ocean litter  The issue of ocean pollution does not only affect California's Pacific coast, it is an international issue. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine debris, there is no place on Earth that has been left untouched by the debris. Marine debris is anything man-made that ends up in marine environments. Some of the most common items that end up as debris are plastics, abandoned vessels, and fishing gear. Of the marine debris, approximately 80% originates from land, the other percentage comes from sea disposal. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) commonly referred to as the ‚ÄòGreat Pacific Garbage Patch‚Äô is a result of the marine debris accumulating. While access to plastic has increased the amount of plastic in marine environments reciprocates. These plastic products in marine environments degrade slowly, remaining floating for an extended amount of time or sink to the bottom where they can remain for up to several decades. The threats posed by the plastic in the ocean and other bodies if water includes animals becoming entangled leading to drowning, ingestion which can lead to digestive and feeding issues. The issue of ocean pollution affects marine wildlife, human health and California's tourist economy. The litter other than becoming an eyesore to California's beaches can also negatively affect coastal communities economy.

It received its world premiere at the Liverpool Playhouse, England from June to August 2008. The production starred Julie Atherton and Simon Bailey, was directed by Phil Willmott with musical direction and arrangements by Elliot Davis, choreography by Andrew Wright, associate musical direction and additional arrangements by Mark Collins, set and costume design by Christopher Woods and sound design by Jason Barnes. It was written and produced for the Liverpool '08 Capital of Culture celebrations and featured a professional cast of principals and an ensemble from the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts.  Narrative  Once Upon A Time At The Adelphi follows two stories; in the present day, Jo works at the world-famous Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool. On a busy day of hen parties and difficult customers, Jo is informed by her colleague and boyfriend, Neil, that somebody is on the hotel's roof. Upon finding the female stranger, she tells Jo she wants to meet her ex- lover, Thompson - and reveals an epic story of the Adelphi Hotel's history, when Hollywood actors stayed there en route to UK and European destinations. Many of the stories are based on actual events, for example, Roy Rogers riding his horse Trigger in the hotel. The show portrays this event on the roof, whereas in real life Rogers reportedly waved at the crowd from the balcony. Back in the present, Jo is having trouble when Neil asks her to leave Liverpool and move to Japan with him, but she is more interested in hearing the strange woman's stories. It transpires that she also worked at the hotel in the past, where she fell in love with a young vagabond called Thompson, whom she helped obtain employment at the hotel in order to get his life in order. However, during a misunderstanding over a stolen ring, Thompson left the hotel and joined the Resistance and fought in the Second World War. Years later, whilst Liverpool was under heavy bombardment, Thompson promised to return so they could dance on the roof of the hotel. In the present day, Neil tries to research the stranger's story so that Jo can return to her work and, hopefully, leave Liverpool with him that night. Finally, the stranger reveals how a dance for American soldiers in the Adelphi ballroom was interrupted by a destructive air-raid, and she tried to reach the roof to meet with Thompson. Neil interrupts the story and tells Jo that he has discovered that the stranger had died in that air-raid. Jo realises life is too short to deny love, and agrees to leave with Neil. As they embrace, Thompson arrives, and in the rain, the reunited couple finally dance on the roof, joined by the spirits of the show's characters.  Awards Productions  Adelphi won the 2008 TMA Award for Best Musical Production and was nominated for Best Regional Production at the 2009 WhatsOnStage Awards. A section of the show was performed at the awards ceremony at the Prince of Wales Theatre on Sunday 15 February 2009. The section starred Julie Atherton as Young Alice and Tom Oakley as Thompson, supported by an ensemble of final year students from Arts Ed school in London. It was choreographed by Andrew Wright and conducted by Mark Collins. The show also received a West End showcase at the Trafalgar Studios in November 2008 conducted by Elliot Davis. The show received a full staging in London's Union Theatre in March 2010.The Stage Review The musical was given its amateur premiere on Merseyside at the Floral Pavilion, New Brighton in May 2010 by West Kirby Light Opera Society ( WKLOS ), who worked with the writer to turn it into a full scale singing and dancing musical, with orchestra. The show is returning to the Floral Pavilion New Brighton in June 2018, marking the 10th anniversary of Liverpool's Capital of Culture Year.

History Bishop Selwyn's see was focused on New Zealand. In December 1847 he began a series of voyages to the Pacific Islands, which were included in his diocese by a clerical error in his letters patent. His see should have been defined as lying between 34th and 50th degrees of south latitude. The clerk drafted the boundaries as lying between 34th degrees of north latitude and 50th degrees of south latitude, which include islands to the north of New Zealand. At the time of his appointment, Selwyn was aware of this clerical error, but he chose not to point out the error. His letters and journals of these journeys through Melanesia present the reader with a vivid picture of his versatility, courage, and energy. In 1849 he formed the Melanesian Mission to work in the Western Pacific.Project CanterburyCorrespondence and photographs of the Melanesian Mission dating from 1872 are held by SOAS Archives.

Luckenbach (ID-4597) was a cargo ship and troop transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919. USS Edgar F. Luckenbach in 1919 with her decks crowded with troops returning to the United States from Europe after World War I.SS Edgar F. Luckenbach, named for her owner Edgar Fredrick Luckenbach, Sr., was built as a commercial cargo ship in 1916 at Newport News, Virginia, by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. The United States Army chartered her for World War I service in 1917, and she spent about a year operating for the Army with a U.S. Navy Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard. On 11 July 1918, Edgar F. Luckenbach was transferred to the U.S. Navy, which commissioned her the same day at New Orleans, Louisiana, as USS Edgar F. Luckenbach with Lieutenant Commander A. H. Sears, USNRF, in command. Placed in service with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Edgar F. Luckenbach departed New Orleans on 14 July 1918 and joined a convoy at New York City bound for France. She offloaded her U.S. Army cargo at Le Verdon-sur-Mer, La Pallice, Bordeaux, and Royan, then returned to the United States, arriving at Newport News on 26 September 1918. She then made her second and last wartime voyage as a U.S. Navy ship between New York and Marseilles, France. In mid-December 1918, Edgar F. Luckenbach was transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force to bring home sick, wounded, and convalescent troops from Europe in the aftermath of World War I. She was converted into a troop transport, and from 1 March 1919 to 14 October 1919 she made five such voyages to France. Arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, at the end of the fifth of these postwar voyages on 14 October 1919, Edgar F. Luckenbach was decommissioned there and returned to her owner on 30 October 1919. Like most commercial ships commissioned by the U.S. Navy for World War I service, Edgar F. Luckenbach was assigned a Navy registry Identification Number (Id. No.) -- in her case Id. No. 4597‚Äîbut she appears to have received this designation retrospectively, several years after the conclusion of her U.S. Navy service. It was highest of the many identification numbers in the SP/ID series given to private and commercial ships commissioned during and just after the war.

It then grew to include salvage and clipper ships, and finally Luckenbach began to acquire steamships. When Lewis Luckenbach died in 1906, his son succeeded him as president and moved the company to 120 Wall Street in Manhattan. At that time, his ships sailed all over the world, engaging in trade. After the First World War, Luckenbach decided it was in the best interest of the company to focus on domestic trade. He established terminal facilities throughout the United States, including in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Mobile and Galveston. Luckenbach was also a strong advocate of Federal control of shipping rates. The company played a large role in ship operations during both world wars. A claim Edgar Luckenbach liked to make was that his ships shuttled more soldiers between America and Europe than any other steamship company. Four Luckenbach ships were sunk during the First World War, and a fifth was crippled so that it had to be towed back to shore. During World War II, the Luckenbach Steamship Co. was once again called into action by the military. At the onset of the war, the company had twenty-three ships. Luckenbach ships ferried soldiers between Europe and the United States again throughout the war.  Personal interests  Luckenbach was very active in club affairs. He was a member of the Atlantic Yacht Club, Sands Point Bath Club, New York Yacht Club, the Turf and Field Club, the United Hunts Club and the Everglades Club of Palm Beach. In business, he was a member of the Maritime Association of the Port of New York, the Commerce and Industry Association of New York and the New York Produce Exchange. He was elected president of the American Steamship Owners Association in 1927, but refused the post because of his busy business. He was also an avid horseman. His saddle mare, Lucky Nira, won many horse shows throughout the 1920s and 1930s. His third wife, Andrea, also held many horse shows at their country estate. Death After months of declining health, Edgar F. Luckenbach died at his estate, Elm Court, in Sands Point, New York, on April 26, 1943. He was 75 years old. A few years after his death, the Elm Court estate was put up for auction. It consisted of a 22-room main house, a 12-room dwelling, a 4-room cottage, a 7-room house and two 8-room homes. Also on the estate were a six-car and a four-car garage, greenhouses, orchards, a chicken coop and a bathhouse on the beach. The estate later became the campus of Sands Point Country Day School, also known as Sands Point Academy, a school for gifted children, which operated there from 1954 to 1973.
