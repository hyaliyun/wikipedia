Biography Born in Belfast in 1981 in what she later described as into > one of the darkest and most turbulent years of the Troubles: the year the > hunger strikes began, when within a few months Bobby Sands and nine others > died; when things seemed to be spiralling irrevocably out of control. She studied at Strathearn School and later at Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating with a First Class Degree, and Goldsmiths College, London. Caldwell left the city she had always considered 'boring, introverted' in 1999 but later declared 'yes, it's true: I do love this city, and I do love these streets, and I am proud to be from here.' In June 2004, Caldwell's first short play, The River was performed at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and subsequently the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The play won her the PMA Most Promising Playwright Award. Caldwell spent time as writer-on-attachment to the National Theatre in 2005. Her first full-length play, Leaves, won the 2006 George Devine Award, the 2007 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and the BBC Stewart Parker Award. In 2007 it was produced by the Druid Theatre Company, and directed by Garry Hynes. The play premiered in Galway before transferring to the Royal Court Theatre. Her second full-length play, Guardians, premiered at the 2009 HighTide Festival in Halesworth. Reviewing the production, critic Michael Billington wrote, \\"[Caldwell] writes with real power about lost love. I was much moved.\\" Notes to Future Self was produced at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in March 2011, directed by Rachel Kavanaugh. It was described in The Stage as \\"Brave, beautiful, and quite extraordinary\\" Caldwell's first novel, Where They Were Missed, set in Belfast and County Donegal was published in February 2006 and short-listed for the 2006 Dylan Thomas Prize. It was described by Vogue as \\"a debut reminiscent of Ian McEwan's The Cement Garden and Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place. Her second novel, The Meeting Point, centred around a young Irish missionary couple who journey to Bahrain, was published in February 2011 by Faber. It was described by the Sunday Times as \\"Compelling, passionate and deeply resonant\\" and by the Guardian as \\"haunting... compulsively readable\\" Caldwell's radio play, Girl From Mars, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in 2008, won the Irish Playwrights' and Screenwriters' Guild Award (\\"ZeBBie\\") for Best Radio Play and the BBC's Richard Imison Award for best script by a writer new to radio. In their verdict, the judges said: > This is a gripping and powerful depiction of the effect on a family when one > sibling goes missing. The beautifully-told story begins when a body is found > and the remaining daughter returns to be with her family while they await > identification. Girl From Mars is moving and emotionally taut. It veers away > from sentimentality and felt personal and believable. The structure is > complex – combining three different timescales – and uses radio to its full > potential, using many techniques including voice-overs, dialogue, text > messages, and voice mail. The story has a shades-of-grey resolution about > the way a person's life can tragically stop short – and this is echoed in > the subtle way the writer ends her own play too. In 2012 she was the recipient of a Major Individual Artist Award from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland. Her most recent novel, All the Beggars Riding, published in 2013, was shortlisted for both the Kerry Group Irish Fiction Award and the Fiction Uncovered selection and was chosen as Belfast's One City One Book.

He has previously received training in the Gwalior, Jaipur and Agra gharanas, and is considered a representative of all three schools. Early life Ulhas was born in Nagpur. He received his first lessons in music from his father N D Kashalkar, a lawyer by profession and an amateur vocalist and musicologist. He went on to study music at Nagpur University, topping his post-graduate class. Around that time, he trained under Rajabhau Kogje and P N Khardenavis. Indian music is heavily influenced by the Guru-shishya tradition. Kashalkar studied principally under Ram Marathe and Gajananrao Joshi. Career Ulhas Kashalkar initially worked as a programme executive at the Mumbai station of All India Radio. In 1993 he became a teacher at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy, where he remains today. Both Rambhau and Gajananrao were traditionalists which finds reflection in Kashalkar's vocalism. He possesses the ability to switch between three styles (namely Gwalior, Jaipur and Agra), at times even in the course of a single performance. He adheres to the aesthetic contours of each individual style, and also to the formal demands of the raga being presented. He is noted for his authentic presentations of obscure traditional ragas. In an uncharacteristically expansive passage, the veteran music critic Prakash Wadhera once noted: Ulhas is a fabulous vocalist, still in his middle years and young, who has an old musical head stuffed with innumerable current and rare ragas and compositions. Like a computer he never errs in any raga or composition howsoever intertwined or tricky it may be. He, just seems to press one key and out comes a raga in the true Jaipur colours, another to obtain a melody attired in the Agra style and still another to get a raga in the Gwalior habiliments. One can only imagine Kashalkar's questionless loyalty to his various gurus, and his own prodigious capacity to assimilate and consolidate the incoming knowledge.

It was the fourth event under the Hard Justice name and the eighth event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. Seven professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card, three of which were for championships. The main event was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which the champion Samoa Joe defeated the challenger Booker T to retain the title. Another heavily promoted bout was a Last Man Standing match between Kurt Angle and A.J. Styles, which the latter won. The card also featured a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, which saw Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defeat The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) to become the new champions. A New Jersey Street Fight was also held pitting the team of Christian Cage and Rhino against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Cage and Rhino were the victors in the contest. Hard Justice featured the start of a storyline between veteran wrestlers and younger wrestlers in TNA along with marking the beginning of Jeff Jarrett's return to active competition. 35,000 was the reported figure of purchasers for the event by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Hard Justice had a reported attendance between 2,300 and 3,500 people. Canadian Online Explorer writer John Pollock reviewed the show and felt it featured the \\"usual assortment of wacky finishes and outside interference\\" but that \\"all in all it was a solid show.\\" Wade Keller and James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter both reviewed the event, praising the Last Man Standing match saying it was a \\"superb\\" and \\"epic match.\\" In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Production Background The fourth installment under the Hard Justice name was announced in January 2008 with an August 10th date attached. In May, TNA hoped to host a PPV event in the Northeastern United States sometime before the end of the year. Hard Justice was the PPV under consideration. TNA issued a press release in late-June revealing that Hard Justice would be held at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton, New Jersey. Tickets for the show went on-sale on June 27. TNA released a poster to promote the event featuring The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX) and Samoa Joe; the poster also promoted a musical appearance by rap artists Filthee, Grandmaster Caz, and Ice-T. The official theme for the show was \\"AyAyAya\\" by Filthee. Storylines Hard Justice featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. alt=Samoa Joe holding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt wearing ring gear making his ring entrance The main event at Hard Justice was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion Samoa Joe and the challenger Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. The duo also fought at TNA's previous PPV event Victory Road on July 13, which ended in a no contest after interference from Sting allowed Booker T to gain an unofficial pinfall counted by his legitimate wife Sharmell instead of an official referee. On the July 17 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T proclaimed that he was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion before Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T did not win the match and that Joe was still the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, despite Booker T having taken possession of the title belt. Cornette then scheduled a rematch between the two for the title at Hard Justice; Joe did not retrieve physical possession of the title belt after this, instead chose to reclaim the physical belt after he beat Booker T at the event. On the July 24 episode of Impact!, Joe and Booker T made the contest a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match. The predominate storyline heading into the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance. On the February 14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle separated in the storyline on the March 13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May 15 episode of Impact!; TNA began to phase out the marriage between Styles and Karen also. Karen refused Angle's request on the May 22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen. The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June 12 episode of Impact!, which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles, Angle, Tomko, Christian Cage, Rhino, Abyss, and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Afterwards, Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino became involved in the feud with Team 3D joining Angle, while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles. The two teams then fought in a Full Metal Mayhem at Victory Road, which the team of Angle and Team 3D won. The teams fought again on the July 24 episode of Impact!, this time in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match, which Angle and Team 3D also won. On the July 31 episode of Impact!, while Styles stood in a ring surrounded by a steel cage, Angle attacked Styles from behind and slammed him back-first into the mat, rendering him unconscious. As a result of this action, Styles challenged Angle to a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice; Angle accepted the challenge. The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended at Hard Justice by LAX against Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode). On the June 12 episode of Impact!, Roode and Storm teamed to face LAX for the World Tag Team Championship. The match was originally won by Roode and Storm before being restarted due to interference. LAX won the restart to retain the championship. After the bout, Roode and Storm assaulted LAX and their manager Héctor Guerrero. Management Director Jim Cornette scheduled a title defense at Victory Road between LAX and Roode and Storm under \\"Fan's Revenge\\" Lumberjack rules on the June 19 episode of Impact!. At Victory Road, LAX defeated the newly renamed Beer Money Incorporated to retain the World Tag Team Championship. On the July 17 episode of Impact!, Roode and Storm began assaulting various wrestlers, crew members, and fans in retaliation for their loss at Victory Road. Later in the program, Roode and Storm once again attacked Guerrero, prompting LAX to come to his rescue. On the July 31 episode of Impact!, Roode and Storm defeated the team of Christian Cage and Rhino for a World Tag Team Championship match at Hard Justice. On the August 7 episode of Impact!, the team of Cage, Rhino, and LAX fought the team of Roode, Storm, and Team 3D in an Eight Man Tag Team match, which the latter lost. After the contest, Roode and Storm slammed Homicide through a glass table, injuring his right eye in the storyline. Team 3D fought the team of Christian Cage and Rhino in a New Jersey Street Fight at Hard Justice. This match was a break-off from the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle. After Team 3D, Cage, and Rhino became involved in the rivalry, Team 3D injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative leading into Victory Road.

After the match at Victory Road and a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match on Impact!, Team 3D cost Cage and Rhino a shot at the World Tag Team Championship on the July 31 episode of Impact!. Afterwards, Cage challenged Team 3D to a New Jersey Street Fight at Hard Justice, which Team 3D accepted. Event The telecast began with a live performance of the event theme song \\"AyAyAya\\" by Filthee along with Grandmaster Caz and Melle Mel. Ice-T was advertised to perform but was absent with no reason given and was replaced by Mel. It later came to light that Ice-T was unable to attend as a result of \\"travel problems.\\" Miscellaneous Hard Justice featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. Mike Tenay and Don West were the commentators for the telecast. Jeremy Borash and David Penzer were ring announcers for the event. Andrew Thomas, Earl Hebner, Rudy Charles, Mark \\"Slick\\" Johnson, and Traci Brooks participated as referees for the encounters. Lauren Thompson and Borash were used as interviewers during the event. Besides employees who appeared in a wrestling role, Rhaka Khan, Sheik Abdul Bashir, Raisha Saeed, Jacqueline, Héctor Guerrero, Salinas, Johnny Devine, Abyss, Sting, and Kevin Nash all appeared on camera, either in backstage or in ringside segments. Preliminary matches alt=Beer Money, Inc. posing in a wrestling ring The opening bout was for the TNA X Division Championship between the champion Petey Williams and the challenger Consequences Creed. The duration of the match was 12 minutes and 30 seconds. Williams was accompanied to the ring by Rhaka Khan, who interfered in the contest trying to aid Williams to no avail. Near the end of the match, Sheik Abdul Bashir walked out to the ring and bashed Creed across the back with a steel chair, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. Williams followed with the pin to win the match and retain the TNA X Division Championship. After the bout, Bashir continued to attack Creed. The second contest of the show was a Six Woman Tag Team match pitting the team of Gail Kim, ODB, and Taylor Wilde against the team of Awesome Kong and The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky). Kong was accompanied to the ring by Raisha Saeed. Wilde won the match for her team with a pinning maneuver on Love at 11 minutes and 27 seconds. The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended by LAX against Beer Money, Inc. in the next encounter. Jacqueline accompanied Beer Money to the ring, while Salinas and Héctor Guerrero accompanied LAX. The duration of the encounter was 14 minutes and 15 seconds. Filthee, Grandmaster Caz, and Melle Mel performed LAX's theme during their entrance. Near the end of the contest, Jacqueline and Salinas both interfered in the match. This led to Roode smacking Homicide in his injured right eye with a beer bottle while the referee was not looking. Storm then gained the pinfall to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for his team. TNA held a Black Tie Brawl and Chain match between Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt, which lasted 11 minutes and 14 seconds. In this match, both competitors were tied together via a chain and dressed in tuxedos. The only way to win was to strip their opponent of the tuxedo and either make them submit or pin them afterwards. Lethal won the encounter after jumping off of a turnbuckle to drive his elbow into Dutt's chest and followed with the pin. Main event matches alt=Booker T posing in a wrestling ring The fifth match on the card was a New Jersey Street Fight pitting the team of Christian Cage and Rhino against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). In this match, weapons were legal to use and there were no count-outs or disqualifications. Early in the match, both teams fought throughout the crowd, at which time they both used weapons against each other. The match ended when Cage performed a frog splash aerial maneuver onto Ray from atop a ladder, followed up by Rhino performing his signature Gore maneuver into Ray against a table placed up in the ring corner. Rhino then pinned Ray to win the contest at 15 minutes and 22 seconds. After the match, Team 3D's associate Johnny Devine came out to help attack Cage and Rhino, however, Abyss came to their rescue and slammed Devine back- first onto the mat with his trademark Black Hole Slam maneuver while Team 3D made their retreat. A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, there are no disqualifications or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to not be able to reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on. The main event was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the champion Samoa Joe against the challenger Booker T, who was accompanied by Sharmell. The duration of the contest was 12 minutes and 44 seconds. Early in the bout, Booker T hit Joe in the face with a steel chair, resulting in Joe bleeding from the forehead. Later on, Booker T slammed Joe back-first onto two chairs with his signature Book End maneuver, however, Joe kicked out of a pinfall attempt. Joe gained the pinfall victory to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after bashing Booker T over the head with a guitar that had appeared in the ring after the lights had suddenly went off and back on. Reception alt=A.J. Styles in wrestling gear standing in a wrestling ring A total of 3,500 people attended Hard Justice, while The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 35,000 people bought the event. However, the attendance number has been disputed, with it also being reported that Hard Justice drew an attendance of 2,300 people. Canadian Online Explorer writer John Pollock reviewed the show and felt it featured the \\"usual assortment of wacky finishes and outside interference\\" but that \\"all in all it was a solid show.\\" Pollock commented on the musical performance shown at the beginning of the telecast, stating the \\"crowd is silent in appreciation.\\" \\"Crowd is very hot for this opener and the atmosphere should hopefully add to this show\\", stated Pollock when covering the TNA X Division Championship match. Pollock discussed the Street Fight in his review, commenting that the \\"crowd was really hot for this match.\\" As for the Last Man Standing match, Pollock said it \\"was an outstanding match.\\" Pollock also felt that the main event got \\"zero time.\\" Pollock noted that the fans in attendance started chanting \\"Fire Russo\\" during the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match in his review, which was a reference to TNA writer Vince Russo. Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter rated the matches out of five stars in his review of the event. He gave the main event 2 3/4 stars and discussed the amount of time it was given, stating it was \\"just enough time for a suitable main event\\" but that it did not \\"leave much flex time for things to run past the bare minimum for a PPV main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they're going to do with Sting and Nash.\\" Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout, commenting that TNA management needed to start fining \\"wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull\\" because it was \\"just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling.\\" He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a \\"superb match\\" with a \\"scaring finish\\" since the \\"potential for something going wrong given Angle's legit neck problems was substantial\\" even if \\"everything was planned\\" to work out that way. Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1/2 stars and stated it \\"was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive\\" and that it felt \\"like yet another weapons match.\\" \\"The match was okay, but nothing more. The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match\\", said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match, which he gave 1 1/4 stars. Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars, but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest. He did comment on the X Division Championship match, saying it was a \\"very good match\\" and gave it 3 stars. James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, published a review of the show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event \\"underwhelming\\" due to the \\"audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe- Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish\\" and that it was \\"not memorable\\" but that it would \\"generate talk about Jarrett.\\" He gave the bout 2 stars. \\"That was an epic match\\", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a \\"silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation\\" and that the \\"all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win.\\" Caldwell felt the match made Styles look \\"like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out\\" but that he had a \\"memorable, star-making victory over Angle.\\" He disapproved of Styles being \\"used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life.\\" Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, he said it was a \\"fun brawl for the audience\\" and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had \\"good heat\\" that \\"over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking\\" and that it was \\"refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match.\\" He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been \\"great\\" if it had avoided involving \\"outside interference.\\" Aftermath alt=Sting wearing a red longcoat standing in a wrestling ring talking on a microphone The feud between Samoa Joe and Booker T ended after Hard Justice. On the August 14 episode of TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Joe would defend the championship at TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on September 14 in a Four Ways to Glory match. Cornette stated that over the weeks leading to the show three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe. Booker T won the first qualifying match was on the August 21 episode of Impact! by defeating Rhino. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August 28 episode of Impact! to qualify for the contest.

Booker T could not attend the event due to Hurricane Ike, making the bout a Three Ways to Glory match instead. Joe retained the championship at the show. The finish to the main event and the segment after the Last Man Standing match led to several matches and segments following Hard Justice. Sting was announced at No Surrender to be the challenger for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's Bound for Glory IV PPV event on October 12. Sting ended up defeating Joe for the title at the event due to Nash betraying and hitting Joe with a baseball bat. Styles went on to challenge Sting at TNA's Turning Point and Final Resolution PPV events for the title, failing to win on both occasions. These matches were part of a storyline between veterans wrestlers, which made up The Main Event Mafia, and younger wrestlers, called The TNA Front Line, in TNA. Meanwhile, the finish of the main event led to the return of Jeff Jarrett at No Surrender, when he aided Joe in retaining the TNA World Heavyweight Championship by hitting Angle with a guitar. The rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle continued after Hard Justice leading into No Surrender. On the August 14 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Angle in an Olympic Wrestling match for Angle's 1996 Summer Olympics gold medal in freestyle wrestling. Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles then went on to feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank Trigg, who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' Four Ways to Glory qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September 11 episode of Impact!. Styles and Trigg fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting Trigg in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat Trigg with a kendo stick to end their feud. On the September 25 episode of Impact!, Styles was ordered to return Angle's gold medal by Jeff Jarrett, who had taken a role as a TNA management authority figure.

Beer Money, Inc retained the title at the show. Petey Williams defended the X Division Championship against Consequences Creed in a rematch on the August 21 episode of Impact!, with Bashir once again interfering by attacking Creed, resulting in Creed winning by disqualification and Williams retaining the X Division Championship. TNA promoted a Three Way match between the three for the X Division Championship for No Surrender, which Bashir ended up winning to become the new champion on the telecast. Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) and the team of Christian Cage and Rhino ended their conflict after Hard Justice.

No Surrender had an attendance of 3,500 people. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 3 out of 10, which was lower than the 7 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. In regards to the overall show, Clevett said that \\"TNA’s pay per view debut in Canada was one of the weakest shows in recent memory, overwhelmed by horrible overbooking by TNA that once again proves that they do not know what their fanbase wants.\\" In October 2017, with the launch of the Global Wrestling Network, the event became available to stream on demand. Production Background The fourth installment under the No Surrender name was announced in January 2008 with a September 14 date attached. In July, The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that TNA would hold its first PPV held in Canada with No Surrender in September. The reported location for the event was Oshawa, Ontario, Canada at the General Motors Centre. TNA issued a press release in late-July revealing that No Surrender would be held at the General Motors Centre in Oshawa, Ontario on September 14\\\\. Tickets for the show went on-sale on July 25. Early ticket sales for the event were on par with the early sales of TNA's Lockdown PPV event. The General Motors Centre was close to being sold out a few days prior to the show, with only 800 tickets remaining. The arena had a maximum capacity of 5,000 but was configured to have a maximum capacity of 3,500 due to the event layout. Views were positive in TNA towards early ticket sales considering it was TNA's first PPV in Canada. Before any matches were announced, it was suspected that the event would be headlined by a tag team match or a trios bout to set up for a standard match at TNA's next PPV event Bound for Glory IV on October 12. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Samoa Joe, while \\"Soul Crusher\\" by Operator was the official theme. Storylines No Surrender featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. alt=Samoa Joe holding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt wearing ring gear making his ring entrance The main event at No Surrender was a Four Ways to Glory match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which the champion Samoa Joe defended the title against three competitors. This match was announced on the August 14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, with Management Director Jim Cornette stating that three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe over the weeks leading to No Surrender. The first qualifying match was on the August 21 episode of Impact!, when Booker T defeated Rhino to take a spot in the match. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August 28 episode of Impact! to qualify for the contest. The final qualifier was Christian Cage, who defeated A.J. Styles on the September 4 episode of Impact!. TNA held a scripted Mixed Martial Arts match at No Surrender between A.J. Styles and Frank Trigg. This match was the result of a feud between Kurt Angle and Styles. The two had competed against each other at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8, Victory Road PPV event on July 13, Hard Justice PPV event on August 10, and on several Impact! episodes with Trigg providing commentary for some of the contests and aiding Angle in the feud as they were depicted as on- screen best friends.

A couple of months later on the September 4 episode of Impact!, Trigg attacked Styles during his Four Ways to Glory qualifying match with Christian Cage. Trigg hit Styles with a kendo stick and left the ring, which allowed Cage to pin Styles to win the bout. On the September 11 episode of Impact!, Styles challenged Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules. The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended at No Surrender by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) against The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX). On the June 12 episode of Impact!, Roode and Storm teamed to face LAX for the World Tag Team Championship. The match was originally won by Roode and Storm before being restarted due to interference. LAX won the restart to retain the championship. After the bout, Roode and Storm assaulted LAX and their manager Héctor Guerrero.

TNA scheduled a rematch between the two teams for the championship to take place at No Surrender. Another rivalry heading into the show was between Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt, who were fighting over the heart of SoCal Val. The storyline behind this rivalry started on the May 15 episode of Impact!, when Lethal proposed marriage to Val in the storyline. With the two being an on-screen couple, she accepted with the planned wedding segment taking place at Slammiversary. Lethal then asked Dutt to be his bestman on the May 29 episode of Impact!, which he accepted despite him being scripted to show feelings for Val. At Slammiversary, Dutt interrupted the wedding proclaiming his love for Val in the storyline and attacked Lethal, which ended with Dutt unconscious as Jake Roberts placed a snake on top of his body. Dutt then defeated Lethal in a bout at Victory Road. Lethal won a rematch in a Black Tie Brawl and Chain match at Hard Justice over Dutt. Leading up to No Surrender, Dutt attacked Lethal after he was defeated by Sheik Abdul Bashir on the August 14 episode of Impact!. On the September 11 episode of Impact!, TNA promoted a Ladder of Love match at No Surrender with the winner becoming engaged to Val. The TNA X Division Championship was defended by Petey Williams against Sheik Abdul Bashir and Consequences Creed in a Three Way match at the event. At Hard Justice, Bashir attacked Creed with a steal chair during his bout with Williams, which allowed Williams to force Creed's head into the mat with his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver to retain the X Division Championship. Creed was given a rematch on the August 21 episode of Impact!, with Bashir once again interfering by attacking Creed, resulting in Creed winning by disqualification and Williams retaining the X Division Championship. This match was later advertised on the card for No Surrender. Event The event began with Sting announcing that he would be facing the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory IV. TNA commentator Mike Tenay also announced that due to Hurricane Ike, Booker T could not make it to the event so the original scheduled Four Ways to Glory match was changed to a Three Ways to Glory match.

Bashir then pinned Creed to win the TNA X Division Championship at 8 minutes and 15 seconds. The fifth match was for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, in which the champion Taylor Wilde defended against Angelina Love. Wilde was accompanied by Rhino to the ring, while Love was accompanied by Velvet Sky and Cute Kip. The bout lasted 6 minutes and 22 seconds. At one point in the contest, Kip attempted to interefere by aiding Love to only be met by Rhino who tackled Kip with his trademark Gore maneuver. Wilde won the bout by pinning Love following a Northern Lights suplex to retain the Women's Knockout Championship. Main Event matches alt=An adult male wearing red and black wrestling gear performing a strut in front of a crowd in a red-roped wrestling ring. The Ladder of Love match for SoCal Val followed between Sonjay Dutt and Jay Lethal, which lasted 13 minutes and 19 seconds. In the bout, the only way to win was to climb a ladder and retrieve an engagement ring that hung above the ring, which symbolized winning SoCal Val's heart in the storyline. Early in the match, TNA commentator Mike Tenay announced that Salinas had been injured in an assault by Jacqueline and was taken to the hospital in the storyline. The competitors set up two ladders in the ring at one point, with one standing upright and the other positioned between two steps of the first and on the top rope. This led to Dutt placing Lethal on the bridged ladder, ascending a turnbuckle, and delivered an aerial senton splash to Lethal. Later, Dutt bridged a ladder over two chairs at ringside, then followed up by forcing Lethal back-first onto the ladder with a neckbreaker. Close to the end of the encounter, Dutt had Lethal positioned on top of two standing ladders when he climbed on top of Lethal and placed Lethal in a Camel Clutch submission hold. Lethal fought out of it and pushed Dutt off the ladder, causing him to land back-first onto the ring mat. Afterwards, Lethal got his leg stuck in between the ladder rungs, causing Val to enter the ring and help release him from his predicament. Dutt then yelled at Val for helping Lethal before climbing the ladder. Lethal checked on a visibly upset Val in the storyline before also climbing the ladder. Val then hit Lethal in the groin as he climbed, allowing Dutt to retrieve the ring and win the contest. The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) against The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX) in a Tag Team match afterwards. Beer Money, Inc. was accompanied by Jacqueline, while LAX was accompanied by Hector Guerrero. The duration of the contest was 8 minutes and 42 seconds. Early in the bout, Hernandez threw Homicide over the ring ropes to the outside onto a standing Storm and Roode. Later, Storm spat beer in the face of Hernandez and powerbombed him off the top of a turnbuckle to the mat below. Hernandez in return jumped over the rope to the outside onto Storm. The conclusion of the encounter saw Roode attempt to perform his signature Payoff maneuver on Homicide, only for Homicide to counter the move into his signature Gringo Stunner maneuver. Homicide then followed up by attempting to perform his trademark Da Gringo Killa maneuver, however, Jacqueline interfered in the bout throwing powder in Homicide's eyes. Roode performed the Payoff afterwards and pinned Homicide to retain the World Tag Team Championship for his team. A Mixed Martial Arts match between A.J. Styles and Frank Trigg was the eighth contest of the show. This match lasted 6 minutes and 7 seconds. This bout was contested under mixed martial arts rules, but had a scripted finish. Half way through Round One, Styles and Trigg tumbled to the ringside area and continued to fight until security broke them up. The round ended with Styles having Trigg in an armbar submission hold, causing Styles to release the hold. The system feed broadcasting the show was interrupted at this time, upon its return it displayed a pornographic film, until the broadcast was fixed, returning to No Surrender. The feed returned to Styles and Trigg fighting in Round Two, with Styles grabbing a kendo stick from under the ring and assaulting Trigg with it. It was later shown that the bout was ruled a no contest by the referee due to Styles hitting Trigg in the groin by accident. The main event was a Three Ways to Glory match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which the champion Samoa Joe defended against Christian Cage and Kurt Angle. Mid-way through the encounter, Angle held Joe in his signature Ankle lock submission hold when Cage tried to break up the hold, only to have Angle place Cage in the hold as well, resulting in Angle having both Joe and Cage in the Ankle Lock simultaneously. Both Cage and Joe broke out of the submission, tossing Angle to the outside area. Later, Joe attempted to perform his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on Angle, with Angle countering the move into his signature Olympic slam maneuver. Cage followed by hitting a frog splash aerial maneuver from the top of a turnbuckle onto Joe. He threw Angle from the ring, performed his signature Unprettier maneuver on Joe, and covered Joe for a pin attempt. Angle pulled the referee Earl Hebner from the ring and threw him into a ringside barricade. Angle grabbed a chair and attacked Cage and Joe with it. He knocked out Cage first then placed Joe in the Ankle lock. Jeff Jarrett then returned to TNA television by smashing a guitar over the head of Angle. Joe performed the Muscle Buster on Angle and followed by pinning Angle as the referee returned to the ring at 15 minutes and 27 seconds to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Reception A total of 3,500 people attended No Surrender, while The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that 20,000 people bought the event. The show was reviewed by two contributors of the Canadian Online Explorer's SLAM! Sports, Jason Clevett and Kenai Andrews, with Andrews providing a live attendance review. Clevett rated the entire event a 3 out of 10, which was lower than the 7 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. 7 out of 10 was also given to the 2009 edition by Bob Kapur. Bound for Glory IV also received a 7 out of 10 by Chris Sokol and Bryan Sokol. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) Unforgiven PPV event on September 7, Unforgiven performed better as it received a 7 out of 10 from Matt Bishop. Clevett also rated the matches out of 10, with his highest rating going to the Ladder of Love match, which he gave an 8 out of 10. The main event received a 6 out of 10, the Mixed Martial Arts bout was given a 0 out of 10, the X Division Championship match got a 7 out of 10, while the World Tag Team match received a 5 out of 10. Shiek Abdul Bashir's (pictured) entrance at No Surrender received criticism in reviews of the event.alt=Daivari holding the TNA X Division Championship in front of a crowd. Overall, Clevett was disappointed by the event, making several comments regarding the quality of the show. In his closing comments, Clevett wrote that he \\"once considered himself a huge wrestling fan\\" but shows \\"like tonight make him question his dedication anymore,\\" before revealing that he wanted \\"his money and three hours back.\\" When discussing the A.J. Styles versus Frank Trigg encounter, Clevett stated that \\"the chant “this is b.s.” should never, ever be heard during an A.J. Styles match, the man is far too talented to ever have fans react in such a manner. However, that is exactly what the crowd at GM Place in Oshawa, Ontario, chanted during his “MMA” bout with Frank Trigg. TNA’s pay per view debut in Canada was one of the weakest shows in recent memory, overwhelmed by horrible overbooking by TNA that once again proves that they do not know what their fanbase wants.\\" For the X Division Championship contest, Clevett discussed various issues such as Bashir's entrance music and the match quality: \\"I watched this show with a friend who moved here from the U.S., and we shared our disgust with Bashir’s theme music opening with the sound of a plane crashing. TNA has probably lost a few viewers at that lame attempt to garner heat.\\" However, he felt the match was a \\"highlight of the show with some fast paced-solid wrestling\\" but that it lost a rating point for the \\"lousy finish.\\" He also believed the Ladder of Love match was another \\"highlight of the show\\" despite the \\"terrible angle that has surrounded the feud between the two over SoCal Val.\\" He said the two competitors \\"busted their asses\\" but that the match \\"should have been showcased in New Jersey last month in front of Lethal’s hometown crowd\\" at the Hard Justice PPV event. However, he gave credit to the two involved for \\"coming up with some incredibly creative spots\\" that got the crowd to cheer and chant \\"This is awesome\\" despite the ladder match genre having \\"become rather tired and overdone.\\" Regarding the World Tag Team match, Clevett thought it \\"should have been held off a month\\" since \\"it really doesn’t mean much so soon after the title change.\\" However, he felt the \\"four men worked hard and it was a decent tag match, but by this point the show wasn’t salvageable.\\" As for the main event, he commented that the \\"match itself was solid, but felt like all three men were going through the motions\\" since the \\"three have wrestled each other so many times in the past year, it doesn’t feel fresh or exciting.\\" He also said he could not \\"remember many specifics of the match, and considering the talent level that is surprising.\\" He also expressed his disappointment in the finish, that he tried to remember \\"the last time a TNA main event ended without some kind of interference, guitar shot, or overbooking\\" but he could not. Andrews discussed the experience of witnessing the show live along with the crowd reaction during his review. He did not give any event or match ratings, but did provide comments on the quality of the event. Andrews mentioned that the TNA President Dixie Carter was present \\"earnestly signed autographs\\" and interacting \\"with fans in the pre-amble\\" which he said they \\"seemed to love mingling with her and her eyes beamed when told SLAM! Wrestling was present covering the show.\\" He stated the \\"crowd anticipation was decent, with many fans looking forward to \\"Four ways to Glory,\\" but wondering if Booker T would show, due to Hurricane Ike making landfall in Houston, Texas, Booker's hometown\\" with no announcement being \\"made to the arena crowd about Booker T being there one way or another.\\" Also that the \\"energy through most of the show had an ordinary quality, bobbing unevenly between good and bland. Sting’s opening promo were greeted warmly and Curry Man’s comical segments with Christy Hemme tickled the crowd. They also gushed over Petey Williams and his Maple Leaf Muscle, The Beautful[sic] People and Taylor Wilde, and the Jay Lethal versus Sonjay Dutt ladder match.\\" Andrews said \\"the crowd came alive and actively participated throughout\\" those matches with the energy level being \\"high.\\" Conversely, he stated that \\"ODB and Kong’s match was a slow-paced affair, and Beer Money Inc. - LAX tag team title match was notable only for James Storm and Jacqueline's coherent performances given their injuries at the TNA London house show the night before.\\" The Mixed Martial Arts bout \\"annoyed the action-hungry fans, not wanting to endure the chess style patience that MMA can be known for. It was probably a harsh reaction, as the extremely small vocal minority thought the MMA choreography was well done, mimicking a good blend of both men trying to impose their style on the other. Ultimately, that opinion was squashed, symbolized by Styles beating Trigg with a kendo stick after the match.\\" He felt that Booker T's absence \\"seemed to dampen any mystique \\"Four ways to Glory\\" had going for it\\" with the main event being \\"lacklustre[sic]\\" despite Christian Cage’s entrance maintaining the \\"aura of the grand spectacle everyone was hoping the match would be.\\" He said it still a \\"solid match put on by the combatants, but one that was very familiar, prompting one fan to coin the bout \\"3 the Hard Way.\\" Even Jeff Jarrett’s run-in couldn’t get a notable rise out of the crowd. Not bad and not great.\\" However, he stated that it was \\"hard to ignore the grumblings about the main event in the tunnels and down Athol St.\\" He concluded his review by writing that the \\"card from a ringside experience perspective was hurt by the ordinary main event, turning a possibly good and memorable show into an average one.\\" Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter rated the matches out of five stars in his review of the show. For the main event, Keller gave it 3 1/4 stars and said it was a \\"good match\\" and that the \\"booking made sense within TNA's style, but it's yet another example of a match ending only after obvious outside interference.\\" As for the Styles versus Trigg bout, Keller did not give it a rating and did not comment on the quality of the match, instead focused on the feed interruption, stating that the \\"brief image of the naked women will be talked about for years as one of the funniest blunders on pro wrestling PPV, and not so funny for parents watching with their kids.\\" He gave the World Tag Team Championship match 1 1/4 stars calling it a \\"basic match\\" with \\"nothing wrong with it\\" despite the highpoints being late \\"it felt like a match to cool down the crowd after the ladder match\\" with another finish that conditioned \\"viewers to never consider a pinfall attempt a serious potential finish until there's some sort of interference - such as powder from Jackie this time.\\" The Ladder of Love match was given 3 3/4 stars with Keller saying it was a \\"really good ladder match\\" with the competitors managing to \\"really innovate and not rely on the standard ladder spots we've seen so often before\\" but that the finish \\"made no sense that Val would save Lethal seconds before turning on him. It's one of those things that's done for drama that doesn't seem the least bit realistic.\\" Lastly, Keller discussed the X Division Championship match, which he gave 2 1/2 stars and also commented on Bashir's entrance music calling it \\"among the most scummy promoting tactics in history\\" believing it was \\"beyond words how absolutely disgusting it is.\\" Also saying that it is \\"the type of thing that should put a risk their deals with Spike TV and InDemand, it's that bad. Coming three days after the anniversary makes it worse, but it really isn't acceptable on any day.\\" Aftermath Sting went on to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory IValt=Sting entering the arena at Bound for Glory IV Since Sting announced that he would challenge for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory IV and Samoa Joe retained the championship at No Surrender, TNA scheduled the two to fight for the title. This feud was connected to the company wide narrative involving the rivalry between wrestling veterans and the next generation of wrestlers. Also connected to that narrative was the feud between Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle. Jarrett and Angle became involved after Jarrett accused the veterans in the company of trying to keep the next generation from being stars and refusing to retire. Angle challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV for these comments and for Jarrett assaulting him with a guitar at No Surrender. Jarrett refused at first but later accepted the challenge on the September 25 episode of Impact!. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October 2 Impact! episode. Meanwhile, Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October 9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added that there would be no rematch between the two after the event. Sting went on to win the title at the show, while Jarrett defeated Angle. A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage all went on to feud heading into Bound for Glory IV. This bout was also connected to the above narrative, with Cage being neutral in the storyline and both camps trying to recruit him to their group. After various miscommunications in matches involving the three wrestlers, Management Director Jim Cornette announced Booker T versus Styles with Cage as Special Guest Referee as the main event of the October 9 episode of Impact! to settle the issue. Styles defeated Booker T during the show, with Cage assaulting both wrestlers after the contest. Cornette then promoted a Three Way match between the three at Bound for Glory. Booker T won the contest at the event. The TNA World Tag Team Championship went on to be defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match by Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide; LAX), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). On the September 18 episode of Impact!, Matt Morgan announced that TNA were holding a Tag Team Invitational Tournament at Bound for Glory and that he had signed up himself and his partner Abyss for the contest. Team 3D interrupted Morgan and revealed that they were also involved in the tournament. On the same telecast, Beer Money, Inc. and Jacqueline assaulted Héctor Guerrero. On the September 25 episode of Impact!, Team 3D announced that the match between them and the team of Morgan and Abyss was made a Monster's Ball match. On the same telecast, Beer Money, Inc. defeated LAX in a bout with the stipulation that the losing team lost their manager. This meant that Guerrero could no longer manage LAX in the storyline. On the October 2 episode of Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the originally scheduled tournament was cancelled. Instead, TNA was holding a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship between the above teams at Bound for Glory IV. TNA issued a press release announcing that Steve McMichael would be the Special Guest Referee for this match after it was promoted for the event. Beer Money, Inc. retained the championship during the telecast. The TNA X Division Championship was defended by Sheik Abdul Bashir against Consequences Creed at Bound for Glory IV. On the October 9 episode of Impact!, Creed won a Four Way match to challenge Bashir for the title at Bound for Glory, defeating Sonjay Dutt, Williams, and Jay Lethal in the process. Bashir retained the title at the event. During the No Surrender telecast, the commentators Mike Tenay and Don West announced that LAX's manager Salinas had been attacked backstage and was sent to the hospital. In reality, Salinas had quit the company and decided against appearing at No Surrender.

This led to the club name (they were brave and fearless Roman soldiers). History During the 2003 season, the club played only friendly games. First, the National League of Serbia took place in 2004. The Legionaries finished third in the regular season, reaching the playoffs, where they were beaten by Vukovi Beograd. Next year, the National League wasn’t played, but the National Cup was.

The village is north east of Hall Dunnerdale and south west of the tarn. It lies along the old Walna Scar road, which can be reached from the A595 in the south, or from the steep Hardknott-Wrynose pass road in the north, which leads off the A593 from Skelwith Bridge). The name Seathwaite derives from a combination of the old Norse words sef (sedges) and thveit (clearing) and may be taken to mean \\"Sedges clearing\\". The name, then spelled Seuthwayt, first appeared in written records dating from 1340. A local landmark is the Newfield Inn, a pub that dates from the 16th century that is reputed to have been visited by William Wordsworth on his trips around the Lake District in the early 19th century. Another prominent local building is the Church of the Holy Trinity which was originally built in the early 16th century. William Wordsworth visited the church and dedicated one of his 35 Duddon Sonnets to the place and to Robert Walker (1709–1802) who was parson at the church for 66 years. The church contains a memorial plaque to Walker, who was known as \\"Wonderful Walker\\" because of his long and exemplary ministry. Wordsworth refers to him in the sonnet as someone \\"whose good works formed an endless retinue\\". The church itself was completely rebuilt in 1874 due to its rundown state, it was reconsecrated in May 1875.\\"Ordnance Survey Leisure Guide - Lake District\\", , Page 57, Gives information on Holy Trinity Church.www.achurchnearyou.com.

In narrative sequence it is preceded by Point of Impact, Black Light, and Time to Hunt. Plot The story begins with Bob Lee now living in Idaho. There along with his wife, former wife of his spotter Donny Fenn, he is cultivating his land by using a scythe. The story starts while Bob Lee is cutting away at his land with the scythe while an expensive car pulls up. Bob Lee is aggravated by this, since his previous encounters with such cars and men in them have led him into troublesome situations. Having this predisposition to the men within the car, Bob Lee confronts them to make them leave him and his family alone. Instead he finds a man roughly the same age as himself, looking for Bob Lee, since he is the son of the man that was killed by Bob's father during the battle of Iwo Jima.

He was made a baron de l'Empire on 9 September 1810, général de brigade on 30 January 1813, and acted as aide de camp to Napoleon himself. He fought with distinction in the first French Revolutionary Wars and became, under the First French Empire, a major in the dragoons of the Imperial Guard. Life Volunteering in 1791, he fought at the battle of Jemappes (and Neerwinden). Wounded in Italy in 1799, he continued on a military career in Austria, then Prussia, Poland and Russia despite receiving a new wound at the battle of Jena. Distinguishing himself in 1808 at the battle of Burgos, his service in Russia (notably in the battle of Malojaroslawitz) won him promotion to général de brigade. Wounded and distinguished again at Wachau, he still took part in the battle of Hanau, where his horse was killed under him. On 2 February 1814, he distinguished himself again at the Battle of Montmirail, and the following day was made général de division. On 19 March that same year, he impetuously attacked the enemy rearguard, captured a group of pontoons and closely pursued the Allies. During the Hundred Days, general Letort offered his services to Napoleon, who accepted and put him in command of the dragoons of the Imperial Guard. On 15 June, at the moment Napoleon gave the order to attack elements of Ziethen's Prussian I Corps (hidden in the woods of Fleurus), the Prussians began to retire. Impatient to see this corps escaping, Napoleon ordered his aide-de- camp Letort to take four service squadrons of the Guard and charge the enemy vanguard. Letort immediately charged in pursuit of the Prussian infantry, pushing off two infantry squares and wrecking one whole regiment, but fell mortally wounded by a bullet in the lower stomach and died two days later. His name is engraved on the north face of the Arc de Triomphe.

Creation The reservoir was constructed in 1970 by damming Quick's Creek. The state hoped the reservoir would provide a stable source of water for nearby communities in Scott County. The lake's water elevation does remain at a stable level, unlike the water elevations of most reservoirs. The dam that creates the reservoir is an earth filled dam, high and wide, downstream of of drainage area. The reservoir is now used as a back- up source of water for the Stucker Fork Conservancy District, whose primary source of water is the East Fork of the Muscatatuck River. When Hardy Lake was completed, Indiana governor Otis R. Bowen hailed it as part of his goal of having a park controlled by the state of Indiana within driving distance of every Hoosier.

It was released in 1986 on Chase Records. Beargarden were selected by Virgin Records Australia as their first Australian signing. Under their new label the band released a single, \\"The Finer Things\\", which was produced by Ross Cockle at AAV studios in South Melbourne and released in October 1984 with a film clip directed by John Hillcoat and featuring a young Noah Taylor. The single however made little impact on the charts. In July 1985, Beargarden began recording their debut album, All That Fall, at Albert Studios in Sydney with producers Bruce Brown and Russel Dunlop. A second single, \\"I Write the News\\", resulted from these sessions. The B-side, \\"Sixty Perfect Windows\\", had been recorded previously at Richmond Recorders, Melbourne, and was produced by Michael Hutchence and Andrew Farris (Hutchence provides backing vocals for the track). A film clip for \\"I Write The News\\" was directed by Paul Goldman (Australian Rules, The Night They Called It a Day, The Ben Cousins Story). All That Fall took a great many months to complete and during this time the band's inner turmoil again boiled to the surface. Bassist Ross Farnell was replaced by Simon Polinski, and Shaun Andersen (brother of guitarist Shane Andalou) was recruited as second guitar. These changes exacerbated the band's pre-existing instability and, after the release of a third single \\"Drink Drink Drink\\"', it folded. Paul Goldman directed a clip for \\"Drink Drink Drink\\" but, given the suggestive nature of the song title and the mistaking of burning scarecrows for burning crucifixes by the producers of Countdown, it failed to air and the single made little impact. Beargarden's disintegration was accompanied by acrimony and incidents of poor and/or outrageous behaviour on stage. Virgin quickly divested themselves of the product and All That Fall was ultimately released to little fanfare on Chase Records, accompanied by a fourth and final single \\"A Seaside Song\\".

Béchirian was a key player in the British new wave scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with Nick Lowe, Paul Carrack, Elvis Costello, The Undertones, Dave Edmunds, The Monkees, the Flamin' Groovies, and Squeeze. He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group Blanket of Secrecy, which issued one album in 1982. More recently, Béchirian has worked with the Trashcan Sinatras and Bell X1. Life and career Béchirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10. His engineering career started at Eden Studios, in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. Béchirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained Béchirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time. Stiff Records founder Dave Robinson sought out Béchirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster. He continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including Jethro Tull, Marc Bolan, Manfred Mann, Moody Blues, David Essex, Georgie Fame, The Damned, Clover and many others. Béchirian had come to the attention of various A&R; men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of Lene Lovich's first album, which produced her first hit single, \\"Lucky Number\\". Malcolm McLaren brought the Sex Pistols into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached Béchirian to work on his solo project, which was to become Jesus of Cool. As a result, he wanted Béchirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with Graham Parker, Huey Lewis and Clover, Elvis Costello, Rockpile, and others. Seymour Stein, founder of Sire Records, signed the Undertones, asking Béchirian to take on production duties for the band's first album. Béchirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. Jake Riviera, who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing Béchirian as manager. Béchirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album East Side Story, and their American breakthrough hit single \\"Tempted\\". Around that same time, he formed the band Blanket of Secrecy. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\\"Tinker\\", \\"Tailor\\" and \\"Soldier\\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities—as Béchirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group. However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up. The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years. Béchirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York. He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced The Monkees' 1986 reunion album Pool It! Looking for a new direction, Béchirian later formed Trick Management. Amongst his clients are Tom McRae and Bell X1. Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album Flock. Now based in London, Béchirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.

Watanabe opens Slave Widow with close-ups of Noriko Tatsumi's body rising and falling to the sound of heavy breathing, juxtaposed with images of the lake near her country villa. Watanabe's skillful use of sound is also evident in the contrast between Mitsuko and Kazuhiko's two love scenes. In the first, a lyrical scene which takes place near the lake in which Mitsuko will drown herself, the visuals are accompanied by natural sounds such as crickets, birds and water. In the second, which takes place in Tokyo, the desperation of Mitsuko's situation is emphasized with harsh city noises such as non-stop traffic. Thematically, the film criticizes the nouveau riche of Japan's post-war era in the person of Kitō. The conflict between romantic life and filial piety is also explored in the storyline involving Kitō's son Kazuhiko's affection for Mitsuko. This puts the son in conflict with his father both because Kitō desires to make Mitsuko his own mistress, and because Kazuhiko is expected to marry the daughter of Kitō's business partner. It is Mitsuko who pays for the breach of social protocol through her suicide.

It continued as both a fishing and continental tin trading port through the late Iron Age into the Early Medieval period, until the more prosperous Saxon settlement of Sutton, later renamed Plymouth, surpassed it. With its natural harbour and open access to the Atlantic, the town found wealth and a national strategic importance during the establishment of British naval dominance in the colonisation of the New World. In 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers departed from Plymouth to establish the second English colony in America. During the English Civil War the town was besieged between 1642 and 1646 by the Royalists, but after the Restoration a Dockyard was established in the nearby town of Devonport (later amalgamated with Plymouth). Throughout the Industrial Revolution Plymouth grew as a major mercantile shipping industry, including imports and passengers from the US, whilst Devonport grew as a naval base and ship construction town, building battleships for the Royal Navy – which later led to its partial destruction during World War II in a series of air-raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war was over, the city centre was completely rebuilt to a new plan. Toponymy For much of its earlier history, the settlement here was known as Sutton (Sutona in 1086, Suttona in 1201), simply meaning South town. It was based near Sutton Harbour, the oldest quarter of the modern city. The modern name has two parts: Plym and mouth. The element Plym is taken from the River Plym along which Sutton traded with its parent settlement of Plympton, but Plympton's name (first recorded as Plymentun in c. 900) is considered to derive from the Old English word for 'plum tree', though the local civic association suggests an alternative derivation from the Celtic Pen-lyn-don (\\"fort at the head of a creek\\"). By the early 13th century, the river was being called the Plym (Plyme, in 1238), as a back-formation from Plympton and Plymstock (first recorded as Plemestocha in 1086). The earliest records of the name Plymouth date from around this time (as Plymmue in 1230, Plimmuth in 1234). Plymouth notably lent its name to the settlement of Plymouth, Massachusetts following the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers aboard the Mayflower in 1620, as well as many other settlements in North America. Early history The earliest human remains in the Plymouth area are from a number of caves around Plymouth Sound. The 'bone caves', located at Cattedown, Oreston, Turnchapel and Stonehouse, contain extensive Upper Palaeolithic deposits, including those of Homo sapiens, some of the earliest such evidence in England. A reindeer bone from one of the Cattedown caves is dated 15,125 ± 390 years B.P. There is no public access to the caves, and they are not easily locatable or visitable. However their archaeological importance is very great, owing to both the geographical location of the Cattedown discovery, in a European context, and to the quantitative and qualitative nature and physical disposition of the human remains; this is one of the most important discoveries for the early history of anatomically modern humans in Europe. There is currently no evidence of Homo neanderthalensis having been found in caves at Cattedown, Oreston, Stonehouse or Mount Batten (Turnchapel). It was once thought, based on a reference to TAMARIS OSTIA ('Port of Tamar') in Ptolemy's Geographia, that tin brought from Dartmoor via the River Plym was traded with the Phoenicians here, but this theory was discounted by Malcolm Todd in 1987. However, evidence of copper ingots and copper scrap in contexts dating from the late Bronze Age to the Middle Iron Age have been found at Mount Batten, a promontory settlement jutting into Plymouth Sound, which was one of the main ports of trade in Prehistoric Britain.Barry Cunliffe, Mount Batten Plymouth: A Prehistoric and Roman Port (1988) Tin trading at Mount Batten in the region inhabited by the Dumnonii continued up to the period of Roman Britain (approximately 50 AD), but it had declined since the Iron Age. As a peripheral trading outpost of the Roman Empire this port continued to trade tin along with cattle and hides but was eclipsed by the rise of the fishing village of Sutton opposite. Later evidence suggests that the Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia retained a degree of autonomy from Rome, and the later Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex due to the significance of its tin mining activities. Archaeological evidence from the surrounding region of west Devon and east CornwallMedieval Devon and Cornwall; Shaping an Ancient Countryside, Edited by Sam Turner, 2006 suggests that the area was culturally distinct from the more easterly English heartlands well into the Middle Ages, the agricultural and architectural patternssee for example Dartmoor longhouse having much more in common with Atlantic South Wales, Ireland and Brittany. However, the extent to which the Brythonic Cornish language was spoken east of the Tamar remains a point of conjecture. At the time of the Domesday Book (1086) the manor of Sutton was held by the King, but Henry I granted it to the Valletort family of nearby Trematon Castle. The Valletorts in turn granted parts to the Augustinian priory at Plympton, a larger and older settlement than Plymouth, at the head of the tidal estuary of the River Plym. That part of the town owned by Plympton Priory was granted a market charter in 1254, and the whole town and its surrounding area achieved municipal independence in 1439, becoming the first town to be incorporated by Act of Parliament. As the higher parts of the Plym estuary silted up, ships used the Cattewater moorings and the then tidal harbour at the Plym's mouth instead of Plympton. And so the name of the town Sutton slowly became Plymouth. The name Sutton still exists in the name of its old harbour and a parliamentary division. Prysten House, Finewell Street, 1498, is the oldest surviving house in Plymouth, and built from local Plymouth Limestone and Dartmoor granite. The town was often the target of enemies across the English Channel, especially during the Hundred Years' War. In 1340 French attackers, who had been successfully burning towns along the coast by surprise, burned a manor house and took some prisoners, but failed to get into the town; by the time they reached Plymouth, they had lost the advantage of surprise. In 1403, the town was briefly occupied and burnt by Breton raiders. In the late fifteenth century Plymouth Castle, a \\"castle quadrate\\", was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms. The castle served to protect Sutton Pool, which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of Plymouth Dock. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth, and a series of fortifications were then built including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built (including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe).See 1591 Spry Map of Plimmouth and surrounding areas, British Library This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596, which itself went on to provide the site for the Citadel, established in the 1660s. Renaissance age A sketch of Plymouth, c. 1600 During the 16th century, Plymouth was the home port for a number of successful maritime traders, among them William Hawkins, who made the first English expeditions to West Africa in the 1530s; and his son Sir John Hawkins, who led England's first foray into the slave trade. The diary of his own son Admiral Sir Richard Hawkins inspired the Victorian novel Westward Ho! which romantically mythologises the historical exploits of the 'Men of Devon' of this era. However Sir Francis Drake, navigator, privateer and vice admiral of the British Royal Navy remains the city's most famous resident; though born in Tavistock, he was mayor of Plymouth from 1581 and is credited with bringing fresh water from Dartmoor to the flourishing town by means of an aqueduct now known as Drake's Leat and developing the Tudor fortifications around Sutton Harbour. The remains of once wealthy Elizabethan Merchant's houses can be still be seen in the city's Barbican quarter – which has also seen the first arrival and departure on British soil of many notable persons such as Catherine of Aragon and Pocahontas in 1501 and 1616 respectively. Outside the historic town walls, Plymouth Hoe, meaning high place, remains a wide grass meadow atop cliffs overlooking the natural harbour of Plymouth Sound. According to an enduring national myth, this is the place where Sir Francis Drake insisted on completing his game of bowls to allow wind and tide to change in his favour enabling his defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1589, the English Armada's assembly had been completed, and the fleet of 146 ships lay at mooring in Plymouth. However, due to poor planning, and a lack of both cavalry and siege artillery aboard the fleet, the expedition was ultimately defeated. Local histographer Sir Richard Carew of Antony in his Survey of Cornwall noted the presence in the early 17th century of large outline images of the giants Gog and Magog (or Goemagot and Corineus the mythical founder of Cornwall) which had been for a long time cut into the grass of the Hoe, exposing the white limestone beneath. There is no trace of these chalk figures today. In 1606 the Plymouth Company (the Plymouth Adventurers) was issued with a royal charter by James I of England with the purpose of establishing settlements on the coast of North America. A few years later, Plymouth was also the departure point of the Mayflower in 1620, aboard which the Pilgrim Fathers set sail for the New World, establishing the second permanent English colony in the United States of America. They eventually landed at a site which Captain John Smith had already named New Plymouth in a map published in his 1616 work A Description of New England pp. 69–71 and the Pilgrims accepted this name. Twin flags of the US and UK now fly at the Mayflower Steps to commemorate the significance of this event to both nations. Civil War, Restoration and William III During the English Civil War Plymouth, in common with the other major port towns, sided with the Parliamentarians and so was isolated from the surrounding regions of Devon and Cornwall which were held by Royalist sympathisers. The town was besieged almost continuously from December 1642 to January 1646; the main factor in its successful resistance was the navy's adherence to Parliament which allowed the regular arrival of supply ships and, when under serious Royalist attacks, enabled parties of seamen to be rushed ashore to reinforce the defences. Part of a contemporary map showing the defences Extensive works were constructed to defend the town, including a line of stockaded earthworks on high ground north of the town, from Lipson in the east to Eldad in the west, as well as several isolated works, for instance at Prince Rock, Cattedown and Stonehouse. Various skirmishes and confrontations occurred, including the rout of Royalist cavalry along Lipson Ridge on 3 December 1643, which is commemorated by a monument in Freedom Fields Park, and the battle of St Budeaux. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be a reminder to residents not to oppose the Crown. In the nearby parish of Stoke Damerel new dockyards at the mouth of the Tamar were commissioned by William of Orange in 1691 to support the Royal Navy in the western approaches. The settlement that developed here was called \\"Dock\\" or \\"Plymouth Dock\\" at the time, and a new town, separate from Plymouth, grew up. In 1712 there were 318 men employed and by 1733 it had grown to a population of 3,000 people. From then on, Plymouth became steadily more dependent on the Navy, and the thriving commercial port which had existed in the 17th century dwindled, as the activities of the press gang made it less attractive to merchant shipping. The first Eddystone Lighthouse was erected by Henry Winstanley in 1696 in an attempt to protect the increasing volume of shipping passing the treacherous reefs on the approach to Rame Head. The first Eddystone Lighthouse 1699 Napoleonic era A map of Plymouth in 1888. The 18th century marked a period of continued expansion and development for the ancient port town: the first theatre in Plymouth was built 1762, followed by the town's first bank in 1772. Similar growth took place in the two neighbouring towns of Stonehouse and Devonport (Plymouth-Dock). At Stonehouse was built the Royal Marine Barracks,1782, and the Royal Naval Hospital built 1762;. At Devonport additional docks were built in 1727, 1762 and 1793; the first ferry to Torpoint began operating in 1791; and the Military Hospital was built in 1797 opposite the parish church. The urban populations of Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse traded a variety of mineral ores such as copper, lime, tin and arsenic from the rural hinterlands via mining ports such as Morwellham Quay, Oreston the Stannary Towns of Tavistock and Plympton and small industrial towns throughout South Devon & East Cornwall.See also BBC TV Series Edwardian Farm 2010–11 Around 1745, local apothecary William Cookworthy unravelled the then unknown formula for Chinese porcelain and developed the earliest English porcelain ware, Plymouth China manufactured for just two years in the town, but establishing the China Clay extraction industry in the region. John Foulston's Town Hall, Column and Library in Devonport. The Three Towns now enjoyed some prosperity during the late 18th and early 19th centuries and were enriched by a series of neo- classical urban developments designed by London architect John Foulston. Foulston was an important and early advocate of the Greek Revival and was responsible for several grand public buildings, many now destroyed, including the Athenaeum, the Theatre Royal and Royal Hotel, and he was responsible for the implementation of Union Street a grand thoroughfare proposed to unite the Three Towns. Important local houses such as Saltram House seat of the Earls of Morley, Antony House, Mount Edgcumbe House and Trematon Castle were extensively rebuilt to the fashionable Georgian tastes of the day by notable architects including Robert Adam. HMS Bellerophon anchored in Plymouth Sound, with Napoleon Bonaparte aboard. Bonaparte had surrendered to Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland of the Bellerophon and been transported to England. After his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte was brought to Plymouth aboard HMS Bellerophon which remained in Plymouth Sound with the ex- emperor aboard for two weeks before his exile to St Helena. Under renewed threat of invasion from across the Channel, Plymouth Sound and the dockyards at Devonport once again assumed a critical strategic significance in the defence of the nation. Though the threat never materialised, the sound was heavily fortified at the recommendation of Lord Palmerston with early 19th- century gun emplacements installed at Mount Edgcumbe and St Nicholas Island (now Drake's Island), and with the construction of forts guarding the port on the headlands at the mouth of the harbour.Goodall, Chapter 15 Devonport became the departure point of many historic sea voyages, including the first voyage of James Cook in 1768 aboard HMS Endeavour, and the second voyage of HMS Beagle in 1831, carrying Charles Darwin. The third Eddystone Lighthouse, Smeaton's Tower, was assembled from granite at Millbay from 1756 to 1759 and marked a major leap forward in the development of lighthouse design – the upper portion remains the most iconic landmark of the modern city. Modernisation and urbanisation Part of an Ordnance Survey 1\\" map showing Plymouth in 1936 By comparison with the earlier eras, the later 19th century marked a period of consolidation and modernisation of a relatively stable military port industry, gradual decline in the importance of commercial trade and some growth in passenger shipping at the Millbay Docks which set the template until well into modern period. The railways arrived early in Plymouth, with industrial tramways serving the naval dockyard as early as 1724, and steam arriving with the South Devon Railway in 1848. The Royal Albert Bridge, built in 1859. Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed and constructed the iconic Royal Albert Bridge, completed 1859, for the Great Western Railway which did much to connect the isolated population of the Three Towns with the rest of the country. However, high rents in the cramped ancient tenements had resulted in overcrowding and unsanitary conditions documented in an 1852 Government report following the Public Health Act 1848, which suggested that conditions were the worst in Europe with the exception of Warsaw.Goodall, Chapter 30 The damning findings of the report resulted in large scale slum clearances of most of the ancient parts of the City and substantial public housing improvements. The Guildhall, Law Courts and Municipal Offices were constructed in the 1870sWorth, R N, FGS, \\"History of Plymouth from the Earliest Period to the Present Time\\", Messrs William Brendon & Son, Plymouth, 1890 in a French Gothic style and reflected the burgeoning civic pride in Plymouth as the commercial head of the Three Towns; most of the complex was later destroyed, however about one third, including the tower was remodelled in the 1950s. The bid for city status was eventually granted in 1928 and constituted as the City of Plymouth. Until World War II, the port at Millbay Docks was used for Transatlantic liner shipping, as it had been since the 1870s. Many of the surviving crew of the RMS Titanic disaster disembarked at Millbay docks on their return to England in 1912. During the First World War, Devonport Dockyard provided employment to around 20,000 workers, but after the war the ending of the naval arms race, the need to economise on government expenditure (culminating in the Geddes Axe), and the Great Depression jointly led to large declines in its workforce, down to a low of under 11,000 by 1933. Despite this, Plymouth suffered less than cities that were dependent on commercial shipbuilders: in 1932 unemployment in Plymouth was 20.6% compared to 30.7% in Glasgow and 34.2% in Barrow-in-Furness. A number of representations were made to the Admiralty for alleviating the high unemployment, including transferring part of the Dockyard's workforce and facilities to a commercial employer, converting part of the yard into a commercial port and the use of dockyard labour and facilities to do commercial work under the Admiralty's control. Only the last of these suggestions was adopted, and only to a limited degree. The 1931 census showed that despite the decline in Dockyard employment, 40% of the employed population of Plymouth were still working in either \\"Public Administration and Defence\\" or \\"Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering\\"—this is compared to 11% for the country as a whole—and 21% of the employed were directly engaged upon defence. Plymouth Pier, 1884 – the last by noted pier builder Eugenius Birch – and the unique Art Deco Lido Tinside Pool of 1935 were constructed as seafront leisure facilities reflecting the growing importance of tourism to the new city's economy. Union Street before 1941 showing the trams that used to run through the city World War II Due to its strategic proximity to the northern coast of France and its naval pre-eminence, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, an event known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, the two main shopping centres, most of the civic buildings and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. Charles Church has been left in its ruined state as a memorial to those civilians who died. On the Hoe stands a memorial to the many members of the Royal Navy from Plymouth who were killed in both World Wars. In June 1944 Plymouth was one of the principal staging posts for the Normandy Landings. General Omar Bradley and the 1st US Army embarked here for the landings at Omaha Beach and Utah Beach and after the initial bombardments some of the American battleships came to the dockyard for repair. Post war In 1943 Sir Patrick Abercrombie published his Plan for Plymouth in response to the devastation inflicted upon the city. Its Beaux Arts-inspired vision called for the removal of the few remaining pre-war buildings in the city centre and their replacement with wide, modern boulevards aligned east-west linked by a grand north-south avenue (Armada Way) linking the railway station with Plymouth Hoe.Gould, Jeremy: Architecture and the Plan for Plymouth: The Legacy of a British City, Architectural Review March 2007 The ruined Charles Church, the city's memorial to the civilians killed in the Blitz. The Plan had to deal not only with the effects of the War, but also the pre-war defects of the city: much of the housing and many narrow streets were overcrowded. The main concern was for housing, and many prefabs were built by 1946, followed by over a thousand permanent council houses built each year from 1951–1957 as part of the 'Homes fit for heroes' programme. The first estate, at Efford, was started in 1945 and this was rapidly followed by many others, laid out according to the Plan. By 1964 over 20,000 new homes had been built, more than 13,500 of them permanent council homes and 853 built by the Admiralty. Despite all this building, in 1971 over ten percent of the houses in Plymouth were still occupied by more than one family. After the war, the Admiralty required more space in the city and by 1950, after much discussion, were allocated. Devonport Dockyard was kept busy for many years refitting aircraft carriers such as the Ark Royal. By the time this work ended in the late 1970s the nuclear submarine base was operational. In the 1950s a new Royal Navy Engineering College was built at Manadon, and HMS Raleigh, the current basic training facility of the Royal Navy, was opened west of Torpoint. The army had substantially left the city by 1971, with Raglan Barracks and Plumer Barracks pulled down in the 1960s. However the Royal Citadel has been home to 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery since 1962, and 42 Commando Royal Marines has been based at Bickleigh Barracks north-east of the Barbican, since 1971. In 1962 Plymouth Civic Centre was constructed as a modernist 'slab-and-block' set piece to accommodate the city offices lost in the pre-War Guildhall complex – it was listed in 2007 to prevent its demolition. On 28 May 1967 Sir Francis Chichester returned to Plymouth after the first single handed Clipper Route circumnavigation of the world and was greeted by an estimated crowd of a million spectators on the Hoe and every vantage point from Rame Head to Wembury. In 1988, to mark the 400th anniversary of defeat of the Spanish Armada the majority of the city centre was pedestrianised, closed to vehicular traffic and the city centre was landscaped and a new shopping centre named the Armada Centre marked the transition to the tourist economy as the employment at the Dockyards began to fall away.

Biography His alternative name derives from Nouillonpont, a village in the Meuse département then in the jurisdiction of Lorraine. According to Vita Sackville West's Saint Joan of Arc, he was \\"of relatively gentle birth\\", though his parents were not noble. He had been in trouble \\"for swearing a vilain servant and for flinging an award of money on the ground\\", but was otherwise an ordinary \\"man of the sword\\". His acquaintance with Joan began when she arrived at the fortified city of Vaucouleurs in 1428. At the time, he was a squire in the service of Robert de Baudricourt. Their meeting included an exchange in which he asked her who her Lord was, to which she replied \\"God\\". De Metz provided her with men's clothing in order to further her desire to meet the King of France. It was the devotion of de Metz and his fellow soldier Bertrand de Poulengy that persuaded de Baudricourt to her cause. De Metz effectively became \\"the leader of the little troop\\", Joan's escort to Chinon, where she met King Charles VII; after this point, Jean aided Joan's efforts by furnishing her a horse and necessary clothing. An aide to the King provided de Metz with some 425 livres for the expenses of \\"the Maid\\" and himself, including armor. Though there were suspicions of these men travelling with an unmarried woman, de Metz declared at her trial that though he, Poulengy, and \\"la Pucelle\\" (Joan) slept side-by-side when they camped for the night, her garments were \\"closely shut\\", and he never felt any sexual desire for her, \\"by reason of the virtue I divined in her\\". After Joan's execution, de Metz was not forgotten: in 1444, Charles VII granted Jean a title of nobility, in recognition of his services \\"in our wars and elsewhere\\". Eleven years later, at Joan's nullification trial, de Metz was a witness, described as a nobleman in residence at Vaucouleurs. Alternative interpretations Sackville-West refers in an appendix to a theory by Joan's Jesuit biographer, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Ayroles, that the actions taken by de Metz (specifically his leaving her journey before she reached Nancy, France) may only make sense if he were \\"a kind of spy\\" sent, most likely at the behest of de Baudricourt, to determine Joan's \\"true or false worth\\". The argument hangs in part on the breach-of-promise action brought by Joan's father Jacques d'Arc, and Sackville-West finds Ayrole's interpretation faulty on several practical grounds, although she offers nothing to counter his view of de Metz. Portrayals In the 1948 film Joan of Arc (starring Ingrid Bergman) de Metz was played by Richard Derr. In the 1999 miniseries Joan of Arc, de Metz was portrayed by actor Chad Willett. In this telling, de Metz \\"gradually falls in love\\" with the saint, but never tells her of his feelings, remaining true to her even after her death. De Metz is a selectable player character in the 2004 videogame Wars and Warriors: Joan of Arc, is a minor character in the 1999 videogame, Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings and a major character in the 2007 PSP game Jeanne d'Arc.

History For the 1988 edition, editor Anthony Thwaite included all of Philip Larkin's published poetry as well as unpublished and incomplete work. Thwaite organized the poems in chronological order, meaning that poems from Larkin's four collections, his uncollected poems, and his unpublished work are interspersed throughout according to their date of composition.

Some critics considered the arrangement eccentric. In 2003, Thwaite prepared a new edition with a different arrangement. He also corrected typos and added back poem titles.

Its rocks are mostly highly siliceous strata that vary greatly in composition, stratigraphy, and tectono-stratigraphic history. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated in 2014 that the 1,750 square mile Monterey Formation could yield about 600 million barrels of oil, from tight oil contained in the formation, down sharply from their 2011 estimate of a potential 15.4 billion barrels.Sahagun, Louis (May 21, 2014) \\"U.S. officials cut estimate of recoverable Monterey Shale oil by 96%\\" Los Angeles TimesDrilling California: A Reality Check on the Monterey Shale J.

The study's review of the two resource projections from deep source rocks in the Monterey Formation developed by EIA concluded that both these estimates are highly uncertain.\\" Despite intense industry efforts, there has been little success to date (2013) in producing Monterey-hosted tight oil/shale oil, except in places where it is already naturally fractured, and it may be many years, if ever, before the Monterey becomes a significant producer of shale oil.So Much Shale Oil—but So Hard to Get, Wall Street Journal, Updated Sept. 23, 2013 The Monterey Formation strata vary. Its lower Miocene members show indications of weak coastal upwelling, with fossil assemblages and calcareous-siliceous rocks formed from diatoms and coccolithophorids. Its middle and upper Miocene upwelling-rich assemblages, and its unique highly siliceous rocks from diatom-rich plankton, became diatomites, porcelainites, and banded cherts. Shale oil resources and exploitation The Monterey formation has long been recognized as the primary source of the oil produced from other formations in Southern California; the Monterey itself has been very productive where it is naturally fractured. Since 2011, the possibility that hydraulic fracturing might make the Monterey Shale productive over large areas has gained widespread public attention.Josie Garthwaite, Monterey Shale shakes up California energy future, National Geographic, 27 May 2013. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2011, the Monterey Shale Formation contained more than half of the United States's total estimated technically recoverable shale oil (tight oil contained in shale, as distinct from oil shale) resource, about .US Energy Information administration, Review of emerging resources US shale gas and shale oil plays, July 2011. In 2012, the EIA revised its recoverable volume downward, to .US Energy Information Administration, Geology and technology drive estimates of technically recoverable resources, 20 July 2012. As of 2013 advances in hydraulic fracturing commonly called \\"fracking,\\" and the high price of oil resulted in spirited bidding by oil companies for leases. Occidental Petroleum and Venoco were reported to have been major players. The deposit lies below the surface. A widely cited March 2013 study released by the University of Southern California (USC) estimated that if extensive resource-play development of the Monterey through hydraulic fracturing were successful, it could generate as many as 2.8 million jobs and as much as $24.6 billion in state and local taxes.The Monterey Shale and California’s Economic Future University of Southern California, USC Price School of Public Policy, (March 2013. However, observers have pointed out that as of 2012, however large its theoretical potential, no one as yet has succeeded in making the Monterey Shale widely economic through hydraulic fracturing; to date it has been economic only in those limited locations already naturally fractured.David Brown, The Monterey Shale, big deal, or big bust?, AAPG Explorer, Nov, 2012.

He found the EIA report's assumptions on prospective well productivity to be \\"extremely optimistic,\\" and the total estimate of 15.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil \\"highly overstated.\\" He also found the USC study's assumption that development of the Monterey shale could increase California oil production as much as seven-fold to be \\"unfounded,\\" and the economic projections regarding jobs and tax revenue to be \\"extremely suspect.\\"Purd'homme, Alex (December 29, 2013) \\"'Fracking' the Monterey Shale -- boon or boondoggle?\\" Los Angeles Times Source rock The Monterey Formation is considered the source of 84% of the oil in known fields of the San Joaquin Basin, a total of 12.2 billion barrels of oil. Of this, 112 million barrels of oil in known fields is produced from the Monterey itself.Magoon and others, , US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1713, Chapter 8. The Monterey formation is the source for such giant oilfields as the Kern River, Elk Hills, Midway-Sunset Oil Field,Monterey Shale Continues to Tempt and Tease, AAPG Explorer, February 2013 and probable source for the overlying North and South Belridge Oil Fields. History Monterey Formation oil was discovered at the Orcutt Oil Field in the Santa Maria Basin of Santa Barbara County in 1901. This was quickly followed by other Monterey discoveries nearby, including the Cat Canyon Oil Field and Lompoc Oil Field. Each of these early Monterey discoveries depended on natural fractures in the Monterey. The Monterey Formation is one of the reservoirs in the Elk Hills Oil Field of Kern County.S.A. Reid and J.L. McIntyre, Monterey Formation porcelanite reservoirs of the Elk Hills Field, Kern County, California, American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 2001, v.85 n.1 p.169-189. Major Monterey production was also discovered in offshore oil fields, such as the South Ellwood Oil Field in the Santa Barbara Channel,Pressure buildup analysis in a naturally fractured reservoir, 1983. and the Point Arguello Field in the Santa Maria Basin.Mero, W.E., Thurston, S.P., and Kropschot, R.E., 1992, The Point Arguello Field, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978–1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, The North Shafter and Rose oil fields of Kern County, which produce primarily from the Monterey Formation, were discovered in 1983, but attempts to produce the oil have not been highly economic.Robert Sterling and others, North Shafter and Rose fields, Houston Geological Society Bulletin, 2003. Some horizontal wells were drilled in the Rose field in the early 2000s, with 2,500-foot lateral lengths and single-stage open-hole fracs; the results were said to be improvements over vertical wells.W.A. Minner and others, Rose field, Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2003. Carbon dioxide injection has been tested in the Monterey shale, with mixed results. \\"The main problem was that the carbon dioxide didn't increase production as much as hoped. ... That could be because the rock formation is so jumbled up, it's hard to find the right spot in which to inject the carbon dioxide.\\" Oil Firms Seek to Unlock Big California Field, Wall Street Journal, Sept. 22, 2013 Oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum are using acidizing to stimulate production in Monterey wells, and other companies are experimenting with proprietary mixes of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. \\"There's a lot of discussion around the Monterey Shale that it doesn't require fracking, that acidizing will be enough to open up the rock,\\" said Chris Faulkner, chief executive officer of Breitling Oil and Gas. Acidizing could rival fracking in Monterey Shale, San Francisco Chronicle, August 25, 2013 Opposition and regulation The Monterey Formation underlies the southern half of the San Joaquin Valley, a prime agricultural region. The possibility of environmental damage has caused some farmers in Kern County to press for close regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Opponents say that hydraulic fracturing poses risks in the seismically active region. The California legislature passed a bill regulating fracking in September 2013. Some environmentalists criticised the bill as being too lax.Mark Melincoe, Brown says he'll sign California bill regulating fracking, Bloomberg, 12 Sept, 2013. Some environmentalists promised not to rest until fracking is banned completely. Oil industry representatives criticized the bill as too restrictive. The measure was supported by state Sen. Fran Pavley, author of a fracking bill defeated the previous year.Stephen Stock, California fracking law has huge holes, critics argue, NBC Bay Area, 13 Sept. 2013 The bill, which Governor Jerry Brown promised to sign, provided for disclosure of chemical used, pre-testing of nearby water wells, and a study on environmental and safety issues to be completed by January 2015.California lawmakers approve fracking bill, NBC Bay Area, 12 Sept. 2013. Given the very limited success with fracking the Monterey to date, some find the controversy \\"much ado about little.\\" In Santa Barbara County, Santa Maria Energy LLC (SME) has proposed a total of 136 wells in the Monterey formation that would use cyclic steam injection to produce tight oil. In 2013, the county planning commission declined its staff's recommendation to approve the project, calling for more study on concerns raised by environmentalists about greenhouse-gas emissions. The County Board of Supervisors approved the proposed project on November 18, 2013 and SME was cited as a model operator and applicant during the proceedings.

Napoleon ended his reign with a series of Pyrrhic victories which could not save the Empire, and he abdicated on 5 April 1814. In a Paris occupied by the forces of the Coalition, the National Guard ensured public order by wearing a white cockade, abandoning the Revolutionary tricolour cockade, and it was on this corps that the returning Bourbons chose to found their power, rather than the Imperial armies and their officers, which they judged still to be too unreliable. Creation King Louis XVIII arrived in Paris on 3 May with his brother Charles de Bourbon, Comte d’Artois, the future Charles X. It was then that little medals with the image of the new king and fleurs de lys, on white ribbons, began to circulate to reassure and appease the Paris population. One of the comte d’Artois's orders of the day, on 26 April 1814, created the Décoration du Lys for the garde nationale of Paris as \\"a perpetual sign of the services it has rendered, whether in fighting for their homes and, charged alone on the night of 30 March with ensuring Paris's guard and safety, preserving the king's capital for the king and the goods, lives and honour of so many families, or - when occupying posts beside those of the troops of the line - it rendered them an example of devotion and sacrifice, or when - despite this painful service - it acted as the maison militaire du Roi and granted the royal family the satisfaction of, for their guard, not being surrounded by the French.\\" By an order of the day on 9 May 1814, king Louis XVIII approved the creation of the Décoration du Lys, extending it to all the gardes nationales of France. It was awarded to the national guards after they took the following oath - \\"I swear fidelity to God, and to the King, forever\\" The granting of the Décoration du Lys induced the grant of an official patent. Assuring the loyalty of the social elite to the new monarchy thanks to this simple honour, the award of the Décoration du Lys would be extended again and again, quickly starting to be awarded in all France's regions then royal officials granted them successively to generals, ministers, prefects, and finally even mayors. It was banned during the Hundred Days, then reinstated on the Second Restoration, only to be suppressed once and for all by an ordinance of Louis Philippe I on 10 February 1831. Beneficiaries * Order of 26 April 1814: the Décoration du Lys was to be granted solely to the troops of the national guard of Paris \\"officers, sous-officiers, grenadiers or chasseurs who have justified their well-deserving them\\" * Order of 9 May 1814: the granting of the Décoration du Lys was extended to all the national guards of France.

Bars *Ordinance of 9 May 1814 : for civil holders, the king authorised the wearing of a simple white ribbon, sometimes with a three- band bar, generally in silver but sometimes in gold, representing a reduction of the croix du Lys, or a lily (often crowned and bordered by two olive branches) As with the croix du Lys, some bore the inscription Gage de la paix- Vive le Roi. These bars were sometimes borne on the ribbon of the Légion d’Honneur. Insignia * Ordinance of 26 April 1814 : a simple fleur de lys in silver. * Ordinance of 9 May 1814 : a silver fleur de lys from the royal crown. * Ruling of 31 August 1816 : after too many abuses of the insignia (mostly eccentric), the count of Artois fixed the definitive rules for wearing the Décoration du Lys. * 5 May 1824 : the grand chancellor of the Légion d’honneur recalled that \\"the Décoration du Lys having furnished a pretext for a multitude of abuses, the king put its supervision under the grand chancellor. He therefore recalled that this decoration must only be a simple silver fleur de lys hung from a white ribbon or of the colours set out for each of the departments of the kingdom (...) The mania for ribbons and decorations, the cupidity of some jewellers, fantasies and whims, made some imagine and make several forms, imitating royal or foreign orders. It was ruled that each ribbon must be worn only for one department and the simple, long-established fleur de lys was to be the only one allowed; all the others were abolished and must disappear.\\" Did an Ordre du Lys exist? The Décoration du Lys was often called the Ordre du Lys. Even if from 1824 it was controlled by the grand chancellory of the Légion d’honneur, it never had a Grand Master or a chancellory of its own, and is never called an Order in the official documents. Décoration de la Fidélité In 1816 the 600 National Guards serving in Paris in 1815 received the Fidelity Decoration, created by order of Louis XVIII on 5 February 1816 to replace the Décoration du Lys. Strictly speaking, it was not a new decoration but mainly a particular version of the Décoration du Lys, albeit one strictly reserved for these 600 Guards. It was in gold, and not widely awarded. Again, official texts speak of a \\"decoration\\" rather than an \\"order\\" of fidelity.

It's similar to Kvevri which is widely used for wine farming in Georgia to this day. Dolia at Ostia Antica. Description Though many modern authors make the mistake of translating a dolium as a wooden barrel, it was actually a very large jug or container made of fired clay. Oval in shape, with a wide mouth and rim, it was much larger than the amphora, a similar pottery container. The dolium had no neck or handles and, in many cases, could measure up to six feet in height. Some dolia have a rounded body tapering into a flat bottom, while more frequently, dolia maintained a rounded bottom. They were lined with pitch or wax in order to contain or process liquids and solid foods. Some sources mention dolia holding up to 50 quadrantals, equivalent to 346.5 gallons. Though there was no standard size for dolia, even the smallest capacity recorded by Pliny the Elder was large for Roman earthenware containers. History Dolia, earthenware storage jars for grain and other agricultural products embedded in the ground at the Oppidum of Enserune, France Much of what modern scholars know about the dolium comes from ancient Latin literature. Sources which address agriculture, significantly De Agri Cultura by Cato the Elder, Res Rustica by Varro, Res Rustica by Columella, and the Res Rustica by Palladius, help us determine the size, appearance and purposes of the dolia. Because these sources deal with rural matters of the time, they also give scholars an insight into the life and culture of ancient Rome in addition to specific information about use of the dolium. Another noteworthy source is the Digest of Justinian. It is a collection of quotations from earlier works of Roman jurists that discuss the importance of the integration of dolia in ancient Roman society. These sources, along with a variety of other less significant sources where dolia are only briefly mentioned, characterize the dolia as the largest type of earthenware vessel made by the Romans.Brenni, G. M. R. 1985. “The Dolia and the Sea-Borne Commerce of Imperial Rome.” MA thesis, Texas A&M; University. Use and purpose There is evidence to support the claim of many classical archaeologists that dolia were used exclusively on land for the processing and storage of foodstuffs. For instance, dolia were manufactured for the most part by travelling specialist potters or by workshops that were involved principally in production of architectural ceramics. Dolia were used in food production areas, such as farmhouses, and selling points like taverns and town warehouses. Dolia were also used in theatres for their acoustic qualities (presumably for special sound effects). The two methods of storing dolia were to either bury them half way in the ground or standing under a roof. They were used to hold goods such as wine, grape husks, olive oil, amurca, wheat, and other common grains. Many dolia hold record amounts of 40-50 quadrantals (quadrantals being the general amount held in one amphora). Unlike the amphora, the dolium was not regarded as an accessory and sold along with the wine that it contained. Rather, dolia were fixed facilities not employed for the distribution of wine. Its major purpose was for the permanent storage capacity of goods.Pena, T. J. 2007. Roman Pottery In The Archaeological Record. New York: Cambridge University Press. 20, 46-49. However, dolia were also commonly used in conjunction with transport facilities such as merchant ships and temporary storage places like harbor warehouses. Surprisingly given their construction, dolia were often used in overseas transport. Recent archaeological discoveries indicate two or three rows of dolia were sometimes positioned along the keel of a merchant ship, apparently cemented in place to prevent shifting with the ship's movement at sea. This technique allowed dolia to serve as fixed receptacles for the transport of wine. The high prices of dolia is evidence to indicate that their incorporation into maritime transportation represented a substantial investment of funds. Also, given their great weight and bulk, replacement must have represented both an inconvenience and an expense. Thus, extraordinary caution must have been placed when handling the dolia to preserve and maintain their useful life. Ethnographic research indicates that in many cases dolia remained in use for several decades, and therefore, it seems plausible to suggest that dolia regularly remained in prime use for up to 20–30 years and perhaps longer. Dolia in maritime commerce Positions of dolia in ships While the mystery of the dolia in relation to maritime commerce is still being researched, archaeologists have substantial evidence from shipwrecks to support its significant, yet short role. One of the most striking evidences of the use of dolia in the commerce of food supplies is their presence on board Roman merchant ships. There have been at least seven shipwrecks discovered carrying dolia, dating between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. Three of the most interesting and identifiable shipwrecks that lend themselves to study of dolia are the Diano Marina, the Petit Congloue, and the La Giraglia shipwrecks. The Diano Marina shipwreck (IM, Liguria, Italy) was discovered with fifteen dolia still intact. Its relatively deep underwater location provided sufficient protection from both natural and human disturbances to allow for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. The dolia from this shipwreck were found to be two different shapes, corresponding to two different positions on board the ship. Four long, cylindrical dolia were located in a line along the keel of the ship, while ten shorter, more rounded dolia were divided into two lines and laid alongside the central dolia. This type of disposition seems to be related to the structure of the ship and most likely implies that the lips of all the dolia were lying at an even level. The preservation of the Diano Marina's entire cargo provides a rare chance to estimate the capacity of Roman ships. Based on the calculations of the capacity of the central cylindrical dolia and the surrounding rounded dolia on board, the total capacity of the dolia on board the “Diano Marina” would have been approximately 9,500 gallons. The “Petit Congloue” shipwreck (Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhone, Provence, France) was discovered in a similar environment as the “Diano Marina” shipwreck. Its relatively deep underwater location sufficiently protected the site from disturbances as well, which also allowed for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. However, in the “Petit Congloue” shipwreck, the dolia are all unfortunately silted up to their shoulders, making it impossible to distinguish their different shapes. But their disposition clearly shows the same pattern of three lines parallel to the keel as in the “Diano Marina” shipwreck, which allows us to further specify that the vases in each line were actually sized compared to the ones in the neighboring line. It is important to note here that even though this shipwreck does not allow us to study the shapes of these particular dolia, the sporadic recovery of single dolia from the sea without its known origins basically shows two different and distinct shapes: cylindrical or rounded. Construction of Dolia Ships The “La Giraglia” shipwreck, discovered off the coast of Corsica, France, is particularly interesting because it is officially recognized as a cistern boat. This type of vessel was intended to transport dolia in bulk as the dolia appear to have been placed in the hold as the ship was being built. The “La Giraglia” was carrying at least eight dolia and its excavation gives insight into the ship’s design and how such vessels contributed to patterns of trade in the western Mediterranean. The cistern boat was an innovation in ship construction, intended to respond to changes in the production and transportation of wine brought about by Roman expansion. The cistern boat began being built during the Augustan Period, and continued until the 2nd century. The relatively short period of production for this ship-type suggests that there were problems with its design which caused the design to be superseded. Because each discovery illuminates the ways in which maritime commerce adapted to the demands of production and transportation, the “La Giraglia” shipwreck is essential in the understanding of mutual exchange within the Mediterranean. As this dolia ship came to a very traumatic ending, there is little left to be excavated and studied of the hull. The hull planking is also poorly preserved, but there were, however, thirteen strakes that may serve for extrapolation to the design of the entire ship. The strakes were fastened together by pegged mortise and tenon joinery and assembled in the classic shell-first construction. The spacing between mortises and the width of the mortises is very tight and they also appear to be slightly wider than the tenons. It is believed that the space left within the mortises was intended to compensate for possible misalignment of opposite mortises. It appears that they were arranged in a straight line, rather than alternating from the inboard to the outboard edge and the back inboard in order to prevent the wood from splitting. Twenty-six frames were also identified and recorded from the “La Giraglia” dolia shipwreck. The large quantity of nails indicates their significance as a strengthening element in the assemblage of the frames with the planking. The “La Giraglia” was a medium-sized ship, but possessed a few rather unusual characteristics because the discovery and study of the twenty-six frames reveal that 58.8% of the preserved hull was composed of oak. The use of oak solely for the hull planking has never before been seen in the Mediterranean. However, given the fragmented nature of the remaining wreck, this preponderance of oak in the surviving portions may not reflect the composition of the rest of the original ship. It could have perhaps only been used for the bottom of the hull, which would certainly be an interesting characteristic for such cistern boats. The ship builder might have thought it necessary to use this hardwood because the weight of the cargo was concentrated in the center section of the ship. Overall, there were six species of wood used in the construction of the “La Giraglia”: oak was used for the frames and tenons, beech and elm also for the frames, ash made up the small pegs used in the hull planking, and fir and two other types of oak. The shipwright obviously knew how to use the available species appropriately for the construction of the different structures and elements of the ship. “Whatever the answers to the numerous questions raised about the dolia vessels or cistern boats, these ships must be considered not only as a technical innovation of their time, but also as a daring enterprise. The presence of huge containers in the hold presented an obvious and real danger. The rupture of a full dolium would have caused almost two tons of wine to pour rapidly into the hold, which could have resulted in a sudden destabilization and capsizing of the vessel. In spite of the advantages of dolia over amphoras, the obvious risks may explain why cistern boats disappeared”.Marlier, S. and P. Sibella. 2002, “La Giraglia, a dolia wreck of the 1st century BC from Corsica, France: study of its hull remains.” International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 31.2: 161-71. Recent discovery A new dolia shipwreck has recently been discovered on the seabed just off the coast of the Tuscan island of Elba. The contents of the Roman ship were perfectly preserved, containing nine intact dolia that measured two meters high and five meters round. Experts estimate the ship to be about twenty-two meters in length and date back to the time of the first Roman empire. \\"This is the first time a complete, inviolate wreck has been found,\\" Michelangelo Zecchini, an archaeologist who works for the Forum UNESCO commented. \\"However in itself just the number of containers and their superb condition makes this a truly astounding discovery”.“Mystery of seabed resolved with 2,000 year old ship’s discovery.” The Roman Hideout. http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2002/irna20020824.asp (26 April 2009). Excavation remains slow and tedious as the shipwreck lies under a meter of lime, but archeologists are hoping that this discovery will provide valuable information and details about the layout and cargo of the ship, as well as cargo ships like it. Doing so will help historians better understand and study the shipping routes of the Mediterranean in antiquity. ProMare, a non-profit organization that promotes marine discovery and archeology around the globe, is currently heading up the excavation process. It began on September 2, 2008 and represents current attempts to use modern technology in the excavation process. So far, it has been discovered that the ship was carrying ten dolia with a capacity of 400-450 gallons each. The project plans to continue excavating the site in 2009 with the use of a custom-built remotely operated vehicle.Gambogi, P., et al. 2008. “Dolia Shipwreck.” Promare: Promoting Marine Research and Exploration. (26 April 2009). Conclusions Study and analysis of shipboard use of dolia on Roman merchant ships indicates a strong similarity to how dolia were used on land. “It seems that dolia were made in a shape that allowed them to fit perfectly inside a ship in order to leave minimal empty space. The central row was composed of the highest cylindrical dolia, while the two other lines, laid on both sides of the central one, were composed of shorter and more rounded vases. The very tight disposition of the dolia has led to the deduction that these containers were never removed from their places on board ship and that when they carried wine, it had to be poured in and out at the ports-of-call. This conclusion is supported by the fact that all the dolia found on Roman port buildings were imbedded in the ground, and therefore were also irremovable.” In terms of maritime commerce, two assumptions about dolia presented: one, dolia were intended to carry wine and two, they were irremovable within the ships that carried them. This is supported by an ambiguous passage of Latin text from Pliny’s Digest that talks about wine being poured for ships specialized for wine. This would draw the conclusion that ships carrying dolia were specifically transporting only wine. “Perhaps one of the most interesting results of the search for information on dolia is the fact that they have been found in considerable quantities in every step of a system of food supply which was related to the overseas trade. In fact, the archaeological evidence confirms the existence of a commercial organization, which would buy a certain food commodity, most likely wine, stored in dolia… In a second step the same commodity may be been further transported to other dolia in other warehouses located closer to possible buyers… All the archaeological and literary evidence support this vision” of the role of dolia in maritime commerce.

New York: Coffee House Press, 1990. Told from the first-person perspective of a self-conscious extraterrestrial ball that floats six inches from the head of Kazumasa Ishimaru, a Japanese expatriate who relocates to Brazil in search of job opportunities, the novel details the rise and devastation of an Amazonian community after the discovery of the Matacão, a resilient and seemingly magical and impenetrable black substance found on the floor of the rainforest on the farm of Brazilian farmer Mané Pena. The presence of the Matacão leads to a variety of conflicts that result in several distinct but interconnected plot strands: # In the first, pilgrims flock to the site as the Matacão becomes the site of religious miracles. # Batista and Tania Aparecida Djapan collude with media outlets, and converge upon the area to make use of it as a site of advertising and media spectacle. # Mané Pena becomes a new age healer who heals with broadcast the mysterious nature of the region # Corporate entities, manifest as the American conglomerate GGG and its extraordinary representative J.B. Tweep, arrive to explore commercial potential of the site and substance # Kazumasa is invited to the Matacão by J.B. Tweep as one of GGG's major stockholders, and becomes a prisoner of the ambitious man As the threads converge, the area experiences a boom of economic and corporate growth and development. As more people arrive, as more of the Matacão is transformed into commercial products, or used as a site of entrepreneurial opportunity, and Brazil becomes more globally connected the area suffers severe exploitation and deterioration. The characters of the novel then become increasingly isolated and estranged, with the only person finding temporary happiness being the American businessman, Tweep. Eventually, the narrative reveals that the Matacão is actually a byproduct of industrial waste, and with that the Matacão dissolves and retreats. All of the products and benefits that had been made possible by Matacão vanish. List of characters and figures Kazumasa Ishimaru Kazumasa Ishimaru is a Japanese railroad engineer and a primary character of the novel. As a child, Ishimaru encounters a sentient alien object that attaches itself to his head. This sentient ball serves as the quasi-omniscient narrator of the novel. Ishimaru and the ball migrate to Brazil after he is displaced as a rail worker with the introduction of new technologies to maintain the national rail system. In Brazil he takes on a job with the São Paulo Municipal Subway System. Mané da Costa Pena Mané Pena is a Brazilian native of the rainforest. He is a farmer on whose land the Matacão is discovered. After the discovery of the Matacão, Mané Pena unwittingly becomes a New Age guru wielding a magic feather that heals. Matacão The Matacão is an anomalous black substance discovered in the Brazilian rainforest that resembles a malleable plastic. It is attributed with mysterious powers and abilities which draws religious pilgrims, and also attracts the attention of the media coverage and corporate entities, namely the American transnational corporation GGG, in attempts to monetize, own, or gain access to the substance. Chico Paco Chico Paco is a Brazilian native and pilgrim to the Matacão. He sees news coverages of the Matacão on television and decides that the Matacão must be a divine place. He lives next door to Dona Maria Crueza and her invalid grandson Gilberto. Chico Paco volunteers to make the 1,500 mile trek to the Matacão on foot, and then builds an altar to Saint George on the Matacão at the request of Dona Maria Crueza to fulfill a promise made to Saint George once Gilberto is miraculously healed. This altar stirs controversy amongst local government officials, The Church, and media outlets about the legality of placing an altar on the Matacão. The altar itself then becomes a destination for pilgrims Jonathan B. Tweep J. B. Tweep is a highly efficient, three-armed, corporate bureaucrat working for the U.S. corporation GGG. He travels to Brazil to examine the Matacão and its potentials for commercial uses. Rather than viewing his extra arm as a deformity, Tweep was proud of it: \\"He accepted his third arm as another might accept ESP, and addition of 128K to their random access or the invention of the wheel. As far as J.B. was concerned, he had entered a new genetic plane in the species. He even speculated that he was the result of Nobel prize-winning sperm. He was a better model, the wave of the future.\\"Yamashita, Karen Tei. Through of the Arc of the Rainforest. New York: Coffee House Press, 1990. 30. Lourdes  Lourdes is Kazumasa's Brazilian maid and a single mother. She becomes Kazumasa's lucky charm and he attributes his sudden increase in wealth (via winning lottery tickets) to her. Kazumasa later realizes he has feelings for Lourdes. Michelle Mabelle Michelle Mabelle is a highly competent French Ornithologist who travels to the Matacão to study the local birds and the magical feathers. She surrounds herself with a menagerie of exotic birds that she names and treats as children. She becomes the object of affection for J. B. Tweep, who thinks she is his perfect match because of her three breasts, which make her a match for his three arms. Batista and Tania Aparecida Djapan This couple are the neighbors of Kazumasa, with whom they share a back porch. They are depicted as a passionate couple that fights constantly. Upon taking in a wounded pigeon, Batista and Tania's relationship shifts from being heated and tumultuous to being a more harmonious one. Their wounded pigeon eventually becomes a faithful carrier pigeon who brings out the entire community to watch his return and read the notes Batista sends with the bird. Criticism and significance Although generally viewed as an Asian American text, Through the Arc of the Rainforest has also been an important text for scholars of eco-criticism, media studies, transnationalism, and globalization. Literary critic Ursula Heise, for example, writes of the Matacão: The text has also been recognized for its post-colonial critique, as Aimee Bahng situates the book in relation to the purchase of 2.5 million acres of Amazon rainforest in Pará, Brazil, by Henry Ford in 1927 to establish a rubber plantation known as Fordlândia:  Awards  * 1991 - American Book Award * 1991 - Before Columbus Foundation American Book Award * 1990 - Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize References Further reading *Murashige, Michael S.

Having existed for more than 300 years, it is the oldest still-existing officers' academy in the world.  The education  All aspirants (unlike many navies all candidates begin their time as aspirants and then become cadets) begin their education with 6 months of basic military training and general seamanship. Parts of this at the Naval NCO and Basic Training School (Danish: Søværnets Sergent- og Grundskole) near Frederikshavn and other parts on the training vessel Georg Stage. This goes to both aspirants that begin their education without prior military service and those who are recruited among enlisted and petty officers. Then follows an intensified NCO-training for another 6 months. If these periods are completed and passed, then the aspirant will move onto the Naval Academy. Here follows the education for the two functional lines (either the master-line for 4 years or engineering-line for 4½ years). Included in these periods, where the aspirants of each line, is separated, is also an 11 months leadership training period, where both lines are educated together in courses like leadership, naval warfare, naval history, teaching, psychology, administration, social sciences and economics. At this time, the aspirant becomes a cadet. After 5–5½ years of training and education from the very start the aspirant is commissioned as an officer. Besides career-officers, the naval academy also trains civilian licensed marine engineers and first officers, towards naval commissioning. This training period is 11 months for first officers, and 14 months for engineers. The naval academy also runs the junior staff officers course. This course runs for 11 months, and requires satisfactory service as an OF-1 (Danish premierløjtnant).  History  * January 1701: General-Admirallieutenant Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve proposes the creation of a Søe Cadet Compagni (\\"Sea Cadet Company\\"), in which young men can receive training in seamanship, military tactics, and navigation for the purpose of becoming naval officers. * 26 February 1701: King Frederick IV approves the creation of the Søe Cadet Compagni. : Inspiration for the Company was found in the Netherlands and France, where systematic training of naval officers had begun as early as the 16th century. The creation of this Company was also the foundation of the second academic education facility in Denmark, preceded only by the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479). The educational facility initially was located at Bremerholm, close to Holmen Church (approximately at the current location of the Ministry of Defence). * 26 April 1701: Commodore C. T. Sehested adjourns as the first chief of Søe Cadet Compagniet. * 1709: The Søe Cadet Compagniet is renamed the Søe Cadet Academy (\\"Sea Cadet Academy\\"). * 1727: The Academy is removed to the twenty- three-year-old opera house (the building now houses the Eastern High Court). * 1788: The Academy is removed to the northeastern palace (Brockdorff's Palace) of Amalienborg Palace. * 1827: The Academy is removed to the Søbøtkerske mansion, on the corner of Bredgade and Esplanaden. The mansion itself no longer stands, but a bookstore is now located at the site. * 1865: The Academy is removed to the former administrative complex of the naval artillery on Christiansholm. These buildings do still exist; they now house the Danish naval museum Orlogsmuseet and the Danish Maritime Safety Administration (in Danish, the Farvandsvæsnet). * 1869: The Søe Cadet Academiet is renamed the Søofficersskolen (\\"Sea Officers' School\\") and is removed to a facility at Gernersgade, in Nyboder. This facility was built in 1856, originally to house a girls' school. Today, the building houses several companies. * 1903: The Søofficersskolen is renamed the Kadetskolen (\\"Cadets' School\\"). * 1946: The School is removed to its current buildings, on Holmen Naval Base. The buildings had been completed in the 1930s, but relocation of the School had been postponed by the outbreak of World War II and subsequent German occupation of Denmark. * 1951: The Kadetskolen is renamed the Søværnets Officersskole, by which it is known currently. * 1964: Aspirants and cadets are no longer required to live at the School (lodging at the School now is not even possible); presently, most aspirants and cadets are housed by the navy in Nyboder. * 1966: A naval cadets' association (the Søværnets Kadetforening) is created as a social and educational institution. * 1969: The naval specialty officers' school (the Søværnets Specialofficersskole) is disbanded and all instruction is conducted at the naval academy. * 1970: The program of education is completely restructured and ten faculties are created. * 2007: Under the 2005–2009 defence agreement, the naval musical corps (the Søværnets Tamburkorps) is moved to Holmen and made part of the naval academy, as are all training facilities on Holmen.

The Kramgasse (\\"Grocers Alley\\") is one of the principal streets in the Old City of Bern, the medieval city centre of Bern, Switzerland. It was the center of urban life in Bern until the 19th century.de Capitani, 8. Today, it is a popular shopping street. Its length, slight curve and long line of Baroque façades combine to produce Bern's most impressive streetscape.Caviezel et al., 188. The Kramgasse and its buildings are a heritage site of national significanceSwiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 103. and part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site that encompasses the Old City. Topography The Kramgasse is some longHofer, 242. and lies at the center of the old city. It is the western half of the central axis of the city's oldest part, the Zähringerstadt, built right after the founding of the city in 1191. It is bounded to the west by the Zytglogge, Bern's iconic clock tower that served as the city's main gate tower in the 12th century. In the east, the Kreuzgasse, literally a \\"crossroads\\", separates it from the other half of the old main street, the Gerechtigkeitsgasse. Several narrow alleys and passageways connect the Kramgasse to the parallel Rathausgasse in the north and the Münstergasse in the south. The Kramgasse cannot be reached by car without a special permit. It is accessible by foot, bike or by means of the Bernmobil bus line no. 12 that runs through it and has stops at either end of the street (Zytglogge and Rathaus). Both sides of the Kramgasse are covered with Lauben, stone arcades that protect pedestrians from inclement weather. History A 19th century market day in the Kramgasse. The Kramgasse was known as the Märitgasse (Swiss German for \\"Market Alley\\") until the 15th century and as the Vordere Gasse during the 16th century. The changes in name reflect the street's changes in character. In medieval times, it served as the city's marketplace, but after the Reformation the market stands were gradually replaced by stores.Hofer, 243. The street remained the commercial center of the city until the middle of the 19th century,Hofer, 243; de Capitani, 11. its heyday being the 1840s.de Capitani, 11. Over the centuries, the street was slowly gentrified. Throughout the 19th century, residents complained about the waste, smell and noise associated with the Schaal, an open hall of butcher's stalls vis-à-vis the Simsonbrunnen. The Schaal was eventually demolished in 1938 and a conservatory built in its place, disrupting the medieval streetscape.Caviezel et al., 191.; de Capitani, 23. Local legend has it that a calf once flayed alive here still haunts the place of its death with frightful bleats.de Capitani, 9. In the second half of the 19th century, the commercial significance of the Kramgasse waned as business moved to the newer, western part of the city and the authorities shut down the many noisy cellar taverns. At the turn of the 20th century, the Kramgasse was already a tourist attraction.de Capitani, 15. Beginning in the 1920s, buses and tramways were routed through it,de Capitani, 18. and from the 1970s on, motor traffic was gradually prohibited throughout the lower Old City.de Capitani, 24. The number of apartments on the Kramgasse steadily dwindled as they came to be replaced by shops and offices.de Capitani, 26. In 2005, the street was thoroughly renovated and its cobblestone pavement replaced. The city ditch (Stadtbach) running through the middle of the street since medieval times is now visible again through metal gratings. Buildings The Kreuzgassbrunnen and the full length of the Kramgasse, as seen from the Kreuzgasse. Apart from a few cellars, only fragments of the current buildings on the Kramgasse date from before 1500.Hofer, 246. Many of the private town-houses retain elements from the Late Gothic period.Hofer, 250; Caviezel et al., 189. There are very few preserved 17th century façades.Hofer, 253. Between 1705 and 1745, the façades and parts of the interior of 72 of the street's 85 buildings were rebuilt in the Baroque style, many of them by the noted architect Albrecht Stürler or his students. The Lauben on the Kramgasse and the Zähringerbrunnen. Postcard from around 1900. Three fountains decorate the street. At the eastern crossroads, the KreuzgassbrunnenLocation: was the model for all other obelisk fountains of Bern; it was built 1778–79 by Christian Reist and Johann Conrad Wiser. In the center, the SimsonbrunnenLocation: was built in 1527 and decorated with a figure by Hans Gieng of Samson taming the lion in 1543. The ZähringerbrunnenLocation: at the western end of the street is Bern's first figure-topped fountain, an interesting combination of historical tradition and heraldic personification. It was built by Hans Hiltprand in 1535, depicting an armoured bear – Bern's heraldic beast – bearing the arms of the house of Zähringen. The guild hall in the Zunfthaus zu Kaufleuten. House no. 2, at the eastern end of the street, houses Bern's oldest apothecary's since 1527; the 1824 hardwood interior of the drugstore is unique as the earliest witness of the Gothic Revival in Bern.Caviezel et al., 189. The cellar of house no. 4 dates from the 13th century, Bern's oldest building period. House no. 7 is completely preserved in its state of 1559 and the city's most impressive ensemble of secular Late Gothic architecture; its rich interior is preserved in the Historical Museum.Caviezel et al., 189–90. No. 19 was built together with no. 21 in 1735–40 and is representative of the Bernese Régence style; it was used as a family town house until the 1970s.Caviezel et al., 190. No. 29, the Zunfthaus zu Kaufleuten (\\"Merchants' Guildhouse\\") is the most significant Late Baroque Bernese town house, built 1718–20 by Niklaus Schiltknecht and equipped with a guild hall with impressive Baroque boiseries and furniture. No. 17–21 are the headquarters of the police department of the canton of Bern, in the course of whose establishment here in the 1950s the historical interior was largely destroyed.Caviezel et al., 191. No. 41 features one of the few Humanist house mottoes that survived the 18th century building boom; it reads: \\"What's most beautiful is highest justice, what's best is to be healthy, but what's most joyful is to attain what one desires.\\" The Zunfthaus zu Metzgern (\\"Butchers' Guildhouse\\"), no. 45, is a 1769 construction by Rudolf Augst, a student of Niklaus Sprüngli. No. 61 features the first use of the colossal order in a private building in Bern; its back-house, Münstergasse no. 56, is one of the few purely pre-Baroque town houses.Caviezel et al., 192. No. 54 is recognised as one of the finest works of Bernese town house architecture and as the best work of Albrecht Stürler. No. 81, in turn, has been characterised as a low-key masterpiece by Niklaus Sprüngli because of its tensely elegant, barely adorned façade.Caviezel et al., 193. Famous residents House no. 49, the Einsteinhaus, was the residence of Albert and Mileva Einstein from 1903 to 1905 and the place where Einstein wrote his Annus Mirabilis Papers.

Albrecht von Haller, the Bernese naturalist, resided in no. 25 in the 1750s.Ried, 56. Federal Councillor Max Petitpierre lived in no. 61 during his time in office.Ried, 58. Other notable Bernese who lived on the Kramgasse include two Schultheisse, Niklaus Friedrich von Steiger and Karl Friedrich von Tscharner (in no. 61 and 74, respectively), illustrator Albert Lindegger (in no. 82 and 17) and art historian Wilhelm Stein (in no. 43).Ried, 57–8. Amenities The Kramgasse is one of Bern's more upmarket shopping streets. Among others, it features antiquaries, drugstores, bakeries, banks, jewelers' stores, bookstores, art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, furniture stores, opticians' stores, furriers, watch dealerships and wine cellars. Bern's oldest cinema, the Capitol, is located on Kramgasse, as are a number of small theaters, mostly set up in the medieval cellars (Kellertheater).

The Macellum. (Forum). Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection A macellum (plural: macella; makellon) is an ancient Roman indoor market building that sold mostly provisions (especially meat and fish). The building normally sat alongside the forum and basilica, providing a place in which a market could be held. Each macellum sold different kinds of produce, depending on local availability, but it was not uncommon to import these comestibles, especially at ports like Pompeii. Physical features A macellum is a fairly easy building to identify from its design. A macellum provides shops arranged around a courtyard which contains a central tholos. The tholos is a round structure, usually built upon a couple of steps (a podium), with a ring of columns supporting a domed roof. A macellum is usually square in shape. The central courtyard of the macellum is surrounded by tabernae, shops, all of the same size. It was also possible to extend the macellum upwards to include upper stories. Entrance to the macellum was either through central gates on each of the four sides or through some of the tabernae themselves. It appears that the tabernae set aside for butchers (carnificēs) were together in one area of the macellum where they were provided with marble counters, presumably to keep the meat cooler, and drains for the removal of water and fluid waste. It has been suggested that the central tholos, also well provided with water and drains, was where fish was sold (due to excavated fish skeletons), although other uses for the central tholos have been suggested, such as the place where official weights and measures were held for reference or as shrines to the gods of the market place (due to excavated coins). Some macella had a water fountain or water feature in the centre of their courtyard instead of a tholos structure. It is the presence of this central water feature which seems to denote a building a macellum. Macellum Magnum The Macellum Magnum was a market building located on the Caelian Hill in Rome. The complex was built and dedicated by the emperor Nero in AD 59 and the location of the ancient structure likely corresponded to the current location of the church of S. Stefano Rotondo.CIL VI.1648; VI.9183 Roman coin perhaps depicting the Macellum Magnum Macellum of Pozzuoli The Macellum of Pozzuoli was first excavated in the 1750s, when the discovery of a statue of Serapis led to the building being misidentified as the city's Serapeum or Temple of Serapis. Standing columns with bands of boreholes left by marine mollusks showed that the height of the buildings had varied in relation to sea level, and made it the subject of debate in early geology. Subsequent excavations exposed the characteristic plan of a macellum. Macellum of Pompeii The Macellum of Pompeii was a provisional market located in the Forum of Pompeii. Some of the buildings have been dated to 130-120 BC. A section of the East side of the Macellum is thought to be dedicated to the imperial cult. If true, this would show the important role that the emperors played in the lives of the Romans in the early 1st century. Parts of the Macellum were damaged in the earthquake of 62 CE, and these damages were not repaired before the eruption that destroyed Pompeii in the year 79 AD. History The macellum was a food market, particularly for meat, fish and delicatessen. Plautus mentioned such a macellum in the second half of the 3rd century BC. The macellum was modeled after the agora of Greek and Hellenistic cities, except that there was no wholesale trade. The last macella were still in operation in Constantinople in the sixth century AD.

He was swiftly given a yellow card, however, after realizing the severity of the player's injury, the referee decided to send off M'Bengue. The French Football Federation responded by suspending him 13 matches, which effectively made him ineligible for play until March 2008.Though M'Bengue was suspended by the federation, he was still allowed participation in UEFA-sanctioned matches.

Background The group's third album, Hot Mess, released in 2009 by Decaydance/Fueled by Ramen, debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. It was powered by the smash lead single, \\"Good Girls Go Bad\\", which featured Gossip Girl actress Leighton Meester and peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 with more than 2 million copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan. After the success, Cobra Starship frontman Gabe Saporta said of the aftermath of Hot Mess: \\"That caused me to lose my girlfriend, who I had been with since before Cobra started.\\" The band started writing Night Shades in September 2010, but during these initial sessions, Saporta wasn't happy with what they were coming up with. \\"We had a lot of songs that just felt uninspired to me,\\" he says. \\"It felt like I was just doing it to do it, because that's what we do, we're a band.\\" He confessed that his solution for inspiration was embarking on what he describes as a \\"spiritual detox\\" in South America. \\"I went on this, like, pretty crazy... I don't know if you call it a retreat, but I lived in a little house in the forest in Brazil, and all I ate was rice for 10 days.\\" In the end, the trip gave Saporta \\"clarity\\" and made him feel \\"rejuvenated\\"—two things he needed to survive the studio mishaps Cobra Starship experienced after he returned. First, the band set up shop in an abandoned floor of a building owned by a friend's family—but two weeks into recording, they were unexpectedly met by a demolition crew. Their next attempt at setting up studio space unwittingly ended up being adjacent to a place rented by a masseuse. Finally, the band found a home in a converted storage space on the ground floor of Saporta's building. Once the band settled into their permanent digs, Saporta started delving into the issues he started dissecting in South America—and found a way to address them from a unique perspective. \\"When I was writing in September, the problem was [that] it was either uninspired or it was really depressing,\\" he explains. \\"It was about the fact that I lost the love of my life. As much as I need to deal with that, I don't think the whole world needs to deal with that. It's very self-serving just for me to make a record for that. If I would have just written that without taking my spiritual detox in the jungle, we would have had a record that would've just been that.\\" Speaking of Night Shades, Saporta commented, \\"This record might be the most commercial record, but also our most honest.\\" Fueled by Ramen president John Janick was quoted as saying, \\"[Cobra Starship] delivered an album that has the Cobra sound but delivers those radio records\\" and thought that \\"there are multiple singles on [the] album.\\" During an interview with Alicia Fiorletta from The Aquarium, Alex Suarez commented about the album: > \\"I think we've massaged our writing process a whole lot more. Basically, we > started writing this album a long time ago. Ryland and myself would get > together to make some songs, then we'd pass it off to Gabe and then he would > work on some lyrical concepts and then we would demo it. So we get a huge > barrel of songs put together and then he picks the best ones to write off of > until it just dwindles down. This time around, we got our own studio space, > basically. Ryland and I would go in and produce the final tracks during the > day and Gabe would go in at night and track vocals, so we'd sort of tag-team > them. Then we also would use our own little home studio set up and do a lot > of the production stuff there.\\" Music and production Saporta and the band worked with multiple producers; he confirmed Kara DioGuardi (who co-produced the band's 2009 hit \\"Good Girls Go Bad\\") and OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder have been collaborators. As for current inspirations, Saporta cites the \\"attitude toward making music\\" displayed by the kaleidoscopic electronic duo Major Lazer—a colorful, fun project which refuses to be pigeonholed by genres. > \\"[Night Shades] definitely has something for everyone. For me personally, I > think we're at the point where people listen to mixes much more than they > actually listen to full albums. I kind of want to make records that feel > like they're mixtapes.\\" The 11-song set ranges from club anthems like \\"#1Nite\\" to the reggae-tinted \\"Fool Like Me\\" and slow jam \\"Anything for Love\\". The dance music songs, \\"You Make Me Feel...\\" and \\"Don't Blame the World, It's the DJ's Fault\\" preserve the band's carefree atmosphere, but show marked production (and sonic) growth. \\"Stylistically, I think that we're definitely a band that's about making people have a good time, and we definitely want it to feel like a party,\\" Saporta says. \\"But we also want to experiment with those sounds and make sure that it stays fresh, too.\\" \\"Fool Like Me\\" has a slower rhythm, electronic keyboard sounds, story-telling lyrics, and high-pitched accompaniment from The Plastiscines. \\"Anything for Love\\" is a heavily synthesized nod to 1980s new wave. Other songs on the album include \\"Disaster Boy\\" which offers a flashback to Hot Mess with its more alternative sounds and female vocals; \\"Don't Blame the World, It's the DJ's Fault\\" sounds similar to \\"Fool Like Me\\" with its slower rhythm; and \\"You Belong to Me\\", the upbeat ballad of the album. Promotional singles For Night Shades the band engaged in a staged rollout, offering fans sneak peeks of the album through pre-release tracks or promotional singles starting with \\"#1Nite (One Night)\\" on July 26, \\"Fool Like Me\\" (featuring Plastiscines) on August 9 and \\"Middle Finger\\" (featuring Mac Miller) on August 23, available exclusively through iTunes, where fans were able to collect them with the option to complete the album on release date for the remainder of the album price. \\"Don't Blame the World, It's the DJ's Fault\\" was released separately onto iTunes on August 29, 2011, the day of Night Shades's release. Fueled by Ramen also had three separate preorder options: a premium bundle that includes a hoodie, T-shirt and white \\"night shades\\" for $75; a shirt/album package for $25; or a CD for $10. \\"Middle Finger\\" later became the second official single. \\"#1Nite\\" featuring My Name Is Kay was released as the third official single in 2012. Critical reception Night Shades received generally favorable reviews from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on 4 reviews. Tim Sendra from AllMusic gave to the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, declaring that \\"packing so many WTFs into one ten-song record is hardly fair, a bit reckless, and ultimately (amazingly) successful.\\" He also wrote that the album \\"is ridiculously fun and light, sure to spawn at least a couple of songs you’ll want to play at ironic dance parties, summer blowouts, and maybe even over headphones when you need some (mostly) mindless cheering up.

The 40-Mile Loop is a partially completed greenway trail around and through Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon. It was proposed in 1903 by the Olmsted Brothers architecture firm as part of the development of Forest Park. One greenway expert calls it \\"one of the most creative and resourceful greenway projects in the country.\\" The name's \\"forty\\" was obsolete within a few decades after it was proposed. The proposed total path is now about long, and connects more than thirty city parks. Similarly, \\"loop\\" is not entirely accurate. There are several subloops, cutoffs and spur trails within the system. One spur is proposed to connect to the Pacific Crest Trail.  History  350pxthumbleft Map of the 40-Mile Loop As part of beautification planning for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905, Portland's recently established Parks Board invited the Olmsted Brothers in 1903. Besides suggestions for Washington Park, their research of existing city parks resulted in a bold proposal for a loop of interconnected parks around the city, instead of a traditional plan of scattered parks: \\"A connected system of parks and parkways is manifestly far more complete and useful than a series of isolated parks.\\" As the brothers puzzled over a name for the system, one asked the other \\"What would you call a forty-mile loop?\\" The firm was famous for its straightforward names, so they left it at that. Little action occurred until a $1 million—equivalent to $ today—city bond measure in 1907 passed, which was used to develop existing parks. In 1912, another city planner, Edward H. Bennett, also recommended developing a ridgetop park long the West Hills. A $2 million bond issue to acquire the necessary land was voted down. However, shortly afterward, most of the lots sold in Forest Park forfeited to the city or Multnomah County due to high assessments for road building, and a landslide. In 1943, influential urban planner Robert Moses was hired, and recommended establishing Forest Park. After several subsequent years of controversy, the park was created in 1948 from tax-delinquent lands, gifts, and purchases. This contained the first portion of the loop. Little more happened until 1978: at the request of Oregon legislators, U.S. Congress stripped the Columbia Slough of its \\"navigable\\" status, enabling the land to be dedicated to recreational use, an important component of the Olmsted plan. The Oregon director of the Nature Conservancy responded to withering federal funds for parks and natural areas by reviving the loop plan to enthusiastic receptions by the City, suburban cities, federal agencies, conservationists, and civic groups. The alliance eventually formed the 40-Mile Loop Land Trust which proved most effective at getting the thirteen key governmental entities—which normally did not talk to each other—to effectively work together. It also served as an intermediary to transfer property from one entity to the other. One of the Land Trust's major victories was bringing Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads together, which jointly owned the abandoned Springwater Corridor, to transfer the land in 1990 to the Trust. It represented significant progress in the completion of the loop.  Trail  The trail has a variety of sections: some are on level ground, such as along the Columbia River; others are heavily forested and/or mountainous, as through Washington Park's Hoyt Arboretum. All portions are suitable for walking and hiking, and most are open to bicycling. There are opportunities for strollers, wheelchairs, skating, skateboarding, horseback riding, canoeing, and kayaking.

It spans Columbus Drive to connect Maggie Daley Park (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza) with Millennium Park, both parts of the larger Grant Park. Designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry and structurally engineered by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, it opened along with the rest of Millennium Park on July 16, 2004. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion, and eventually agreed to do so after the Pritzker family funded the Pavilion. Named for energy firm BP, which donated $5 million toward its construction, it is the first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is described as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of stainless steel plates to express abstraction. The pedestrian bridge serves as a noise barrier for traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a parking garage. BP Bridge uses a concealed box girder design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. It is designed without handrails, using stainless steel parapets instead. The total length is , with a five percent slope on its inclined surfaces that makes it barrier free and accessible. Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics. Design Preliminary plans Since the mid-19th century, Grant Park has been Chicago's \\"front yard\\", with Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west. Columbus Drive runs north–south through Grant Park, with Daley Bicentennial Plaza in the northeast corner of the park. West of Columbus Drive, the northwest corner of the park had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it became available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Millennium Park is also north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, and south of Randolph Street. For 2007, Millennium Park trailed only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. Gehry designed both the bridge and Jay Pritzker Pavilion with curving stainless steel plates. In February 1999, the city announced it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a proscenium arch and orchestra enclosure for a band shell in the new park, as well as a pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive between Millennium Park and Daley Bicentennial Plaza. The city also sought donors to cover the cost of Gehry's work, which would eventually become Jay Pritzker Pavilion and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. At the time, the Chicago Tribune dubbed Gehry \\"the hottest architect in the universe\\" in reference to the acclaim for his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said \\"Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture\\", and noted that no other architect was being sought. Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city. In April 1999, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15 million to fund Gehry's band shell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $10 million more to the park. That same day, Gehry agreed to the design request. In November 1999, when he unveiled his initial plans for the bridge and band shell, Gehry admitted the bridge's design was underdeveloped because funding for it was not yet committed. Even at this early point, the need for a sound barrier for Columbus Drive traffic noise was recognized, although Gehry indicated this might take the form of a berm, or raised barrier. The need to fund a bridge to span the eight-lane Columbus Drive was evident, but some planning for the park was delayed in anticipation of details on the redesign of Soldier Field. In January 2000, the city announced plans to expand the park to include features that became Cloud Gate, Crown Fountain, the McDonald's Cycle Center, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Later that month, Gehry unveiled his next design, which depicted a winding bridge. While the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion changed relatively little from Gehry's 1999 design when built, the bridge went through several proposed designs. The proposal made in early 2000, which was expected to be executed in 2002, included a bridge that was a mere long and wide. That design was not approved, and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's disapproval of Gehry's subsequent design of an bridge caused Gehry to come up with ten more designs. The first of these plans was for a Z-shaped bridge that would have run northwest–southeast with western ramps in Millennium Park, leading south, and eastern ramps in the empty north section of Daley Bicentennial Plaza, leading north. It would have required elevators to conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act. This plan was abandoned because it would have segregated the handicapped.Sharoff, p. 95 Gehry had only designed two bridges previously, both in the mid-1990s (Pferdeturm USTRA Bridge in Hanover, Germany and Financial Times Millennium Bridge in London, United Kingdom) but neither was built.Gilfoyle, pp. 239–41. Final plan The bridge is a noise barrier along the eastern edge of Millennium Park, with the Historic Michigan Boulevard District in the background. The final design for the bridge was revealed in an exhibit at the Chicago Cultural Center on June 10, 2000. As designed and built, the bridge is long and wide, with a Columbus Drive clearance. The clearance was designed to slightly exceed the standard set by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration for urban area interstate bridge clearances, and to allow for additional future layers of pavement below. This height is also greater than the maximum vehicle height of set by the Illinois Vehicle Code. Note: The code states that vehicle height statewide measured from the under side of the tire to the top of the vehicle, inclusive of load, that shall not exceed . According to the Chicago Tribune the width of the \\"trenchlike\\" area spanned is approximately , while The New York Times reports the bridge is over ten times longer than Columbus Drive is wide. BP Bridge begins in Millennium Park between the trellis system over the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's great lawn and the Lurie Garden; the design was changed so that the west ramp coincided with the boardwalk of the Lurie Garden seam.Gilfoyle, pp. 303, 308. The bridge winds its way northward along the eastern edge of Millennium Park before crossing Columbus Drive in a C-shaped curve, above underground parking garage entrances. In Daley Bicentennial Plaza the bridge has an S-shape, then turns east. BP Bridge is designed so that its inclined surfaces have a continuous five percent slope rather than landings and switchback ramps, which provides easy access for the physically challenged. The gently sloped ramp eliminates the need for lifts or any of the other common types of ramps (L-shaped, switchback, U-shaped, straight), and helped the park earn the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award for its exemplary barrier- free design. Crossing Columbus Drive, the bridge is supported by a central concrete column. (from Randolph Street) Gehry had hoped to design the bridge so that it could be constructed without a support column in the center of Columbus Drive. However, Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin notes that if he had done so, the bridge might not have been as sleek. Building the bridge without the column would have required load-bearing cantilevers (beams supported only on one side) from structural positions on opposite sides of the street; this would have been expensive and labor-intensive, because it would have required excavating large portions of the parking garages on both sides of the street. Moreover, on the Daley Bicentennial Plaza side, the optimal location for the supporting cantilever would have been at the location of the Monroe Street Garage. Thus, the preferred bridge design was altered to avoid problems related to the underground parking garages.Gilfoyle, p. 200. The bridge is both a connector and a viewing platform for the park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also designed to be a berm noise barrier blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds upward. The bridge, which uses steel girders, reinforced concrete abutments and deck slabs, hardwood deck, and a stainless steel veneer, cost between $12.1 and $14.5 million. It contains large sculptural plates of curvilinear stainless steel instead of more standard flat plates. The bridge's curvilinear design gives it a flowing, natural look, instead of the linear, rigid form of standard bridges. Although its steel girders rest on concrete pylons and most of the bridge is solid concrete, the bridge uses a hollow box girder design to minimize weight, as the ground that supports the bridge covers underground parking garages.Gilfoyle, pp. 196–201. The concrete base and box girder are flanked by a hollow stainless steel skeleton. Despite its hollow structure, and the fact that it is designed as a concealed beam bridge, the footbridge is built to highway standards and can support a full capacity load of pedestrians. The bridge is designed without standard handrails and uses waist-high parapets as guard rails instead. Construction BP Bridge entry and redesigned landscape in Daley Bicentennial Plaza The bridge was built using 22-gauge stainless steel type 316 plates ( thick), with an angel hair finish and a flat interlocking panel process. Stainless steel type 316 is known for its excellent welding characteristics, as well as for its resistance to pitting. According to the Chicago Tribune, the bridge materials used in construction include 2,000 rot- resistant Brazilian hardwood boards for the deck, 115,000 stainless steel screws and 9,800 stainless steel shingle plates.Gilfoyle, p. 243. According to Architecture Metal Expertise, the bridge has \\"10,400 stainless steel trapezoidal panels in 17 different shop fabricated configurations [which] involved 1,000 shop hours\\". The sheet metal work totaled 5,900 field hours over a six-month period. During construction, about 200 shingles were installed per day.Sharoff, p. 105 The bridge includes two types of structural steel: steel that is thick and in diameter for the approaches and box girders for the span.Sharoff, p. 100 CATIA software was used to handle the complex geometric layout.Sharoff, p. 103 To ensure accurate fitting and alignment to the sloping, curving sides of the bridge, 4,400 custom-made convex, concave and radiused cladding panels were fabricated on site by sheet metal contractor Custom Metal Fabricators (CMF). CMF used of stainless steel sheet to cover the sides, which have a combined perimeter length of . CMF built special heated enclosures so that work could continue on site through the winter. They designed, fabricated and installed custom type 4 brushed stainless steel parapets serving in the place of handrails on the bridge. CMF earned the 2005 Tom Guilfoy Memorial Architectural Sheet Metal Award, by the California chapter of the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association for the project. In 2005 it received a Merit Award from the National Steel Bridge Alliance, and an Excellence in Structural Engineering award from the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois. On the day that the two halves of the bridge were joined, each side of Columbus Drive was closed for a 12-hour period and a crane was used to install the girders. Before bringing the crane to the location, screw jacks were used to shore up the underground garage roof to hold the crane's weight.Sharoff, p. 109 The landscaping surrounding the bridge was redesigned by landscape architect Terry Guen. Honey locusts, ash and maple trees were removed and replaced with three varieties of magnolia and more than two dozen ornamental and canopy trees along the eastern foot of the bridge in Daley Bicentennial Plaza. Other preliminary construction work included setting reinforcing rods for the bridge in the concrete roof deck of the parking garage located under the park. Use and controversies The deck is covered with 2,000 Brazilian hardwood floor boards. Before its official opening, the bridge had a May 22, 2004, private ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Gehry and Mayor Daley. During the weekend of the ribbon-cutting, Gehry was awarded an honorary degree from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The BP Pedestrian Bridge officially opened, along with the rest of Millennium Park, on July 16, 2004. It remained unnamed at the ribbon-cutting, but before the July park opening, energy firm BP had paid for the bridge sponsorship and naming rights. Timothy Gilfoyle, author of Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark, notes that a controversy surrounds the \\"tasteless\\" corporate naming of several of the Park's features, including the bridge, which was named after an oil company.Gilfoyle, p. 345. It is well documented that naming rights were sold for high fees, and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder. Public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of Chicago parks. However, many of the donors have a long history of local philanthropy and the funds were essential to providing necessary financing for several features of the park. After the park opened, some of the bridge's foibles became apparent. The bridge has had to be closed during the winter because freezing conditions make it unsafe. Since the bridge is over an expressway-like trench of Columbus Drive, shoveling the snow onto passing cars is not an option and the Brazilian hardwood would be damaged by rock salt. The city not only mandates that the bridge be swept and washed daily, but also that the parapets be wiped free of fingerprints. The bridge has also had controversial closures in the summer, which were related to larger park concerns. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent the bridge and all but four venues in the park from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the bridge and most of the park for a day.The four venues in Millennium Park that were not rented by Toyota were Wrigley Square, Lurie Garden, the McDonald's Cycle Center and Crown Fountain. Allstate acquired the visitation rights to Pritzker Pavilion, BP Bridge, Lurie Garden and the Chase Promenades, and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4 p.m. The exclusion of commuters who normally walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions was controversial, though the city said the money raised paid for free public programs in Millennium Park. Aesthetics The bridge is noted for its sculptural characteristics and Kamin describes it as a delightful pleasure that was designed to emphasize its artistic elements while de-emphasizing its concrete and steel support system. The New York Times notes that the artist Anish Kapoor's attempts to hide the seams of Cloud Gate were an interesting contrast to Gehry's architectural efforts. Gehry took pride in making the BP Pedestrian Bridge flaunt its seams. Beginning with Gehry's earliest bridge designs, the bridge was expected to complement the neighboring Pritzker Pavilion. Some have suggested that the bridge and the pavilion are mere extensions of Gehry's work in other cities. For example, according to Gilfoyle, both structures embody Gehry's established asymmetrical style, evoking fluid, continuous motion and sculptural abstraction. They also feature metallic facades and aesthetic curves, but they are said to be more refined, reduced and dynamic than much of his other work. Since the 1960s, Gehry has made artistic use of scaled animals such as fish and snakes, which first appeared in his architectural designs in the 1980s. Many references to the bridge describe it as snakelike for its winding path, and some even refer to the stainless steel plates as scales with discussion of reptilian forms. Kamin calls it \\"a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake, complete with a scaly skin\\", while Gehry said he thought the bridge looked like a river, but added he might be the only one who thought that. The way the bridge flows in a continuum of unexpected directions is a break from Gehry's other work and other more traditional urban and architectural forms nearby.Gilfoyle, pp. 229–231. Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Kamin gave the bridge four stars (out of a possible four) in his review and admires how \\"computers have given Gehry unparalleled formal freedom\\" to design \\"the complexity of its geometry\\" and multidimensional curvatures. The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan in a way that Kamin says makes it a belvedere.Gilfoyle, p. 272. Kamin also recommends anyone having a bad day to stroll across the bridge, adding, \\"You won't get where you're going quickly, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you're done.\\" Credits Instead of handrails, the BP Bridge uses parapets (with lights for illumination at night). * Commissioned by – The City of Chicago * Architect – Gehry Partners, LLP * Project manager – US Equities * Construction manager – URS Construction Services * Structural engineer – Skidmore, Owings and Merrill * Mechanical and electrical engineer – McDonough Associates * Contractor – Walsh Construction * Subcontractor – Permasteelisa Cladding Technologies Ltd. * Steel supplier – Littell Steel Company Retrieved on July 25, 2008. * Steel construction – Imperial Construction Associates * Sheet metal contractor – Custom Metal Fabricators Inc.

He became the pastor of both Old St. Joseph's Church and Old St. Mary's Church, where he served for 16 years. During that time, he opened the first parochial school in the United States, and edited the first American catechism. His pastorate encompassed the American Revolutionary War, and though he did not expressly commit himself to either belligerent, he largely endorsed the American cause. Molyneux then spent several years in the Jesuits' Maryland missions, and was made vicar general for Southern Maryland by the Bishop of Baltimore, John Carroll. In 1793, Carroll appointed Molyneux the second president of Georgetown College, where he oversaw the construction of the Old North building. After three years, he returned to missionary work, until 1805, when he was named the first superior of the Jesuit Maryland Mission after their restoration. He remained superior for the rest of his life, and saw the establishment of a novitiate at Georgetown, where he became president again in 1806. His term lasted two years, before he died. Early life Robert P. Molyneux was born July 24, 1738 in Formby, Lancashire, England, into a prominent, Cavalier family. Due to the Penal Laws, he was tutored privately at home, before entering the Society of Jesus on September 7, 1757, following in the path of his brother, William. Molyneux then enrolled at the College of St Omer in France, and continued with the school when it relocated to Bruges, Belgium. He became a master there in 1764, and had as one of his students John Carroll, the future Archbishop of Baltimore. Though he was ordained a priest, Molyneux had not yet pronounced his final vows when he went to the United States as a missionary. He arrived in Maryland in 1771, where he worked in the Jesuits' Maryland Mission. His ancestor, Richard Molyneux, had previously been a Jesuit who worked in the Maryland Mission. The Bishop of Maryland, John Carroll, sought to appoint Molyneux his coadjutor bishop, but Molyneux declined the post.  Missionary in America  Molyneux was in Maryland for only a short while before he went to Philadelphia on March 21, 1771. When the pastor of Old St. Joseph's Church, Robert Harding, died in 1771, John Lewis was appointed to succeed him; however, Lewis very shortly thereafter left for Maryland. In his place, Molyneux was named pastor of Old St. Joseph's in September 1772, as well as of Old St. Mary's Church. He had as his assistant Ferdinand Farmer, who ministered primarily to the German parishioners, traveling as far as New York to do so.  New country and new diocese  alt=Lithograph of Old St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia In 1773, Pope Clement XIV ordered the worldwide suppression of the Jesuit order. At the time, there were 20 Jesuits working in the United States. With the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, Molyneux adopted a personal policies described as general neutrality, as well as moderate patriotism. Nonetheless, he aligned his parish with the Americans in the war of independence. Four members of the Continental Congress, including George Washington and John Adams, visited Old St. Joseph's during the war, and Molyneux celebrated the requiem masses for a French officer who drowned in the Schuylkill River and the Spanish ambassador. He also presided over the funeral of the Spaniard Juan de Miralles. He celebrated masses to mark the anniversary of American Independence, beginning in 1779. Molyneux took the oath of allegiance to the State of Pennsylvania, and in 1783, signed a petition to have Congress return to Philadelphia. In 1782, Molyneux established the first parochial school in the United States, which would later go on to become St. Mary's Interparochial School. Molyneux supported the establishment of a Catholic episcopal hierarchy in the United States, so that it would be separate from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the English bishops. Therefore, he encouraged John Carroll to accept the position of Prefect Apostolic of the United States, to which Carroll was appointed by the Sacred Congregation de Propaganda Fide in 1784. Molyneux then joined others in writing to Rome to request the elevation of the apostolic prefecture to the rank of diocese, and install an American bishop. Pope Pius VI consented, and Carroll became the first Bishop of Baltimore in 1789. While pastor, Molyneux published two catechisms, one in 1785 and another 1788, making him, so far as is known, the first American to edit a catechism. He also gained a reputation as an eloquent preacher. He Molyneux tutored Anne- César de La Luzerne, the French minister plenipotentiary to the United States, in English. From 1786 to 1788, Molyneux served as a trustee of the University of the State of Pennsylvania by virtue of being the most senior Catholic cleric in Philadelphia. He also became a member of the American Philosophical Society. His pastorate of the two churches came to an end in February 1788, and he was succeeded by Dominic Lawrence Graessel. Molyneux then left Philadelphia for the Jesuits' Maryland missions, first going to Bohemia Manor. John Carroll then appointed him the vicar general for the southern district of the diocese, and he was stationed at Newtown Manor. President of Georgetown College alt=Georgetown University campus Molyneux became the second president of Georgetown University on June 14, 1793, succeeding Robert Plunkett. John Carroll had previously sought to appoint him as the school's first president, but Molyneux declined. Molyneux immediately undertook a project to expand the college, purchasing of land, located to the north of the original Old South building. This provided room for a second building as well as space for recreation for the students. Construction on the Old North building, which was modeled after Nassau Hall at Princeton University, began in 1794. Funding for construction of the building was unsteady, as the school was unable to raise adequate money through donations by Maryland Catholics. As a result, a Jesuit estate on Double Pipe Creek was sold to pay for the building, and beef was also offered as barter. After delays resulting from this insecurity in funding, Old North opened in spring 1797. To support the increasing enrollment, the building quintupled the dormitory space on campus, and housed a chapel and several classrooms. Compared to the small structures and simple architecture of the city at the time, Old North was monumental, and was described as one of the \\"grandest works in Washington, after the Capitol Building.\\" In late 1796, Molyneux submitted his resignation to John Carroll because of his declining health; William Louis DuBourg was named as his successor in October of that year. Upon leaving office, Molyneux returned to Newtown Manor for two years.  Superior of the Maryland Jesuits  When Pope Pius VII was elected supreme pontiff, Emperor Paul I of Russia requested the formal restoration of the Jesuit order. In response, the pope issued the bull on March 7, 1801, which officially permitted the Society of Jesus to continue existing in the Russian Empire. In turn, the members of the of the Jesuits' former English province sought the pope's permission to be received back into the Society, as members of the Russian province. They pope gave them verbal approval and expressed his desire for the worldwide restoration of the Jesuits, but did not commit this to writing, as the political enemies of the Society remained powerful. While superior of the Jesuits, Molyneux lived at alt=St. Ignatius Church at St. Thomas Manor Seeing these developments, Bishop Carroll instructed his coadjutor, Leonard Neale, (both former Jesuits) to write Gabriel Gruber, the Jesuit Superior General, to request permission for the Maryland Jesuits to join with the Russian province. Gruber responded that he believed that the pope's oraculum vivæ vocis approbation of the Jesuits in Russia authorized him to quietly admit Jesuits from anywhere in the world to the Russian province. However, Bishop Carroll was wary that the papal permission was addressed only to Russia and was not memorialized in writing, which would allow a future pope who was hostile to the Jesuits to declare the American Jesuits insubordinate to the order of suppression. Therefore, he convened all the former Jesuits at St. Thomas Manor, and instructed them that they must each individually choose whether they would accept the risk of re- joining the Society. All the Jesuits elected to join the Russian province, and Carroll appointed Molyneux superior of the Jesuits' Maryland Mission on June 21, 1805, with the powers of provincial superior over the Jesuits in the United States. As the first American superior of the restored Society, he resumed the position last held by John Lewis. As superior, he took up residence at St. Thomas Manor. One of his first actions was to oversee the establishment of a Jesuit novitiate at Georgetown on October 10, 1806, and a scholasticate two years after that. Five Jesuits from the Russian province were sent to Maryland to work and teach at Georgetown.  Second presidency of Georgetown  In addition to his duties as superior, Molyneux again resumed the presidency of Georgetown on October 1, 1806, replacing Bishop Leonard Neale. In so doing, Georgetown College officially became a Jesuit institution. By this time, St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, the second Catholic college in the United States, had grown and was competing with Georgetown for students. Molyneux saw that progress continued on Old North, which, though structurally complete, remained unfinished in the interior; only its third floor was able to be used. Lacking funds, the Jesuits themselves assisted the plasterer, such as by making mortar. Though the enrollment remained low, progress on the college's facilities improved the public's perception of the school. Molyneux's health began to fail, and he exhibited dropsy. He resigned the presidency, and shortly thereafter, died at Georgetown College on December 9, 1808. He had appointed Charles Neale to succeed him as superior of the Jesuits; Francis Neale became acting president of the college until William Matthews' appointment. He is buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery at the college. Upon his death, John Carroll recounted Molyneux as his \\"oldest friend\\" after his childhood friend Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia created the Molyneux- Lilly Award, named for Robert Molyneux and Thomas Lilly, both Jesuits. The annual award is given to an educator in Philadelphia's Catholic schools.

As a prisoner-of-war in Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, Germany, during World War II, he served as Escape Officer for the Dutch POWs, a role also held by Captain Pat Reid, the author of The Colditz Story, for the British. Van den Heuvel played a key role in most Dutch officer escapes (such as Hans Larive, Francis Steinmetz and Anthony Luteyn) during the war. POW Machiel (\\"Jim\\") van den Heuvel, known as \\"Vandy\\" by the British POW's, was a captain in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) who happened to be in the Netherlands at the outbreak of World War II in May 1940. After the Dutch capitulation he refused to give his word of honour not to harm German interests and was sent to a German POW camp. Here van den Heuvel was quickly appointed Escape Officer. Together with Lieutenant Gerrit Dames the two KNIL officers were a main factor for most Dutch escape successes during the war. He discovered the escape route in the park where two men could be hidden in a manhole, Lieutenants Hans Larive, Francis Steinmetz, Lt. Oscar Drijber and Major Cornelis Giebel escaped using this route. Vandy worked together with the other Escape Officers. In June 1943 all Dutch officers at Colditz were transferred to Stalag 371 in Stanislau to join other Dutch officer POW's. Vandy also claimed many more escapes from this camp. Finally Vandy was transferred to Oflag VII-D at Tittmoning where the Germans thought he could do no more harm because most prisoners were older generals. From Tittmoning Vandy helped Giles Romilly escape. Romilly was a prominent prisoner in Colditz because he was Winston Churchill's nephew. After the war After the war, Machiel van den Heuvel was made a major and sent to Java, Indonesia to fight in the Indonesian war of independence. He was a battalion commander when he was killed in action at Padalarang, Java, on 29 June 1946. He had been awarded the Bronze Cross for his actions. On film In the film The Colditz Story (1955), directed by Guy Hamilton, the role of Vandy was played by actor Theodore Bikel.

He was the first person who had played baseball in a major league to become a casualty of military service. Early life Stearns was born in 1853 in Washington, D.C. and although he was only 12 years old when the American Civil War ended, he was a member of the Grand Army of the Republic, which indicates he served in some capacity during the war, perhaps as a drummer or messenger. Professional baseball For the first three seasons of his career, Stearns appeared exclusively as a pitcher. In —the first year of the National Association—he pitched two complete games for Washington Olympics, winning both, with a 2.50 ERA. In he pitched 11 complete games for the Washington Nationals, unfortunately losing all of them, with a 6.18 ERA. In he pitched 32 complete games for the Washington Blue Legs, posting a record of 7–25, with a 4.61 ERA. In the final two seasons of his career, Stearns appeared both as a pitcher and an outfielder. In with the Hartford Dark Blues his pitching record was 3–14 with a 2.95 ERA, and he played 19 games in the outfield. In his final season of —also the final year of the National Association—he was with the Washington Nationals, pitching to a 1–14 record with a 4.02 ERA, and playing 7 games in the outfield. Stearns' career pitching record was 13–64 with a 4.28 ERA, and as a batter he had 411 plate appearances, hitting .191 with just two extra base hits, both doubles. He later served as an umpire during 1884. Spanish–American War In 1898 with the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Stearns volunteered for military service.

According to Vatican sources, it is the busiest pharmacy in the world, with 2,000 customers per day.Glatz, Carol. 2008, May 23. \\"World's busiest pharmacy? Vatican drugstore offers cut-rate prices.\\" Catholic News Service. Half of those customers come from outside the Vatican for medicines that are not available in Italy or are difficult to find. The current director of the pharmacy is Rafael Cenizo Ramirez, a Fatebenefratelli monk. Although the director of the pharmacy has always been a monk of that order, the staff pharmacists have been lay people for the past 30 years (7 religious and 53 laypeople in 2014). The pharmacy is organized under the Directorate of Health Services, one of eight Vatican City directorates.d'Onorio, Joël-Benoît. Levillain, Philippe (ed.). 2002. \\"Vatican City State\\" in The Papacy: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. . p. 1591. History The pharmacy was founded in 1874, at the height of the \\"Roman Question\\", when Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli asked Eusebio Ludvig Fronmen, a Fatebenefratelli monk, who ran a nearby pharmacy, to take charge of supplying medicines for the pope and cardinals residing in the Vatican. Popes had been confined to the Vatican since an 1870 dispute with the Italian government, when Rome was annexed into the Kingdom of Italy. The pharmacy remained only a storeroom until 1892, when a permanent office was established to offer healthcare services to the pope, cardinals, and bishops of the Vatican. In 1917, the pharmacy was moved to St. Anne's Gate, closer to the main entrance of the Vatican. At the time, the Vatican pharmacy was immensely popular for offering medicines which were otherwise unobtainable within Rome. Even today, due to the complicated bureaucratic drug approval process of the Italian government, the pharmacy often has medicines months to years before Italian pharmacies. After the Lateran treaties of 1929, the pharmacy was moved to its current location in Palazzo Belvedere, behind the Vatican central post office and across from the Vatican supermarket. Unlike Italian pharmacies, the Vatican Pharmacy will fill foreign prescriptions.Ward, Travis. 2002. Living, Studying, and Working in Italy. Macmillan. . p. 111. Eligibility Non-Vatican employees must obtain a temporary pass from a special registry office, and have a prescription and ID to use the pharmacy. The 10,000 members of the Vatican's private health care plan possess a permanent pass to use the pharmacy. As Vatican City has no taxes, the pharmacy is duty-free. Stock The pharmacy carries 42,000 products, but it does not carry products which are contrary to Catholic social teaching, such as contraceptives or abortifacients. Nor does the pharmacy carry sildenafil (Viagra)NewsRX. 1998, October 26. \\"(1998-10-26), Vatican Pharmacy Says No to Viagra, Impotence & Male Health Weekly.\\" or medical marijuana.CWNews. 2002, May 23. \\"No Medical Marijuana at Vatican Pharmacy .\\" However, the pharmacy does carry \\"top-brand beauty-care products\\" and perfume.

Its appeal as a picturesque film setting derives from its natural beauty, isolation and its history as a prison (now a museum) from which, officially, no prisoner ever successfully escaped. Prisoners Most appearances of Alcatraz island in popular culture are related to its former status as a federal prison. Both real life and fictional accounts of imprisonment on the island have been popular. One of the best-known of Alcatraz's historic inmates was Robert Franklin Stroud, known as \\"The Birdman of Alcatraz\\". His biography was written by Thomas E. Gaddis and then adapted into a film in 1962, with Burt Lancaster playing the lead role. The 1995 film Murder in the First depicts a man who spends three years in solitary confinement at the prison. One of the prisoners, Kyle Oberholzer, was charged with rape, murder and fornicating. Portrayals in arts, media, and entertainment Common fictional themes =Escape attempts= Many films and television series have exploited Alcatraz Island's reputation as a prison from which it was almost impossible to escape. For example: * Brute Force (1947), starring Burt Lancaster, although inspired by actual events during the Battle of Alcatraz, is a highly fictionalized account of an attempted prison break. It was unusual at the time for the level of violence it portrayed. * Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), starring Burt Lancaster, briefly depicts a largely fictional version of the battle which, from the start, is portrayed as a full-scale riot rather than a discrete escape attempt. Robert Stroud, the \\"Birdman of Alcatraz\\", is given unwarranted credit for ending the conflict. * Don Siegel's thriller Escape from Alcatraz (1979) portrays both the conditions of life in the prison and the difficulty of escaping from it, and chronicles the story of Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin, who escaped from Alcatraz in 1962, although it is not known whether the three escapees survived. The film implies that the escape succeeded. * Alcatraz — The Whole Shocking Story (1980) is a factually based TV drama of the events of the Battle of Alcatraz, incorporated into a larger narrative of the history of Alcatraz as seen through the eyes of its youngest prisoner, Clarence Carnes. * Six Against the Rock (1987), starring David Carradine as Bernard Coy, is based on the semi-fictional book by Clark Howard. *Alcatraz (2018), is an independent film depicting the Battle of Alcatraz. =Hostages= Alcatraz's isolated and fortified image has meant that it has been used as a location for fictional hostage scenarios in various instances. *Terrorists use Alcatraz as a hiding-place after taking the Mayor of San Francisco hostage in the third Dirty Harry film, The Enforcer (1976) *The most successful of such films was The Rock (1996), in which a group from the United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance holds 81 tourists hostage, demanding monetary reparations; to defeat the hostage- takers, the Navy SEAL team enlists the help and knowledge of John Patrick Mason, the only inmate of Alcatraz who ever successfully escaped =Safe haven= Alcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in post-apocalyptic fiction, such as the film The Book of Eli (2010).

About 170 km (105 mi) from Rio de Janeiro, the area where Penedo is located belongs to the Itatiaia National Park. The small town was colonized by immigrants from Finland and the architecture, gastronomy and local customs such as saunas, are still present in Penedo. Penedo is the first Finnish colony in Brazil. History In 1906, the first Finnish immigrants seem to have been sailors who went ashore especially in the port of Rio de Janeiro to settle , although there are reports of Finns working in Brazil since late 19th century as Finnish engineers and technicians, mostly working in the railways in Brazil. In 1908, a small Finnish colony was founded, comprising about 20 families. Then in 1909-1910, a group of Finns from northern Sweden and northern Finland emigrated to southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul). In the inter-war years about one thousand Finns immigrated to Latin America, mainly to Brazil and Argentina. Especially from the year 1924, Colonia Finlandesa in Argentina received new emigrants from eastern Finland. In Brazil a utopian social experiment, Penedo was started in 1929. After World War II, immigration from Finland to Latin America continued, but in a much smaller degree. According to Finnish official statistics, about 500 immigrants left for Latin American countries; Venezuela then becoming a main settling country for Finn expats in addition to Brazil and Argentina. In the course of time small Finnish colonies have sprung up within some of South America's major cities, especially in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Caracas. Here, however, we must distinguish between true emigrants and the occasional Finnish resident in Latin American countries for diplomatic service or business.

The Consolidated Vultee Bomber Plant workers would build the B-24 \\"Liberator\\" heavy bomber. Later, they would build the B-32 Dominator bomber that made it to the war for only a short time. The plant begun production less than a year later while much of its workforce was accommodated in the 1500 prefabricated dwelling unitsp. 177, Talbert. located around the south gate of the bomber plant which housed men and women that built the B-24 bomber near Fort Worth, Texas during World War II.p. 142, Yenne and Yenne. The war had caused a shortage of housing in the area, therefore, the government decided to build a complex within walking distance to the plant.p. 6, Lambert. It would be named Liberator Village after the name of the B-24 bomber. The employees worked in difficult living conditions with the housing described as \\"ricky-ticky houses and open sewers\\".p. 263, Flemmons. However, this is disputed by Lambert.p. 16, Lambert. The village was built in three parts. The first was the part just across the road from the plant. It was built in the shape of barracks buildings. The next two parts were built about a mile away and were the built as \\"brick\\" buildings and small housing units with asbestos siding. One is still in existence and being used as a newspaper office. The village was operated by the Federal Public Housing Authority, later to be called the Fort Worth Housing Authority, which was directed by Mr. Lealand Hunter. The tenants called it the Village Housing Authority (VHA). The VHA director was Mr. P. F. Miller. The building site was in the White Settlement area just south of the aircraft plant. The apartments were constructed in four stages at a cost of three and a half million dollars giving six thousand people from all over the United States a place to live near the new plant.p. 26, Lambert. Many families that moved into these units had never had indoor plumbing, water, or electricity. All bills were paid for only $35.00 to $40.00 rent per month.p. 36, Lambert. The Village caused a large problem for the small school district that had only one building with four classrooms. Soon, with government aid, several more buildings were added to the school. Even with the new buildings the students still had to go to class in shifts. A large strip mall was built nearby with a drug, grocery, clothing stores, post office and other small shops.p. 46, Lambert. In May 1949 the Village was inundated by a flood,p. 228, Knight, Lale. but largely escaped damage with a small area north of the Village washed out by Farmers Creek. A few trailer houses were damaged, and one boy was killed. The Village became a part of the White Settlement in 1954 and finally closed in 1955. It is now a suburb of Fort Worth famous for its longest factory building in the World operated by Lockheed Martin, and its proximity to the Fort Worth Naval Air Station. The plant would continue to build the even larger B-36 bomber, but the Village would fade away during the mid-1950s. The aircraft plant, its workers and the village are commemorated by the White Settlement Historical Museum.p. 56, Lambert. References Sources * Maurice G.

He played for the Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, and St. Louis Cardinals. Biography Weiland was born on December 14, 1905, on Chicago's South Side to Christ and Mathilda Weiland and he also had an older sister. In his professional career, he was listed at tall and weighing . He attended Lowell School for the first eight years and then went to Lane Tech High School for the next four years in Chicago. Unfortunately, he played for two unsuccessful teams in the American League for the first six and a half years in the majors, pitching for the White Sox and Red Sox from 1928 to 1934 and putting up a combined record of 20–50. Then he moved from to the Indians in the mid of 1934, it still took some time for him and then he was 1–5 for the balance of the year. There may not have been any better chances of finishing with a lot of money with the Red Sox due to the team finishing in eighth again in 1932. Weiland's ERA of 4.51 was distinctly better than the team's own 5.02. Weiland began to have issues with throwing the ball over the plate, walking 97 while only striking out 63 and putting up a walks and hits per inning pitched of 1.676. Weiland improved walks and hits per inning to 1.373 and the team then finished seventh. He started with a 1–5 record for the Red Sox in 1934, but then was bought by the Cleveland Indians. His pitching improved, but also put up a 1–5 record for Cleveland causing it to be 2–10 on the season. Then in November for ten grand, he was sent to the St. Louis Browns where he did not pitch that much either, spending most of his time in the minor leagues. Weiland's was then sent to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1937 and improved again, going 15–14 and 16–11. This could be due because he was on a much better team, but his ERA decreased a large amount, too. Weiland's final major league game came on April 26, 1940. He played for five teams in total: Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, St. Louis Browns, and the St. Louis Cardinals. He died of a stroke and congestive heart failure on November 9, 1988, in Chicago.

Other members from the House of Vlasim were Leva z Jankova of the Castle Chřenovice and Jan z Kamenice, the father of Cardinal Jan Očko z Vlašime. Markvart's sons were Maršík, Jaroš and Hynek. Maršík and Jaroš were followers of John of Luxembourg and were knighted on the battlefield in 1325. Maršík died on the battlefield at Mailberk in Tirol, Austria in 1332. Hron z Vlašimi, son of Maršík, died with King John of Bohemia at the Battle of Crécy in 1346 fighting Edward, The Black Prince.

Vlašim was sold in 1363 to Michael z Vlašimě of Castle Svojanov, who was the brother of Jan Očko z Vlašimě. Benes' sons were Ceč, Benes II and Hynek III Jankovský z Vlašimi. The family then split into 3 branches. Ceč Jankovských z Vlašimi (+1392) established a new family line at Nemyčeves in northern Bohemia. In 1488, Vaclav z Nemyčevsi was Castellan of Prague Castle and later Marshall to King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.

Jan Jankovský z Vlašimi's (+1420) wife was Markéta, and they had sons Václav, Karl and Jan II. The family then split into 2 branches. Vaclav (+1463) and Karl (+1475), sons of Jan Jankovský z Vlašimi, ruled at the Castle Úsov, established the new family line z Úsovský and adopted the old coat of arms of the two red vultures heads of the House of Vlašim. In 1440 the family acquired the Royal Town of Litovel and in 1496 they acquired the Castle Sobotín. Jiří z Úsovský, in the years 1516–1520, was made Vice-Chamberlain of Moravian Margraviate by King Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia. Jiří (†1520) only had daughters and the Úsov estates were given to his grandson Kryštof z Boskovic. His granddaughters Anna and Katerina z Boskovic married brothers Karl and Maximilian of the Princely family of Liechtenstein.

A Calvinist, he sided with a defeated uprising and was sentenced to a loss of honor and all property. He died in 1622. Hynek Jankovský z Vlašimi, son of Fridrich, became Imperial Counsel to Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor. Maxmilian Arnošt II Jankovský z Vlašimi was a good friend of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor. The Bitov family line ended with the death of Maxmilian Arnošt II Jankovský z Vlašimi in 1736. His daughter Countess Marie Johanka von Vlasching married Jan Josef, Count of Kounice, and her sister Marie Anna married Heindrich von Daun. The family at Rešice after Jiřik Jankovský z Vlašimi was followed by Jindřich, who founded new line at Castle Rešice. Jindřich's wife was Ludmila z Lažan. Her son Karl Václav Jankovský z Vlašimi (1644-1684) lived for a time at the court of King Karl X Gustav of Sweden. František Antonín (1690–1752), brother of Jan Antonín Jankovský z Vlašimi (1695-1740), resided in the King's Tribunal was able to claim the Bítov estates for the families in 1752. But František died a few months after the Tribunal and the children of the two brothers became orphans.

Jan Václav's wife was from the Prussian family von Mayenn and they had two sons Karl, and Jan Matious. The family again split into 2 branches. In Moravia, Karl and his son Franz continued the family's tradition of military service. The family branch ended with the death of Colonel Franz Jankovsky von Mayenhorst in 1860. His daughter Anna Jankovsky von Mayenhorst married Baron Wilhelm von Kralik jr in 1862. In Bohemia, Jan Matious continued the family line. In 1789 the family was listed Soupis Královských Svobodníků (List of royal freemen). His daughter Barbara married Baron Franz von Raule in 1829. In the 1800s, the remaining family moved from Bohemia with grandson John Jankovský (1845-1944), establishing a new family line in America. Senior members of the family, Thomas Joseph and William Otto, made a return visit to Bohemia and Moravia in 2005 and 2007 and were honored during their visit to Bítov Castle.

He played for the Chicago White Sox, Boston Braves, Milwaukee Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, and New York Giants. The nickname Max was given to him by his childhood friends.Baseball Register, 1956, C.C Spink & Son, pg. 232. Minor league pitcher A native of Central Falls, Rhode Island, the right-handed Surkont was in the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a major league prospect. He was highly touted in 1942, prior to injuring his arm during spring training. This impeded his advancement throughout the season, as the injury was of a lingering kind.High-flying birds: the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals, Jerome M. Mileur, University of Missouri Press, 2009, pg. 134. Surkont was sold to the Braves before being returned to the Cardinals after manager Billy Southworth passed on him. He was again shipped to the Rochester Red Wings, where he remained until 1949. Then the Chicago White Sox risked the draft price on Surkont. The team was struggling at the time to emerge from the second division of the American League standings.Baseball Digest, August 1951, pg. 69.

The first tropical cyclone of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, the storm formed on May 30, 2008 from the interaction of two tropical waves and the remnants of the eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Alma, which had crossed into the western Caribbean Sea. The system quickly organized and was named Tropical Storm Arthur on May 31, while crossing the shore of Belize. It dissipated two days later over the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Arthur and its remnants triggered severe flooding which killed a reported nine people and affected 100,000 more in Belize. Damage was light to moderate, estimated at $78 million (2008 USD). Meteorological history By May 29, 2008, the western Caribbean Sea became tropically active due to the presence of two tropical waves and Tropical Storm Alma, which was located in the east Pacific Ocean. The system generated a broad surface low pressure system, as well as clusters of convection. The next day, Alma made landfall on Nicaragua, pulling deep tropical moisture into the region. Upper level outflow was spreading outwards from the tropical storm with a high pressure system over the Caribbean. A surface trough developed and extended from inland Honduras to just south of the Cayman Islands, which sparked further development of strong convection. On May 31, the remnants of Alma were situated along the coast of Belize as a 1004 mbar low pressure system. A broad upper-level ridge was anchored over the Gulf of Honduras, which covered the entire region and maintained deep tropical moisture. Satellite imagery and a NOAA buoy reported sustained tropical storm-force winds. Despite moving ashore, the system was named Tropical Storm Arthur about north-northwest of Belize City. In post- analysis, it was determined that Arthur had developed more than 12 hours earlier, late on May 30, and made landfall early on May 31 with 45 mph (75 km/h) winds in northeastern Belize. While over land, Arthur maintained minimal tropical storm force winds, concentrated primarily over open waters to the east and northeast. Despite being over land for several hours, the storm maintained a fairly organized structure. The storm contained a large low-level center, accompanied by convective banding, and was developing new convective cells. Initially, it was thought Arthur would continue generally westward due to a ridge to its north, and later re-intensify in the Bay of Campeche. The associated thunderstorm activity became separated from the center of circulation, and early on June 1, the center became difficult to locate due to becoming disorganized. It remained a tropical storm over land for nearly 24 hours before weakening to a tropical depression later that day. While drifting southwestward over land, Arthur weakened further, and the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system late on June 1. By June 4, the remnants of Arthur were diminishing over southeastern Mexico without any redevelopment. Thunderstorms briefly redeveloped two days later, as its associated circulation crossed over the Bay of Campeche into Veracruz, although it dissipated soon after. Impact and records Alma and Arthur In preparation for the storm, ports were closed in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, while residents and tourists were encouraged to take precautions in coastal areas. Also, ports were closed on the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and in Chetumal. Small boats were restricted from leaving some ports, but evacuations were deemed unnecessary. Tropical storm warnings were issued as soon as the storm was first classified for the coast of Belize and the coast of Mexico south of Cabo Catoche, and remained in effect until Arthur weakened to a tropical depression. While crossing Belize, Arthur dropped heavy rainfall, estimated as high as . The storm produced rainfall as far south as Belize City and kicked up strong surf on the island of Ambergris Caye. Winds from Arthur forced the closure of two of Mexico's three main oil exporting ports in the Gulf of Mexico due to rough seas. The storm's remnants, combined with recent heavy rains from Tropical Storm Alma, triggered flash flooding and caused rivers in southern and northern Belize to overflow. The flooding damaged one bridge and one highway, and several other bridges were under water. One village was evacuated, and shelters in Corozal and Orange Walk were opened. In rural areas the electricity was cut off due to safety issues. Dozens were stranded on their roof due to high water, and work to repair an important highway was halted when flood waters washed away the repaired section. Papaya plantations, shrimp farms and rice crops were also affected by the unsettled weather. In all, about 100,000 people were affected by the flooding, and nine fatalities were reported; five of which were directly attributed to Arthur. A total of 714 houses were damaged, and damage in Belize was estimated at $78 million (2008 USD). British helicopters helped rescue stranded people following the storm, and Mexico provided a helicopter to help carry supplies to areas affected by the flooding. Prime Minister Dean Barrow declared a disaster area in southern Belize's Stann Creek Valley. Additionally, the government rushed food, water and clothing to about 13,000 people. When Arthur later moved over Mexico, it dropped heavy rainfall, with a maximum 24-hour total of 8.34 in (212 mm) in Pijijiapan, Chiapas. There were no reports of damage or deaths in the country. Arthur was the first tropical storm to form in May in the Atlantic since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981, and the last until Tropical Storm Alberto in May 2012.

It uses the M8A1 scabbard. Background During the Korean War, the M1 bayonet, which mounted to the M1 rifle, was found difficult to remove while wearing heavy gloves. As a result, the M5 bayonet was designed and issued in 1953. This was a total redesign based on the M4 bayonet used by the M1 carbine. The M5 bayonet looks nothing like the original M1 bayonet, and is the only U.S. bayonet without a barrel mount ring on the crossguard, making it look more like a fighting knife than a bayonet. Description The M5 bayonet has a 6¾ inch blade, and overall length is 11½ inches. Weight is 11½ ounces. The blade has one side sharpened for its full length and three inches of the other side are sharpened. There is a relatively large push button release to deal with removal while wearing gloves. The stud on the bayonet crossguard fits the gas cylinder lock screw under the M1 barrel. Locking grooves attach to the bayonet lug on the rifle. The M5 fits only the M1 and does not interchange with any other firearms. There were three different patterns made: M5, M5-1 and M5A1. M5 Bayonet crossguard labeled US M5 The grips are checkered black molded plastic and all metal parts are a dark gray parkerized finish. There are no markings on the blade. The manufacturer name or initials and \\"US M5\\" (or other model) will be found stamped under the cross guard. Many M5 family bayonets were made in Korea after the Korean War and these will have \\"K\\" stamped in place of the \\"US\\". Manufacturers included Aerial Cutlery, Jones & Dickinson Tool, Imperial Knife, Utica Cutlery, and Columbus Milpar & Mfg. The M5A1 was manufactured during the 1960s and was the last bayonet made for the M1 Garand.\\"M5 Bayonet at Olive-Drab.com\\" Retrieved 05/03/2010 M8 and M8A1 Scabbard There are two variations of this scabbard, both with an olive drab fiberglass body with steel throat. The early version M8 scabbard only had a belt loop and lacked the double hook that earlier bayonet scabbards had for attaching to load carrying equipment such as the M1910 Haversack. The improved M8A1 scabbard manufactured later in WW II has the M1910 bent wire hook. The scabbard throat flange is stamped \\"US M8\\" or \\"US M8A1\\" on the flat steel part along with manufacturer initials. Some M8 scabbards were later modified by adding the M1910 hook. Later M8A1 scabbards were manufactured with a modified extended tab on the web hanger to provide more clearance for the M5 bayonet which rubbed against the wider bayonet handle.http://www.usmilitaryknives.com/bayo_points_18.htm This sheath is correct for all post-war US bayonets including the M4, M5, M6, and M7.

Death On June 30, 1905, Dowling was on his way to La Grande, Oregon, where he had joined a semipro team. Dowling missed his train at Fox Lake station in Union County, and decided to walk along the tracks en route to the game. While walking on the track in Hot Lake, Dowling was struck by an oncoming train which decapitated him. He was interred at Odd Fellows Cemetery in La Grande.

He would play for the Washington Senators, St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. Goodwin was known for throwing the spitball, and he was one of the 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after it was outlawed in 1920. Goodwin was a pilot in World War I, and died after the war from injuries sustained in a training flight while a member of the Army Air Service Reserve. He is believed to have been the first professional athlete killed as a result of a plane crash. Early life Goodwin was born and raised in Gordonsville, Virginia, and graduated from high school there. He attended college for two years in New London, Connecticut, and later took a position as a telegraph operator with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Goodwin became an established baseball star with the semipro team in his hometown, and the railroad agreed to give him time off when he was offered a contract by the Washington Senators in 1916. Baseball career before World War I In , Goodwin pitched for the Martinsburg Blue Sox of the Class D Blue Ridge League, starting and completing 31 games with a record of 19–12, with 10 shutouts. His major league debut came in September of that year, when he appeared 3 times in relief for Washington, pitching innings and giving up two earned runs. Goodwin started the season with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, and compiled a record of 8–9 with a 1.91 ERA, before being acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals in July. With the Cardinals his record for the season was 6–4 with a 2.21 ERA. Military service during World War I In December 1917, Goodwin joined the United States Army. Being unmarried and with no dependents, he told the Cardinals he was sure to be drafted, so he enlisted in order to join the aviation corps. He was stationed in Texas, where he successfully completed his training, and became an aviation instructor. He was preparing to deploy to France when the war ended in November 1918. Baseball career after World War I After the war, Goodwin rejoined the St. Louis Cardinals. In his record was 11–9 with a 2.51 ERA, and in his record was 3–8 with a 4.95 ERA. For and he split time between the Cardinals and their farm club, the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League, and then spent all of the 1923 and 1924 seasons with Houston. In May 1924, Goodwin became player-manager of the Houston club, a role he continued through the next season. Late in the season he was sold to the Cincinnati Reds; he appeared in four games for the Reds, compiling a 0–2 record with a 4.79 ERA. His final major league appearance came on the final day of the season, when he pitched a complete game in the first half of a doubleheader, but lost 4–2. Death Two weeks after his final appearance with the Reds, Goodwin crash landed his airplane at Ellington Field on October 18, 1925. The accident occurred during a training exercise when he was performing reserve duty with the United States Army Air Service. Goodwin experienced a tailspin about 200 feet (61 meters) in the air. He was hospitalized with serious injuries including two broken legs. His piloting skills were credited with saving him from immediate death. Goodwin died on October 21, 1925, from the injuries he sustained three days earlier. Legacy As noted by The Sporting News, \\"Marvin was a gentleman and an athlete of whom baseball can be proud... Lieutenant Goodwin sacrificed his life in behalf of his country. No person can do more.\\" Goodwin is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in his hometown of Gordonsville.

The average crossing number is often seen in the context of physical knot theory. Definition More precisely, if K is a smooth knot, then for almost every unit vector v giving the direction, orthogonal projection onto the plane perpendicular to v gives a knot diagram, and we can compute the crossing number, denoted n(v). The average crossing number is then defined as the integral over the unit sphere: : \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_{S^2} n(v) \\\\, dA where dA is the area form on the 2-sphere. The integral makes sense because the set of directions where projection doesn't give a knot diagram is a set of measure zero and n(v) is locally constant when defined. Alternative formulation A less intuitive but computationally useful definition is an integral similar to the Gauss linking integral. A derivation analogous to the derivation of the linking integral will be given. Let K be a knot, parameterized by : f: S^1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb R^3. Then define the map from the torus to the 2-sphere : g: S^1 \\\\times S^1 \\\\rightarrow S^2 by : g(s, t) = \\\\frac{f(s) - f(t)}{f(s) - f(t)}. (Technically, one needs to avoid the diagonal: points where s = t .) We want to count the number of times a point (direction) is covered by g. This will count, for a generic direction, the number of crossings in a knot diagram given by projecting along that direction. Using the degree of the map, as in the linking integral, would count the number of crossings with sign, giving the writhe. Use g to pull back the area form on S2 to the torus T2 = S1 × S1. Instead of integrating this form, integrate the absolute value of it, to avoid the sign issue. The resulting integral is : \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi}\\\\int_{T^2} \\\\frac{(f'(s) \\\\times f'(t)) \\\\cdot (f(s) - f(t))}{(f(s) -f(t))^3} \\\\, ds\\\\, dt. References Further reading *. *. *. *.

The building is also often called St. Anthony Tower, or 1247 St. Anthony. At it is the largest single HUD-subsidized building in Minnesota, and the 22nd-tallest building in Saint Paul. With over 500 units it is the largest single-building subsidized housing complex in the U.S. west of Chicago.Emporis.com The building is run by CommonBond Communities, the largest developer or owner of affordable rental housing in Minnesota. The nonprofit bought the building in 2000 with the help of U.S. Bank. The building was previously owned by Skyline Towers Co and managed by Sentinel Management Co. History Skyline Tower opened in 1971 as part of HUD's section 236 program. It was then sold to private owners, converting to federally subsidized housing. The owner, Sentinel Management, struggled to address drug problems, crime, and a deteriorating building. A series of fires in 1998–1999 led to an increased push for sprinkler systems. Service agencies also struggled to provide services to the building's low-income residents, often running out money before long-term change could be enacted. In 1991 an attempt to evict drug users and problem tenants significantly lowered the building’s occupancy levels. Occupancy was boosted from 60% to 95%, creating more money for maintenance concerns. However, by 2000 the 1986 exterior installation and finishing was failing, the 1970s appliances, cabinets and plumbing were in need of refurbishing and common space was limited. Finding itself unable to finance the necessary major improvements and wishing to avoid tearing down the building, Sentinel Management agreed to sell the property to affordable housing non-profit CommonBond Communities in 2005. During the 1990s most of the residents of Skyline Toweres were very poor. In 1997 the average resident's annual household income was $6,738, which was then roughly 15% of the United States average. In 1995 residents spoke over twenty different languages. The number of residents also varied. Low numbers were around 850 residents when there was a 71% occupancy rate to 2,000 residents. Due to its high concentration of poverty, the building was characterized in a 1993 paper \\"as a ghetto tipped on its edge\\". As a result of this characterization and the building's residents at the time, Skyline Towers was often referred to during that decade as a \\"ghetto in the sky\\" or specifically as The Ghetto in the Sky. Of the building's 506 units, 451 were federally subsidized. Partially as a result of the high rate of poverty, there were often high levels of crime. In 1994, there were 643 police calls to the building. The stairways were also closed due to security concerns. In 1996 the building's operator paid $150,000 a year to contract an outside security firm. In 1996 the building received a federal grant to install a high tech security system to lower crime. The system also allowed only one person to enter the building at a time. Renovation and new residents Skyline Tower from the sidewalk In 2000, $31.3 million was raised by CommonBond Communities to buy and renovate the building. The money came from a variety of sources including the City of Saint Paul, HUD, Ramsey County, U.S. Bancorp, CommonBond Communities, Sentinel Management Co and the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency. $15.2 million was used for renovation and the rest to purchase the building. Ramsey County contributed $10 million in tax-exempt bonds, the first time the county contributed to a project of this type The rehabilitation repaired the crumbling exterior, added sprinkler systems and replaced outdated appliances and plumbing. It also added on a service center which is run and funded by CommonBond and designed to improve the skills and earning capacity of residents. The change of ownership and structural renovation is credited with improving the building. Since then the building has seen an influx of Somali residents. As a results of its large new immigrant population, Skyline Tower's nickname has also changed to United Nations of the Sky.

History Brazilian President Lula and Uruguayan President Tabaré Vázquez. Before the 1960s, the economy of Uruguay provided its citizens with middle-class affluence, and emigration was limited. With a comfortable standard of living, adequate employment opportunities, a favorable social welfare and health insurance system, and democratic freedoms, the need to leave was not pressing. On the whole, even the poorest of the Uruguayans enjoyed certain benefits that kept them satisfied enough to stay in their own country. For those who left the cultural and recreational opportunities of the cities, where 85 percent of all Uruguayans lived, the proposition of going to neighboring countries such as Argentina, with its familiar language and proximity to the home country, was more appealing than moving to Southern Brazil. Those who pursued business or educational opportunities in the Brazil and elsewhere, often returned home, never forsaking their Uruguayan citizenship. Two factors changed the complacency of Uruguayans. First, there were economic and political problems in Uruguay after World War II, particularly money and employment crisis during the 1960s and 1970s. Second, an oppressive military regime took control of the government. Now, there were motivating factors to leave Uruguay, and the people leaving Uruguay in vast numbers were the ones that the country could least afford to lose—well-educated professionals and the young. This, too, marked the beginning of the social security crisis. As the aging population retired, and young people left the country, the burden on the country's financial resources grew. Of Uruguay immigrants from 1963 to 1975, 17.7 percent of them were aged 14 years or younger, 68 percent of them were between the ages of 15 and 39, and only 14.3 percent were over 40 years old. The continued employment problems of the late 1980s represented yet another impetus for the youth of Uruguay to seek employment and new lives elsewhere. Some of them went to the United States, but the largest population of Uruguayan emigrants continued to reside in Argentina and Brazil. Modern estimates put the figure of Uruguayans in Brazil at about 55,000. There are many thousands of Uruguayan citizens who also have Brazilian citizenship and vote in elections in both countries.\\"Double plate\\": Uruguayans with Bolsonaro Notable people *César Charlone, cinematographer *Juan Figer, football agent *Emílio Garrastazu Médici, President of Brazil, was son of a Uruguayan- born woman See also * Brazil–Uruguay relations * Emigration from Uruguay * White Brazilian * Immigration from other South American countries to Brazil * Brazilians in Uruguay References Category:Ethnic groups in Brazil Brazil ","title":"Uruguayan Brazilians"},{"id":"17695680","text":"Erichthonius. Painting by Jasper van der Lanen, c. 1620. Aglaurus (; Ancient Greek: ) or Agraulus (; Ancient Greek: ) was, in Greek mythology, an Athenian princess.  Family  Aglaurus was the daughter of Cecrops and another Aglaurus, daughter of Actaeus. She had two offspring by two different gods, Alcippe (with Ares) and Ceryx (with Hermes). There were numerous versions of her myth. Mythology Taking the earliest first, Euripides Ion, lines 22–23; 484–485, mentions her, but in the Moses Hadas and John Mclean 1960 Bantam Classics translation they have Euripides say respectively: > \\"(Athena) gave Erichthonius to Aglaurus' daughters (not sisters) to keep.\\" > and > later, speaking of \\"a haunt of Pan\\": \\"There the daughters of Aglaurus still > tread the > measures of their dance, on the green lawns before the shrine of Pallas > (Athena)...\\". According to the Bibliotheca, Hephaestus attempted to rape Athena but was unsuccessful. His semen fell on the ground, impregnating Gaia. Gaia did not want the infant Erichthonius, so she gave the baby to the goddess Athena. Athena gave the baby in a box to three women—Aglaurus and her two sisters Herse and Pandrosus—and warned them to never open it. Aglaurus and Herse opened the box. The sight of the infant caused them both to go insane and they threw themselves off the Acropolis,Pausanias, Description of Greece i. 18. § 2 or, according to Hyginus, into the sea.Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae 166 Mercury, Herse and Aglaurus An alternative version of the same story is that, while Athena was gone bringing a limestone mountain from the Pallene peninsula to use in the Acropolis, the sisters, minus Pandrosus again, opened the box. A crow witnessed the opening and flew away to tell Athena, who fell into a rage and dropped the mountain (now Mt. Lykabettos). Once again, Herse and Aglaurus went insane and threw themselves to their deaths from a cliff. Another legend represents Agraulos in a totally different light. Athens was at one time involved in a long and protracted war, and an oracle declared that it would cease if someone would sacrifice himself for the good of his country. Agraulos came forward and threw herself off the Acropolis. The Athenians, in gratitude for this, built her a temple on the Acropolis, in which it subsequently became customary for the young Athenians, on receiving their first suit of armor, to take an oath that they would always defend their country to the last.Suda and Hesychius of Alexandria, s.v. Ulpian ad Demosth. de fals. leg.Plutarch, Alcibiades 15Philochorus, Fragm. p. 18, ed. Siebelis According to Ovid, Mercury loved Herse but her jealous sister, whom he calls Aglaurus, stood between them, barring Mercury's entry into the house and refusing to move. Mercury was outraged at her presumption and turned her to stone.Ovid, Metamorphoses ii. 710, &c.; It is in reference to this myth that Dante places her on the second terrace of Purgatory, alongside Cain, to guide as God's reins against jealousy. Worship One of the Attic demes (Agraule) derived its name from this heroine, and a festival and mysteries were celebrated at Athens in honor of her.Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. Christian Lobeck, Aglaoph. p. 89Dict. of Ant. p. 30, a According to Porphyry, she was also worshiped in Cyprus, where human sacrifices were offered to her down to a very late time.Porphyry, De Abstinentia i. 2 Mythographers believe Aglaurus to have an origin distinct from that of her sisters, due in part to the fact that she had her own sanctuary near the Acropolis,Herodotus 8.53 and unlike her sister Pandrosus, was more associated with young men or soldiers (epheboi) than with infants. She was particularly associated with the festival of Athena called the Plynteria.

In mathematical analysis, the rising sun lemma is a lemma due to Frigyes Riesz, used in the proof of the Hardy–Littlewood maximal theorem. The lemma was a precursor in one dimension of the Calderón–Zygmund lemma. The lemma is stated as follows:See:  :Suppose g is a real-valued continuous function on the interval [a,b] and S is the set of x in [a,b] such that there exists a y∈(x,b] with g(y) > g(x). (Note that b cannot be in S, though a may be.) Define E = S ∩ (a,b). :Then E is an open set, and it may be written as a countable union of disjoint intervals ::E=\\\\bigcup_k (a_k,b_k) :such that g(ak) = g(bk), unless ak = a ∈ S for some k, in which case g(a) < g(bk) for that one k. Furthermore, if x ∈ (ak,bk), then g(x) < g(bk). The colorful name of the lemma comes from imagining the graph of the function g as a mountainous landscape, with the sun shining horizontally from the right. The set E consist of points that are in the shadow. Proof We need a lemma: Suppose [c,d) ⊂ S, but d ∉ S. Then g(c) < g(d). To prove this, suppose g(c) ≥ g(d). Then g achieves its maximum on [c,d] at some point z < d. Since z ∈ S, there is a y in (z,b] with g(z) < g(y). If y ≤ d, then g would not reach its maximum on [c,d] at z. Thus, y ∈ (d,b], and g(d) ≤ g(z) < g(y). This means that d ∈ S, which is a contradiction, thus establishing the lemma. The set E is open, so it is composed of a countable union of disjoint intervals (ak,bk). It follows immediately from the lemma that g(x) < g(bk) for x in (ak,bk). Since g is continuous, we must also have g(ak) ≤ g(bk). If ak ≠ a or a ∉ S, then ak ∉ S, so g(ak) ≥ g(bk), for otherwise ak ∈ S. Thus, g(ak) = g(bk) in these cases. Finally, if ak = a ∈ S, the lemma tells us that g(a) < g(bk).

He started his career as a military psychiatrist, and was involved in research for the CIA, including the Project ARTICHOKE and its successor, the Project MKUltra (popularly known as the CIA's mind control program), a research project into behavioral engineering of humans. As part of his work for the CIA, he developed techniques of what he called \\"hypno-conditioning.\\" His published research from the era focused on the forensic and military range of psychological research. He would later focus on legal hypnosis. William Joseph Bryan Jr is famous for inducing Albert DeSalvo's confession to multiple homicide under hypnosis. On May 4 of 1955, William J. Bryan founded the American Institute of Hypnosis, and he then edited the institute's Journal of the American Institute of Hypnosis. He is credited with creating the 'Bryan Method' of hypnoanalysis. According to hypnosis practitioners such as Marc Aymar, Francoise Lotery and Felicia Mocanu, William J. Bryan Jr MD is recognized as one of the two central figures in the field of hypnosis during the 20th Century and they also claim that he was also the first full-time medical practitioner of hypnosis in the USA. The second central figure, they claim, was Milton H. Erickson (1901-1980). Controversy William Turner and Jonn Christian hypothesized in The Assassination of Robert F.

An Information Super-Highway was launched in 1993, followed by the creation of the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC). Public access to government information services began to move online in the late 1990s; and a drive for \\"Participatory Government\\" gave further impetus for e-government after 2002, led by the 2003 \\"E-Government Roadmap\\" which sets a number of specific targets. Defining e-Government The term \\"Electronic Government\\" first appeared in official documents in September 1993, on page 112 of a report for government reform by the Clinton administration (\\"Creating A Government that Works Better and Costs Less: From Red Tape to Results\\"). The United Nations has defined the concept \\"e-government\\", or \\"Digital Government\\", as \\"The employment of the Internet and the world-wide-web for delivering government information and services to the citizens\\". (United Nations, 2006; AOEMA, 2005). E-Government involves \\"[t]he utilization of IT, ICTs, and other web-based telecommunication technologies services to improve and/or enhance on the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector.\\" (Jeong, 2007).Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). Fundamental of Development Administration. Selangor: Scholar Press. E-government uses technologies to facilitate the smooth operation of government functions, and the disbursement of government information and services to the people. E-government has enhanced office automation in the public sector, through the utilization of the Internet and wireless technologies to connect telephones, fax machines, and printers. This is especially relevant for those public-sector fields where staff are constantly on the move, such as police officers and project managers. History The beginning (1960s–1970s) South Korea's E-Government project first started as part of the office automation efforts for statistical analysis work in the Economy Planning Board (EPB) with the introduction of computers in 1967. At the time, it was the Committee on Coordination for Development of Computerized Organization established in 1967 under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) that supplied computers to each ministry in the government. In a survey conducted a decade later on supply and management of computers in government agencies by MOST in 1977, it was found that computers had greatly contributed to fast and accurate results in simple arithmetic tasks such as payroll and personnel management, calculations for phone bills, grading tests and so on, in central agencies such as the Ministry of Culture and Education, Ministry of Communication and Postal Service, and the National Tax Agency. However, in 1978, the need for informatization rather than simple automation of menial tasks brought about the start of the E-Government initiative aiming to realize a more advanced model of E-Government. Moves to introduce ICT into government took the form of E-Government projects for building necessary infrastructure to achieve this end, under the \\"Five Year Basic Plan on Informatizaton of Public Administration\\". These efforts, led by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs (MOGAHA), paved the way for implementation of South Korea's advanced informatization policies in the 1980s. Building the infrastructure for E-government (1980s–1990s) The decision to build a \\"National Backbone Computer Network\\" and subsequent enactments of laws such as the Computer Program Protection Act and Supply and Utilization of Computer Network Act in 1986, and the Software Development Promotion Act in 1987, secured technology and infrastructure vital to realizing e-governance. These efforts led to a concrete plan and project engagements for the \\"National Backbone Computer Network\\" project that would become the communications and information network for the public sector. Under this plan, five national network projects - administration, finance, education and research, defense, and security - were launched. This period was also a turning point for the infrastructure of e-governance in Korea. In 1993, a basic plan for building the foundation for the Information Super-Highway was announced, and the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) was launched in 1994. The following year saw the enactment by the National Assembly of the \\"Framework on Informatization Promotion Act\\", which became the basis for policies on informatization and e-governance. Based on this Act, the \\"Informatization Promotion Committee\\" was created along with the \\"Informatization Promotion Fund,\\" to act as the steering head for informatization and E-Government initiatives. This act also provided a firm basis for implementing E-Government initiatives such as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) system. During the latter half of the 90s, the first Informatization Promotion conference was held at the Blue House on October 14, 1996, where President Kim Young-sam's ideas on E-Government were announced in the form of a report, \\"Informatization Strategy for Strengthening National Competitiveness\\". In 1997, an evaluation system for informatization projects was introduced while plans were made for implementation of the second stage of advanced ICT. Full-scale implementation of E-Government (2000–Present) With the inauguration of the Kim Dae-jung administration in 1998, the official government homepage went online and Internet-based civil services, such as real estate registration, became available. Presidential executive orders for appointing CIOs in the public sector and guidelines for sharing administrative information were established as well. In 1999 a comprehensive E-Government implementation plan was created, while civil services based on integrated civil application information system and comprehensive statistical information system were introduced. ::: By 2001, halfway into the term of the Kim Dae-jung administration, South Korea passed the first comprehensive legislation on E-Government, the \\"Promotion of Digitalization of Administrative Work for E-Government Realization Act\\". The SCEG began work in February of the same year, holding 12 executive and two general meetings where detailed plans for implementation, as well as funding for the 11 newly selected key E-Government projects, listed in (Table 1), were drawn up and reported to the President on 7 May 2001. With the inauguration of Participatory Government under President Roh Moo-hyun from 2002, policies for E-Government became focused on ways to extend informatization. The former PCGI was restructured into PCGID (Presidential Committee on Government Innovation and Decentralization), encompassing E-Government, administrative reform, fiscal and tax reform, and decentralization. From each of the sub-committees in charge of these areas, implementation plans centered on the presidential agenda were announced as Roadmap tasks. For e-governance, the \\"Participatory Government's Vision and Direction of E-Government\\" was announced in May 2003, and the \\"E-Government Roadmap\\" based on the vision of realizing the \\"World's Best Open E-Government\\" was released in August of the same year. The roadmap is divided into four areas, 10 agenda, 31 tasks and managed in terms of 45 detailed subtasks. It sets specific targets, including: to increase online public services to 85%; to attain a top 10 ranking in the world for business support competitiveness; to reduce visits for civil service applicants to 3 per year; and to raise the utilization rate of E-Government programs to 60%.

His best friend tells him he's stupid; \\"it's a small-time suckers game\\".

We're all heroes in our own movie. \\"The Moneytree\\" offers a surprising look at the other side of the headlines. There is no writer credited because, although the actors were given a storyline, all the dialogue is improvised. The film's ending leaves one wondering if the film is more of a documentary than is implied.

The early British rulers of India were not in favour of Christian missionaries being active in India, but William Carey (1761-1834) established a mission at Serampore in 1799 which became known as the cradle of Modern Missions. Two Khasi were converted through the ministry of Krishna Chandra Pal, who was deputised by William Carey in 1813, and worked at the trading outpost of Pandua, situated in the Sylhet Plains. The same year a mission station was opened at Jowai in the Jaintai Hills. William Carey, heartened by the efforts of Krishna Pal, began a translation of the Bible into Khasi using Bengali script. In 1832 Carey sponsored Alexander B. Lish as a missionary at Cherrapunjee. Lish stayed six years, learning the language, opening schools, and translating the New Testament into Khasi, using Bengali script. This script was unknown to the Khasi at that time, which perhaps accounts, in part, for Lish's lack of converts. So began the history of the missionary efforts of the Welsh in Khasiland. The Secretary of the Welsh Mission, the Reverend John Thomas Jones from Aberriw in Wales who had a strong desire to work in India had applied to the LMS on medical grounds. Reverend Jones managed to obtain support from his congregation and incorporated The Welsh Missionary Society and they sent him to work in the Khasi Hillshttp://www.mundus.ac.uk/cats/51/1042.htm (created 5 Jan 2012 - viewed 5 Jan 2012). The Foreign Missions enterprise of the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church (later known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales) began at Liverpool in 1840. Earlier this church had supported the work of the London City Missionary Society both in terms of home support and also in overseas agency—four Calvinistic Methodists were sent out by the LMS in the years up to 1840. However, there arose a feeling among Welsh Calvinists, especially those in North Wales, that the Welsh Calvinists were not being sufficiently represented in the LMS and that, moreover, the Methodist Churches had not done what they ought to have done in evangelising the Heathen world. A former London City Missionary by the name of Jacob Tomlin had toured the Khasia Hills before 1840 and recommended that the Welsh Calvinists adopt this area as its first mission. The area had been brought under British domination with a military station at Chrrapunji. In 1874 the Khasia and Jaintia Hills and the plains of Assam were designated the Province of Assam. The first missionary, Rev. Thomas Jones, left with his wife for Cherrapunji in November 1840. They arrived at the reputedly rainiest plain on earth in June 1841. The Rev. Jones learned the Khasi language and after one year opened schools with his publication: First Khasi Reader. The Reverend was aided by a number of other Welsh missionary workers and the first two converts to the Christian faith from Khasiland were baptised in March 1846.

Rev Thomas Jones and his wife arrived in Sohra and from the town, this work spread to Sylhet today known as Bangladesh and Cachar Plains, Assam, Mizoram, Manipur and Tripura. But before this around 1813 the Serampore Mission stated working in at the foot of the Khasi Hills. This mission closed in 1838, the Welsh missionaries revived this effort. Rev. William Pyrse arrived to strengthen this work. The first Presbytery was formed in 1867 in Khasi Hills, and 5 presbyteries were established in 1895, resulting in 1896 in what was then called the Assembly. Work was started in 1896 in Sylhet and Cachar, and later another Assembly was formed in there. In 1947 India and Pakistan were divided, the greater part of the area came under Pakistan, the Pakistan Assembly discontinued. In India the Welsh reached Mizoram, and was strengthen by another missionaries, and the work developed since 1897.www.reformiert-omline.net By the end of the 1890s the church grew in membership and character, this was the Welsh religious revival, and includes today the whole population. Various tribes in north Cachar Hills who had been evangelizedby missionaries and local workers were organised as an Assembly, but this assemblies were just regional, not the whole Presbyterian denomination was included. The Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Assam was created in 1926.www.pciga.org/sub.php?sub=aboutus.php The highest church court, the Synod was renamed to Assembly in 1956.

Early life Born in Boggabri, New South Wales, Edward St John was one of eight children of a Church of England canon and a descendant of many famous St Johns, including Ambrose St John, who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a close friend of Cardinal John Henry Newman, and Oliver St John, a statesman and judge who challenged the legality of Charles I's Ship Money tax.The Independent \\"Madeleine St John Obituary\\", by Christopher Potter 6 July 2006. Edward St John was educated at state schools before attending the University of Sydney. His older brother was Anglican churchman Roland St John. Career He became a barrister in 1940 and served in the 2nd AIF in Australia, the Middle East and the New Guinea campaign between 1940 and 1945 during World War II.Barnier, Cheryl (ed.) Notable Australians Paul Hamlyn Pty. Ltd. 1978 Upon his return he was a law lecturer at the University of Sydney. In 1959 he was an official observer at the South African Treason Trial in Pretoria. He served in 1960 as a member of the Malta Constitutional Commission. In 1966, before entering parliament, he was an acting judge of the Supreme Court on NSW. He was also President of the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists. In November 1966 St John was elected to the House of Representatives as the Liberal member for the safe seat of Warringah. As a barrister, St John successfully defended Richard Walsh, editor of the satirical magazine Oz at the first Oz obscenity trial in 1964. Of his last two major cases he successfully defended Thomas and Alexander Barton, two company directors charged with a series of alleged offences in which Barton company shareholders lost millions of dollars. The prosecutor for the NSW Corporate Affairs Commission was Tom Hughes QC, a former Liberal Attorney- General. The other was a major action arising out of the Chelmsford Hospital scandal. Controversies His maiden speech before the House of Representatives on 16 May 1967 was remarkable for not being, as is usual, a paean to the beauties of the electorate, the civic pride of its inhabitants and the aims of its new representative. Instead, he criticised, in forthright terms, the conduct and findings of the Royal Commission into the Voyager disaster, calling for a second inquiry. Even more remarkably, and against all precedent, he was interrupted by an interjection from the Prime Minister – his own party leader – Harold Holt. He had effectively sacrificed his parliamentary career, but there was a second Royal Commission, largely vindicating his stand. He irritated the Government. In a debate on the new General Dynamics F-111 aircraft the Minister for Air, Gordon Freeth, said of St John: :From this honourable gentleman emanates an odour of sanctity in this House which is quite nauseating. He has come here fairly recently with all the benefits of his party's endorsement for one of the safest electorates in Australia, and in this comfortable security he has been quick, very quick, to cash in on every opportunity to secure for himself a headline—always available to any member who attacks his own party. He has used this regardless of the political consequences to his own less comfortably situated colleagues. He does this with an air of the highest virtue, always proclaiming his anguish, as he did last night.House of Representatives Hansard 10 October 1968 p1828. In 1969 he embarrassed his party by criticising the behaviour of Prime Minister John Gorton, claiming that he had offended American ambassador Crook by turning up at 1 am at the American embassy, after a late press-gallery dinner, with journalist Geraldine Willesee, the 19-year-old daughter of Labor Senator Don Willesee.House of Representatives Hansard 20 March 1969 pp790-792 Labor Senator Lionel Murphy sent a message to the House suggesting that St John's comments were an inappropriate breach of the Prime Minister's privacy. St John's view was that Gorton was inadequate in character, training and temperament to be prime minister. He said that he was not the only one dissatisfied with Gorton, but no other party members supported him. Gorton's wife Bettina supported her husband by sending a poem to the press gallery, referring to St John as \\"the member with the Serpent's tongue\\".Edward St John 'A Time to Speak', Sun Books, 1969, p207. St John resigned from the Liberal Party on 28 March 1969 to sit as an independent.As an independent member he spoke only twice in the House: 29 April 1969 and 26 August 1969 He contested Warringah as an independent at the October 1969 election, but finished third after losing more than half of his primary vote from 1966. His book about these turbulent times, A Time to Speak,published by Sun Books, Melbourne, 1969. The title was taken from the Book of Ecclesiastes. The book was reviewed by J. D. Pringle in The Sydney Morning Herald on 11 October 1969, \\"St John's Gospel\\". was published just before the elections.

St John helped establish global principles of the rule of law at successive meetings of the International Commission of Jurists in Bangkok, Rio de Janeiro and New Delhi, a non-governmental international human rights organisation. As an environmentalist he led the campaign against the flooding of Lake Pedder, which was dammed in 1972. After leaving politics for himself he supported Peter Garrett's Nuclear Disarmament Party candidature for the Australian Senate in 1984, which almost succeeded. Over the last decade of his life he campaigned for nuclear disarmament and peace. In 1984 he and the poet Les Murray jointly composed \\"The Universal Prayer for Peace: A Prayer for the Nuclear Age\\". A founding member of Australian Lawyers for Nuclear Disarmament in the same year, he was instrumental in its affiliation to the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms. In the mid-1980s he co-founded and chaired the Australian Peace Foundation. Inspired by his New Zealand colleague Harold Evans, he was a leading supporter of the World Court Project (WCP), through which his last quest was to ask the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion on the criminality of nuclear weapons.State Library of New South Wales, Manuscripts, Oral History and Pictures – Collection record details From 1985 St. John began writing his major work, an anti-nuclear book Judgment at Hiroshima, with some research assistance from Elizabeth Handsley but died before publication. A Japanese edition appeared in 1995 to coincide with the 50th anniversaries of the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. His widow Valerie released the English version two years later with copies distributed to research libraries in Australia and overseas. Personal life In 1940 he married Frenchwoman Sylvette Cargher, who committed suicide in 1954. They had two daughters: Madeleine and Colette. Madeleine became a successful yet reclusive writer who was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 1955 he married Valerie Winslow, who died in 2010. They had three sons: Oliver, Edward (Ed) and Patrick. Death Edward St John died on 24 October 1994. His funeral was held in St Luke's Anglican Church, Mosman. The address was given by Justice Michael Kirby, who recalled St John's relationship to Oliver Cromwell: > In his blood, as he told the House of Representatives in 1967, were the > genes of Oliver St John who defended John Hampden when he refused to pay > ship money to King Charles I. Oliver married into the Cromwell family.

The ruins are located about west of Mountainair, at about 6100 feet (1859 m) above sea level. They are said to date back to the 14th century. It was a major trading station during its time. There is a visitor contact station, a 0.25 mile (0.4 km) trail through the mission ruins, and a 0.5 mile (0.8 km) trail around the unexcavated pueblo ruins. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1962. and Abo is also the geological type locality for the Abo Formation, which is made up of sandstone red beds and is exposed to the northwest of the Abo ruins. History Abó was the site of a Native American Pueblo. The community, composed of Tompiro-speaking Tanoans, was recorded to have a population of more than 1,600 in 1641. The Tompiro language was likely related to Piro, as well as to Tiwa, which is still spoken at present-day Pueblos of Isleta and Sandia west of Abó. As village-dwelling and sedentary Pueblo Indians, the Abó Tompiros' livelihood depended on agriculture. The region where they lived is more than 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) in elevation, near the upper climatic limit for corn cultivation. They had little surface water for irrigation, rainfall was sparse and sporadic, and winters were cold. Tompiro settlements were made viable by their proximity to salt deposits in the Salinas and to the bison herds of the Great Plains. The Tompiros were important traders and middlemen between the Plains Indians and the Pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley for salt and bison skins and meat. They s also hunted small and large game in the region, especially deer, pronghorn, and rabbits and gathered wild foods, including pinyon (piñón) pine nuts. Abó appears to first enter the documentary historic record in 1583, when a visit to a site believed to be Abó was recorded by the Spanish explorer Antonio de Espejo. Spanish missionary work began there in 1622, and construction of the first church began in 1629. The Pueblo was abandoned around 1672, apparently due to drought and attacks by the Apaches. The Spanish recorded that Abó residents then moved to the Rio Grande valley, where they later sided with the Spanish in the 1680 Pueblo Rebellion. The Abó site was acquired by the state in 1938, which preserved it as a state historic site. In 1981 it was taken over by the National Park Service as part of the newly enlarged and renamed Gran Quivira National Monument, now the Salinas Pueblos National Monument.

It is estimated that 45,000 ethnic Croats live in Brazil. Unlike other Southern American countries in which the number of Croatians has stagnated or dropped after the war, Brazil is one of the few countries where the number of Croatian immigrants is constantly on the rise. The training and work qualifications of Croat emigrants in the inter-war period remained more or less unchanged from what it had been in the earlier period; most emigrants were unskilled farmers and the number of craftsmen who emigrated increased by only a small amount. However, in the countries of South America which became very important emigration targets in the post-World War I period agricultural workers or other labourers were still in demand, and in those destinations the bulk of emigrants took up employment in agriculture (Argentina and Brazil) or in the mines (Chile and Bolivia). History From as far back as the 1830s the first wave of mass emigrations to the countries of the New World occurred, which mainly saw the Croatian population fit into the context of European migration flows of the time. There were many reasons why Croatians emigrated to foreign countries: economic underdevelopment, political reasons and for reasons of adventure and exploration. But for the majority of people who left their homes at the time the main reason was the economic situation. The most striking example of this was the so-called \\"Wine Clause,\\" stipulated in an 1891 trade agreement between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Italy, which was particularly unfavorable to Dalmatian viticulture. The Wine Clause allowed the import of cheap Italian wines under very favorable conditions. The Dalmatian wine industry was heavily affected by this resolution by the Viennese authorities, which reduced its market in Croatia itself. The agreement lasted decades and was not revised for some time. Political conditions as the main motive of emigration was the result of World War I and became much more significant immediately after World War II, when hundreds of thousands emigrated for fear of retaliation and the suppression of democracy by the Yugoslav authorities. The emigrants were mostly men from rural areas, young and without professional qualifications. In general it is safe to say that they performed the hardest and the most dangerous physical labor in the countries they moved to. So-called chain emigration results in compact groups of emigrants, often related by family connections, place of emigration, region, etc. Thus, many emigrants from Dubrovnik have large communities in California, emigrants from the island of Hvar in Argentina, emigrants from Korčula in Brazil, emigrants from the Lika region in the American Midwest, emigrants from Makarska in New Zealand and Dalmatians in Chile and Australia. The most recent research conducted can’t conclusively reveal how many Croatians have left their country and how many currently live abroad.

It is the second film in Ning Ying's Beijing Trilogy, a collection of three films that follows the massive changes to Beijing in the last decades of the twentieth century. Whereas Ning's previous film, For Fun dealt with the older generation, On the Beat is firmly focused on the story of the middle-aged. I Love Beijing, meanwhile, would follow characters belonging Beijing's younger generations. On the Beat was coproduced by Eurasia Communications, Euskal Media and the state- operated Beijing Film Studio. Some funding was also from the International Film Festival Rotterdam's Hubert Bals Fund. On the Beat follows a group of police officers in the Deshengmen Precinct during the slow months of winter. The policemen, stuck in the dull winter months of Beijing, get stuck in a routine, only occasionally finding excitement, as when they chase after a rabid dog. Released in 1995, On the Beat made the rounds of most of the major international film festivals, including Toronto, Telluride and San Sebastian, among others.  Plot  On the Beat consists mainly of a series of vignettes involving members of a local precinct in the Beijing Public Security Bureau. Filmed in the slow months of December, January, and February the members of the PSB find they have little in the way of substantive police work. Instead, they spend time (and manpower) on small incidents like the chasing of a possibly rabid dog, the arrest of a small-time con artist, and the reprimanding of a man who sells posters of a woman in a bathing suit. Though the incidents seem small, the PSB treats each with deadly seriousness, often to comedic effect. The film culminates in the arrest and intense interrogation of a man who may have insulted a police officer. Realizing that they have no evidence, the officers bluster as they attempt to avoid losing face.  Cast  Known for her style that echoes Italian Neorealism and cinema verite films, Ning Ying cast her film primarily with non-professional actors. Most of the police officers, for example, were actual police officers with the Beijing Police, while the residents on the police officers' beats were actual residents of Beijing neighborhoods. While essentially an ensemble piece, the film generally revolves around the character of Yang Guoli (杨国立), played by police officer Li Zhanhe (李占河).  Reception  On the Beat was well received by western critics and further cemented Ning Ying's reputation as a major talent to emerge from China in the early to mid-1990s. As such, Ning is often considered part of the \\"Sixth Generation\\" as opposed to the earlier \\"Fifth Generation\\" to which Ning is closer in both in terms of age and experience. Derek Elley of Variety for example gives the film praise, but notes that perhaps the film's \\"ironic humor is an acquired taste.\\" The New York Times meanwhile praised the films \\"effortless authenticity and a quiet, watchful style.\\" Several critics saw the film as a sly critique of the Chinese bureaucracy, a subject that was the focus of The Story of Qiu Ju, Zhang Yimou's earlier film, and which would also be referenced several years later in Lu Xuechang's Cala, My Dog!. Chinese film scholar and critic Shelly Kraicer, however, saw the film as a critique of China's \\"Coca-Colaization.\\" She notes the film's visual hints at the changing face of Beijing, from a marooned remnant of the old city wall to the constant construction overtaking the city's hutongs. In so doing, Kraicer suggests, Ning Ying has created an image of a \\"traditional city under siege\\" by modernity.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. A $90 million expansion and renovation of the library, led by the Boston architectural firms William Rawn Associates and Ann Beha Architects, opened on November 8, 2009.http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2009/11/10/cambridge-public-library-grand- opening-a-beautiful-library-for-a-great-innovation-city/ The new addition more than triples the square footage of the building, and is the first building in the US to make use of European Double-Skin Curtainwall technology.

Museum of Science Community Solar System  Prior to the renovation of the main library, the library was home to a scale model of the planet Saturn in the Boston Museum of Science's community-wide solar system model. Saturn was located just outside the portion of the building that housed the old stacks, roughly where the computer workstation sign-in table is currently located.

Other locations in Cambridge that still have models in the historic nine planet series are the Royal Sonesta Hotel (home of Earth) and the CambridgeSide mall (home of Mars).

Born in Young, New South Wales, Lynch was educated at St Mary's Denominational School before becoming a mining, road and railway contractor and dam sinker along with his father and brothers. In 1890, after being injured in a workplace accident, he selected land at Thuddungra, establishing and clearing the 1400-acre \\"Glenachrawn\\" property. He largely grew wheat on the property, but also experimented in cotton-growing. Lynch was a foundation councillor and deputy president for seven years of the Burrangong Shire, a member of the Young Land Board, a member of the local Pastures Protection Board and a justice of the peace. Lynch was an active member of the Australian Workers' Union and Young Political Labor League and was a prominent member of the Hibernian Society. He had initially been endorsed as the Labor candidate for the 1912 Werriwa by-election, but was forced to withdraw due to procedural issues with his nomination. In 1914, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Werriwa, defeating Liberal MP Alfred Conroy. Lynch was one of the Labor members who left the party in the 1916 Labor split over conscription in World War I, walking out of caucus in support of expelled Prime Minister Billy Hughes in November and being formally expelled from the party himself in December. Lynch joined the new Nationalist Party along with the other MPs involved in the split and won re-election as a Nationalist in 1917, but was defeated in 1919 by Labor's Bert Lazzarini.

It is now operated as Neville Place, an assisted living community managed by Senior Living Residences.http://www.nevilleplace.org The building was built in 1928 by Charles Reggio Greco and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Cambridge Home for the Aged and Infirm is set on the south side of Concord Avenue, between it and the north shore of Fresh Pond in the western part of the city. The main building is a 2-1/2 story Georgian Revival brick structure, roughly in the shape of a W. It has a central main block, which is flanked on either side by wings that are essentially Y-shaped with a truncated stem. The frame of the structure is reinforced concrete, which is faced in brick. The main entrance is framed by a cast stone pedimented pavilion, with a keystone arch flanked by Doric columns. The home was built in 1928 as a partial replacement for service that had previously been offered at the city's almshouse, and represents the first known instance of such a purpose-built facility in the state. The older facility had primarily been built to house able-bodied yet indigent people, and had been judged functionally obsolete as much as 15 years before this facility was built. This facility was designed by Charles Reggio Greco, a local architect who had produced designs for other municipal facilities. It remained the city's primary support for its aged and infirm population until the advent of Medicare in the 1960s. It then underwent conversion to a nursing home, and was again adapted for use as an assisted living facility in 1984.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History of building The building was initially constructed in 1901 as a chapel to The New Church Theological School, which has moved to Berkeley, California and is doing business as the Swedenborgian House of Studies. It was designed by Herbert Langford Warren (1857–1917), founder of the Harvard School of Architecture (now the Harvard Graduate School of Design), a founding member of the Cambridge church, and son of a Swedenborgian missionary. It was built by the New Church Theological School on part of the Jared Sparks estate purchased in 1889 for the purpose of housing both a school and a Cambridge congregation of Swedenborgians. In 1965 a Parish House addition was constructed at the northeast corner of the chapel to designs by Cambridge architect Arthur H. Brooks, Jr. In 2002, the Swedenborg School of Religion sold the chapel to the Cambridge Society of the New Jerusalem, which was the incorporated congregation that had been with the chapel since its construction. The building is a 1.5 story, gable-roofed, stone building in the English Gothic Revival style, constructed of rubblestone with Indiana limestone trim. The roof is green and purple slate. In plan, it is a rectangle, oriented east/west in the traditional manner of ecclesiastical architecture, entered through a one-story porch at the west end. On the west wall at either side of the porch are lancet windows with limestone hood moulds whose carved corbels represent the allegorical beasts of the four evangelists. The two lancets contain stained glass memorial windows representing \\"The Good Shepherd\\" and \\"Behold, I stand at the door and knock.\\" The altar is located in a shallow, projecting one-story gabled chancel bay at the east end. Subsidiary projections include a shed roofed side entrance and chimney on the south elevation at the chancel crossing and a hip roofed projection on the north side that is now obscured by the 1965 Parish House addition. Limestone trim embellishes the exterior of the porch and the west wall. Congregation The congregation dates back to the 1880s, but did not formally exist until the construction of the building in 1901. Since that time, Swedenborg Chapel has been served by 9 pastors.

Currently, the company is under significant artistic leadership changes and board reform. In its early years, Carousel garnered attention for its adaptations of Shakespeare in modern dress. Later, it shifted its focus to adaptations of classical stories and new works by Canadian playwrights. Carousel first mounted its productions in Vancouver playhouses such as the Arts Club Theatre Company's old Seymour Street theatre and the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. In about 1993, it relocated to Granville Island, where it has administrative offices and three rehearsal halls. Its administrative and rehearsal space is located across the street from the Waterfront Theatre, which Carousel helped to build and is where it mounts many of its productions. When Higgins took over as Artistic Director, Carousel Theatre rebranded itself as Carousel Theatre for Young People, in order to signify its focus on children and youth. Carousel has mounted premieres of several productions, some of which it had commissioned and developed. Currently, a typical mainstage season for Carousel consists of four or five productions. It offers public performances on weekends and matinees, primarily for schools, during the week. Canadian plays that premiered at Carousel Theatre include A Christmas Carol - The Musical by Mavor Moore (in 1998), Dying to be Thin by Linda A. Carson (in 1992), and Basically Good Kids by Mark Leiren-Young (in 1993). Carousel also mounted an original production of Pierre Berton's fable The Secret World of Og, adapted under commission by Governor General's Award-winning playwright Kevin Kerr. Other Carousel productions have included Seussical and Kim Selody's adaptation of The Hobbit. Many Canadian theatre artists, including Roy Surette, and Anna Cummer have worked for Carousel Theatre in the decades since it was founded.

The author was the Anglo-Irish writer and philanthropist Iris Origo.Origo, Iris. War in Val d'Orcia, Jonathan Cape, London 1947, p. 7 ff. Setting Origo, with her Italian noble husband Antonio, owned and managed the estate of La Foce, comprising 57 farms on some 7000 acres (c. 2833 ha). The early parts of the book recount the events in Italy from the end of January 1943 as seen and heard from the author's locality in rural Tuscany. The account begins with the arrival of the first refugee children, sent by parents with local links, in response to the Allied bombing of the cities, particularly Genoa and Turin.Origo, pp. 19 ff. Val d'Orcia itself escaped bombing until 17 August – pp. 61–62. Detailed information is given on the opinions and allegiances of local people and officials. \\"The intention, presumably of the raids was to produce panic: the immediate result was rather resentment. Partly of the kind that the Allies wished to produce, resentment against Fascism.... But there was also... a healthy, elemental reaction of resentment against those who were dropping the bombs.\\"Origo, p. 20, also p. 64. The overthrow of Mussolini on 24 July 1943Origo, pp. 50–52. was followed by a short chaotic period of \\"Fascist Republican\\" rule under the Italian Social Republic, whose actions were progressively superseded by the weight of German occupation and military reinforcements from Germany.Origo, p. 59. Public desires for a separate peace were tempered by feelings of shame at the idea of capitulation.Origo, pp. 54, 57–58 etc. The couple's tasks were complicated by having some fifty British prisoners of war billeted on them,Origo, p. 31 ff. in addition to catering for over twenty child evacuees, many other outlawed people, partisans, and others who had fallen foul of the Fascists and/or the German occupiers at various times, and by the birth of Origo's second daughter on 9 June.Origo, p. 41. The events of those years and the feelings toward them in ordinary people are described in vivid detail. These include the deportation or arbitrary murder of the Jews of Italy.E. g. Origo, p. 110. Cases she meets in December: Origo, pp. 126 and 127–28. A case of Catholic opposition to this: Origo, p. 132. Allied advance The Allied invasion of Sicily (9 July 1943 onwards)Origo, p. 43. and the Italian mainland (from 3 September 1943) affected Val d'Orcia through the Allied bombings of major cities elsewhere, the increasing partisan activities, and the reprisals made by the Republican Fascists and the occupying Germans.Tightening up: Origo, pp. 77–80. Many of the prisoners of war at La Foce set out to join the Allied forces, in a few cases successfully. They were more than replaced by new arrivals: \\"Indeed, our woods [round La Foce] seem likely to be thickly populated this autumn, sheltering not only Italian soldiers [evading re- enlistment], but an ever-increasing number of Allied escaped prisoners...\\"Origo, p. 84. Allied advance was felt to be painfully slow: \\"The B.B.C. exhorts its listeners in England to be patient – but this is less easy for those living here, who are still enduring Allied bombings, as well as increasingly severe German and Fascist repressive measures.\\"Origo, p. 95. \\"Allied progress imperceptible.\\"Origo, p. 96. \\"Daily the B.B.C. tells of 'four miles' progress, two miles' progress'; it seems infinitesimal. The B.B.C. reports, too, with satisfaction, the results of the Moscow Conference, but here it seems very remote indeed.... Everywhere the screw is being tightened.\\"Origo, p. 113. Origo is critical also of the way the Allied air attacks were conducted: \\"Such incidents [as the bombing of a trainload of Allied prisoners and civilians evacuated from Rome]... are part of war. But the bombing of a little town like Arezzo, including the districts farthest away from the railway – and of country churches, like the Convento dell'Osservanza outside Siena – these, and the machine-gunning of the civilian population, cannot easily be explained. It is difficult to believe that public opinion in England, if fully informed, would approve of all this.\\"Origo, p. 142.

First Baptist Church's current Gothic building was constructed in 1881 to a design by Hartwell and Richardson. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Architecture The First Baptist Church is set just south of the main intersection at the heart of Central Square, on a roughly trapezoidal lot bounded by River Street, Green Street, Magazine Street, and Franklin Street. The church building is roughly L-shaped, with its front facing north toward the square. The long main section of the building houses the sanctuary, and the rear section, extending a short way to the west, houses a parish hall, offices and other facilities of the church. The church is a tall single-story brick structure, with sandstone trim and decorative detailing in terra cotta, and has Gothic Revival styling. It has a gabled slate roof with a clerestory section near the top of the gable, with the rear section having a cross-gable roof. The slate is mainly gray-green, with bands of red. A tower rises at the northeast corner of the building, rising to an open belfry with lancet-arch windows at the third stage. Clock face sections with gabled tops interrupt the steeple, which is eight-sided, finished in slate. The church is the third to be built by the Baptist congregation, which acquired the property in 1819. The first two churches, built in 1819 and 1866, were both destroyed by fire.

Biography  Ibn Hubayra was born on Rabi II 499 A.H. (December 1105 / January 1106 CE) in Dur, a village northwest of Baghdad. As a youth, he went to Baghdad where he received a classical Arabic education under several masters, studying the Qur'an, Arabic linguistics, and the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). He was appointed as the chief of the treasury by caliph al-Muqtafi, and in 1149, he was appointed as the vizier (chief minister) of the Caliphate, a post he kept for sixteen years until his death on 27 March 1165, commonly attributed to poisoning through his physician, who was in the pay of his rivals.Makdisi (1971), pp. 802–803 His vizierate marked the final decline of the Seljuq influence in the Abbasid court (cf.

The addition of a chancel and transepts in 1872 created a cruciform plan. The original three-stage tower and spire, similar to that of the New South Church, was damaged in a storm, and in 1906 its upper two round stages and spire were replaced with a square belfry and a copper dome. Today's eight-faceted spire was built in 1964 after the dome was struck by lightning and caught fire, and now only the pedimented first stage of the original steeple remains.

In 1869 the church constructed the current meeting house, a larger Gothic revival stone building, designed by architect Alexander Rice Esty. Old Cambridge Baptist Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Built of local fieldstone and granite quarried in Somerville, Massachusetts, the building is a notable example of the muscular use of stone, typical of American Gothic Revival architecture. This solidity, coupled with Esty's display of structural strength in the asymmetrical massing of forms, is further accentuated by the contrast between heavy gray stone and large, graceful, delicate stained glass windows, which the stone walls simultaneously reveal and protect. In 1897, the original Parrish Hall was lost in a fire. The rebuild was under the direction of noted Boston Theater Architect, Clarence Blackall. The most notable feature of the reconstruction is an 1890 Tiffany & Company Window. This early Tiffany window bridges the gothic stained glass tradition and emerging art nouveau movement.

Restoration In 1924, Iris Origo, a writer who was a granddaughter of William Bayard Cutting and Hamilton Cuffe, 5th Earl of Desart, joined Antonio Origo, son of Marchese Clemente Origo in buying the dilapidated estate. They moved there after their marriage. The late 15th-century villa was restored by the Origos in the 1920s with government financial assistance.

The architects, Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan, won four gold medals from the American Institute of Architects. One was for St. John's.  History  Until the early 1890s North Cambridge and West Somerville were part of Saint Peter's parish. Members from this section of the parish would travel long distances to attend Mass on Sunday. Because of rapidly growing industries and the growing number of immigrants, Father Flately, the pastor of St. Peter's Parish, worried that the young children would not get a proper Catholic education. In 1890, he purchased an acre of land on Spruce Street (now Rindge Avenue). On January 1, 1893 St. John's Parish became an independent parish and worshiped in a small wooden chapel on Rindge Avenue. In 1898 the estate of the late Horatio Locke, on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Hollis Street, was purchased for $18,000 as the site for the new church. The Locke house was moved to 8 Hollis Street and became the second rectory. In 1930 the third and present rectory was built of yellow brick at 2254 Massachusetts Avenue, on the site of the Woodbridge House, in Prance (Dutch) School Style with Moorish windows. Architect was William B. Colleary; builder was Walsh Brothers. The old rectory at 8 Hollis Street was razed. A monstrance made of gold, silver, diamonds and other precious stones, donated by parishioners, was used for a Holy Hour to begin the Holy Year in 1933.New Advent.org:Holy Year of Jubilee It was reputed to be the largest monstrance in the United States.  Architecture  Work for the new church began on November 30, 1904, with Maginnis, Walsh & Sullivan as architects and Stephen Brennan as builder. Charles Donagh Maginnis was a disciple of Ralph Adams Cram, himself a disciple of H. H. Richardson, who designed Trinity Church, Boston. The building permit issued by the city describes the construction as brick, stone and iron. The cornerstone was laid in 1905. The first Mass was celebrated in the church on April 7, 1912 (Easter Sunday). On November 1, 1912 (All Saint's Day), the church was dedicated by Cardinal O'Connell. The church, although largely built by Irish immigrants, was modeled after the 12th century Lombardo-Romanesque basilica and is very similar to Basilica di San Zeno in Verona, Italy. Interior and stained glass windows The cream colored limestone and marble, reflective of Italian architecture of the Middle Ages, introduces color into the construction. Using Italian Gothic design of both round and pointed arches simultaneously, the pointed arches were used more for ornamentation. The same basic construction is found in the temples of Greece and Rome and was later used in Christian churches. The stained glass windows in the side walls imitate the subdued colors in the windows of sun-drenched Italy rather than those in France and Germany, where the days are darker. The beautiful high altar sits under a gorgeous stained glass window depicting the Crucifixion. The side altar on the Epistle side is dedicated to the Sacred heart of Jesus. The other side is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Campanile, rose window and bells The most outstanding feature of the church is the Campanile, or bell tower. Set well back from the facade and contiguous with the outside wall of the church, it stands free and does not compromise the facade. The Byzantine design of the top of the tower is reminiscent of the churches of the Ravenna region of Italy. An unusual feature of that style was to set the tower towards the rear of the building rather than the front. The bells ring on each quarter-hour and toll the hour, ringing the Westminster Chimes. The front approach has a broad flight of stone stairs extending the entire width of the building. The lower portion of the facade was treated as an arcade of five arches, supported by marble columns with Ionic capitals. Above the five arches a broad frieze, a band of terra cotta trim crowns the arcade. Above the frieze is a rose window, an exact replica of a church window in Toscanella, Italy. This \\"Wheel of fortune\\" represents unending life and imitates the sun. On the very peak of the facade was a statue of John the Evangelist. Fire and rebuilding On December 7, 1956 the church suffered a devastating fire. The Fitzgerald School's auditorium on Rindge Avenue was used as a temporary chapel. The roof caved in and fell into the nave of the upper church, as did the choir loft. The side windows were saved, but were removed during rebuilding. Much of the upper church was razed in February 1957. In April of that year rebuilding began. The main altar was completely rebuilt, although the original steps into the sanctuary were salvaged. The altar rail and pulpit were all left intact. Due to lack of funding the clerestory, its upper windows and catwalk were eliminated, as was the statue of St. John. The rose window was replaced by a smaller one. On the arch above the high altar are the words: \\"And the word was made flesh and came to dwell among us\\" from the Prologue of the Gospel of John. Mid-1990s renovation and liturgical update In 1996 a fund drive began to renovate and update the church. In addition to much needed repairs and upgrades the church underwent a Liturgical update. The marble high altar was moved forward from the under the baldacchino, allowing it to be used for the first time in many years due to changes made to the Mass by the Second Vatican Council. The altar rail was removed to give the sanctuary a more open and inviting feel. The pulpit was taken down and fashioned into a new ambo. Much of the marble was used elsewhere in the church; parts of the altar rail and pulpit were made into a new baptismal font. Two statues, one of St. John The Evangelist, the other of Saint Joseph, that had been placed in the sanctuary during the rebuilding were removed, painted and placed by the front entrances of the church. The two side altars were also painted emphasizing their beauty. The church's tabernacle, which had been placed on the altar of the Sacred Heart during the rebuilding, was restored to its original grandeur. During the renovation, the church was made handicapped accessible. The newly renovated and updated church was dedicated by Cardinal Bernard F. Law on December 27, 1998, the feast of St. John The Evangelist.  Masses  Mass Schedule: Saturday Vigil – 4:00 p.m., Sunday – 6:30, 9:00 & 11:00 a.m. (and 4:30 p.m. in Creole).

In 1903 Roberts built his first model which was of the \\"Wa\\" class steam locomotive using a scale of 1:19. Over the next 50 years he was to develop a garden railway at his home in Epsom, Auckland. His meticulously accurate working models of examples of the locomotives and rolling stock found on New Zealand railways became a local attraction. The popularity of this layout led to Roberts being commissioned in 1938 by the Railways Department to build and operate a working model train layout for the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition. Roberts' work for the New Zealand Centennial Exhibition (1940) showed him at the peak of his expertise. The New Zealand Railways Department section of the exhibition was extremely popular. Roberts sold his models to the Railways Department in 1950 and was employed by them to maintain them as working models.

Description and history When Mount Auburn Cemetery was opened in 1831, it quickly developed as a popular outing destination for the local population. Its popularity was such that the first horse-drawn trolley route in New England was built with a terminus at the cemetery's entrance in 1853. Demand for function spaces related to funeral activities also increased, prompting the cemetery trustees to consider building a reception hall. The cemetery's first reception house was built in 1870 to a design by Nathaniel J. Bradlee, and is one of only two surviving designs of his in Cambridge. The building was commissioned by the cemetery trustees as a place to hold receptions and other functions. It is a single story building wide and deep, with a full-width porch supported by four tapered columns, and a projecting center gable supported by two additional columns. The gable and the frieze board above the columns are decorated with incised floral patterns, while the tympanum of the gable end has a cartouche for a clock.

It is part of the economic policy orienting Morocco towards exports, based on eight clearly identified export sectors, with particular emphasis on the free trade agreement with the European Union to be implemented by 2012. The new maritime station of the Tangier-Med Port Completion of the «Tangier-Mediterranean» project will have important economic effects in terms of jobs, creation of added value and foreign investment. Its particular position on the Straits of Gibraltar, at the crossing of two major maritime routes, and 15 km from the European Union will enable it to serve a market of hundreds of millions of consumers through the industrial and commercial free zones which will be run by well-known private operators. It will also win part of the strong growth market of container transshipment and become the leading hub for cereal transshipment, a facility which is non-existent in the north-west African region at present. The project will be implemented, coordinated and managed by TMSA, a private company with public prerogatives, operating under an agreement with the State and interacting with the different ministries involved. The port complex will have important economic effects in terms of jobs, creation of added value and foreign investment. In addition to the economic effects of the operation of the port, there will be important effects resulting from its construction, particularly through foreign investments, and others from the operation of the free zones (direct and indirect added value, direct gains, jobs and foreign investment).

It is located in a one-block area surrounded by Third, Rogers, Binney, and Fifth Streets. The property was developed by the Blake and Knowles Steam Pump Company, one of the nation's leading manufacturer of industrial pumps from the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history George Blake was the owner of a brickyard in Medford who developed pumps for removing water from brickyard clay pits. Establishing a pump factory in Boston in 1864, he moved to this site in 1886. In 1879 he entered into a financial arrangement with Lucius Knowles, another pump manufacturer, and their two businesses were formally merged in 1897. By this time, the company was a nationally leading supplier of a diversity of industrial pumps. In 1916 it was merged with other pump makers to create the Worthington Pump Works. It provided pumps to the United States Army during World War I, nearly doubling the plant size so that it extended from Bent to Monroe Streets. This plant operated until 1927, when its manufacturing was relocated to Holyoke. Although the buildings were sold off for other industrial uses, the surviving ones have been remarkably little altered. The surviving elements of the Blake and Knowles are located in East Cambridge, an area that became increasingly industrial as the 19th century progressed. They are located on a single block about in size, bounded by Third, Fifth, Rogers, and Binney Streets. Buildings between Binney and Monroe associated with the company have been demolished, while a few surviving buildings between Rogers and Bent Streets survive in altered form. The complex consists of several machine shops, including its main () shop, which extends along Rogers Street, and the plant office building, which is also known as the Kendall Boiler and Tank Company after a subsequent owner.

Though initially unenthusiastic, Nepal has been of late making efforts to increase trade and connectivity with China. Relations between Nepal and China got a boost when both countries solved all border disputes along the China–Nepal border by signing the Sino-Nepal boundary agreement on March 21, 1960 making Nepal the first neighboring country of China to agree to and ratify a border treaty with China.

However, the people to people ties between these groups has been affected since 1950 onwards, after the absorption of Tibet into China resulting in the regulated border between Nepal and Tibet (as a part of China). Despite the fluctuating political scenarios in Nepal's neighborhood and within Nepal itself, the influence of Buddhism still remains strong in the day-to-day life of Nepalese people living in the Himalayan Region.

Princess Bhrikuti, as a part of her dowry, is widely believed to have brought Buddhists relics and Thangkas to Tibet, and therefore, is attributed for establishing Buddhism as the Royal religion in Tibet. Bhrikuti is usually represented as Green Tara in Tibetan iconography. The Red Palace (Mar-po-ri Pho-drang) on Marpo Ri (Red Mountain) in Lhasa, which was later rebuilt into the thirteen storey Potala Palace by the Fifth Dalai Lama, was constructed by Newari craftsmen according to her wishes, who came to Tibet from Kathmandu with her, as a part of her dowry. She also instructed her craftsmen to construct the Tub-wang and other statues in Samye, the first Buddhist gompa in Tibet.Yeshe Tsogyal (2004). The Lotus-born: The Life Story of Padmasambhava. Rangjung Yeshe Publications. p. 290. . One of her craftsmen, Thro-wo, also carved the revered statue of Chenresig (Avalokiteshvara), Thungji Chen-po rang-jung nga-ldan. During the Tang dynasty, the Chinese envoy Wang Xuance led an army of Nepalese and Tibetans to defeat an usurper in the Indian Kingdom of Magadha. In 1260 CE during the Yuan dynasty, Nepali craftsmen Araniko, on the decree of Chinese/Mongolian Emperor Kublai Khan, traveled to Shangdu and built the White Stupa of Miaoying Temple in Beijing, which was the largest structure in Beijing at that time.Kesar Lall. A Nepalese Miscellany, p.32 Taking almost ten years (1279-1288 CE) to complete, the Stupa better known as White Dagoba, is still standing today and is considered to be one of the oldest Buddhist Stupa in China.

In 1789, the Tibetan government stopped the usage of Nepalese coins for trade in Tibet, citing purity concerns over the copper and the silver coins minted by the Nepalese government,Historical money of Tibet which led to the first Tibet- Nepal War. A resounding victory of Gorkha forces over Tibetans in the first Tibet-Nepal War left the Lhasa Durbar with no choice but to ask for assistance from the Qing Emperor in Peking which led to the first Sino-Nepalese War. In the immediate aftermath of the Sino-Nepalese War (1789–1792), Nepal was forced to sign the 'Treaty of Betrawati' which stipulated that the Government of Nepal was required to make payment of tribute to Qing court in Peking once every five years, after the defeat of Gurkha forces by the Qing army in Tibet. The 'Treaty of Betrawati' signed by Nepal and Tibet on October 2, 1792 stipulated that both Nepal and Tibet recognize the suzerainty of the Qing Emperor Jiaqing, and further, stated that the Qing court would be obliged to help Nepal defend against any external aggression.Sino-Nepalese War However, during the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16), the Qing Emperor refused the Nepalese government's request to provide support to Nepalese forces, and, the latter's defeat led to the establishment of the British Empire in India. Then after, Nepal initiated a policy of balancing the influence of Imperial China and British India. Through the tenth quinquennial mission to China (1837), under the leadership of Chautariya Pushkar Shah, the Nepalese government again requested the Daoguang Emperor court to either send troops or a subsidy of Twenty million rupees to oppose the British. However, the Nepalese delegation was said to have been met with a stern refusal of its petition for monetary support, and instructed by the Qing court to stop the further hostilities by Nepal against the British.Hodgson to Gov of India, 26 May 1838, Foreign Dept Sec, 13 June 1838, No 10, NAI Soon after Nepal's defeat in the Anglo-Nepalese war, from 1840 onward, Tibetan government again stopped the use Nepalese coins for trade. In an attempt to preserve the lucrative coin export business and trade advantages, the Nepalese Kingdom, under the leadership of Jung Bahadur Rana again invaded Tibet in 1855 during the second Nepalese-Tibetan War, and raided the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, home to the Panchen Lama at that time. The invading Nepalese army was ordered to vacate the occupied Tibetan territories by the Qing Court, which was rapidly losing its hold over frontier territories due to turmoil inside China proper. Nepal's refusal to hand back the control of Tashilhunpo Monastery led to the second Sino-Nepalese War which resulted in a stalemate; a major setback for Tibetans, ultimately culminating into the Treaty of Thapathali on March 24, 1856.Treaty of Thapathali Through the Treaty of Thapathali, Nepal expressed commitment to help Tibet in the event of foreign aggression while authorities in Tibet were obliged to pay the Nepalese government a sum of Nepalese Rupees 10,000 every year. Further, Nepalese government stopped paying tribute to the rulers in Beijing after signing the Treaty of Thapathali. The withdrawal of Nepalese forces from Tibetan areas adjacent to Tibet-Nepal border in 1856 provided the Qing court with the opportunity to firmly tighten its grip in and around Lhasa and throughout Tibet. Soon after the Treaty of Thapathali, the Qing court also issued an edict which among other dispositions stipulated the introduction of a new silver coinage in Tibet, struck in the name of the Qianlong Emperor, the then ruler of China,Rhodes, Nicholas G. (Winter 1990) The first Coins struck in Tibet, Tibet Journal, Vol. 15, No. 4, Dharamsala, pp. 115–134. while at the same time, Nepalese coins were completely forbidden in Tibet from then onward.Bertsch, Wolfgang (Spring 2008) The Kong-par Tangka of Tibet, Journal of the Oriental Numismatic Society, No. 195, Croydon & Ringwood, pp. 35–46. During the late 19th century, after the rise of the British Raj as the unchallenged and the dominant power in the sub-continent, Nepal aligned itself with the British Raj in India and supported its invasion of Tibet in 1908. When China sought to claim Tibet in 1910, Nepal sided with Tibet and Britain and broke relations with China after Tibet drove Chinese forces out in 1911. Diplomatic relations and Nepalese neutrality The 1950 military occupation of Tibet by the People's Liberation Army raised significant concerns of security and territorial integrity in Nepal, drawing Nepal into a close relationship with extensive economic and military ties with Republic of India.Dick Hodder, Sarah J. Lloyd, Keith Stanley McLachlan. Land-locked States of Africa and Asia. page 177. Routledge, 1998. China ordered restrictions on the entry of Nepalese pilgrims and contacts with Tibet. The 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship that had established a close Indo-Nepalese relationship on commerce, and foreign relations, was increasingly resented in Nepal, which began seeing it as an encroachment of its sovereignty and an unwelcome extension of Indian influence; the deployment of an Indian military mission in Nepal in the 1950s and unabated migration of millions of bihari Indians into Nepal's Terai region increased these concerns. In 1955, Nepal restored diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and exchanged resident ambassadors by 1960. In 1956, both nations signed a new treaty terminating the Treaty of Thapathali of 1856 and Nepal recognized Tibet as a part of China. In 1960, Nepal and China signed a boundary settlement agreement and a separate 'Sino-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship'. Nepal also began supporting the change of China's seat in the United Nations. In 1961, Nepal and China agreed to build an all-weather road connecting the Nepalese capital Kathmandu with Tibet. During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, though Nepal overtly maintained neutrality, the government of Nepal however covertly obliged to the Indian government's request to allow Indian troops to establish 18 border observation posts (BOPs) along the Sino-Nepal border. After the war, Indian army acquisied to Nepal governments request and pulled out from all but one border observation post. India still maintains military presence in Nepal's Kalapani area. Subsequent governments of Nepal from 1990 onward have continuously urged India to remove Indian troops from Kalapani area citing that the war ended a half a century ago. Government of India as of 2020 however have so far refused to entertain Nepal's request. Human rights In June 2020, Nepal was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations. Economic and strategic relations In the late 1970s after the accession of Kingdom of Sikkim into India, King Birendra of Nepal proposed Nepal as a \\"zone of peace\\" between India and China and in the 1980s, Nepal began importing Chinese weaponry. When the United States, United Kingdom and India refused to supply arms to the regime of King Gyanendra of Nepal, who had assumed direct rule to suppress the Maoist insurgency during the Nepalese civil war (1996–2006), China responded by dispatching arms to Nepal, in spite of the ideological affinity of the Maoists with China. After the peace process and national elections in Nepal in 2008, the new Maoist-led government announced its intentions to scrap Nepal's 1950 treaty with India, indicating a stronger move towards closer ties with China. Territorial disputes Claims by China on Nepalese territory were first made in 1930 when Mao Zedong declared in the original version of The Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party, that \\"the correct boundaries of China would include Burma, Bhutan and Nepal\\". He also postulated in his Five Fingers of Tibet policy that Tibet, which he claimed was an integral part of China, was like his right palm and Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and NEFA (Arunachal Pradesh) the five fingers attached to that palm. In November 2019, Nepal's Survey Department reported of Chinese encroachment on 36 hectares in four districts of Nepal (Sankhuwasabha, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Humla) and that there was a further risk of losing several hundred hectares of land. A Nepal Agriculture department's document reported massive road development projects in the Tibet Autonomous Region that have caused Sumjung, Kam Khola and Arun rivers to change their course and expand China’s boundary into northern territories of Nepal, and warned that even more Nepalese land would be encroached by the Chinese if the rivers continue to change course. It also said that China could set up Border Observation Post of Armed Police in these encroached territories In May 2020, Chinese media, calling Mount Everest (known in Nepal as Sagarmatha) as Mount Qomolangma claimed it as part of Chinese territory, sparking outrage among Nepalese citizens. In 1961, King Mahendra, the then ruler of Nepal, had announced that Mount Everest falls squarely inside Nepal. Opposition leaders have criticized Prime Minister Oli for not raising up the Sino-Nepal border issue. In September 2020, Nepalese media reported that a border pillar in Humla District of Nepal was missing and China had constructed 11 buildings 2 kilometers inside Nepalese territory. When the Chief District Officer of Nepal went to inspect the place based on concerns raised by locals, he was told by Chinese security officials that the buildings were within Chinese territory which extends one kilometre further south from where the buildings are located. Treaties Nepal and China have signed a transit trade treaty and nine other pacts as of 22 of March 2016. Points in Nepal- China Treaty 2016: # Nepal to use China's sea port facility # Transit transport agreement to be reviewed every 10 years # China to build a regional international airport in Pokhara. # China, Nepal exploring the possibilities of signing a bilateral free trade agreement # China to explore the possibility of finding oil and gas reserves in Nepal # China to provide economic and technical support to Nepal to implement the project on Pokhara airport # China to distribute solar panels in Nepal's rural areas by tapping its Climate Fund # China to build, manage and maintain Xiarwa Boundary River Bridge at Hilsa, Humla # Nepal, China to strengthen intellectual property system in both the countries # Nepal, China to extend cooperation and exchange information on banking regulations Transportation In 2007–08, China began construction of a 770-kilometre railway connecting the Tibetan capital of Lhasa with the Nepalese border town of Khasa, connecting Nepal to China's wider national railway network. In a meeting between Chinese and Nepalese officials on 25 April 2008, the Chinese delegation announced the intention to extend the Qingzang railway to Zhangmu (Nepali: Khasa) on the Nepalese border. Nepal had requested that the railway be extended to enable trade and tourism between the two nations. On the occasion of the Nepali premier's visit to China it was reported that construction will be completed by 2020.[18] The section Lhasa- Shigatse opened in August 2014. In June 2018, China and Nepal announced an agreement to connect Xigazê, Tibet Autonomous Region with Kathmandu, via a new railroad. In September 2018, Nepalese commerce ministry official Rabi Shankar Sainju announced that China had granted Nepal access to the ports of Tianjin, Shenzhen, Lianyungang, and Zhanjiang, as well as land ports at Lanzhou, Lhasa and Xigatse. Access to Chinese ports reduces Nepal's dependence on India for commerce, a dependence that was highlighted by the 2015 Nepal blockade.

Born in Woodsville, a village of Haverhill, New Hampshire, he was listed as tall and . Smith's professional career lasted for 15 years (1948–51; 1954–64), interrupted by military service during the Korean War. Signed originally by the Red Sox, he made Boston's early-season roster in 1955, and appeared in one game in relief on April 29 against the Chicago White Sox. Summoned in the sixth inning with one out and two men on base and Chicago already in the lead, 5–0, Smith surrendered a base on balls to Nellie Fox and a two-run single to Minnie Miñoso before retiring the side; he then pitched a scoreless seventh inning. It would be his only appearance in a Red Sox uniform. After spending the remainder of 1955 and all of at the top level of minor league baseball, Smith was drafted out of the Red Sox organization by St. Louis in the 1956 Rule 5 lottery. He worked in six games as a relief pitcher for the Cardinals during the early weeks of before being sold to the Pirates at the May cutdown. He remained with Pittsburgh for the rest of that season. Thrust into a starting role late in the year, he threw a complete game, eight-hit victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on September 8. He then played another full year, , for the Pirates. He began the year in the starting rotation, but was winless in his first three appearances. Sent to the bullpen, he was given only one other start for the rest of the year. He then worked 20 more games in relief for the 1959 Pirates before he was released on waivers to the Tigers in mid-June. Detroit used him in only nine games in relief, where he was ineffective, and sent him to Triple-A Charleston for part of the season, his last in the majors. Smith played another five years at the Triple-A level before his retirement at age 33. As a big leaguer, he worked in 91 games pitched, 83 in relief, and won four of 13 decisions (.308), with two saves. In 166 innings pitched, he allowed 174 hits and 83 bases on balls. He struck out 93 and registered two complete games. All of his victories, saves and complete games came as a Pirate. His career coincided with another left-handed pitcher named Bob Smith, nicknamed \\"Riverboat\\", who also came through the Red Sox' system.

The aliens try to use global warming to make Earth more suitable to live in. Major Wozniak arrives with military reinforcements, and he goes out into the jungle to investigate. There, an alien-controlled Captain Waters tries to kill Jillian, but stops when the soldiers come to check on her screams. Captain O'Bannon and Dr. Taggert realize that the Aliens are trying to heat up the entire planet to eliminate all life except for insects. The soldiers go out into the woods at night to hunt for aliens, but experience night-vision goggle malfunctions. They are slowly killed off, one by one. Two survive, and return to base. While making more ammunition with one of the others, Caroline asks Mental about O'Bannon's romantic situation. O'Bannon goes off into the jungle to continue investigating, and discovers a cloaked area where the aliens were hiding. He returns in time to save Jillian from alien-controlled Waters, who tries to kill her again. O'Bannon fights with Waters and Waters escapes after throwing a grenade in the direction of Mental and Caroline. Dr. Taggert leaves the house to find and communicate with the aliens, and is killed by one. Mental goes out into the forest and is attacked by an alien, using up the last of his ammunition to kill it. O'Bannon and Caroline go to the forest to prepare a radio beacon for the military to launch a cruise missile. Immediately after arming the beacon, Waters attacks the two. After another fight, Waters is knocked out, and a worm like alien crawls out of his mouth. O'Bannon shoots the worm, and leaves the range of the missile. It hits, and destroys the alien facility causing global warming. In a moment of celebration, Caroline kisses O'Bannon. The group buries Waters and holds a funeral. Jillian asks if Waters was serious about raising a family. O'Bannon tells Jillian that Waters loved her.

The student paper dedicates itself to discussing socio- political issues in the Philippines, the plight and suffering of the working class, as well as pressing student rights issues. It is part of the Ateneo's Confederation of Publications (COP), including The GUIDON and Heights.http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=77 Ateneo de Manila University From a circulation of a few mimeographed copies hidden in books at the Rizal Library in the 1970s, Matanglawin is now published in glossy form and has a circulation of more than 2,000, serving the Loyola Schools community. Copies of the publication are also sent to student publications across the Philippines.  Origin of the name  The word or name Matanglawin contained negative connotations based from Philippine literary canon. The character of Cabesang Tales from Jose Rizal's novel El filibusterismo took the word as his moniker when he descended into terrorism and banditry after having been maltreated and denied justice by the Spanish colonial government. There were also characters in the plays of patriot playwrights Aurelio Tolentino and Onofre Pagsanghan representing the Filipinos who became bootlickers and lapdogs of the colonial masters named as such, characterized by their rapacity and brutality against fellow Filipinos.Albert Alejo, S.J. \\"Bakit Matanglawin?\\" Matanglawin. Vol. VI, No. 1. July 1983. The publication, however, offers a different explanation as to how the name defines its work by breaking down the word into three other words: \\"mata\\" (eye) for the student journalist's meticulous attention to detail, data, wordings and critical observation; \\"tanglaw\\" (illumination) for the writer's duty to explain difficult topics to the common reader while at the same time offering new insights; and \\"lawin\\" (hawk) for the tradition of courage in championing the cause of justice and the rights of the poor, though deviating from any ideological advocacy.http://matanglawin.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=30&Itemid;=46 Karla Mesina. \\"Pagpapakahulugan sa Pangalan\\". Matanglawin.org. Posted 22 June 2007.  Branches of Service (Bagwisan)  The publication does not limit itself to being simply a dead piece of paper; Matanglawin also presents itself as an organization of students who advocate social involvement and substantial reforms within its avenues of service to the University and the country. In view of this, the organization is divided into seven branches or \\"bagwisan\\" (literally, \\"wing\\"):http://matanglawin.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=34&Itemid;=55 \\"Mga Bagwisan ng Matanglawin. Matanglawin.org * Sulatin at Saliksikan (Content and Research): The lifeblood of the publication, it molds its members to be critical and observant of the myriad issues confronting students inside and outside campus. They also propagate a so-called new brand of journalism, one which is not \\"objective\\" as they believe it is already obsolete in such period in time. * Sining (Art): Through works of art or taken photographs, this branch gives life to the publication's otherwise pure and stale text, providing the readers an accurate glimpse of the issues they are reading about. * Disenyo (Design): Following the principle of \\"organization in chaos\\", this branch strives to make the publication palatable to the reader's viewing through effective design and layout of text and images for the magazine issues and online materials. * Pandayan (Formations): The vanguard of the publication's organizational characteristics, it is given the responsibility of preparing the members and journalists in fulfilling their objectives through educational discussions, team building seminars and outside activities. * Proyekto (Projects): This branch gives its members a chance of being able to do projects for the entire year, that is aimed to make people aware of sociopolitical issues, historical, and current events that are relevant to the society. * Social Media (Social Media): Through online communication, this branch connects with netizens using the organization's official website and other platforms (Facebook, Twitter) for efficient posting of articles, announcements, and other information that involves the organization. Awards and Recognition Received Matanglawin has garnered a multitude of awards in its 40 years of existence. It has been nominated for the Catholic Mass Media Awards. In 2002, it has also won the Best Magazine Award at the annual Gawad Ernesto Rodriguez Jr, sponsored by the College Editors Guild of the Philippines. Its website and spoof issues have also been recognized by the said organization. The publication is known for the quality of its investigative journalism, and its editorial columns. The spoof issue, Tanganglawin, has been cited for mixing tabloid humor with scathing political commentary. To make the organization more enticing to aspiring members who do not just want to write, it has included projects that allowed members to be involved in the planning and execution, as well as for participants to be able to have a discussion on relevant issues in the current context in a light and unconventional manner. Such projects include Tumpak, a competition for college students, and Bertigo, a competition for high school students in Metro Manila and nearby cities. Alumni * Fr.

Commemoration The day is marked at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City with the presentation of the Dag Hammarskjöld Medal, statements by the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General, as well as a press release regarding the state of UN Peacekeeping missions and the continued necessity of their work. There are also observances around the world; often countries will honor their own peacekeepers abroad, but the UN also organizes festivals, discussion forums, and memorials in cooperation with local and national groups. In 2009, the UN put a special focus on the role of and need for women in peacekeeping, both as role models and also to serve in a number of gender-specific capacities.

Built in 1845, it is one of two identical surviving rental properties built by a local developer (out of four originally built). The survival of their original building contracts provides an important window into the understanding of 19th century building practices. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history 1715-17 Cambridge Street is located a short way east of Harvard Square, on the north side of Cambridge Street, and its junction with Summer Road and just west of 1707-09 Cambridge Street, its virtual duplicate. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is pierced by four dormers with fully pedimented gable fronts, their windows flanked by small pilasters rising to entablatures. The building corners are also pilastered, rising to an entablature that encircles the building. The side gables are also fully pedimented. A single-story porch extends across the front, with Doric columns supporting an entablature and hip roof. The facade is six bays wide, with entrances in the two center bays. This house, the one next door, and two others since demolished, were all built in 1845 as speculative rental property for Royal Richardson, a prominent local real estate developer. When completed, the four identical buildings would have presented a striking appearance on the north side of Cambridge Street. The survival of the contracts for their construction adds to their importance in understanding 19th century building practices, which lacked plans but included detailed specifications that mentioned existing buildings whose features and elements were to be copied.

Description and history 104-106 Hancock Street stands in the Dana Hill area of Cambridge, between Central Square and Harvard Square north of Massachusetts Avenue. It is set on the east side of Harvard Street, nearly opposite its junction with Centre Street, and is oriented facing south. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof extends over a shallow front porch for its full five-bay width, supported by Doric columns. The main entrance is at the center of the main block, which is extended to the east by an enclosed porch. The area was historically the estate of jurist Francis Dana, which was divided among his heirs after his death. The main mansion was sold out of the family at that time, and burned down in 1839, spurring family members to sell buildable lots from their holdings. This house and the nearly identical house next door were both built in 1839. They exhibit fairly typical modest Greek Revival elements, but also include early examples of Gothic detailing in an applied-wood Gothic arch over the windows in the street-facing gable end. This house underwent a number of alterations between its construction and the 1940s; these have been reversed in a historically sensitive rehabilitation.

It is the mono-ester formed from glycerol and lauric acid. Its chemical formula is C15H30O4. Uses Monolaurin is most commonly used as a surfactant in cosmetics, such as deodorants. As a food additive it is also used as an emulsifier or preservative. Monolaurin is also taken as a dietary supplement. Occurrence Monolaurin is found in coconut oil and may be similar to other monoglycerides found in human breast milk. Lauric acid can be ingested in coconut oil and the human body converts it into monolaurin, furthermore, coconut oil, coconut cream, grated coconut and others products are excellent sources of lauric acid and, consequently, monolaurin. Researchers are unsure of conversion rates of lauric acid obtained through foods like coconut oil or coconut to monolaurin in the body. Because of this fact, it is unknown how much coconut oil or coconut one would need to ingest to receive a therapeutic dose of monolaurin. Some articles suggest it may be upwards of 100-300mL of coconut oil per day, making ingesting coconut oil unrealistic compared to monolaurin capsules. Pharmacology Monolaurin in capsule form as a dietary supplement Monolaurin has antibacterial, antiviral, and other antimicrobial effects in vitro, but its clinical usefulness has not been established. Monolaurin is currently sold as a dietary supplement and is categorized in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Monolaurin is known to inactivate lipid-coated viruses by binding to the lipid-protein envelope of the virus, thereby preventing it from attaching and entering host cells, making infection and replication impossible. Other studies show that Monolaurin disintegrates the protective viral envelope, killing the virus. Monolaurin has been studied to inactivate many pathogens including Herpes simplex virus and Chlamydia trachomatis. Monolaurin also shows promising effects against bacteria (both gram-positive and gram-negative), yeast, fungi, and protozoa. Bacteria including E. Coli, yeast including Candida albicans, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), Giardia lamblia, Staphylococcus aureus (Staph), and other microbials have all been neutralized by monolaurin in scientific studies. Monolaurin also presented antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties against Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia garinii, the bacterium which cause Lyme Disease in humans. Furthermore, monolaurin does not seem to contribute to drug resistance.

A financial software development company, fi- linx products are specifically marketed to credit unions. Their services are offered both directly and through the Credit Union Executives Society (CUES). History fi-linx was founded by a group of Maps Credit Union employees in Autumn 2006. After trying unsuccessfully to find Deposit Reclassification software that met the needs of the credit union, fi-linx was formed to create its own software, using in-house software developers. Products and services fi-linx offers two credit union technology solutions: Deposit Reclassification and Check Checker. Deposit Reclassification, the primary service provided by fi-linx, provides an automated method for credit unions to reclassify their deposit accounts to significantly lower their Federal Reserve balance. This is done by splitting each transaction account into a checking subaccount (which carries a reserve requirement) and a savings subaccount (which does not carry a reserve requirement), a process allowed by the Federal Reserve Bank in 1993. The service has been reported to have saved Maps Credit Union $145,000 per year and it is estimated that $154 million could be saved industry-wide if every credit union were to use the service. Check Checker is a form of check fraud deterrent software that uses real-time validation to check the routing number of a check with the Federal Reserve, as well as checking fraud alerts from the National Credit Union Administration and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Competition Both deposit reclassification and check fraud deterrent software are offered by other organizations. For example, although not specifically marketing to credit unions, Ceto and Associates also offers deposit reclassification services, with over 1500 clients in all 50 states.

Biography Founded in Graz in 2002, the members entered a temporary hiatus in 2005. However in the same year, they re-grouped and later signed to the Vienna-based indie label Siluh Records and released three full-length albums there. Around 2015 the band went on a second hiatus and front singer Wolfgang Möstl worked out his solo act Mile Me Deaf to a three member band. This band is in sound similar to Killed by 9 Volt Batteries, though a bit less noisy. In Mile Me Deaf he is the lead singer and plays guitar and occasionally on a Home Swinger. In 2018 he scaled down this project to a solo act again with a more electronic output with samplers, drum computers and him on guitar and vocals. Möstl also plays guitar in the bands Sex Jams, and the sludge rockband Melt Downer. Möstl also plays guitar in the live band of Clara Luzia.

The station was closed during the 2002 Winter Olympics since it was in the Olympic Plaza. The countdown clock from the games still remains on the platform. It is in the shape of an arrowhead because of the Native American weapons that were unearthed during the construction of the station. Arena was previously called Delta Center, but when the name of the arena was changed to EnergySolutions Arena, the UTA Board of Trustees officially changed the station name to Arena in December 2006. \\"EnergySolutions\\" was not included in the name as the UTA Board decided to no longer allow corporate names on stations.

Biography Hochstetter was born in Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg. He was the father of geologist Ferdinand Hochstetter (1829–1884). In 1807 Hochstetter received his degree of Master of Divinity in Tübingen. While still a student, he became a member of a secret organization headed by Carl Ludwig Reichenbach (1788–1869) that had designs on establishing a colony on Tahiti (Otaheiti-Gesellschaft). In 1808 the organization was discovered by authorities, and its members suspected of treason and arrested. Hochstetter was imprisoned for a short period of time for his small role in the secret society. Later on, he spent six months as a teacher in a private institution in Erlangen, and afterwards was a tutor for four years in the house of the Minister of Altenstein in Thuringia. In 1816 he became a pastor and school inspector in Brno, moving to Esslingen am Neckar in 1824. Here he worked as an instructor at the seminary school, becoming a pastor in 1829. At Esslingen, together with Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel (1783–1856), he organised Unio Itineraria (Württembergischer botanische Reiseveren). The scientific society raised funds through subscribers for the collection and distribution of plant specimens and sold specimens to private collectors, museums and dealers in other European cities. Hochstetter published numerous works on botany, mineralogy and natural history as well as on theology and education. With Steudel, he published Enumeratio plantarum Germaniae Helvetiaeque indigenarum, a book covering botanical species of Germany and Switzerland and with Moritz August Seubert (1818–1878), he published Flora Azorica, a treatise on the flora of the Azores.

The Blue Line has service from the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub in Downtown Salt Lake City to Draper. The Green Line provides service from the Salt Lake International Airport to West Valley City (via Downtown Salt Lake City). Description Gallivan Plaza Station looking west at American Towers. The station is located at 275 South Main Street, with the island platform in the median of Main Street. The station is situated southwest of the Gallivan Center. It served as a transfer station from 2001 to 2011 while the University Line was open. Though not the official center of the city, the area is just as densely built-up as the area around City Center Station: the Wells Fargo Center (Salt Lake City) fills the whole street frontage east of the platform, while 222 Main, the One Utah Center, and the Walker Center (in that order) are just to the north along Main Street. All four of these skyscrapers have banks as anchor tenants, so the area is central to Salt Lake City's financial district. The station was opened on 4 December 1999 as part of the first operating segment of the TRAX system. and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. The station is included in the Free Fare Zone in Downtown Salt Lake City. Transportation patrons that both enter and exit bus or TRAX service within the Zone can ride at no charge. Unlike many TRAX stations, Gallivan Plaza does not have a Park and Ride lot. Like the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub (as well as City Center and Library), there is a nearby Greenbike docking station. Greenbike is a bicycle sharing program within Downtown Salt Lake City that allows members to pick up bicycles from any docking station and then drop it off at any docking station (not necessarily the same as where it was picked up), ideally for trips of 30 minutes or less to avoid additional charges. Greenbike is seasonal and, depending on weather conditions, shuts down operations in November–December and starts up again in March–April. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the trains clearly indicate accessibility options. Ramps on the passenger platform and assistance from the train operator may be necessary for wheelchair boarding on Blue Line (weekdays only). These ramps are not used on weekends or on the Green Line.

The organization is run by executive director Maggie Vail after Jesse von Doom resigned to focus on other matters. CASH Music takes an open source approach to music production and distribution, and works directly with musicians and labels to help design the tools they build. History CASH Music evolved from a discussion about the sustainability of the music industry between musicians Kristin Hersh, Donita Sparks, and their managers Billy O'Connell and Bob Fagan. Von Doom became involved shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, Portland-based record label Kill Rock Stars had reached out to von Doom, who operated a small web development studio, Dutchmoney, to build a new label website. Von Doom went \\"above and beyond\\" and created promotional tools that allowed then KRS VP Vail to \\"keep tabs on which music writers logged into the site and how many times they listened to the tunes\\". Vail, who was impressed with the tools and supported the CASH Music's mandate joined its board of directors in 2007. She became its co-executive director, alongside von Doom, in 2011. Platform and Other Code The CASH Music platform is a free collection of tools for artists and labels to sell, share, and promote music directly to their fans. It is entirely open source, with all code available for viewing or forking at GitHub. The platform currently enables digital purchases, download code generation and redemption, email collection, secure downloads, tour dates, member areas, and social feeds. While many of the platform's features operate independently, it was also designed to be compatible with third-party resources, such as MailChimp, Google Drive, and PayPal through APIs. The idea is to \\"integrate seamlessly with as many relevant Web services as possible\\". Artists currently using the CASH Music platform include Brendan Benson, Calexico, Deerhoof, Explosions in the Sky, 50 Foot Wave, Health., Iron & Wine, Kina Grannis, Learning Music, Lushlife, No Age, Portugal. The Man, The Raincoats, Ray LaMontagne, The Swell Season, The Thermals, Xiu Xiu, Zoë Keating, Zola Jesus. Participating labels include Mom + Pop Music, FatCat Records, Kill Rock Stars, Nat Geo Music, Sacred Bones Records, Saddle Creek Records, Sub Pop, and Temporary Residence Limited. cashmusic.js cashmusic.js is a lightweight JavaScript library that handles CASH Music embeds available through the platform, provides video lightboxing compatible with YouTube and Vimeo, and simple audio players. The library is distributed under a simplified BSD license, which imposes nominal restrictions on its redistribution. The library was designed to not interfere with jQuery or similar libraries, and relies on no external dependencies besides SoundManager 2 for audio playback. Education Central to CASH Music's mandate is a focus on learning. They are currently developing an educational curriculum geared towards empowering artists by equipping them with both resources and technical skills. The non-profit hosted two summits in Portland, OR, in summer 2013, and is hosting its next summit in Los Angeles in November 2013. I.R.S. Scrutiny and 501(c)3 Status Von Doom sought 501(c)(3) status for CASH Music in February 2009, only to have his application denied by the IRS in June 2012. His rejection letter was signed by Lois Lerner, the embattled former Director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, who was placed on administrative leave after it was revealed that the IRS had targeted political groups applying for tax-exempt status based on keywords contained in their names and suspected political allegations. While initial speculation pointed to Super PACs being targeted based on conservative keywords, a New York Times article that ran on June 5, 2013, revealed that IRS scrutiny extended beyond the political. The term open source is a keyword that is now known to have flagged CASH Music for further investigation, as \\"the IRS feared that such groups were really moneymaking enterprises\\". Despite being denied 501(c)(3) status, CASH Music continues to operate as a non-profit on the state level (Oregon) and will continue to seek federal non-profit status.

It features the voice of Adam Carolla as the title character who is a human cartoon living in real world. It made its television premiere on G4's Happy Tree Friends and Friends series.  Plot  The story starts with a crowd gathered at the Hollywood sign with Virgil sitting on top of the sign strapped with dynamite preparing to take his life. A reporter from the local new covering the story live climbs up to get an exclusive interview with Virgil. Thus Virgil recounts his life story. Virgil was born to a young biker girl. Due to Virgil's \\"unusual\\" condition her love interest at the time leaves her, forcing her to raise Virgil on her own. Over the next couple of years Virgil would have trouble adapting with other kids his own age. Resulting in him becoming perverted and foulmouthed. The only thing that kept him happy was the cartoon character Viking Girl. A voluptuous blond Viking warrior who Virgil was convinced that just like him, was a living toon who became a successful actor in Hollywood, and that they were destined to be together. So he embarks for Hollywood to find her and confess his feelings for her. On the way he is picked up by a group of hippies/druggies who give him weed. After having the weed, Virgil imagines himself on a motor bike in a weird and wonderful place. It changes to him and Viking girl running together and then they're on the ground just about to have intercourse when Virgil imagines hair growing from his hands and spots on his face bursting and stuff flowing out and building up around him. When he comes around he is in fact being humped by a monkey and the people around him laughing at him. Once he arrives at the studio where Viking Girl is filmed. He learns the horrible truth that Viking Girl is nothing more than a made-up cartoon character and his journey was in vain. So Virgil straps dynamite to his person and goes to the Hollywood sign to take his life. Returning the story to the present. Hearing the story, the reporter becomes sadden and hugs Virgil only for him to cop a feel of her breast. She scolds him and in retaliation Virgil prepares to set off the dynamite. The reporter desperately begs Virgil not to commit suicide, suggesting that he, himself could become the first living cartoon star, as he already has a legion of fans. Virgil ponder the idea and imagines what his life would be like, which resembles an elaborate hip hop video, and agrees to this. But suddenly Virgil is fatally shot. The gunman is none other than former child actor Gary Coleman who states that the price of fame is not worth it, and Virgil dies. Suddenly Virgil finds himself in an animated heaven and Viking Girl has been waiting for him. Virgil begins to have intercourse with her but suddenly everything turns dark and Virgil discovers that he has gone to hell and that he has been humping the Satan's leg, who himself is in the form of Gary Coleman in a red devil costume.

The movie, directed by Sven Taddicken, is based on the novel Emmas Glück (now translated into English under the title Emma's Luck) by Claudia Schreiber. Plot Upon being informed that he is fatally ill with cancer, Max, who works at a used car lot, steals over seventy thousand illegally gained euros from his boss. His boss sees him, giving chase to Max. Max intentionally crashes the car. He is lifted unconscious from the destroyed vehicle by a big and strong woman, Emma, who lives alone on a farm in the boondocks. She discovers the money and sets the car aflame. When Max comes to, she tells him that the car has burned and that she took nothing but him from the car before it burst into flames. Max hides from her the fact that he is dying. He also hides from the police, in the form of the nearby village's young officer, Henner, who has had his heart set on marrying Emma. Love blooms between Max and Emma, after some stumbles, such as his finding out that she had taken the money.

E. Cummings House is an historic house at 104 Irving Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The house was the childhood home of author and poet E. E. Cummings. The Colonial Revival house was built in 1893 for Cummings' parents, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Cummings house is set on a roughly triangular parcel formed by the junction of Irving and Scott Streets in the Shady Hill neighborhood east of Harvard University. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with Colonial Revival massing and features. It has a projecting dentillated cornice below the gabled roof, and a porch supported by Tuscan columns. There is a projecting bay section at the center of the main facade to the left of the entry, and a single-story bay to its right. Windows are generally 1-over-1 sash, and the front entrance door is topped by a multilight transom window. Dormers of varying style project from the main roof. The house was designed by Walker and Kimball for Edward E. Cummings, a professor at Harvard and a local pastor, and was built in 1893. Cummings' son the poet E. E. Cummings, was born here the following year, and lived here until he graduated from Harvard (BA 1915, MA 1917), and moved to New York City. Cummings described the house in his six nonlectures: \\"My own home faced the Cambridge world as a finely and solidly constructed mansion, preceded by a large oval lawn and ringed with an imposing white-pine hedge,\\" and \\"The big Cambridge house was in this respect, as in all other respects, a true home.\\" See also *Joy Farm, the poet's summer house in New Hampshire, now a National Historic Landmark *National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1893 Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Massachusetts Category:E.

Its Italianate styling places its construction right around 1850, and its small size (22' by 18') suggests that it might have originally been built as a railroad depot, probably from the Watertown Branch Railroad. It is two stories in height, with a shallow-pitch hip roof that extends to an unusual length beyond the walls, and is supported by large decorative brackets.

It is operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). Description The station is located at 150 South Main Street (SR-126) on approximately 12.5 acres of land and is easily accessed from I-15 by way of the new Layton Parkway interchange. The station is near the south end of Layton's historic downtown area, which had suffered from a hard-to-access location in a highly acute wedge bounded by I-15 on the northeast and the railroad tracks on the southwest. The railroad tracks have also presented enough of a barrier that the area west of the station and the tracks is still undeveloped despite its proximity to the historic downtown. Besides the station's opening on the site of the previous Union Pacific Layton Depot, access in the area has also recently been improved (both from I-15 and from surrounding parts of Layton) by the completion of the new Layton Parkway interchange on I-15, which is just south of the station. The station has two free Park and Ride lots with about 380 total parking spaces available. However, a majority of these parking spaces are in the lot that is located just off South Main Street about one block north of the station. This lot can be accessed by either South Main Street or by a path that parallels the tracks and connects the north end of the platform with the parking lot. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The inaugural FrontRunner train departed the station southbound at 9:45 am April 26, 2008. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Ogden and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (with additional half hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am Sunday morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday, service is extended to Pleasant View station with two trains picking up (no dropping off) passengers early in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening.

The two story wood frame house was built in 1822, and is basically Federal in its styling, although it has a Greek Revival porch. The house was built on land belonging to the Dana family, and was occupied by Richard Henry Dana, Sr. among others, before its acquisition by Harvard University in 1835. From 1839 to 1843 the building was used as Harvard's first astronomical observatory, before being converted for use as a residence for its professors. One of its residents of long tenure was George Herbert Palmer, who lived there for nearly forty years. In 1947 the house was moved to its present location, and alterations made for its astronomical uses were reversed. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

Description The station is located immediately west of the I-15/US-89/Legacy Parkway (SR-67)/Park Lane (SR-225) interchanges. The official address of the station, according to UTA is 450 N 850 West, but it is actually located at the south end of Station Parkway. Station Parkway is accessed by turning southeast off Park Lane (this section of the street is also known as North 1100 West) and then following Station Parkway through the roundabout. Park Lane is accessed from either I-15 or US-89 southbound by way of the appropriate Park Lane interchange. From northbound I-15 the Station is accessed by way of the US-89 northbound exit and then the Park Lane interchange on US-89. The station is located on approximately of land and is part of the Station Park commercial development. Since Union Pacific Railroad tracks run northwest to southeast between the FrontRunner platform and the parking lot for the station, the use of a pedestrian bridge is necessary to cross over the tracks. The top of this bridge, and its red roof, is readily visible from I-15. The station has a free Park and Ride lot with about 870 parking spaces available. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. History The inaugural FrontRunner train departed the station southbound at 10:30 am on April 26, 2008. December 2011 wind storm In the early morning hours of December 1, 2011 a major wind storm passed through Davis County. The storm caused an overall estimated $20 million in property damages within Davis County. UTA reported began reporting problems at the Farmington Station at about 6:15 am, with train service to the station being curtailed shortly thereafter. UTA later reported, \\"Record breaking winds of more than 100 mph...\\" causing severe damage to the Farmington station. UTA also stated that, even though \\"FrontRunner trains are designed to withstand winds of even greater strength...\\", damage to the station was so severe that trains could not operate safely through the area until mid-afternoon. Much of the most visible damage was to light poles on the passenger platform and in the parking lot. A \\"bus bridge\\" was used to ferry passengers between the Layton and Salt Lake Central stations while repairs were made. Although train service resumed by 3:00 pm, the Farmington Station remained closed through the weekend while repairs to the station were completed. Station Park Station Park is transit-oriented commercial development that was planned specifically in conjunction with the construction of the Farmington Station and is located south of the station. It is intended to be similar to The Gateway in Salt Lake City, only bigger. A shopping complex is nearly complete and is within walking distance of the Farmington Station, featuring a 16-screen Cinemark movie theater, Best Buy, Barnes & Noble, J. C. Penney, Ross, Staples, Petco, Lane Bryant, Sports Authority and Bed, Bath & Beyond. Upon completion there will be a hotel, sixty shops and about 10 restaurants, as well as office space for lease. Residential facilities will also be included in Station Park upon completion.

Boys between the ages of 7 and 17 attend for one to seven weeks, depending on their age and interest. Airy is a fully accredited member of the American Camp Association. Camp Airy is the brother camp to Camp Louise. History Camp Airy was founded in 1924 by Aaron and Lilly Straus, philanthropists from Baltimore. One of the early figures in the camp history was Sidney Chernak, who started as a counselor and continued as director of Airy and executive director of Airy and Louise. In 1990, Sid Chernak retired after 63 summers spent at camp Airy. Edwin \\"Ed\\" Cohen took over as director of Camp Airy. Ed, who referred to Mr. Chernak as \\"a father,\\"http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-01-15/news/0401150067_1_city- school-johns-hopkins-university-students-to-return created the legacy of a \\"camp family\\" that will insure he is always a part of camp. On June 21, 2014, Ed died. Religious aspects Camp Airy is a camp for Jewish boys. The meals are kosher style, meaning that milk and meat are not served at the same time and nothing that is explicitly non-kosher (such as pork) is served. Each meal begins with the recitation of Ha'motzi - The prayer over bread. Traditional grace after meals is also recited on Saturdays. Shabbat is observed at camp with short services on Friday night and Saturday morning. A special day is created to provide a change of pace during the remainder of Saturday. This “day of rest” creates a certain rhythm that helps punctuate the camp experience. Shabbat concludes with a Havdallah service at night. People One of the most prized assets of Airy are the people who work there. Many of these people are referred to as “Lifers”. For Airy, this includes early \\"lifers\\" such as Sidney Chernak and Ed Cohen, and current \\"lifers\\" Rick Frankle, Doctors Danny and David Framm, Larry Cantor and Mike Schneider. While some of these \\"Lifers\\" are no longer a part of the daily running of Camp Airy, most can be found \\"on the hill\\" each and every season. Rick Frankle is the most recent past Director of the camp. Joining him in 2010 was Assistant Director Scott Black, a former camper, CIT, and counselor. Returning to camp in 2014 was another \\"lifer,\\" Marty Rochlin. Marty was a former camper, CIT, Counselor, Unit Leader and Assistant Director who took over as the year round director of Camp Airy at the end of the Summer of 2014. As Rochlin became director, Black left his position of assistant director, with longtime staff member Jason Creger taking his position. Last year, over 90 percent of the staff had been at Camp Airy the year before. Programming Airy offers many traditional summer camp activities including Athletics, outdoor living, swimming, performing arts and fine arts. Athletics are a critical part of the summer camp experience. Campers play baseball, basketball, football, lacrosse, soccer, floor hockey, tennis, and volleyball. Many also participate in in-line skating, fencing and wrestling. The camp also has an archery range. The Drama department typically produces two plays in a Summer, the first a musical production, and the second a straight play. Currently the Drama Department Head is Cody Riker. There are also opportunities for people who play musical instruments or enjoy singing to perform. In the fine arts department, campers are offered activities in ceramics, painting, silk-screening, copper enamel, hemp and beads, photography, and wood working among others. Recently the camp has begun to add non-traditional features such as a skateboard park, Scuba diving, paintballing, and go-carts/dunebuggies. CIT program The CIT (Counselor in Training) program is one of Camp Airy's best distinguishing features. It is a program held for campers who will be entering their senior year of high school after camp that focuses on both teaching campers how to transition into becoming counselors and developing strong bonds between fellow CITs. The program provides continuity between counselor classes summer after summer and allows campers to transition smoothly into counselors without having to leave camp for even one summer. The CIT program can also be credited with causing counselor retention to be so high at Airy. CIT traditions and programs include many bonding activities, riding White Wolf buses, bunk and department experiences, a CIT havdallah service, CIT T-shirts, and a frequent leadership training course taught by trainee director Jeff Lasser. Facilities Located on 450 heavily treed acres, the camp is located north of Washington and west of Baltimore. Down-hill camp includes the large Chernak gym, complete with basketball courts and a wrestling area. There’s also a 300,000 gallon swimming pool, featuring a small basketball hoop, several floating pool balls, and an Aquaclimb. Also, there are athletic fields, tennis courts, a floor hockey rink, and a ropes course. At the top of the hill, there’s a 550-seat dining hall where campers eat each of their meals.

It is operated by the Utah Transit Authority (UTA). Description The station is located at 750 South 800 West on approximately 13.5 acres of land and is easily accessed from I-15 by way of the 500 South (SR-68) interchange. (From the I-15/500 S interchange, turn south onto 700 West, which after a few blocks curves right, very briefly becoming 700 South, and then curves left and becomes 800 West.) Unlike nearly all other stations served by the FrontRunner, the station is located in a fairly residential area. However, major commercial and retail areas are located just across I-15 to the east in Bountiful and there is an oil refinery located to the northwest of the station on the far side of the tracks and 500 South. The station has two Park and Ride lots with total of about free 230 parking spaces available. The primary parking lot is situated between the station platform and 800 West, while the secondary parking lot is very short walk north on the north side of 700 South. The Station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened for service on April 26, 2008 and is operated by the Utah Transit Authority. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Since not all FrontRunner passenger cars are wheelchair accessible, signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the passenger cars clearly indicate accessibility options. In addition, each train has one or more Train Hosts available to provide assistance as may be needed, including the placement of ramps for wheelchair boarding. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, \\"smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations\\". History The inaugural FrontRunner train departed the station southbound at 11:30 am on April 26, 2008. On December 1, 2011, service was to the station was suspended for most of the day due to severe damage cause by a major wind storm that passed through Davis County. Although the Woods Cross station was not directly affected, damage to the Farmington Station was so extensive that a \\"bus bridge\\" was used to ferry passengers between the Layton and Salt Lake Central stations while repairs were made. Although full service resumed by 3:00 pm, repairs to the station took several more days to complete. Woods Cross was formerly the first FrontRunner station north of Salt Lake Central. However, at the same time that FrontRunner South opened on December 10, 2012, a new infill station (North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe) also opened for service just north of Salt Lake Central. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Ogden and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (with additional half-hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am Sunday morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday, service is extended to Pleasant View station with two trains picking up (no dropping off) passengers early in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening. Train schedule On weekdays the first northbound FrontRunner train (to the Ogden Intermodal Transit Center) leaves the Woods Cross station at about 4:45 am and the first southbound train (to the Provo station) leaves at about 6:00 am. The last northbound and southbound trains both leave at 11:55 pm. However, the last southbound train only goes as far as the Salt Lake Central station; the last train to the Provo station leaves at 11:23 pm. The first, last, and only trains that go as far north as the Pleasant View station leave at 5:44 pm and 6:44 pm. On Saturdays the first northbound train leaves at about 7:15 am and the first southbound train leaves at about 9:00 am. The last northbound train leaves at 12:14 am (early Sunday morning) and the last southbound train leaves at 1:53 am (early Sunday morning). However, the last southbound train only goes as far as the Salt Lake Intermodal Hub; the last train to the Provo station leaves at 11:53 pm.

The bed extends from the island right up to the estuary of Pulai River in Johor. Dugongs and seahorses which feed on seagrass made their home in the nearby coral reefs. Environmentalists are concerned that the development of Port of Tanjung Pelepas is threatening the area and the livelihood of seahorses as well as dugongs and turtles. The island is planned to be gazette as a nature park with various environmental based NGOs funding it. Sovereignty In the aftermath of the International Court of Justice ruling that saw Pedra Branca being awarded to Singapore, concerns on Malaysian sovereignty over Merambong Island have been raised. To alleviate the concern, the Straits Settlement and Johore Territorial Waters Agreement of 1927 which clearly states the ownership of the island has been cited. Singaporean incident On 13 April 2007, two Interceptor Crafts of the Special Task Squadron were on ambush duty off Tuas in the vicinity of Tuas Jetty, when a speedboat with six illegal immigrants and cartons of cigarettes intruded into Singapore's territorial waters at about 9:30pm. The speedboat sped off when approached by the police, resulting in a five-minute chase which ended with a collision between one of the crafts and the speedboat near Merambong Island. PK 50 capsized, while the speedboat was completely wrecked. Two officers were rescued from the scene within minutes with minor injuries, while another two were found dead. Three passengers on the intruding vessels were also rescued, and a fourth man found dead. The rest of the passengers were still missing.

It was built in 1898 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. According to a promotional booklet published in 1899, its name is derived from that of Scotland's Dunvegan Castle, whose coat of arms is worked into the apartment's stained glass windows. It was constructed 25 feet from its adjoining apartment block, The Montrose, with which it connects via an underground passage. Both buildings are of the same height and similar size (six stories, with a frontage of eighty-five feet), built of the same materials, and with a similar architectural appearance, although the Montrose's floorplan is roughly rectangular but the Dunvegan's is triangular. The Dunvegan's vestibules, front hall, and stairway are finished in Siena marble, mahogany, and mosaic floors. Each of its twelve suites originally consisted of ten rooms and a bath, as follows: parlor, reception room, library, dining room, four bedrooms, kitchen and servant's room, bathroom, servant's water closet, and butler's pantry. The building also contained twelve bachelor suites of two rooms and a bath apiece. When constructed, the building was wired for doorbells and electric lights, and piped for gas and hot and cold running water. Heating was provided by low- pressure steam. In the 1930s the buildings were reworked into one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. The buildings are now served by Best Choice Apartments Shortill Realty.

It includes the major buildings that were built to house county services for Middlesex County beginning in the 1810s, and a cluster of largely vernacular Greek Revival worker housing located west of the county complex on Otis, Thorndike, Spring, and Sciarappa Streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Before the turn of the 19th century, the East Cambridge area was historically isolated from the rest of Cambridge by marshy land. The first organized development attempt, made by the Lechmere Point Corporation, began around that time and resulted in the layout of a rectilinear street grid in the area. It was the first planned land use of its type in the Boston area. The area's growth was the result of two key decisions: the first was a grant of land to the county for new facilities; the second was the establishment of the New England Glass Company, which spurred both residential construction and industrial development. Major landmarks from the early years of East Cambridge's development are an 1827 Federal-style church, built as a Congregational church and based on an Asher Benjamin design, and the Charles Bulfinch-designed county courthouse, which has been surrounded by a complex of sympathetically-designed buildings that include the brick Queen Anne Putnam School. The major surviving industrial facility in the district is the Davenport factory, bounded by Otis, Thorndike, and First Streets, in which a high-profile furniture manufacturer operated into the 20th century. Vernacular workers' housing in late Federal and Greek Revival styles were built in robust quantity in the area, some examples of which survive on Otis Street. A few Second Empire rowhouses were also built, in a simpler emulation of more sophisticated styles found in Boston. Few houses were built after circa 1890; there are only a few examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revivals.

The parkway was built in 1899 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Fresh Pond Parkway is a four-lane road (two lanes in each direction) stretching from Mount Auburn Street on its southern end to a rotary at Concord Avenue (formerly Cambridge and Concord Turnpike) and Alewife Brook Parkway to the north. Much of the parkway acts as eastern boundary for portions of the city's municipal Fresh Pond reservoir area and also serves to connect the reservoir to the Charles River Reservation. The parkway is part of Massachusetts Route 2 (Route 2) and U.S. Route 3 (US 3) for its entire length. The portion north of Huron Avenue is also part of Route 16\\\\. Route description Fresh Pond Parkway begins at a large interchange with Mount Auburn Street, a major east-west road in western Cambridge, and Gerry's Landing Road, which serves as the connection between the parkway and Memorial Drive, Greenough Boulevard, and the Eliot Bridge over the Charles River. A median initially separates the north and southbound lanes, which gradually narrows to little more than a jersey barrier at the intersection with Brattle Street, about to the northwest. This section bisects Lowell Memorial Park, with the Elmwood estate the only residence on the east. North of Brattle Street, the parkway has no median. In it reaches Huron Avenue, where Massachusetts Route 16 joins the roadway from the west. This section is residential on both sides. The entire southern portion of the parkway is canopied by mature trees, and has concrete sidewalks on each side, separate by a narrow green strip. North of the Huron Avenue junction, the road turns northeast to skirt around Fresh Pond, crossing the former Watertown Branch Railroad right-of-way, and running for to a rotary with Concord Avenue. It remains residential on the east side, until Lexington Avenue, when that side becomes commercial. The west side is lined by the Fresh Pond Reservation, with southbound access to a public parking area (limited to city residents) and the facilities of the Cambridge public water supply. From the rotary it proceeds west about to its end at a larger rotary, where Concord Avenue continues west, and Alewife Brook Parkway continues north, carrying all three numbered route designations. The south side of this section continues to be the Fresh Pond Reservation, and the north side is heavily commercialized. History A northbound parkway from the Charles River through western Cambridge was proposed by landscape designer Charles Eliot as early as 1892. Eliot, a Cambridge resident, had already assisted the city in laying out the Fresh Pond Reservation lands, and believed a parkway would provide improved access between the Charles River and the Middlesex Fells Reservation. In 1898 the Metropolitan Parks Commission, predecessor to the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) and today's Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), began acquiring land for the parkway with the purchase of Lowell Park, formerly a portion of the Elmwood estate. Land takings continued in 1899, and the section between Gerry's Landing and Huron Avenue was completed in 1900. The northern section was completed 1928-1930, following disputes between the MDC and the city over its route and funding. The connection of Gerry's Landing Road to Eliot Bridge, colloquially considered part of the parkway, was not completed until 1958. In media In February 2010, CBS-television affiliate WBZ questioned whether the remaining 118 rotaries such as the ones featured at Fresh Pond Parkway and Alewife Brook Parkway should be scrapped across Massachusetts.

It was built by soldiers of the Continental Army under the orders of George Washington in November 1775. It is the oldest surviving fortification from the American Revolutionary War and the only surviving fortification from the Siege of Boston. Fort Washington was placed on the List of Registered Historic Places in Massachusetts on April 3, 1973. History American Revolution In a letter to Joseph Reed written at Cambridge in November 1775, George Washington wrote, \\"I have caused two three gun half moon batteries to be thrown up for occasional use.\\" At the time these small fortifications were constructed, Henry Knox was on his way to Fort Ticonderoga to get the best of the cannons which were there and at Fort Crown Point, a three-month exercise known as the noble train of artillery. The troops needed to be trained in constructing works in which the guns could be mounted promptly. Post war The property was acquired by the City of Cambridge and restored in 1857, at which time three 18-pounder cannons from the old Fort Winthrop, located on Governor's Island, were installed, and an elaborate granite and iron fence was designed by architect John R. Hall to protect the site.\\"Fort Washington, in Cambridge\\", Charles W. Sherman – Belmont Massachusetts - 1950, On file with the Cambridge Historical Commission and Massachusetts Historical Society A description of the property at the time of that transfer was later compiled by local historians: The Cambridge city directory of 1861 reported the earthworks to be five years old in appearance and in excellent condition; the total cost of Fort Washington Park, was $9,504.05.The Cambridge City Directory 1861, on file with the Cambridge Historical Commission In 1965 the state passed legislation authorizing the city of Cambridge to transfer the park to the United States government as a historic landmark.Chap. 460. An Act Authorizing the City of Cambridge to Convey the Site of Fort Washington in said City to the United States of America for Preservation and Maintenance as a National Historic Monument The property remains a city park and is designated an historic district of the City of Cambridge. The park was rededicated on October 3, 2009, Cambridgeport History Day, following restoration work. What remains today are only grassy embankments, not substantial fortifications. Cannons The guns standing in the embrasures are 18-pounders and were cast during or shortly after the Revolution. The two 18-pound cannon at Stonington were cast in 1781 in Salisbury, ConnecticutStonington Historical Society article, August 1982, by Henry R. Palmer, Jr during the Revolution. There are also two 18-pound cannon at Mount Defiance in Ticonderoga, New York which are also from the Revolution and of a similar cast. The three 18-pounders were among those over-age cannon that were removed from the original Fort Warren on Governor's Island, when a new Fort Warren was built on George's Island. Mr. Marcus Morton, of Cambridge, learned by correspondence with the Historical Section of the Chief of Ordnance in Washington, in 1942, that the gun carriages were cast by the West Point Foundry on the Hudson River, and he discovered in the city records that it cost the city $13.50 to bring these guns from Governor's Island to Cambridge.History of Cambridge, Massachusetts 1630-1877, Lucius R. Paige These cannon are identical, except for the numbers and weights marked upon them. They are numbered 45, 36, and 40; and their weighs are shown as 30-0-13, 30-0-17, and 30-0-16, respectively, (in cwt., qrs., and lbs.). Those figures correspond to 3375, 3377, and 3376 pounds. The bore is approximately 5 5/8 inches; the diameter of an 18-pound sphere of cast iron is 5.1 inches; the excess diameter of the bore (called windage) was usually about ¼ inch, or a little bit more, to allow for irregularities in the bore of the guns and the casting of the balls. The next larger standard size for cannon of that period was 24 lb., which would require a bore of at least 5.9 inches.

At the 2016 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 1,405.  History  Ripley is situated in the Yugarabul traditional Aboriginal country. The historical settlement of Ripley dates back to the mid-1800s as a farming community before the announcement of the master-planned development in 2007.  Geography  The eastern boundary of Ripley is aligned with Bundamba Creek. The Centenary Highway passes through the south east corner of Ripley. Ripley is located within the Ripley Valley and takes its name from the valley. Ripley urban development The Ripley area is part of the Brisbane metropolitan western growth corridor project. The development, known as Ecco Ripley is in response to the local and state governments' solicitation for land releases to alleviate expected and forecasted population growth from the general population growth of the existing communities, as well as growth from interstate and overseas migration. Once the area is fully developed, Ripley is expected to have a population of 120,000 people with an estimated 50,000 residential dwellings. The city development will provide employment with 200,000 job positions estimated. The Ripley development is in proximity of the suburbs and areas within the western growth corridor, such as Amberley, Ebenezer, New Chum, Swanbank, Deebing Heights and Willowbank with suitable land for new business and industrial developments.

J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 50-51 The Primordial Tradition seeks to establish a fundamental origin of religious belief in all authentic religious teachings, adhering to the principle that universal truths are a cross- cultural phenomenon and transcendent of their respective traditions, mythologies, and religious beliefs. The idea of the Primordial Tradition was well received by both practitioners and the academic community, and its development was actively endorsed by the International Conference of Religions in Chicago, 1893Antoine Faivre and Karen-Claire Voss, Western Esotericism and the Science of Religions, in Numen, Vol. 42 (E. J. Brill, Leiden 1995) 56 The Primordial Tradition does not elevate any tradition or religion above another and instead upholds the truth claims of all authentic religions and spiritual movements. Adherents of the Primordial Tradition can be found in any religious system such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Paganism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity or Islam. By examining the foundations of religious thought as philosophical truth values, the Primordial Tradition seeks to produce a level of wisdom or gnosis which is greater than that which would be provided by the study of a single religious system. The process utilized is similar to the study of the history of religions and comparative mythology as is found in the works of authors such as Mircea Eliade. It can also be found in the school of archetypal psychology and in the ideas of Carl Jung. Key proponents of the Primordial Tradition have included Rene Guenon, Frithjof Schuon, Julius Evola, Harvey Spencer Lewis, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Hossein Nasr, Elémire Zolla, Alain Danielou, Jean-Louis Michon, Gottfried Leibniz, Aldous Huxley, and Plato.

Although usually applied to individual animals, a group of animals may be referred to collectively as foundation bloodstock when one distinct population (such as breed or a breed group) provides part of the underlying genetic base for a new distinct population. The term is particularly common in older breeds for which a written breed registry was not created until after the breed phenotype was well established. However, many modern breeds can be traced to specific, named foundation animals. The terms for foundation parents differ by sex, most commonly foundation sire for the father, and foundation dam for the mother. Depending upon the species in question, more specialized terms may be used, such as foundation mare for female horses, or foundation queen for female cats. Less common is foundation bitch for female dogs. The first generation progeny of foundation stock of a hybrid are referred to as F1 hybrid animals, the second generation as F2, and so forth, usually through F4. Dogs In dog breeding, a foundation sire is a male progenitor of a bloodline, while the corresponding term for the female is foundation dam (or, in a declining usage, foundation bitch). The American Kennel Club operates a breed registry for over 60 nascent and experimental breeds, called the Foundation Stock Service Program (FSS), through which breeders can seek to establish full AKC recognition of their new breeds. Horses In horse breeding, the terms foundation sire and foundation mare or dam refer to the earliest progenitors of a breed. There are usually few foundation sires, but several mares, though in many cases, foundation mares are not always identified in old pedigree records, though in Thoroughbred breeding, pedigrees are traced to the tail-female line. In most cases, breeds that require that all members trace to specific foundation stock have a closed stud book and do not allow crossbreeding to other animals. The Thoroughbred, Andalusian and Arabian are examples of breeds with a closed stud book. Some breeds, such as the Morgan horse, have a single named foundation sire, while others, such as the Lipizzan, may have several. In some cases, particularly with older horse breeds, some or all foundation sires may be unknown. However, in breeds with a well-documented breed registry, all or nearly all foundation animals may be identified. For example, there are three major foundation sires of the Thoroughbred, and another 24 or 25 minor foundation sires, along with 74 foundation mares. An example of a foundation bloodstock pedigree line within a breed are the Crabbet lines from the Crabbet Arabian Stud farm in England. These animals were bred by the same program for 92 years, were exported worldwide, and had a substantial impact on the breed. Some Arabian breeders today specialize in horses descended only from this breeding program. Similarly, in the Standardbred, the Clay Trotting Horses constitute a distinct foundation line within that breed. An example of a breed formed by foundation stock from other breeds, but not necessarily all from named individual animals, is the Hackney horse, with bloodlines contributed from Thoroughbred and Norfolk Trotter. In other cases, where a breed or landrace is older than any written records, the foundation bloodstock is sometimes described by myths or legends, such as the mythical horses of Mohammad, known as Al Khamsa ('The Five'), said to be the foundation mares of the Arabian horse breed. Some breeds with an established phenotype and named foundation stock may still permit outside bloodlines to contribute to the genetic base of the breed; these thus have at least partially open stud books. An example of a partially open stud book is that of the American Quarter Horse, which still allows limited registration of animals with one Quarter Horse parent and one Thoroughbred parent. Newer breeds, such as many of the warmblood breeds, may have mostly open stud books, where horses that are registered may be of a variety of bloodlines, but must first pass a rigorous studbook selection process. The word \\"foundation\\" is also sometimes applied, in a different context, to horses of a phenotype that resembles that of the original foundation stock, particularly when the modern look of the breed has diverged from the original stock. The word may also refer to animals tracing only to a select number of the oldest foundation bloodlines, particularly when newer breeding has been added that changed the original phenotype.

The contractor faced over $10 million in penalties for the delay. The new bridge has three lanes for northbound vehicular traffic and improved pedestrian and cyclist crossings. The old bridge was demolished and removed. Roadway and trail links north and south of the bridge were partially complete, and the pedestrian access and all lanes opened on September 29, 2017. The new bridge is located east of the original bridge, and is supported by concrete thrust blocks on the banks of the river, eliminating the need for piers. The arches are tall.

Joseph Homer Parker, a Congregationalist Minister who had founded many Congregationalist churches in Canada and the Northeast U.S., and who had also founded the predecessor institution to Wichita State University. Parker, who had graduated from Middlebury College in 1869, wanted to bring the academically rigorous tradition of the liberal arts education he had received to the Midwest. Parker gave $2,500 of his own money to pay for the campus. Beginnings First opened in an old hotelHanneman, Carolyn G. \\"Kingfisher College,\\" Oklahoma Historical Society. Retrieved September 12, 2016. in Kingfisher on September 2, 1895, the college was the 42nd with ties to the Congregational church in America. The class of 1896 took classes in the Beard Building, and the class of '97 graduated from the Baptist Church. Parker Hall was completed for 1897, and held class as well as dormitories inside. In the following years, Gilbert Hall, Osgood Hall, and Seay Hall were all built. Dr. Moody was president until 1915, a period in which Kingfisher continued to struggle. After subsequent President George Hatfield's six-month tenure, Dr. Tuttle took control. Tuttle would remain president until the college's close. Enrollment was increasing until World War I, when it sharply fell. The college was forced to close in 1922, due to declining donations, cheaper tuition at schools such as Central State Normal School, and failed investments in a local flour mill, which closed due to falling wheat prices in the 1920s. Athletics A member of the Oklahoma Athletic Association, Kingfisher competed against the major schools of the state. Their signature sport was tennis: led by Rhodes scholar Roy Lange, Kingfisher won state titles in 1901 and 1902, dropping the sport after Lange's graduation. The 1901 Kingfisher football team had a 4-1 record; from 1897 to 1919, Kingfisher met the mighty University of Oklahoma Sooners a total of 22 times. Although Kingfisher managed a trio of scoreless ties in 1900, 1903 and 1904, the Sooners soon began to dominate, winning the other 19 contests easily, notching 100 points in three of the games (and 96 in another). The 1917 tilt ended 179-0, still the second-worst rout in college football history (eclipsed only by the Georgia Tech's infamous 222-0 win over Cumberland the year before). Kingfisher was also strong in track and field, hosting the conference meet several times.https://www.lostcolleges.com/kingfisher Kingfisher: Lost Colleges Alumni A total of 117 students graduated from Kingfisher College, 55 women and 62 men. The graduating classes never exceeded 12, including two classes of two members. The two initial years both produced only one graduate. Despite a low number of alumni, three were Rhodes Scholars and three more qualified for the prestigious honor. One alumnus, Joyce C. Stearns, became an atomic scientist and worked on the Manhattan Project. After 1922 closing The Pentecostal Holiness Church bought the site, where King's College was open for ten years before closing. The college waited until 1976 to be added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Since December 2016 its work has been continued by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Launch The Foundation was launched in May 2008 in New York at the headquarters of the media group Time Warner. In his speech, Blair outlined the Foundation's aim that \\"idealism becomes the new realism\\", and that one of its goals was to \\"counter extremism in all six leading religions\\" (i.e., according to the Foundation, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and Sikhism). Blair said that while in office, he feared being exposed as a \\"nutter\\" if he had talked about his religious views. Former US president Bill Clinton attended the launch, describing Blair as \\"a good man as well as a great leader\\". In an interview with Time magazine, Blair said the Foundation was \\"how I want to spend the rest of my life\\". \\"BBC News Blair launches faith foundation\\", bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 8 March 2010. The foundation listed several goals: \\"The foundation provides the practical support required to help prevent religious prejudice, conflict and extremism. At school, university and professional level the foundation provides various education programmes. The foundation encouraged interfaith initiatives to tackle global poverty and conflict.\\" The Foundation's basic premises, as listed in its initial mission statement, were that 1) faith is important to many, underpinning their systems of thought, their behaviour and the behaviour of many of the world's progressive movements, and that 2) the great religions share values of respect, justice and compassion. But the statement also recognised that faith can be divisive, too; this is viewed by the Foundation as being based on distortions of faith rather than being intrinsic to it. The aim of the Foundation was to use the tools of modern communication to \\"educate, inform and develop understanding\\" about various faiths, and the relationships between them. It aimed to do this in such a way as to address global poverty and conflict.\\"Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Mission statement\\", Tonyblairfaithfoundation.org. Retrieved July 2010. The Foundation had several projects: Faith and Globalisation Initiative, Face to Faith (later Generation Global), Faiths Act (an activist group), and Faith Shorts (for short religious films). Faith and Globalisation Initiative Faith and Globalisation Initiative launched in Yale University in September 2008 was an attempt to build a \\"global conversation\\" between an \\"elite group\\" of universities. As part of this attempt, Blair was to be the Howland Distinguished Fellow at Yale and was one of the professors for the course. Face to Faith Face to Faith was a programme for schoolchildren (12–17 years) which allowed via videoconferencing international interaction where cross-faith discussions may take place. The proclaimed aim was to break down religious and cultural differences and thereby reduce conflict.http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/page/about-face-to-faith The Tony Blair Faith Foundation: Face to Faith (Accessed March 2012) Faiths Act initiative Faiths Act was a project of the Foundation described as an attempt to build a global movement to both \\"inspire and mobilise\\" those who believe, in a faith, to address the Millennium Development Goals.

Directors, executives and advisors Angela Salt was the Executive Director of the Foundation, which was registered as charity in the UK with Tony Blair as its Patron. The trustees were Robert Clinton, Robert Coke and Jeremy Sinclair. The Foundation was also registered as a charity in the US with the following directors: Alfred E. Smith IV, Linda LeSourd Lader, Ruth Turner, Timothy C. Collins and Tony Blair. Ruth Turner, formerly Director of Government Relations within Tony Blair's Prime Ministerial office, was the first Chief Executive.  International Religious Advisory Council  The Foundation had an International Religious Advisory Council made up of members of what the Foundation considered to be the six major religions.

Criticism  Hugh O'Shaughnessy in The Guardian stated that the Foundation \\"inspires ridicule\\". He noted that Professor Michel Schooyans of the Catholic University of Leuven and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences \\"accused Blair and his wife of supporting a messianic US plan for world domination.\\" The criticism's focus was that the Foundation's approach amounted to reducing the religions to the same, predetermined common denominator. This meant \\"stripping them of their identity\\". Schooyans arguing that \\"(t)his project threatens to set us back to an age in which political power was ascribed the mission of promoting a religious confession, or of changing it. In the case of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, this is also a matter of promoting one and only one religious confession, which a universal, global political power would impose on the entire world.\\" The director of the Muslim charity Forward Thinking, Huda Jawad was reported by the BBC as raising doubts about levels of support from many Muslims for the Foundation, given Blair's foreign-policy record. \\"Tony Blair's faith in new mission\\", by Christopher Landau, BBC, 13 April 2009. On 2 April 2009, sceptic and secularist Richard Dawkins mocked the Foundation in a spoof letter, published in the New Statesman. In it, Dawkins ridiculed the idea that faith is not a divisive force, and attacked religion's record on promoting dialogue and equality. Between April 2008 and April 2009, the foundation raised more than 3.5 million pounds, and paid, according to the Daily Telegraph, six-figure salaries to its top officials. An implied criticism was that these pay scales were in line with much larger charitable organisations. However, the wages were also reported to be the result of external recommendations and a strategy of hiring a small number of capable senior staff to co-ordinate a variety of efforts.\\"Tony Blair's faith charity pays six figure salaries to top officials\\", Robert Mendick, The Telegraph, 13 February 2010. Retrieved 8 March 2012. A former editor of a Foundation website, Martin Bright, was critical of the organisation and its style. He mentioned the problems associated with the need to tiptoe around some of Tony Blair's business interests in Kazakhstan, Romania and the Gulf, his advising of the new government of Egypt being \\"a nightmare\\", the organisation's use of \\"ritzy offices in a West End tower block\\", the employment of a five-people in a communications department \\"whose sole aim seemed to be to say as little as possible\\" and the use of unpaid interns.

It is a follow-up to the 1984 film Let Me Tell Ya 'bout White Chicks. Synopsis The film begins with four African-American women (Cherry Layme, Lady Stephanie, Purple Passion, and Sahara) lounging in a hotel room. The four are dressed as maids and they discuss sexual encounters they have had with white men (and in one instance with a white woman). Their manner and dialog has been criticized for playing to stereotypes. Klansmen scene controversy Klansmen Like many of the films produced by the Dark Brothers, Let Me Tell Ya 'bout Black Chicks is controversial. One scene in particular led to the withdrawal of the film from the home video market. In the scene involving Sahara, Steve Powers, and Mark Wallice, the two men are dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist organization. When the pair encounter Sahara they say \\"Let's fuck the shit out of this darky!\\" and begin a series of racist remarks that continues throughout the scene. Despite the insults, or perhaps because of them, Sahara is portrayed as an enthusiastic participant in the sexual encounter, which includes fellatio and double penetration. In relating the encounter to the other maids, Sahara describes the experience as \\"too good\\". According to script writer Antonio Passolini, the film-makers' intention was to be as politically incorrect as possible. Passolini says that he originally intended to portray Sahara \\"masturbating to [a] picture of Jesus that she was looking at as she cleaned the altar at a church\\", but Gregory Dark would not film it that way. Instead, the Klansmen find Sahara masturbating while listening to gospel music.

It is based on James Herriot's first two novels, If Only They Could Talk (1970) and It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet (1972), and was given the same title as the 1972 US compilation volume of these two novels. It is the first of a series of films and television series based on Herriot's work. A sequel, somewhat confusingly titled It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet although it actually covers the two following novels, Let Sleeping Vets Lie and Vet in Harness, was released in 1976. Premise It is 1937, and newly qualified vet James Herriot travels to Yorkshire to apply for the post of assistant in Siegfried Farnon’s practice. He soon learns the facts of country life but struggles to overcome the prejudices of the Darrowby locals who are skeptical of the novice vet's ability.

Another account said the budget was $1 million, with $650,000 from NBC, $250,000 from EMI (who distributed), and $100,000 privately raised. The lead role was given to Simon Ward, who later recalled, \\"I hadn't known the books and a lot of people hadn't known about them then, so at that time I wasn't taking on a national icon. It's always nerve-wracking playing a real person particularly if that real person is still alive and comes and sits on set watching you. Although Herriot was the most charming wonderful man who I really adored and kept in touch with till he died.\\" Writing The script by Hugh Whitemore, focused on James, and played down Siegfried's eccentricity; for example, a speech he makes early in the film rebuking James for refusing to attend a call during the middle of the night is delivered straight, while in the book it was highly hypocritical, as Siegfried himself had earlier told James that he was 'spoiling' the farmers by coming out at all hours. Shooting Filming started in May 1974, in the town of Malton, North Riding of Yorkshire. Studio work was done in London. Ward said \\"The roughest thing was putting a hand up a pregnant mare... for the film I had to do it again and again.\\" Music The film's incidental music was by Wilfred Josephs.

He is best known for his work on molecular evolution; with Walter Fitch, he devised Fitch- Margoliash method for constructing evolutionary trees based on protein sequences. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Biography Margoliash earned an M.D. from the American University of Beirut. He served as an Israeli Army medical officer during the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, and subsequently held research positions at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem-Hadassah Medical School, the Nobel Institute Department of Biochemistry, the University of Utah College of Medicine, the McGill-Montreal General Hospital Research Institute, Abbott Laboratories, Northwestern University, where he was chair of the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Cell Biology during the 1980s. He left Abbott Laboratories to join the faculty at Northwestern University, and continued his research on cytochrome c, until Northwestern Universities policies forced him to retire. He quietly enjoyed his retirement ceremonies and immediately obtained a position (with all new labs) at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His passion for cytochrome C research took him all over the world, and in 1970 he was offered the chance to dissect a coelacanth fish and isolate its cytochrome C for sequencing. This fish which lives at great ocean depths was washed up on the shores of France during the war, and DeGaulle deemed it a \\"french fish\\" and refused to allow its exportation. Margoliash went to France and with his colleagues carried out the cytochrome C isolation of the large fish, and returned with a small crystal in a small vial which represented the entire amount of cytochrome C in the unusual animal.

The church is Grade I listed by English Heritage as a building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. History The Chapel of St. Paul at Clumber Park was commissioned by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle in 1864. It was designed by the architect Thomas Chambers Hine but not completed and became known as the pigeon coop. Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle, demolished it and commissioned a new chapel dedicated to St Mary the Virgin in 1886. It was designed by George Frederick Bodley and built by the contractor R. Franklin of Diddington, Oxfordshire. The stone used in the interior is Red Runcorn, and externally Steetly ashlar with Red Runcorn dressings. It was completed by 1889 at a cost of £30,000 (equivalent to £ in ) . It was opened by the Bishop of Southwell on 22 October 1889 but this ceremony caused alarm in the Protestant Alliance of the Church of England as reported in the Derby Daily Telegraph on 6 November 1889. > The committee and members of the Protestant Alliance have forwarded a > memorial to the Archbishop of Canterbury, inviting his Grace's attention to > the reports published in the Press regarding the services conducted at the > benediction or dedication of the new church at Clumber on the 22nd of > October - services “authorised and conducted” by the Bishop of Southwell, > the bishop of the diocese, and described as “a function which far exceeded > that of Cardiff in grandeur of ritual and dignity of ceremonial”.

While it is commonly believed that production ended in 1967, according to Remington representatives records indicate that it actually ended in 1968. This Model was the precursor to the Model 660 (manufactured 1968–1971); the Model Mohawk 600 (manufactured 1972–1979); and the Model 673 (manufactured 2003–2004). Overview The Model 600 was designed to be a guide rifle. Its most noticeable feature was the vent rib barrel. There were approximately 94,086 rifles produced in the available calibers of: .222 Remington, .223 Remington, 6mm Remington, 6.5mm Remington Magnum, .243 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .35 Remington, .350 Remington Magnum. The rarest is the one chambered in .223 Remington; only 227 were produced—most in the final year of production. Before it was officially added to the line, you could order a Model 600 out of the custom gun shop in .223. At least one Model 600 in .223 came out of the Remington Custom Shop in 1966. A successor model, the Remington Mohawk 600 ('72-'79) available in .222, .243 and .308 comprised total production of only 142 with a Mannlicher-style stock. But the rarest Original Model 600 was and remains the .223. Variants There were several variations in the original production line and they were the: (1) 600 Magnum Carbine, (2) 75th Anniversary Montana Statehood/100th Anniversary Montana Territory &, (3) Remington 600 Mohawk Remington Model 600 Magnum :Same as the Model 600 except that it was available in 6.5mm Remington Magnum and .350 Remington Magnum. Also featured a laminated walnut stock, recoil pad and sling. Remington Model 600 Mohawk Model 600 Mohawk. :Same specs as the Model 600 except featuring an barrel with no rib. It was a promotional model produced from 1971-1980. Popularity While loved by the majority of its owners, the death knell of the original Model 600 and its descendants were its looks; it was largely despised by critics, even though it shot exceptionally well. The original barrel length of 18.5 inches resulted in more felt muzzle blast, especially in the .350 Rem Mag.

Influenced by Cerverí de Girona, the chansonnier and its ideology serve as transition in the history of Catalan literature between the dominance of the troubadours and the new developments of Ausiàs March. The provenance of the manuscript has been debated. Arguments in favour of an origin with the monastic community of Ripoll, where the manuscript is first recorded in the library before heading to the archives in Barcelona, include the use of Latin headings to introduce some of the poems and the abundance of authors of clerical background cited. On the other hand, an aristocratic or \\"courtly\\" provenance has been taught, notably by Martín de Riquer, on the basis of the references to Peter, Count of Ribagorza, to people and places in the County of Roussillon and the Kingdom of Majorca, and evidence of Goliardic influence. The Cançoneret contains a copy of the Regles de trobar of Jaufre de Foixa and an anonymous untitled continuation thereof, dealing mainly with poetic genre and form. Eighteen complete poems and one fragment accompany the grammatical treatise to illustrate the points. All the cited poets are Catalans but only five or six are named. The generic classifications of the Cançoneret follow those of the Doctrina de compondre dictats, possibly of Raimon Vidal, and the \\"rules\\" of the Consistori del Gay Saber, codified in the Leys d'amors. The following genres are recognised: cançó, tençó, sirventès (serventesch), cobles d'acuyndamens, cobles de qüestions, vers, dança (dans), desdança (desdansa), and viadera. The Cançoneret confirms that the vers was merely a canso de matèria tota moral (of entirely moral material) and that the viadera (traveller's song) was la pus jusana spècies qui és en los cantàs (the most humble genre of song there is). The distinction between cobles, exchanges of stanzas between troubadours, that are d'acuyndamens and those de qüestions is unique to the Cançoneret. Cobles d'acuyndamens broke bonds of vassallage, love, or fidelity. Among the classical troubadours cited by the treatise are Guillem de Cabestany, Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, Arnaut Daniel, Peire Cardenal, and Folquet de Marselha (though the reference is a mistake, the poet should be Pons Fabre d'Uzès). Among the named Catalan poets whose pieces are preserved as exemplars are Dalmau de Castellnou, Pere Alamany, and the . The incipit of another Catalan piece, De l'ordre suy de noble infant En Pedro, by Pere de Vilademany is also mentioned in the treatise. There are several unidentifiable authors with works in the Cançoneret: a \\"poeta anònim\\" (anonymous poet), a \\"frare\\" (friar), \\"dos frares\\" (two friars), a \\"monja\\" (nun), \\"frayr'Uguó, prior\\" (brother Hugh, prior), \\"Francesc\\", and an \\"arxiprest\\" (archpriest).

Its population in 2007 was 19,300 inhabitants in a total area of 1,903 km². It is a large producer of cattle and there is mining of zinc. Location Vazante belongs to the Paracatu statistical microregion. The elevation of the municipal seat is 680 meters. It became a municipality in 1953. This municipality is located north of Patos de Minas on paved national highway BR-354. It is 27 km. north of Lagamar and 39 km. southeast of Guarda-Mor.Citybrazil The distance to the capital of the state, Belo Horizonte, is 496 km. Neighboring municipalities are: Lagoa Grande, Coromandel, Guarda-Mor, Lagamar and Paracatu. There are two districts, besides the municipal seat: Claro de Minas, 12 km. distant, and Vazamor, 32 km. distant. Climate and Geography The climate is humid sub- tropical with an average maximum of 35°C; a minimum of 16°C; and an annual average between 21°C and 24°C. The hottest time of the year is between September and October and the coldest in June and July. The year can be divided into a rainy summer, from October to April, and a dry winter, from May to September. The main river is the Rio Claro, which has its source in the Serra de Chapadinha. Another river is the Rio Santa Catarina, which is a tributary of the Paracatu River. There are several lakes, the most important being Lagoa do Vermelho. Economic activities The main economic activities are cattle raising, mining and farming. The GDP was R$209,137,000 (2003).Statistics from IBGE In agriculture the main products cultivated are mangoes, rice, soybeans, and corn. There are 02 bank branches in the town. In the health sector there were 12 health clinics and 02 hospital with 59 beds (2007).Prefeitura municipal There is also a large open-pit zinc mine. The Vazante Mine is a property of Votorantim Metais and has reserves of around 2 million tons of zinc. It has the largest Brazilian deposit of zinc ore, with a production of 290,000 tons of silicate concentrate.Mindat and Geoscience world In the rural area there were 712 farms and a total agricultural area of 133,000 hectares, of which 34,000 ha. were planted, 75,000 were in natural pasture, and 44,000 ha. were in woodland or forest. 2,000 people were dependent on farming. 149 of the farms had tractors. In 2006 there were 84,000 head of cattle. The score on the Municipal Human Development Index was 0.757. Vazante was ranked 235 out of 853 municipalities in the state, with Poços de Caldas in first place with 0.841 and Setubinha in last place with 0.568.Frigoletto History The settlement of Vazante began on a ranch called Vazante due to an alleged religious vision of the Virgin Mary in a cave. The founding of the town occurred in 1920 when the site of the vision, Lapa, was separated from the ranch. Around a chapel houses were built and soon a small general store appeared. This was the arraial (village) of Vazante, in the district of Guarda-Mor, in the municipality of Paracatu. In 1938 Vazante was raised to the category of district, and in 1952 it became a municipality, despite having only 20 or 25 solid houses, when the law required at least 300 houses. The most important moment in the economic history of this city was the discovery of zinc in 1933. In 1969 the first load of metal was sent to the factory in Três Marias. Today the zinc is mined and refined by Cia. Mineira de Metais - 6000 T/month and Mineração Areiense 3500 T/month.Vazante municipal government Tourism The most important tourist site is Lapa Velha (Old Grotto), located in the city itself, where a vision of the Virgin Mary is alleged to have occurred. Every year, on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of May, thousands of pilgrims flock to Vazante to pray to the Virgin. Other caves are Lapa Nova (New Grotto), and Lapa da Delza or Caçula (Youngest Grotto). The cavern of Lapa Nova is listed as the fourth largest in the country.

It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called \\"the most powerful text editor available today\\". With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999. Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement. GNU Emacs is sometimes abbreviated as GNUMACS, especially to differentiate it from other EMACS variants. The tag line for GNU Emacs is \\"the extensible self-documenting text editor\\".  History  Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU Project and author of GNU Emacs In 1976, Stallman wrote the first Emacs (“Editor MACroS”), and in 1984, began work on GNU Emacs, to produce a free software alternative to the proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This became the first program released by the nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides Emacs Lisp, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985. Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as \\"1.x.x,\\" with the initial digit denoting the version of the C core. The \\"1\\" was dropped after version 1.12 as it was thought that the major number would never change, and thus the major version skipped from \\"1\\" to \\"13\\". A new third version number was added to represent changes made by user sites. In the current numbering scheme, a number with two components signifies a release version, with development versions having three components. GNU Emacs was later ported to the Unix operating system. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the de facto Unix Emacs editor. Markus Hess exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs's email subsystem in his 1986 cracking spree, in which he gained superuser access to Unix computers. Although users commonly submitted patches and Elisp code to the net.emacs newsgroup, participation in GNU Emacs development was relatively restricted until 1999, and was used as an example of the \\"Cathedral\\" development style in The Cathedral and the Bazaar. The project has since adopted a public development mailing list and anonymous CVS access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008, and today uses the Git] DVCS. Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong have overseen maintenance since 2008.; see also \\"Stallman on handing over GNU Emacs, its future and the importance of nomenclature\\" On September 21, 2015 Monnier announced that he would be stepping down as maintainer effective with the feature freeze of Emacs 25. Longtime contributor John Wiegley was announced as the new maintainer on November 5, 2015.  Licensing  The terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) state that the Emacs source code, including both the C and Emacs Lisp components, are freely available for examination, modification, and redistribution. Older versions of the GNU Emacs documentation appeared under an ad-hoc license that required the inclusion of certain text in any modified copy. In the GNU Emacs user's manual, for example, this included instructions for obtaining GNU Emacs and Richard Stallman's essay The GNU Manifesto. The XEmacs manuals, which were inherited from older GNU Emacs manuals when the fork occurred, have the same license. Newer versions of the documentation use the GNU Free Documentation License with \\"invariant sections\\" that require the inclusion of the same documents and that the manuals proclaim themselves as GNU Manuals. For GNU Emacs, like many other GNU packages, it remains policy to accept significant code contributions only if the copyright holder executes a suitable disclaimer or assignment of their copyright interest to the Free Software Foundation. Bug fixes and minor code contributions of fewer than 10 lines are exempt. This policy is in place so that the FSF can defend the software in court if its copyleft license is violated. In 2011, it was noticed that GNU Emacs had been accidentally releasing some binaries without corresponding source code for two years, in opposition to the intended spirit of the GPL.License revoked: Applying Section 4 of the GPL and the lessons of Best Buy to Google’s Android by Edward J. Naughton (Aug 8, 2011) on slashdot.org (2011) Richard Stallman described this incident as \\"a very bad mistake\\",Re: Compiled files without sources???? on lists.gnu.org by Richard Stallman (Jul 28, 2011) which was promptly fixed. The FSF didn't sue any downstream redistributors who unknowingly violated the GPL by distributing these binaries.  Using GNU Emacs  Editing multiple Dired buffers in GNU Emacs C source code in GNU Emacs Editing and compiling C++ code from GNU Emacs  Commands  In its normal editing mode, GNU Emacs behaves like other text editors and allows the user to insert characters with the corresponding keys and to move the editing point with the arrow keys. Escape key sequences or pressing the control key and/or the meta key, alt key or super keys in conjunction with a regular key produces modified keystrokes that invoke functions from the Emacs Lisp environment. Commands such as \`save-buffer\` and \`save-buffers-kill-emacs\` combine multiple modified keystrokes. Some GNU Emacs commands work by invoking an external program, such as ispell for spell-checking or GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) for program compilation, parsing the program's output, and displaying the result in GNU Emacs. Emacs also supports \\"inferior processes\\"-- long-lived processes that interact with an Emacs buffer. This is used to implement , running a Unix shell as inferior process, as well as read–eval–print loop (REPL) modes for various programming languages. Emacs' support for external processes makes it an attractive environment for interactive programming along the lines of Interlisp or Smalltalk. Users who prefer IBM Common User Access-style keys can use , a package that originally was a third-party add-on but has been included in GNU Emacs since version 22.  Minibuffer  Emacs uses the \\"minibuffer,\\" normally the bottommost line, to present status and request information--the functions that would typically be performed by dialog boxes in most GUIs. The minibuffer holds information such as text to target in a search or the name of a file to read or save. When applicable, command-line completion is available using the tab and space keys.  File management and display  Emacs keeps text in data structures known as buffers. Buffers may or may not be displayed onscreen, and all buffer features are accessible to both an Emacs Lisp program and to the user interface. The user can create new buffers and dismiss unwanted ones, and many buffers can exist at the same time. There is no upper limit on the number of buffers Emacs allows, other than hardware memory limits. Advanced users may amass hundreds of open buffers of various types relating to their current work. Emacs can be configured to save the list of open buffers on exit, and reopen this list when it is restarted. Some buffers contain text loaded from text files, which the user can edit and save back to permanent storage. These buffers are said to be \\"visiting\\" files. Buffers also serve to display other data, such as the output of Emacs commands, dired directory listings, documentation strings displayed by the \\"help\\" library and notification messages that in other editors would be displayed in a dialog box. Some of these notifications are displayed briefly in the minibuffer, and GNU Emacs provides a buffer that keeps a history of the most recent notifications of this type. When the minibuffer is used for output from Emacs, it is called the \\"echo area\\". Longer notifications are displayed in buffers of their own. The maximum length of messages that will be displayed in the minibuffer is, of course, configurable. Buffers can also serve as input and output areas for an external process such as a shell or REPL. Buffers which Emacs creates on its own are typically named with asterisks on each end, to distinguish from user buffers. The list of open buffers is itself displayed in this type of buffer. Most Emacs key sequences remain functional in any buffer. For example, the standard Ctrl-s \`isearch\` function can be used to search filenames in dired buffers, and the file list can be saved to a text file just as any other buffer. dired buffers can be switched to a writable mode, in which filenames and attributes can be edited textually; when the buffer is saved, the changes are written to the filesystem. This allows multiple files to be renamed using the search and replace features of Emacs. When so equipped, Emacs displays image files in buffers. Emacs is binary safe and 8-bit clean. Emacs can split the editing area into separate non-overlapping sections called \\"windows,\\" a feature that has been available since 1975, predating the graphical user interface in common use. In Emacs terminology, \\"windows\\" are similar to what other systems call \\"frames\\" or \\"panes\\" a rectangular portion of the program's display that can be updated and interacted with independently. Each Emacs window has a status bar called the \\"mode line\\" displayed by default at the bottom edge of the window. Emacs windows are available both in text-terminal and graphical modes and allow more than one buffer, or several parts of a buffer, to be displayed at once. Common applications are to display a dired buffer along with the contents of files in the current directory (there are special modes to make the file buffer follow the file highlighted in dired), to display the source code of a program in one window while another displays a shell buffer with the results of compiling the program, to run a debugger along with a shell buffer running the program, to work on code while displaying a man page or other documentation (possibly loaded over the World Wide Web using one of Emacs' built-in web browsers) or simply to display multiple files for editing at once such as a header along with its implementation file for C-based languages. In addition, there is , a minor mode that chains windows to display non-overlapping portions of a buffer. Using , a single file can be displayed in multiple side-by-side windows that update appropriately when scrolled. In addition, Emacs supports \\"narrowing\\" a buffer to display only a portion of a file, with top/bottom of buffer navigation functionality and buffer size calculations reflecting only the selected range. Emacs windows are tiled and cannot appear \\"above\\" or \\"below\\" their companions. Emacs can launch multiple \\"frames\\", which are displayed as individual windows in a graphical environment. On a text terminal, multiple frames are displayed stacked filling the entire terminal, and can be switched using the standard Emacs commands.  Major modes  GNU Emacs can display or edit a variety of different types of text and adapts its behavior by entering add-on modes called \\"major modes\\". There are major modes for many different purposes including editing ordinary text files, the source code of many markup and programming languages, as well as displaying web pages, directory listings and other system info. Each major mode involves an Emacs Lisp program that extends the editor to behave more conveniently for the specified type of text. Major modes typically provide some or all of the following common features: * Syntax highlighting (\\"font lock\\"): combinations of fonts and colors, termed \\"faces,\\" that differentiate between document elements such as keywords and comments. * Automatic indentation to maintain consistent formatting within a file. * The automatic insertion of elements required by the structure of the document, such as spaces, newlines, and parentheses. * Special editing commands, such as commands to jump to the beginning or the end of a function while editing a programming file or commands to validate documents or insert closing tags while working with markup languages such as XML.  Minor modes  The use of \\"minor modes\\" enables further customization. A GNU Emacs editing buffer can use only one major mode at a time, but multiple minor modes can operate simultaneously. These may operate directly on documents, as in the way the major mode for the C programming language defines a separate minor mode for each of its popular indent styles, or they may alter the editing environment. Examples of the latter include a mode that adds the ability to undo changes to the window configuration and one that performs on-the-fly syntax checking. There is also a minor mode that allows multiple major modes to be used in a single file, for convenience when editing a document in which multiple programming languages are embedded.  \\"Batch mode\\"  GNU Emacs supports the capability to use it as an interpreter for the Emacs Lisp language without displaying the text editor user interface. In batch mode, user configuration is not loaded and the terminal interrupt characters C-c and C-z will have their usual effect of exiting the program or suspending execution instead of invoking Emacs keybindings. GNU Emacs has command line options to specify either a file to load and execute, or an Emacs Lisp function may be passed in from the command line. Emacs will start up, execute the passed-in file or function, print the results, then exit. The shebang line \`#!/usr/bin/emacs --script\` allows the creation of standalone scripts in Emacs Lisp. Batch mode is not an Emacs mode per se, but describes an alternate execution mode for the Emacs program.  Manuals  GNU Emacs Manual (cover art by Etienne Suvasa; cover design by Matt Lee) Apart from the built-in documentation, GNU Emacs has an unusually long and detailed manual. An electronic copy of the GNU Emacs Manual, written by Richard Stallman, is bundled with GNU Emacs and can be viewed with the built- in info browser. Two additional manuals, the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual by Bil Lewis, Richard Stallman, and Dan Laliberte and An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp by Robert Chassell, are included. All three manuals are also published in book form by the Free Software Foundation. The XEmacs manual is similar to the GNU Emacs Manual, from which it forked at the same time that the XEmacs software forked from GNU Emacs.  Internationalization  GNU Emacs has support for many alphabets, scripts, writing systems, and cultural conventions and provides spell-checking for many languages by calling external programs such as ispell. Version 24 added support for bidirectional text and left-to-right and right-to-left writing direction for languages such as Arabic, Persian and Hebrew. Many character encoding systems, including UTF-8, are supported. GNU Emacs uses UTF-8 for its encoding as of GNU 23, while prior versions used their own encoding internally and performed conversion upon load and save. The internal encoding used by XEmacs is similar to that of GNU Emacs but differs in details. The GNU Emacs user interface originated in English and, with the exception of the beginners' tutorial, has not been translated into any other language. A subsystem called Emacspeak enables visually impaired and blind users to control the editor through audio feedback.  Extensibility  GNU Emacs with AUCTeX, a set of tools for editing TeX and LaTeX documents The behavior of GNU Emacs can be modified and extended almost without limit by incorporating Emacs Lisp programs that define new commands, new buffer modes, new keymaps, add command-line options, and so on. Many extensions providing user-facing functionality define a major mode (either for a new file type or to build a non-text-editing user interface); others define only commands or minor modes, or provide functions that enhance another extension. Many extensions are bundled with the GNU Emacs installation; others used to be downloaded as loose files (the Usenet newsgroup gnu.emacs.sources was a traditional means of distribution) but there has been a development of managed packages and package download sites since version 24, with a built-in package manager (itself an extension) to download, install, and keep them up to date. The list of available packages is itself displayed in an Emacs buffer set to major mode. Notable examples include: * AUCTeX, tools to edit and process TeX and LaTeX documents * dired, a file manager * Dissociated press, a Racter-like text generator * Doctor, an implementation of ELIZA * Dunnet, a text adventure * Emacs Web Wowser (eww), a web browser. * Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) modes for editing statistical languages like R and SAS * ERC, an IRC client * Eshell, a command line shell written in Emacs Lisp. This allows closer integration with the Emacs environment than standard shells such as bash or PowerShell, which are also available from within Emacs. For example, in Eshell, Elisp functions are available as shell commands and output from Unix commands can be redirected to an Emacs buffer. * Exwm, an X window manager allowing X11 apps to be run in an Emacs window. *Gnus, a full-featured news client (newsreader) and email client and early evidence for Zawinski's Law * MULtilingual Enhancement to Emacs (MULE) allows editing of text in multiple languages in a manner somewhat analogous to Unicode * Org-mode for keeping notes, maintaining various types of lists, planning and measuring projects, and composing documents in many formats (such as PDF, HTML, or OpenDocument formats). There are static site generators using org mode, as well as an extension, Babel, allowing it to be used for literate programming. * Planner, a personal information manager *rcirc, an IRC client * Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs (SLIME) extends GNU Emacs into a development environment for Common Lisp. With SLIME (written in Emacs Lisp) the GNU Emacs editor communicates with a Common Lisp system (using the SWANK backend) over a special communication protocol and provides such tools as a read–eval–print loop, a data inspector and a debugger. * Texinfo (Info), an online help-browser * Zone, a display hack mode incorporating various text effects.  Performance  GNU Emacs often ran noticeably slower than rival text editors on the systems in which it was first implemented, because the loading and interpreting of its Lisp-based code incurs a performance overhead. Modern computers are powerful enough to run GNU Emacs without slowdowns, but versions prior to 19.29 (released in 1995) couldn't edit files larger than 8 MB. The file size limit was raised in successive versions, and 32 bit versions after GNU Emacs 23.2 can edit files up to 512 MB in size. Emacs compiled on a 64-bit machine can handle much larger buffers.  Platforms  GNU Emacs is one of the most-ported non- trivial computer programs and runs on a wide variety of operating systems, including DOS, Windows and OpenVMS. Support for some \\"obsolete platforms was removed in Emacs 23.1\\", such as VMS and most commercial Unix variants. It is available for most Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux, the various BSDs, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and macOS, and is often included with their system installation packages. Native ports of GNU Emacs exist for Android and Nokia's Maemo. GNU Emacs runs both on text terminals and in graphical user interface (GUI) environments. On Unix-like operating systems, GNU Emacs can use the X Window System to produce its GUI either directly using Athena widgets or by using a \\"widget toolkit\\" such as Motif, LessTif, or GTK+. GNU Emacs can also use the graphics systems native to macOS and Windows to provide menubars, toolbars, scrollbars and context menus conforming more closely to each platform's look and feel.  Forks   XEmacs  XEmacs 21.5 on GNU/Linux Lucid Emacs, based on an early version of GNU Emacs 19, was developed beginning in 1991 by Jamie Zawinski and others at Lucid Inc. One of the best- known forks in free software development occurred when the codebases of the two Emacs versions diverged and the separate development teams ceased efforts to merge them back into a single program. After Lucid filed for bankruptcy, Lucid Emacs was renamed XEmacs and remains the second most popular variety of Emacs, after GNU Emacs. XEmacs development has slowed, with the most recent stable version 21.4.22 released in January 2009, while GNU Emacs has implemented many formerly XEmacs-only features. This has led some users to proclaim XEmacs' death.  Other forks of GNU Emacs  Other forks, less known than XEmacs, include: * Meadow a Japanese version for Microsoft Windows * SXEmacs Steve Youngs' fork of XEmacs * Aquamacs a version which focuses on integrating with the Apple Macintosh user interface * Remacs a port of GNU Emacs to the Rust programming language.

First published in 1899, it describes an adulterous affair between Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, an unhappily married Moscow banker, and Anna Sergeyevna Von Diderits, a young married woman, an affair which begins while both are vacationing alone in the Crimean (Black) sea resort of Yalta. The story comprises four parts: part I describes the initial meeting in Yalta, part II the consummation of the affair and the remaining time in Yalta, part III Gurov's return to Moscow and his visit to Anna's town, and part IV Anna's visits to Moscow. This is one of Chekhov's most famous pieces of short fiction. Vladimir Nabokov, for instance, considered it as one of the greatest short stories ever written.From Vladimir Nabokov's Lectures on Russian Literature, quoted by Francine Prose in Learning from Chekhov, 231. Plot Dmitri Gurov works in a Moscow bank. He is under 40, married has a daughter and two sons. Unhappy in his marriage and the monotony and meaninglessness of his life, he is frequently unfaithful and considers women to be of \\"a lower race\\". While vacationing in Yalta, he sees a young woman walking along the seafront with her little Pomeranian, and endeavors to make her acquaintance. The lady, Anna Sergeyevna, is also unhappily married and vacationing without her spouse. Anna and Dmitri soon commence an affair, and spend most of their time together, often walking and taking drives to the nearby village of Oreanda. Though she is expecting her husband to come to Yalta, he eventually sends for her to come home, saying that something is wrong with his eyes. Gurov sees her off at the station. As they part, both feel that they would never see each other again, and that their affair is over. Returning to Moscow, to his loveless marriage, and to his daily routine, working by day and clubbing by night, Gurov expects to soon forget young Anna; to his surprise, her memory haunts him. Unexpectedly, he fell deeply in love for the first time in his life, after many affairs and just as he was approaching middle age. He feels that he must see Anna, despite the obvious complications. On the ruse of going to St. Petersburg to take care of some business, he sets off to her town to find her. Learning the location of the family's residence from a hotel porter, he finds the house, only to realize that it would be futile to intrude. In despair, he rationalizes that Anna has probably forgotten him and found someone else, and heads back to his hotel. In the evening, he remembers having seen a sign earlier in the day announcing the opening performance of The Geisha. Reasoning that Anna and her husband might attend, he goes to the theater. The couple enters and he watches intently. When the husband goes out for a smoke during the first interval, Gurov greets Anna, who is bewildered and runs from him. After following her through the theater, he confronts her and she confides that she has been thinking of him constantly. Frightened, she begs him to leave and promises to come see him in Moscow. She makes excuses to occasionally come to Moscow, telling her husband that she is going there to see a doctor, which he \\"believes and does not believe\\". They are both now fully aware that for the first time in their lives they have actually fallen in love, and they both wonder how they might overcome the many challenges that face them and achieve their fervent wish to permanently live together. They desperately try to come up with a plan, but the story ends without offering a resolution: > \\"They . . . talked of how to avoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, > for living in different towns and not seeing each other for long stretches > of time. . . . and it was clear to both of them that . . . the most > complicated and difficult part of their journey was just beginning.\\" Nabokov wrote about that unconventional ending: > \\"All the traditional rules ... have been broken in this wonderful short > story.... no problem, no regular climax, no point at the end. And it is one > of the greatest stories ever written.\\"  Interpretations and philosophical reflections  The story beautifully captures the quiet desperation of the two protagonists, their dissatisfaction with their meaningless lives and loveless marriages, and their craving for something better. Their deep love for each other fills that void and radically transforms their outlook on life. But that love also breaks their hearts, for, in 19th century Russia, they find it almost impossible to break away and start a new life together. The story can be seen as \\"Gurov's spiritual journey—his transformation from a connoisseur of women to a man tenderly devoted to a single ordinary woman.\\" The story can also be seen as \\"playing with the paradox that a lie—a husband deceiving a wife or a wife deceiving a husband—can be the fulcrum of truth of feeling, a vehicle of authenticity.\\" Maxim Gorky, another great Russian writer from a working-class background, saw the importance of the story as a wake up call to people \\"to let go of sleepy, half-dead existence.\\" Robert Fulford offers yet another interpretation of the story: > \\"What Chekhov says in this sophisticated parable is that love radically > alters the landscape of existence. When touched by love, we know the world > in a different way. Love changes the inner landscape, too. Under the > pressure of love, Gurov looks inside himself and sees someone he has not > known before, someone capable of feelings that he barely knew existed.\\" Gurov often looks behind his immediate surroundings and reflects on the meaning of our existence. Here for instance is one poetic passage: > 'Yalta was hardly visible through the morning mist; white clouds stood > motionless on the mountaintops. The leaves did not stir on the trees, > crickets chirped, and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea, rising up from > below, spoke of the peace, of the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have > sounded when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now; and it > will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in > this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each > of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the > unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards > perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely, > soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings—the sea, mountains, > clouds, the wide open sky—Gurov thought how in reality everything is > beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we think > or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our > existence.\\" Chekhov poetically describes his vision of what real love could be like: > \\"Anna Sergeyevna and he loved each other like people very close and akin, > like husband and wife, like tender friends; it seemed to them that fate > itself had meant them for one another, and they could not understand why he > had a wife and she a husband; and it was as though they were a pair of birds > of passage, caught and forced to live in different cages. They forgave each > other for what they were ashamed of in their past, they forgave everything > in the present, and felt that this love of theirs had changed them both.\\" In the story we see Dmitri Gurov who is bored with his wife and views women as the lower race and uses women to bring an excitement to his other-wise dull life. Dmitri falls in love with the lady, Anna, when on vacation in Yalta. They are forced to go back to their normal life. Gurov can't stop thinking about her and realizes he loves her. He travels through the country to try and find her and tell her how he doesn't want to live without her. The story brings a strong ironic ending because Gurov, who thought of women as inferior and used them only for his excitement, is now chasing one across the country and wanting nothing more than to be with her.  Historical background  While living in Yalta in the winter of 1898-99, \\"Chekhov had also fallen in love with Olga Knipper, the actress whom he would marry in 1901. It is tempting to view the tender relationship of Gurov and Anna in the light of Chekhov's own newfound love.\\" \\"Like Anna and Dmitry, Olga and Anton had strolled along the promenade and admired the ocean from the vista at Oreanda that summer; like Anna, Olga Knipper had a German last name; and like Anna and Dmitry, Olga and Anton had to live apart.\\" Both Anna and Olga are much younger than their male counterparts. > \\"Just as Chekhov was beginning a relationship with a woman he would soon > marry . . . he wrote a story about people who fall in love at the wrong > time. . . . Perhaps this thirty-nine year old writer—who had been exiled to > his 'warm Siberia' for his health and who would die in less than five years > in a German spa with Olga Knipper at his side—perhaps this man also sensed > that he had fallen in love too late, and that the most complicated, > difficult part was yet to come.\\" Publication history The story was written in Yalta, where Chekhov had moved on his doctor's advice to take advantage of the warmer climate owing to his advancing tuberculosis. It was first published in the December 1899 issue of the magazine Russkaya Mysl (Russian Thought) with the subtitle \\"A Story\\" (\\"Rasskaz\\").Дама с собачкой Since then it has been published in numerous collections and languages, and is one of Chekhov's best-known stories.For example, CHEKHOV, Anton The lady with the dog and other stories. at the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America, where the story is described as one of Chekhov's \\"best-known and best-loved works.\\" The first English translation appeared in 1903.Chekhov Stories: Key Facts at sparknotes.com Adaptations Rodion Schedrin composed a ballet in one act called The Lady with the Lapdog, first performed on 20 November 1985 in Moscow by the Bolshoi Theatre, Alexander Lazarev (cond).

It won a Special Prize for \\"lofty humanism and artistic excellence\\" at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival.The Lady with the Dog Film Information at Variety An adaptation of The Lady with the Dog, Dark Eyes (Italian: Oci ciornie; Russian: Очи чёрные; French: Les Yeux noirs) is a 1987 Italian and Russian language film which tells the story of a 19th-century married Italian man who falls in love with a married Russian woman. It stars Marcello Mastroianni, Silvana Mangano, Oleg Tabakov, Yelena Safonova, Pina Cei and Vsevolod Larionov. The film was adapted by Aleksandr Adabashyan, Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Nikita Mikhalkov, \\"inspired by\\" stories by Anton Chekhov. It was directed by Mikhalkov. Mastroianni received Best Actor at the Cannes Film FestivalAwards 1987 at Festival de Cannes site and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.1987 Academy Awards Winners and History at AMC filmsite The story has also been adapted for stage; for example, an adaptation by Peter Campbell was featured at the 2002 Chekhov Now Festival in New York. A play titled Sunstroke, directed by Oleg Mirochnikov, combines The Lady with the Dog with Ivan Bunin's Sunstroke. The play was performed in 2013 at the Platform Theatre in London. An opera version titled \\"The Lady with the Pet Dog\\" was premiered at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa in 2010. Joyce Carol Oates wrote a short story adaptation of the story also entitled \\"The Lady with the Pet Dog\\" published in 1972. Oates' story is told from Anna's point of view and is set in New York and Nantucket. Brian Friel's play The Yalta Game (2001) is loosely based on this short story by Chekhov. Tony Tanner debuted a musical-comedy version of the story in September, 2016, which he wrote and directed. Titled \\"The Lady with the Little Dog,\\" it was performed at the Great Hall Courtyard of Plummer Park in West Hollywood, California. Cultural references In the 2008 film The Reader, based on Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel, the illiterate Hanna (Kate Winslet) first learns to read by listening to an audio recording of the story, which is referred to by her in the movie as The Lady with the Little Dog, read by her former lover Michael (Ralph Fiennes). The short story is also a central theme of the 2014 movie Gurov and Anna by director Rafaël Ouellet.

See inset.—or earlier. It has become a standard in many Protestant hymnals, though it says nothing about Jesus or the gospel, and covered by many artists. Some scholars, such as Forrest Mason McCann, have asserted the possibility of an earlier stage of evolution of the song, in that \\"the tune may go back to English folk origins\\"McCann, Hymns & History: An Annotated Survey of Sources (Abilene, TX: ACU Press, 1997), , p. 595. (later dying out in the white repertoire but staying alive in the work songs of African Americans). In any event, it was by way of Charles Davis Tillman that the song had incalculable influence on the confluence of black spiritual and white gospel song traditions in forming the genre now known as southern gospel. Tillman was largely responsible for publishing the song into the repertoire of white audiences. It was first heard sung by African- Americans and written down by Tillman when he attended a camp meeting in Lexington, South Carolina in 1889. Lyrics Most common lyrics performed are a repetition of the chorus: The lyrics, however, as sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers are: Following Tillman's nuanced changesTillman published his arrangement in his compilation Revival (Atlanta: Charlie D.

E. Winsett Music Company, 1961), Item 347. Shelton rendered the song title as \\"Old-Time Religion\\" and credited it as an \\"Old melody\\" arranged by her first husband R. E. Winsett. In popular culture * The SATB musical arrangement popularized in the hymnals published by Charles Davis Tillman is the background song in the 1941 film Sergeant York. It is featured prominently in the film Inherit the Wind. It also appears in Russ Meyer's penultimate movie Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens and in HBO's Carnivàle.Carnivale music, Episode 3. * A popular version of \\"Old Time Religion\\" was done by The Caravans in 1954 with a young James Cleveland singing lead. Vocals in the group also included Cassietta George, Albertina Walker, Louise McDowell and Johneron Davis. This version introduced a different, lively upbeat and a new chorus all its own: * British folk busking duo The Brotherhood (Don Partridge and Pat Keene) recorded a lively version of this song on their 1966 album \\"Singin' 'n' Sole- In\\" Fontana TL5390 * American experimental band The Residents recorded a lively version of this song during their 1999 \\"Wormwood\\" tour. * This song is referenced in Captain Beefheart's song \\"Moonlight on Vermont\\" on his 1969 album Trout Mask Replica. Numerous parodic filk verses for \\"Old-Time Religion\\" exist, some of the earliest of which were composed by Gordon R.

The parody verses make reference to a very wide range of \\"old-time religions\\" that most Christians would consider pagan.http://sacred-texts.com/bos/bos527.htm * The song is also sung in The Last Waltz by Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko and Richard Manuel.

Background The government of Spain, in an effort to streamline the operation of its colonial empire, began introducing what became known as the Bourbon Reforms throughout South America. In 1776, as part of these reforms, it created the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata by separating Upper Peru (modern Bolivia) and the territory that is now Argentina from the Viceroyalty of Peru. These territories included the economically important silver mines at Potosí, whose economic benefits began to flow to Buenos Aires in the east, instead of Cuzco and Lima to the west. The economic hardship this introduced to parts of the Altiplano combined with systemic oppression of Indian and mestizo underclasses (a recurring source of localized uprisings throughout Spanish colonial South America) to create an environment in which a large-scale uprising could occur. In 1778 Spain raised sales taxes (known as the alcabala) on goods such as rum and pulque (the common alcoholic beverages of the peasants and commoners) while tightening the rest of its tax system in its colonies,Meade, T. A. (2016). History of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. John Wiley & Sons. in part to fund its participation in the American Revolutionary War. José Gabriel Condorcanqui, an upper-class Indian with claims to the Inca royal lineage, adopted the name Túpac Amaru II (alluding to Túpac Amaru, the last Inca emperor), and in 1780 called for rebellion. He claimed to be acting on behalf of the King of Spain, enforcing royal authority on the corrupt and treacherous colonial administration. He was motivated in part by reading of a prophecy that the Inca would rule again with British support, and he may have been aware of the British colonial rebellion in North America and Spanish involvement in the war. Rebellion near Cusco On November 4, 1780, after a party in Tungasuca, where Túpac was cacique, Túpac and supporters seized Antonio Arriaga, the corregidor of his hometown of Tinta. They forced him to write letters to his treasurer in Tinta requesting money and arms and to other powerful individuals and kurakas ordering them to congregate in Tungasuca. On November 10, six days after his capture, Arriaga was executed in front of thousands of gathered Indians, mestizos, and Criollos (locals of mostly Spanish descent). Túpac began moving through the countryside, where he gained supporters, primarily from the Indian and mestizo classes, but also with some creoles. On November 17 he arrived at the town of Sangarará, where Spanish authorities from Cuzco and the surrounding area had assembled a force of about 604 Spaniards and 700 Indians. Túpac's ad hoc army, which had grown to several thousand, routed this force the next day, destroying the local church where a number of people had taken refuge. Túpac then turned south, against the advice of his wife and lieutenant Micaela Bastidas, who urged him to attack Cuzco before the government could mobilize. Micaela Bastidas was a pivotal force in the Túpac de Amaru rebellion and often does not get enough credit for being a superior strategist to her husband. Bastidas was known for leading an uprising in the San Felipe de Tungasucsa region. Meade, T. A. (2016). History of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. John Wiley & Sons..Indigenous communities often sided with the rebels, and local militias put up little resistance. It was not long before Túpac's forces had taken control of almost the entire southern Peruvian plateau. Spanish colonial administrator José Antonio de Areche acted in response to Túpac's uprising, moving troops from Lima and as far off as Cartagena toward the region. Tupac Amaru II in 1780 began to lead an uprising of indigenous people but the Spanish military proved to be too strong for his army of 40,000–60,000 followers. After being repelled from the capital of the Incan empire the rebels march around the country gathering forces to attempt to fight back. Troops from Lima were instrumental in helping repel Túpac's siege of Cuzco from December 28, 1780, to January 10, 1781. Following these failures, his coalition of disparate malcontents began to fall apart, with the upper-caste Criollos abandoning him first to rejoin the loyalist forces. Further defeats and Spanish offers of amnesty for rebel defectors hastened the collapse of Túpac's forces. By the end of February 1781, Spanish authorities began to gain the upper hand. A mostly indigenous loyalist army of up to between 15,000 and 17,000 troops led by Jose del Valle had the smaller rebel army surrounded by March 23. A breakout attempt on April 5 was repulsed, and Túpac and his family were betrayed and captured the next day along with battalion leader Tomasa Tito Condemayta, who was the only indigenous noble who would be executed alongside Túpac. After being tortured, on May 15 Túpac was sentenced to death, and on May 18 forced to witness the execution of his wife and one of his children before he was himself quartered. The four horses running in opposite directions failed to tear his limbs apart and so Túpac was beheaded.  The Rebellion continues  Túpac Amaru's capture and execution did not end the rebellion. In his place, his surviving relatives, namely his cousin Diego Cristóbal Túpac Amaru, continued the war, albeit using guerilla tactics, and transferred the rebellion's focal point to the Collao highlands around Lake Titicaca.The war was also continued by Túpac Katari's female commander named Bartola Sisa. Sisa led a resistance of 2,000 troops for a number of months until they were eventually brought down by the Spanish army.Meade, T. A. (2016). History of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. John Wiley & Sons. Government efforts to destroy the rebellion were frustrated by, among other things, a high desertion rate, hostile locals, scorched-earth tactics, the onset of winter, and the region's altitude (most of the troops were from the lowlands and had trouble adjusting). An army led by Diego Cristóbal occupied the strategically important city of Puno on May 7, 1781, and proceeded to use it as a base from which they launched attacks all across Upper Peru. Cristóbal would hold the town and much of the surrounding territory until mounting losses and diminishing support convinced him to accept a general amnesty from Viceroy Agustín de Jáuregui. A preliminary treaty and prisoner exchange were conducted on December 12, and Cristóbal's forces formally surrendered on January 26, 1782. Though some rebels continued to resist, the worst was over. The last organized remnants of the rebellion would be vanquished by May 1782, though sporadic violence continued for many months. Diego, his mother, and several of his allies would be arrested and executed anyway by paranoid Spanish authorities in Cuzco on July 19, 1783 on the pretext he had broken the peace accords. During the rebellion, especially after the death of Túpac Amaru II, non-Indians were systematically killed by the rebels.Meade, T. A. (2016). History of modern Latin America: 1800 to the present. John Wiley & Sons.Nicholas A. Robins, Adam Jones (2009). \\"Genocides by the Oppressed: Subaltern Genocide in Theory and Practice\\". Indiana University Press. p.1. Many of the leaders who fought in the rebellion after Túpac de Amaru's death were discovered to be women ( 32 out of the 73) and were later acknowledged by the eventual liberator of Spanish America, Simón Bolívar in his speech in 1820. Aftermath The ultimate death toll is estimated at 100,000 Indians and 10,000–40,000 non-Indians. Viceroy Jáuregui lessened mita obligations in an attempt to ameliorate some of the Indians' complaints. In 1784, his successor, Teodoro de Croix, abolished the corregidors and reorganized the colonial administration around eight intendants. In 1787, an audiencia was established in Cuzco. Areche's decrees following the execution of Túpac Amaru II included the banning of the Quechua language, the wearing of indigenous clothing, and virtually any mention or commemoration of Inca culture and history. Areche's attempts to destroy Inca culture after the execution of Túpac Amaru II were confirmed by royal decree in April 1782, however colonial authorities lacked the resources to enforce these laws and they were soon largely forgotten.

There are several theories as to how they were introduced. The most popular theory was that United States servicemen brought four cougar kittens to Western Australia during World War II; they eventually grew too big for captivity and were released—two at Fremantle and two at Bunbury. Another theory is that cougars escaped from a traveling circus that was involved in an accident between Bridgetown and Nannup around 1961. The circus theory has often been referenced to support the allegation that cougars were responsible for the deaths of around 2000 sheep in the Duranillin area in the late 1970s. The State Library of Western Australia's catalogue refers to the cougar story as the Cordering cougar, while the oral history record has a summary with the spelling Coedering Cougars.Interview with Arnold Meredith, cousin of John Meredith and farmer in the Lake Grace and Boyup Brook regions, W.A.

That year, the Agricultural Protection Board of Western Australia declared that a two-year investigation had failed to find any evidence to suggest that cougars had ever been introduced into south-west Western Australia. Nonetheless, in 1981 an A$20,000 reward was offered for the capture of a cougar in Western Australia, dead or alive. The reward was never claimed. In 2018 further sightings were reported at Chidlow in the Perth Hills, and near Morangup on Toodyay Road.

The temple is almost a kilometer away from the Nedumbassery International Airport and 500 meters away from the Kariyad Junction at NH47.  Prathistha (Origin)  The Ashtamangalya prasna conducted here has revealed that the temple is around 1600 years old. It is also understood from the prasna that ages back the temple was amidst a dense forest and presence of Devi was found here. Vilwamangalam Swamiyar had 'The Darshan of Devi' (the sight of the divine) at this place, hence the hillock where the temple is situated is also called Thiruviluam Kunnu. The presence of Lord Shiva and Sastha (Ayyappan) were also found later on and devotees started to worship them too. A Thambula Prasna was conducted in the year 2007. It has emphasized the need of Prathishta of Brahma Rakshas and Nāga Sarppam in the temple premises and it is done with thanthric rituals in October 2008  Aitihya (Legends)  There are various aitihya told about this temple. *A Brahmachari Brahman scholar in the nearby Padappa Mana, known as Sankara Sarma, was worshiping Bhadrakali in his Illam. When he wanted to go for Sanyasa, he performed prathishta of Bhadrakali in this temple and left for Kasi. The goddess has become so powerful due to the prana prathishta done by this Acharya. *Old timers have been reminiscing many legendary events about this sacred temple. One of them is about a ‘Divine light’ that was seen in the dense forest on the bank of the lake by the villagers who went to graze their cattle. The news had spread \\" Aa parambil adbhudam!!!\\". This land was later known as Akapparambu. People started worshiping the divine presence there, which later on transformed as this temple. *Once two youths were enacting as Bhadrakali and Darika. During the play both of them had the presence of Devi and Asura in them. The play went on and Devi chopped the head of Darika. His body and head had become two rocks and these rocks still exist near the temple. These are called as \\"Darika Para\\". *One more story is told about these rocks. There was a washerwoman (Velathy) who used to wash clothes regularly in the lake. One day when she had more clothes to wash, she was worried since it was about to be dusk. She took a twig and stuck it in the ground and prayed that sun should not cross the stick before she completed her washing. When Lord Soorya became still, Devi realized it. Devi cursed that woman and she along with her cloth bundle became two rocks. Hence the same rocks are also called as \\"Velathy Kallu\\". The big lake, which is at the south side of the temple, has good significance as per the aitihya and is maintained as it was.

It was located in the town of Sorø in central Zealand. After Denmark became Lutheran in 1536, the abbey was confiscated by the Crown. The abbey was turned into the Sorø Academy in 1623, an educational institution that has served as a knight academy, a venue for higher learning during the Danish Golden Age, and survives to date as a boarding school.  History  Sorø was founded by Asser Rig, the son of Skjalm Hvide, Zealand's most powerful noble in 1142. Asser established a Benedictine House just a few years prior to his death in 1151. He then lived as a monk for the last years of his life.Dansk Biografiske Lexicon It was common practice for wealthy and powerful individuals and families to found a religious house for several reasons: expiation of a sinful life, commemorative masses for family members, help for the poor, or out of religious zeal or devotion. Asser Rig's son, Absalon, became the powerful warrior bishop of Zealand and advisor to several Danish kings. In a move to reform Sorø, Bishop Absalon replaced the Benedictine monks with Cistercian monks from Esrum Abbey in 1161. One of Absalon's friends Peder Strang endowed the abbey with enough land to make it financially solvent from that time on.Sorø Kloster.www.da.wikipedia.org The Cistercians went to work on building the abbey church and monastery using a new building material, large, red bricks. The technology and style had been imported from northern Germany. From that time forward Sorø acquired property all over Denmark with an income larger than that of the royal family. The abbey church became the burial place of the noble Hvide family. Absalon was buried behind the main altar. Three Danish kings are buried there: Christopher II, Valdemar IV Atterdag, and Oluf II. Margaret I was buried there and later moved to Roskilde Cathedral. The church remains an excellent example of early brick Gothic architecture. Saxo Grammaticus wrote one of Denmark's most important historical sources Gesta Danorum at Sorø Abbey. Saxo the Tall (Danish:Lange), as he was called at Sorø, wrote a sixteen volume chronicle of Danish history for Bishop Absalon. Only later was he called \\"Grammaticus\\" as a result of his excellently written Latin. Saxo's work was completed before 1208. In 1247 much of the abbey burned down and remained in ruins for about ten years. A gift from Widow Ingeborg Strangessen allowed the rebuilding of the abbey with arched vaults. Reformation in Denmark Artifacts associated with the abbey, now in the National Museum of Denmark After Denmark officially became Lutheran in 1536, the abbey–a property of the Catholic Church–was confiscated by the Crown. After a stint as an institution for Protestant monks, the abbey was transformed into the Sorø Academy, an educational institution that has served a variety of forms, including a boarding school for noble and commoner boys during Frederick II, then turned into a knight academy by Christian IV, and became a venue for higher learning for a period during the Danish Golden Age. Since 1623, the Sorø Academy has existed as a boarding school and gymnasium on the former abbey complex.

History Mountnessing Windmill was built in 1807, replacing an earlier mill. There are records of a windmill here since 1477. The mill was working until 1924, and it worked again in 1932-33. In 1937, ownership of the mill passed from the Blencowe Estates to Mountnessing Parish Council. It was repaired as a memorial to King George VI, whose coronation was in that year. Restoration The mill was restored to working order between 1979 and 1983. A complete new roof was fitted, and the tail of the mill rebuilt. New sails were fitted, and the mill officially opened by Hervey BenhamAuthor of a book on Essex watermills on 13 November 1983. The internal machinery has been rebuilt by Peter Stenning and Richard Seago, and the mill is in full working order. Description Mountnessing Windmill is a post mill with a single-storey sixteen-sided roundhouse. The mill is winded by a tailpole. It has four spring sails. There are two pairs of millstones in the breast. Trestle and roundhouse The trestle is of oak, with the main post of elm. The crosstrees are long, by in section. The underside of the lower crosstree is above ground level. The main post is nearly in length, square at its base. The quarterbars are by in section. The mill was originally built as an open trestle mill, with a roundhouse added at a later date. Three of the crosstree/quarterbar joints have been strengthened with bolted splints. The sixteen-sided roundhouse is of brick, with a boarded roof covered in tarred felt. It had a thatched roof until 1909, when it was replaced as it was infested with rats. Body The body of the mill measures just under by in plan. The crowntree is square in section. It receives a diameter pintle projecting from the top of the main post. The side girts are by in section at the ends, thickening to at the crosstree. Sails and windshaft As originally built, the mill would have had a wooden windshaft and four common sails. The sails are spring sails. The windshaft is of cast iron, replacing the former wooden one. It was probably second-hand when fitted to the mill. It has a mounting for a tail wheel, which would have been forward-facingi.e. with the cogs facing the front of the mill when fitted; this and other evidence shows that the mill was originally built with a head and tail layout. Machinery The wooden brake wheel is of clasp arm construction. It has 77 cogs of pitch, driving a wooden wallower with 21 cogs. The cast-iron spur wheel is diameter with 66 cogs. It drives the two pairs of millstones underdrift via two diameter stone nuts with 32 cogs each. The mill was assisted in its later years by a portable steam engine, which had been built by Wedlake & Dendy Ltd., Engineers of Hornchurch and carried their works number 74.

In 1693 Samuel Pepys and Isaac Newton corresponded over a problem posed by Pepys in relation to a wager he planned to make. The problem was: :Which of the following three propositions has the greatest chance of success? ::A. Six fair dice are tossed independently and at least one “6” appears. ::B. Twelve fair dice are tossed independently and at least two “6”s appear. ::C. Eighteen fair dice are tossed independently and at least three “6”s appear. Pepys initially thought that outcome C had the highest probability, but Newton correctly concluded that outcome A actually has the highest probability. Solution The probabilities of outcomes A, B and C are: :P(A)=1-\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\right)^{6} = \\\\frac{31031}{46656} \\\\approx 0.6651\\\\, , :P(B)=1-\\\\sum_{x=0}^1\\\\binom{12}{x}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right)^x\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\right)^{12-x} = \\\\frac{1346704211}{2176782336} \\\\approx 0.6187\\\\, , :P(C)=1-\\\\sum_{x=0}^2\\\\binom{18}{x}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right)^x\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\right)^{18-x} = \\\\frac{15166600495229}{25389989167104} \\\\approx 0.5973\\\\, . These results may be obtained by applying the binomial distribution (although Newton obtained them from first principles). In general, if P(N) is the probability of throwing at least n sixes with 6n dice, then: :P(N)=1-\\\\sum_{x=0}^{n-1}\\\\binom{6n}{x}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{6}\\\\right)^x\\\\left(\\\\frac{5}{6}\\\\right)^{6n-x}\\\\, . As n grows, P(N) decreases monotonically towards an asymptotic limit of 1/2. Example in R  The solution outlined above can be implemented in R as follows: for (s in 1:3) { # looking for s = 1, 2 or 3 sixes n = 6*s # ... in n = 6, 12 or 18 dice q = pbinom(s-1, n, 1/6) # q = Prob( ~~Newton's explanation Although Newton correctly calculated the odds of each bet, he provided a separate intuitive explanation to Pepys. He imagined that B and C toss their dice in groups of six, and said that A was most favorable because it required a 6 in only one toss, while B and C required a 6 in each of their tosses. This explanation assumes that a group does not produce more than one 6, so it does not actually correspond to the original problem. Generalizations A natural generalization of the problem is to consider n non-necessarily fair dice, with p the probability that each die will select the 6 face when thrown (notice that actually the number of faces of the dice and which face should be selected are irrelevant). If r is the total number of dice selecting the 6 face, then P(r \\\\ge k ; n, p) is the probability of having at least k correct selections when throwing exactly n dice. Then the original Newton–Pepys problem can be generalized as follows: Let u_1, u_2 be natural positive numbers s.t. u_1 \\\\le u_2. Is then P(r \\\\ge u_1 k ; u_1 n, p) not smaller than P(r \\\\ge u_2 k ; u_2 n, p) for all n, p, k?

As noticed in Rubin and Evans (1961), there are no uniform answers to the generalized Newton–Pepys problem since answers depend on k, n and p. There are nonetheless some variations of the previous questions that admit uniform answers: (from Chaundy and Bullard (1960)):Chaundy, T.W., Bullard, J.E., 1960. \\"John Smith’s Problem.\\" The Mathematical Gazette 44, 253-260.

If k, n_1, n_2 are positive natural numbers, and n_1 < n_2, then P(r \\\\ge k ; k n_1, \\\\frac{1}{n_1}) > P(r \\\\ge k ; k n_2, \\\\frac{1}{n_2}). (from Varagnolo, Pillonetto and Schenato (2013)):D.

One famous fact about the hotel is that it was the home (off and on) of famous Alaskan artist Sydney Laurence; however, given his economic situation, he was unable to pay his bill in cash so instead traded Schmidt paintings for his room. To this day, the Schmidt family has one of the largest private collections of his work. The hotel was the place of Leopold's death on September 24, 1914. The hotel's name was soon changed to the Hotel Leopold as a token of appreciation by the hotel's investors. When Schmidt originally purchased the hotel, it held only 93 rooms.The Leopold - Independent and Assisted Retirement Living In the 1980s, The Leopold became a retirement living community and underwent a significant renovation.

ADF&G;'s mission is to protect, maintain, and improve the fish, game, and aquatic plant resources of the state, and manage their use and development in the best interest of the economy and the well-being of the people of the state, consistent with the sustained yield principle.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=about.mission ADF&G; manages approximately 750 active fisheries, 26 game management units, and 32 special areas. From resource policy to public education, the department considers public involvement essential to its mission and goals.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=about.agency The department is committed to working with tribes in Alaska and with a diverse group of State and Federal agencies.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=about.partners The department works cooperatively with various universities and nongovernmental organizations in formal and informal partnership arrangements, and assists local research or baseline environmental monitoring through citizen science programs. History In 1949, the Territorial Legislature created the Alaska Territorial Fishery Service in an attempt to influence federal management practices that had decimated salmon populations in Alaska. The Territorial Fishery Service had no authority, but commented on federal regulations, conducted research, and tried to influence federal managers. In 1955, delegates to the Alaska Constitutional Convention gathered in Fairbanks to draft the Alaska State Constitution. Vincent Ostrom, at the time a University of Oregon assistant professor of political science, assisted delegates in drafting a Natural Resources article. \\"Although several state constitutions touch on the subject of natural resource use, the Constitution of the State of Alaska contains one of the most comprehensive approaches to public and private resource use of any founding document... Two main principles ultimately guided the framers' design: beneficial use and sustainability. Ostrom offered the delegates several other concepts...including: common use, concurrent use, prior appropriation doctrine, and a vital idea for communities existing in an arid ecosystem, 'private ways of necessity.'\\". Key provisions of the constitution's Natural Resources article include: * §3. Common Use — Wherever occurring in their natural state, fish, wildlife, and waters are reserved to the people for common use. * §4. Sustained Yield — Fish, forests, wildlife, grasslands, and all other replenishable resources belong to the State shall be utilized, developed, and maintained on the sustained yield principle, subject to preferences among beneficial uses. * §15. No Exclusive Right of Fishery [as amended in 1972 to allow limited entry] — No exclusive right or special privilege of fishery shall be created or authorized in the natural waters of the State. This section does not restrict the power of the State to limit entry into any fishery for purposes of resource conservation, to prevent economic distress among fishermen and those dependent upon them for a livelihood and to promote the efficient development of aquaculture in the state. In 1957, in anticipation of statehood, the Territorial legislature expanded the Alaska Fishery Service and renamed it the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. C.L. \\"Andy\\" Anderson had been director of the Territorial Fishery Service since 1949 and continued as director for the new organization. Andy hired Jim Brooks to organize the Game Division, Walter Kirkness to organize the Division of Commercial Fisheries and Ed Marvich to develop a Sport Fish Division. These four men began to hire staff in 1958 and decide how the department would be organized. On January 3, 1959, Alaska became a state. In 1959, the first state legislature established the Department of Fish and Game. However, full authority could not be granted until January 1, 1960, when the regulations and statutes were in place. Governor William Egan named C.L. \\"Andy\\" Anderson as the first Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Alaska Statute 16.05.020 stated the commissioner shall: (1) supervise and control the department and may employ division heads, enforcement agents, and the technical, clerical and other assistants necessary for the general administration of the department; (2) manage, protect, maintain, improve, and extend the fish, game and aquatic plant resources of the state in the interests of the economy and general well-being of the state; and (3) have necessary power to accomplish the foregoing including, but not limited to, the power to delegate authority to subordinate officers and employees of the department.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=about.history  Alaska Regulatory Process  The fish and wildlife regulatory process in Alaska is unusually transparent. Regulatory responsibilities rest primarily with Alaska's citizens rather than the Department of Fish and Game. Except for aquatic farming, the ADF&G; commissioner does not have the authority to regulate fish and wildlife.Alaska Statutes §16.05.050. Powers and duties of commissioner Instead, the department administers regulations adopted by the Alaska Boards of Fisheries and Game, as well as statutes adopted by the Alaska Legislature. Although the commissioner does have the authority to appoint peace officers for the purpose of enforcing fish and game regulations,Alaska Statutes §16.05.150. Enforcement authority enforcement responsibilities rest primarily with the Division of Alaska Wildlife Troopers in the Alaska Department of Public Safety.https://dps.alaska.gov/awt/home Given many competing uses of fish and wildlife in Alaska and the public regulatory process, fish and wildlife management decisions are often controversial. Most uses of fish and wildlife in Alaska are regulated by two citizen boards, the Alaska Board of Fisheries and the Alaska Board of Game. Each board has seven members appointed by the governor and confirmed by a joint session of the state legislature.Alaska Statutes § 16.05.221. Boards of fisheries and game The boards establish seasons, bag limits, methods and means, and other regulations on taking and uses of fish and wildlife. The boards also allocate resources among various user groups: commercial, recreational, subsistence, and personal use, either directly through “amount necessary for subsistence” determinations or indirectly through season, bag limit, or methods and means regulations. The Boards meet on a regular schedule to consider proposals to change administrative regulations governing hunting and fishing.Alaska Statutes § 16.05.251. Regulations of the Board of FisheriesAlaska Statutes § 16.05.255. Regulations of the Board of Game; management requirements These public meetings include reports from Department of Fish and Game staff, testimony from the public, and open deliberation by the members of the board leading to votes on whether or not to adopt regulatory proposals. The Department of Fish and Game submits proposals to the boards to change regulations, as do citizen advisory committees (below) and members of the public. Different groups of users attempt to influence resource management by submitting proposals, writing comments, and offering public testimony to the boards. The boards typically review and act on hundreds of regulatory proposals annually. The boards are advised by 84 local citizen advisory committees across the state.Alaska Statutes § 16.05.260. Advisory committees Advisory committees submit proposals for regulatory changes, provide written and oral comments on regulatory proposals, and work with the boards during scheduled board meetings. Advisory committees meetings are always open to the public and are generally attended by department staff, representatives of other agencies, and members of the public. Advisory committees are intended to provide a local forum on fish and wildlife issues, and to provide policy recommendations to the boards. Citizens wishing to participate in the regulatory process can contact the Boards Support Section of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. A number of important species and uses of fish and wildlife in Alaska are not managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. These include marine mammals (see MMPA), fish in federally managed waters (see NPFMC), and subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on federal public lands (see Federal Subsistence Board).  Organizational Structure  The Alaska Department of Fish and Game includes four divisions, three sections , and two associated entities. These include: * Office of the Commissioner. Establishes policy and coordinates agency strategy for protection, management, conservation, and restoration of Alaska’s fish and wildlife. Provides executive level oversight of department activities and services. Serves as liaisons with the governor’s office, legislature, congressional offices, other government agencies, Alaska Native tribes and organizations, and Alaska’s fish and wildlife resource stakeholder groups. * Division of Administrative Services. Provides administrative support to the full range of programs and projects conducted by the Department of Fish and Game. Administers fish and game licensing program. * Division of Commercial Fisheries. Manages commercial, subsistence, and personal use fisheries within the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska, as well as some commercial fisheries occurring in the Exclusive Economic Zone authority delegated by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. Permits and oversees the state's non-profit salmon hatchery and the aquatic shellfish farming programs. Operates three scientific laboratories: a fish genetics laboratory, a fish pathology laboratory, and a laboratory for reading coded wire tags, otoliths, and determining the age of fish. The largest division within the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. * Division of Sport Fish. Manages recreational uses and some personal use fisheries of wild fish stocks (including shellfish) within State of Alaska waters. Diversifies and enhances recreational fishing opportunities via supplemental stocking of hatchery-reared fish. Operates two fish hatcheries located in Anchorage and Fairbanks. Oversees the state’s Fish Resource Permit program. *Division of Wildlife Conservation. Manages harvests of wildlife in Alaska, except marine mammals and wildlife taken for subsistence on federal public lands. Maintains and enhances opportunities to hunt, trap, and view wildlife. Provides opportunities for Alaskans to gain knowledge of and appreciation for Alaska's wildlife. Supports research on species with conservation concerns. Recommends actions to prevent species from becoming listed as Federally Threatened or Endangered. Administers certification courses required to hunt in many parts of Alaska and other jurisdictions throughout North America (e.g. hunter education, bowhunter education, muzzleloader education). * Subsistence Section. Gathers information on all aspects of the role of subsistence hunting and fishing in the lives of the residents of the state. Quantifies amount, nutritional value, and extent of dependence on food acquired through subsistence hunting and fishing. Assists the boards in determining customary and traditional uses of fish and game. Evaluates impact of state and federal laws and regulations on subsistence hunting and fishing. Makes recommendations to the boards regarding the adoption, amendment, and repeal of regulations affecting subsistence hunting. *Habitat Section. Protects Alaska's valuable fish and wildlife resources and their habitats. Reviews applications and issues permits for activities in fish-bearing waters and legislatively designated Special areas. Provides expertise to protect important fish and wildlife habitat. Monitors authorized projects and conducts compliance actions. Manages Alaska’s Special Areas in accordance with legislative guidelines; prepares and updates management plans for these areas. Reviews proposed timber harvest activities; conduct field inspections; works cooperatively with timber operators and other governmental agencies. Reviews development projects (e.g., oil and gas, hard rock mining, hydroelectric) authorized under other agencies’ authorities. Maintains the “Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing, or Migration of Anadromous Fishes.” * Boards Support Section. Facilitates the public process for the state’s regulatory systems relating to fish and wildlife resources. Ensures the public is provided an opportunity to participate in that process. Provides the administrative, technical, and logistical support for the Boards of Fisheries and Game and local fish and game advisory committees. * Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council. Formed to oversee restoration of ecosystems injured by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill in 1989, through the use of the $900 million civil settlement. Consists of three state and three federal trustees (or their designees). Advised by members of the public and by members of the scientific community. * Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission. Controls entry into Alaska's commercial fisheries to promote conservation of Alaska's fishery resources and economic health of commercial fishing. Issues and transfers annual commercial fishing permits and vessel licenses. Reports on the economics and stability of commercial fisheries.

Gameplay  Combat Arms gameplay is similar to commercial games such as Mission Against Terror, CrossFire, Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon 2 and Call of Duty. The game offers many different modes of play, including One Man Army, Elimination, Capture The Flag. During the 2009 winter season of the game, a special mode known as Snowball Fight was introduced, but was later removed. Combat Arms uses a player ranking system based on total experience, using common military ranks that players can obtain. Completing objectives, killing other players, and leveling up one's rank gives the player money in the form of Gear Points (GP), which can be used to purchase new equipment. Equipment includes weaponry, weapon attachments, and accessories for one's character. Players can also purchase equipment from the Black Market that is bought with real-world money. Primarily, the Black Market equipment is cosmetically different from regular shop items and have no rank or level requirement that many of the free items require. In addition, some items may only be obtained through the Black Market. Items purchased have an expiry date, though some can be purchased for a permanent duration, after which the gear is deleted from the player's inventory. The game boasts customizability that includes female player models.  Development  Combat Arms closed beta started on May 30, 2008, exclusively through FilePlanet and ran until June 6.

He was also assistant astronomer and first assistant surveyor of the parallel between the states of Iowa and Minnesota, and resident surveyor and engineer for the construction of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, Virginia. In 1854 Smith was assistant engineer on the Pacific Railroad surveys and explorations along the southern route of a proposed transcontinental railway route under U.S. Engineer lieutenants Williamson and Parke. Smith moved to Washington Territory in 1855 where he supervised the building of various lighthouses along the Pacific coast and Strait of Juan de Fuca. This work was accomplished, in his own words, \\"with considerably difficulty and peril, journeys to and from the works being made either in small rowboats or Indian canoes through water that were of a very treacherous character and often with only Indians for crew\\". In 1858, Smith was appointed Lighthouse Agent for Washington Territory. In 1859 he surveyed the Puget Sound Guide Meridian from the area just north of Seattle to within feet of the international boundary with British Columbia. Smith was appointed chief registrar of the General Land Office in Seattle in 1860 and was an aide- de-camp to Governor Isaac Stevens. American Civil War During the American Civil War, when the Union Army invaded his home state, Smith had to flee north to British Columbia because of his well-known Southern sympathies. He returned to Virginia in 1862 by way of steamer to Baltimore, Maryland, and then on to Richmond. Smith enlisted in the Confederate States Army and was appointed Captain in the Engineer Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia in charge of the Confederate pontoon service. He was instrumental in the defense of Petersburg and Richmond during the Siege of Petersburg, and was present at the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House. Smith returned home with \\"an old gray uniform, much tattered and worn, a good horse and a large amount of experience.\\" Later career After the war, Smith went to Mexico where he served as district engineer on the Imperial Mexican Railroad from Veracruz to Mexico City. He returned to the Pacific Coast in 1869 and worked as surveyor and engineer on various railroad surveys in California, Oregon and the Northern Pacific Railroad in Washington. He built the canals and locks around Willamette Falls in Oregon City in 1871–72. In December 1873, Smith platted gas and water lines for the city of Tacoma, Washington. He then worked in British Columbia in the employ of the Dominion Government where he conducted a survey of the Fraser River from Soda Creek to Lytton to examine the feasibility of steamship travel. From 1876 to 1878 he served on the Board of Railroad Commissioners for the State of California, and was appointed chief engineer of the Sacramento River Drainage Commission. In 1880 he served as chief engineer of the Board of State Harbor Commissioners of California. Smith then returned to Washington in the employ of the Northern Pacific Railroad and was put in charge of surveys through the Cascade Range to find the most practical route across to Tacoma. The route adopted was through \\"Stampede Pass\\", one of the lines Smith surveyed and mapped. \\"Father\\" of Portland Oregon's water system Grave of Isaac Williams Smith From 1885 to 1897 Smith was Chief Engineer for the City of Portland, Oregon, Water Works. In January, 1886, at the request of the Portland Water Committee, Isaac Smith led a survey to discover a new water source for Portland. He designed and supervised the building of the pipeline from the newly surveyed Bull Run Reservoir to Portland, from which the city still gets its drinking water. For several months the survey party fought through country described by another member of the survey team as \\"rugged wilderness, unsurveyed and unknown. The only trails are those of elk, deer, etc. There is not a trace of civilization in any direction.\\" Death \\"The Colonel\\", as he was called, was extremely dedicated to his work. He took to his bed on Christmas Day 1896 with pneumonia. Over the next three days he suffered bouts of chills and fever. His last words before death were, \\"How is the wingdam in the Sandy River getting along? I hope the cost of it will not exceed the estimate of $600. I would not like to have the cost exceed the estimate.\\" Isaac Williams Smith never married and died of pneumonia in Portland on January 1, 1897. His obituary in The Oregonian called this devotion to duty his \\"sterling and unapproachable integrity…his great but unostentatious love for all created things.\\" It went on to state that Isaac Smith was \\"one of nature's noblemen, a man of lofty nature, who could not stoop to give place in his large and generous heart to anything that partook of the small and petty in act or sentiment. His life was colored strongly by his sense of duty, his sterling and unapproachable integrity…\\" Smith is buried in a very plain grave in section three of River View Cemetery, in the Teal family plot. Legacy Camp No. 458 (established 2003) of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Portland, Oregon, is named after him.

About JIM, JIM.be, 05/31/08 Its name is a backronym for \\"Jong, Interactief en Meer\\" (English: Young, Interactive and More). During its first years, the channel mainly broadcast music videos. They have since started mixing this with programs such as Brainiac and Snoop Dogg's Father Hood. The channel stopped broadcasting on December 16, 2015.  History  The cradle of JIMtv were Jo Nachtergaele, Michael Dujardin, Peter Hoogland, Frank Molnar, Serge Jespers and Inge Tossyn. They were responsible for the content, the channel look and positioning of JIMtv. The first broadcast on April 2, 2001 started with \\"God Is A DJ\\" by Faithless followed by an introductory program in which all people and behind the scenes themselves were submitted. On April 2, 2006, the channel celebrated its fifth anniversary. Nowadays the channel is just called JIM. Originally, the letter combination 'JIM' stood for \\"Jong, Interactief en Meer\\" (English: Young, Interactive and More). The suffix 'TV' was omitted because VMMa (later called Medialaan from 2014-2018, now DPG Media) initially also wanted to set up a radio station called JIMfm, but those plans were abandoned. In November 2001 VMMa launched still a radio station: Q-music. On September 15, 2015 Medialaan announced that JIM would cease broadcasting on December 16, 2015. The vacant channel is filled by a new children's channel Kadet from December 19, 2015, which focuses primarily on boys between 8 and 12 years old.  VJs  In 2015 Niko Van Driessche, Britt Valkenborghs, Vincent Banic, Elisa Guarraci and Jolien De Greef were the VJs of service.

Livestream  Since the logo of JIM and the full range of programs was changed on October 11, 2010, one can now watch JIM live via JIM website.  Radio station  Originally, the VMMa was planning on launching a youth radio station called JIMfm as a complement to JIMtv. These plans were later dropped.

It was built in 1935 in the zig-zag Art Deco style and was the home for many Hollywood celebrities, including James Cagney, Mickey Rooney and Montgomery Clift. It was also Ronald Reagan’s first home when he moved to Hollywood in 1937. In 1985, the building was converted to a low-income housing project for senior citizens. Early years The building was built in 1935 with 95 units at a cost of $1 million. Set on a hill overlooking the city, the Montecito is the highest building in Hollywood. It has a private swimming pool, two subterranean garages and a parking lot. The building is a classic Art Deco design with Mayan influences and windows arranged in vertical blinds. In 1946, it was sold for $600,000. In 1954, it was sold again, this time by Isadore and Libby Teacher to Howard Fox and Harry Wyatt. Home for Ronald Reagan and other actors The Montecito was once frequented by movie stars, especially New York based actors while working in Hollywood. It was Ronald Reagan’s first residence when he moved to Hollywood; Reagan lived at the Montecito from June 1937 to late 1938. Reagan was said to have been roommates at the Montecito with Mickey Rooney. Other celebrities who have lived at the Montecito include James Cagney, George C. Scott, Montgomery Clift, Geraldine Page, Don Johnson, Sal Mineo, and Ben Vereen. Renovation and conversion to senior housing Front view of Montecito Apts. In 1970, rents ranged from $180 to $400 for furnished apartments. In 1984, the owners obtained grants and loans from the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency (“CRA”) and HUD to rehabilitate the building and convert it into 180 apartments for low income senior citizens. In 1988, the Los Angeles Conservancy presented an award to the Montecito for the redevelopment project. In 1995, the owners defaulted on loans, and Bank of America foreclosed on the building. The foreclosure triggered CRA losses that amount to $8.2 million. Historic designation In 1985, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Montecito has been described as “one of the finest examples of the Art Deco style, with Mayan influence detailing.” It is also significant for its architectural quality and integrity and as the finest extant work of architect Marcus P. Miller.

An architect by profession, he graduated from Sri Ara Schools, Malaysia. Biography Birth Ali was born on September 11, 1977. According to sources, there was no electricity in the entire city of Lahore that night; as such, Ali was born with lanterns placed in the maternity ward. Childhood Ali comes from a family involved with showbiz. His cousin, Bilal Maqsood, son of veteran comedian and writer Anwer Maqsood, was a frequent visitor at the residential apartment complex where Ali resided for most of his childhood and teen years. Ali was famed for having the largest collection of music cassettes in the entire neighborhood. He was strumming the guitar very early on in his life. Many joked that Ali was taking after Bilal, the latter being a successful guitar lead for the popular band Strings and a student at Indus Valley School of Art in the 1990s. Ganda Banda and the 3 Dead Cats 'Ganda Banda & the 3 Dead Cats' was formed while studying in Indus. Ali along with his friends Babar Sheikh, Ahmed and Rizwan started performing in local events and restaurants. They became popular in the underground circuit with more than 100 shows to their record. The Band recorded a rough-cut live studio version in Sonic Studios Karachi. The album was titled 'Live! 2.5 km from the Tower'. It was later released online in 2006 on the website Raw.com.pk The band disbanded in 2004 with bitter creative indifferences, vowed never to get back again. Their departure was marked by a farewell video 'Tu Na Ho Meray Paas' directed by Umair Tareen, of Razam fame. According to Babar Sheikh, ex-band member, Ali was always the main brain of Ganda Banda & The 3D Cats. Songs like 'Tu Na Ho Meray Pass' and 'Dhoondha Taaron Mein' that have achieved \\"cult\\" status today were all Ali's creations. Ali Alam and his solo years After Ganda Banda, Ali tried to go solo by recording 'Raat Jaagi' in Mekaal Hasan's Digital Fidelity Studios in Lahore. The track also featured Gumby on drums. The track was released online and became popular through many music websites. A low- budget video of the track was shot & directed by Bilal Maqsood. The video was highly successful and went to no.6 on the MTV Indian charts on Indus Music. To make ends meet, Ali recorded 'Kachwa Bachao' for an animal foundation. It got popular among children, only those who appeared in the video. Ali Alam and his A.D.P. years In 2007, Ali started performing alongside the 'Aunty Disco Project' to make a comeback.

Freepatentsonline.com (2008-01-17). Retrieved on 2013-04-19. PEM-MEA Transport of Gases, p+ and e- in PEMFC The PEM is sandwiched between two electrodes which have the catalyst embedded in them. The electrodes are electrically insulated from each other by the PEM. These two electrodes make up the anode and cathode respectively. The PEM is a fluoropolymer (PFSA) proton permeable but electrical insulator barrier. This barrier allows the transport of the protons from the anode to the cathode through the membrane but forces the electrons to travel around a conductive path to the cathode. The most commonly used Nafion PEMs are Nafion XL, 112, 115, 117, and 1110. The electrodes are heat pressed onto the PEM. Commonly used materials for these electrodes are carbon cloth or carbon fiber papers. NuVant produces a carbon cloth called ELAT which maximizes gas transport to the PEM as well as moves water vapor away from the PEM. Imbedding ELAT with noble metal catalyst allows this carbon cloth to also act as the electrode. Many other different methods and procedures also exist for the production of MEAs which are quite similar between fuel cells and electrolyzers. Platinum is one of the most commonly used catalysts, however other platinum group metals are also used. Ruthenium and platinum are often used together, if carbon monoxide (CO) is a product of the electro-chemical reaction as CO poisons the PEM and impacts the efficiency of the fuel cell. Due to the high cost of these and other similar materials, research is being undertaken to develop catalysts that use lower cost materials as the high costs are still a hindering factor in the widespread economical acceptance of fuel cell technology. Current service life is 7,300 hours under cycling conditions, while at the same time reducing platinum group metal loading to 0.2 mg/cm2.Fuel Cell School Buses: Report to Congress. US Department of Energy, December 2008, p. 9. Production At this time most companies manufacturing MEAs specialize solely in high volume production, such as W. L. Gore & Associates, Johnson Matthey, 3M, WUTenergy and Ion Power. However, there are many companies which produce custom or low quantity MEAs, allowing different shapes, catalysts or membranes to be evaluated as well, which include FuelCellStore, FuelCellsEtc, HIAT gGmbH, Ion Power and many others.

History Filmnet was founded by the Swedish company Esselte Video and Dutch film producer Rob Houwer. They formed a partnership with ATN, a joint venture of the Dutch magazine publisher VNU and the European film distribution company United International Pictures and the channel was launched across Scandinavia and the Benelux countries on 29 March 1985. Filmnet transmitted from the ECS-1 satellite, the same one used by cable operators. Filmnet failed to make a profit and was sold to NetHold, a joint venture of MultiChoice and Richemont. The channels were sold to the French Canal+ Group on 1 August 1997. The deal didn't include the Greek channels, who continued using the FilmNet name until 2008. Although the brand no longer exists, most of its subsidiaries in the different countries live on in some way: *Scandinavia: The channel had 3 timeslots: Morning Club for morning programs, Royal Club for noon and afternoon programs and Night Club for night and after-midnight programs. As it was increasing other content except for films, like sports, entertainment, music and others the channel was renamed FilmNet Plus. To create a TV channel which would fit to film lovers, a second FilmNet channel called The Complete Movie Channel: FilmNet was launched on most cable networks and it featured only movies. Later, the channels were renamed FilmNet 1 and FilmNet 2. The channels were renamed Canal+ and Canal+ Gul in September 1, 1997. Canal+ sold the company to Nordic Capital and Baker Capital in 2003 and the company was renamed C More Entertainment (although still using the Canal+ name in marketing until 2012). They went on to sell to the SBS Broadcasting Group in 2005, who in turn was merged with ProSiebenSat.1 Media in 2007. In 2008, a deal was entered to sell the company to the Swedish TV4 Group. In October 2012, C More launched subscription online streaming service under the Filmnet name, which was moved to main C More websites on 30 June 2015. *Netherlands: Filmnet was rebranded as Canal+ in 1997.Fransen gaan Nederlanders vermaken, Trouw, Dorien Pels, 26 July 1997 Canal+ sold the channels in 2005 to Liberty Global and renamed to Sport1 and Film1 in February 2006.Canal+ wordt Sport1 en Film1 Sport1 changed its name to Ziggo Sport Totaal in November 2015.Sport1 heet vanaf 12 November Ziggo Sport Totaal Film1 was sold to Sony Pictures Television in 2015.SONY PICTURES TELEVISION CLOSES FILM1 DEAL sonypicturestelevision.com, Retrieved on July 26, 2015 *Belgium: The Belgian subsidiary was one of the most successful: as from mid 1988 it was profitable; early 1995 it had 186.000 subscribers.

Religious syncretism Rajasthan has more popular Hindu saints, many from the Bhakti era. Rajasthani saints hail from all castes; Maharshi Naval Ram and Umaid Ram Maharaj were Bhangis, Karta Ram Maharaj was a Shudra, Sundardasa was a Vaish, and Meerabai and Ramdeoji were Rajputs. The backward caste Nayaks serve as the narrators or the devotional music (or \\"bhajan\\") for the Baba Ramdevji sect. The most popular Hindu deities are Surya, Krishna and Rama. Modern-day popular saints from Rajasthan have been Paramyogeshwar Sri Devpuriji of Kriya Yoga and Swami Satyananda the master of Kriya Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Mantra Yoga and Laya yoga. Rajasthan had a massive movement to unite the Hindus and Muslims to worship God together. SAint Baba Ramdevji was adored by Muslims, equally that he was to Hindus. Mostly Rajasthani people speak the Marwari language. Saint Dadu Dayal was a popular figure who came from Gujarat to Rajasthan to preach the unity of Ram and Allah. Sant Rajjab was a saint born in Rajasthan who became a disciple of Dadu Dayal and spread the philosophy of unity amongst Hindu and Muslim worshipers of God. Saint Kabir was another popular figure noted for bringing the Hindu and Muslim communities together, and stressing that God may have many forms (e.g. in the form of Rama or Allah.)

Its aim is to support Artists working in the medium of glass and to promote the development of Glass art, both Nationally and Internationally, while forging links within the glass community. Background Founded in 1997, by Peter Layton of the London Glassblowing Studio, together with Colin Reid and Tessa Clegg, the Contemporary Glass Society rose from the ashes of British Artists in Glass, an informal association of individual Glass Artists founded in 1976 by a group of artists including the glass sculptor David Reekie.See David Reekie page Essentially an informal Craft Guild, British Artists in Glass was composed almost entirely of artists working in blown and kiln glass. Since its demise in 1992, the representation of British Glass had been left to individual efforts. There was no overall organisation. Through discussions with other like-minded people, Peter Layton identified the need for a unified, National Society, to represent the interests of enthusiasts of glass more generally, within the national and international community. The Contemporary Glass Society was the result. The first conference was held at the University of Wolverhampton with over 100 attendees and a line-up of speakers including, Keith Cummings, Diana Hobson and Alison Kinnard. Present work In 2005 CGS became a non-profit making limited company. An Arts Council England funded organisation, CGS has a growing membership that now includes not simply Glass artists, but makers, collectors, students, trade and education establishments. CGS is run by a voluntary committee made up mostly of makers and its administrator, Pam Reekie. It publishes a quarterly newsletter Glass Network, designed by the artist Roger Kohn and runs its own website and produces material showcasing the work of glass artists throughout the UK.Contemporary Glass Society Journal The society organises a number of public activities including; international conferences and one-day symposiums as well as practical workshops covering a range of techniques, such as Glass blowing, hot glass, architectural glass, glass engraving and glass casting and kiln work.

Defense of San Juan Area where the \\"Battle of San Juan of 1625\\" took place The Netherlands was a world military and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean Sea. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Balduino Enrico (also known as Boudewijn Hendricksz or Bowdoin Henrick) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men and sent a message to the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haro, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haro refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.Historias de Puerto Rico by Paul G. Miller, (1947) pgs. 221–237.

He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On September 25 Enrico attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and La Fortaleza (the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amezqueta and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Enrico with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amezqueta, who is considered as one of the best swordsman of the island.\\"Don Juan de Haro y los holandeses\\" (24 de Septiembre de 1625) \\"El Morro, testigo inconquistable; Colección Espalda\\"; Author: José Morales-Dorta; Publisher: Isla Negra Editores, 2006; pages 60-73; , 9781932271799 The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by the Puerto Ricans who defeated the Dutch in the land battle. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amezqueta and Andre Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard. They drove Enrico and his men from their trenches and into the ocean in their haste to reach their ships.Middeldyk, R.A. Van Identifier: etext12272 The History of Puerto Rico From the Spanish Discovery to the American Occupation Insight Guides Puerto Rico; By Barbara Balletto; Pg. 32; Published 2003 Langenscheidt Publishing Group; Enrico, upon his retreat, would leave behind him one of his largest ships stranded and over 400 of his men dead. He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of Aguada. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico. Later years Monument at El Morro honoring Capt. Juan de Amezqueta Captain Amezqueta received 1,000 ducats (gold coins), and in 1632 was appointed Governor of Cuba and given command of the Spanish forces in Santiago de Cuba. On March 15, 1635, the Dutch forces had an invasion of Cuba in mind. The Dutch naval forces sent crew members on a reconnaissance mission disguised as Spanish soldiers ashore. One of Amezqueta's men became suspicious and a small skirmish ensued. Under Amezqueta's command, 14 men manned their guns and attacked the Dutch crew members who in turn withdraw and fled.\\"Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the New World, 1492 to the Present\\"; by David F. Marley, David F. Marley; Publisher: ABC-CLIO, Incorporated; ; Amezqueta renounced his position in 1636 and returned to Puerto Rico. Honors The Spanish government honored the defenders of San Juan with a funerary monument on the grounds of El Morro. The monument was dedicated to Amezqueta in 1925, on the 300th anniversary of the defeat of the Dutch. In the 1940s, the United States inaugurated Fort Amezquita, in Isla de Cabras. During World War II, this fort served as a military reservation, or a \\"concrete gun battery\\" for the US Army.Forts Juan de Amezqueta's descendant, Jose Andino y Amezquita, would in the future become the first Puerto Rican journalist.

In that situation, the firm will experience a higher loss when it produces, compared to not producing at all. Technically, shutdown occurs if average revenue is below average variable cost at the profit-maximizing positive level of output. Producing anything would not generate enough revenue to offset the associated variable costs; producing some output would add further costs in excess of revenues to the costs inevitably being incurred (the fixed costs). By not producing, the firm loses only the fixed costs. Explanation The goal of a firm is to maximize profits or minimize losses. The firm can achieve this goal by following two rules. First, the firm should operate, if at all, at the level of output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Second, the firm should shut down rather than operate if it can reduce losses by doing so.Perloff, J. (2009) p.231. Lovell (2004) p.243. The shutdown rule perfect competitor, otherwise downward sloped). If at this output level the height of the average revenue curve (not shown; horizontal for a perfect competitor, otherwise downward sloped) is less than the height of the average variable cost curve, the firm will shut down production of the good in the short run to avoid negative profit. The optimal quantity of output for the perfect competitor is where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). In the case depicted, since at this quantity of output average revenue (AR) exceeds average variable cost (not shown, but below average total cost (ATC)), the firm in this situation does not shut down. Generally, a firm must have revenue R \\\\ge TC, total costs, in order to avoid losses. However, in the short run, all fixed costs are sunk costs. Netting out fixed costs, a firm then faces the requirement that R \\\\ge VC (total revenue equals or exceeds variable costs), in order to continue operating. Thus, a firm will find it profitable in the short run to operate so long as the market price equals or exceeds average variable cost (p ≥ AVC).Revenue R = PQ, price times quantity. Average variable cost AVC = VC/Q, variable cost divided by quantity. Thus, R ≥ VC implies p ≥ AVC. Conventionally stated, the shutdown rule is: \\"in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price equals or exceeds average variable costs.\\"Samuelson, W & Marks, S (2003) p. 227. Restated, the rule is that to produce in the short run a firm must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs.Melvin & Boyes, (2002) p. 222. The rationale for the rule is straightforward. By shutting down, a firm avoids all variable costs.Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D:(2001) p.259. However, the firm must still pay fixed costs.Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D: (2001) p.259. Because fixed costs must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shut down.This version of the rule implicitly assumes that the firm has incurred sunk costs which are being amortized and treated as fixed costs, or that fixed costs equal sunk costs. This assumption does not always hold. Sunk costs may have been incurred and paid for, or the cost of fixed inputs may be partially recoverable, through sale and salvage. If all fixed costs are recoverable, then the firm should shut down if price drops below average total costs rather than average variable costs. Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D: (2001) Thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs (VC) rather than total costs (FC (fixed costs) + VC). If the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its variable cost (R > VC) then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue which partially or entirely offsets fixed costs.Samuelson, W & Marks, S (2003) p. 296. (The size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost.Perloff, J. (2009) p.237. The same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars.) On the other hand if VC > R then the firm is not even covering its short-run production costs and it should immediately shut down. The rule is conventionally stated in terms of price (average revenue) and average variable costs. The rules are equivalent--if one divides both sides of inequality TR > VC (total revenue exceeds variable costs) by the output quantity Q one obtains P > AVC (price exceeds average variable cost). If the firm decides to operate it will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure profit maximization (or equivalently, when profit is negative, loss minimization).Samuelson, W & Marks, S (2006) p.286. Another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shut down, and select the option that produces the greater profit (positive or negative).Png, I: 1999. p. 102Landsburg, S (2002) p.193. A firm that is shut down is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs. However the firm still incurs fixed cost.Bade and Parkin, pp. 353-54. So the firm’s profit equals the negative of fixed costs or (–FC).Landsburg, S (2002) p.193 An operating firm is generating revenue, incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs. The operating firm's profit is R – VC – FC . The firm should continue to operate if R – VC – FC ≥ –FC which simplified is R ≥ VC.Png, I: (1999) p.102.Landsburg, S (2002) p.194 The difference between revenue, R, and variable costs, VC, is the contribution toward offsetting fixed costs, and any positive contribution is better than none. Thus, if R ≥ VC then the firm should operate. If R < VC the firm should shut down. Monopolist shutdown rule A monopolist should shut down when price (average revenue) is less than average variable cost for every output level;Frank, R., (2008) Mc-Graw-Hill in other words, it should shut down if the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve.Frank, R., (2008) Under these circumstances, even at the profit-maximizing level of output (where MR = MC, marginal revenue equals marginal cost) average revenue would be lower than average variable costs and the monopolist would be better off shutting down in the short run.Frank, R., (2008) (Mc-Graw-Hill) Sunk costs An implicit assumption of the above rules is that all fixed costs are sunk costs. However, there can be physical assets whose cost during production is fixed but which have a salvage value which can be obtained if there is a shutdown. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. To illustrate the new rule it is necessary to define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the average non-sunk fixed cost or ANSC = AVC + ANFC. The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average cost, produce; if the price is between minimum average cost and minimum ANSC, produce; and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down.Besanko and Braeutigam (2002) p. 310. If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.Pindyck, R & Rubinfeld, D (2001) p. 260. Short-run shutdown compared to long-run exit A decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production.Mnakiw, (2007) 296. It does not mean that the firm is going out of business (exiting the industry).Landsburg, S (2002) p.193. If market conditions improve, due to prices increasing or production costs falling, the firm can resume production. Shutting down is a short-run decision.Landsburg, S 2002.p.193. A firm that has shut down is not producing, but it still retains its capital assets; however, the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run. However, a firm will not choose to incur losses indefinitely. In the long run, the firm will have to decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere. Exit is a long-term decision. A firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises.Landsburg, S (2002). A firm that exits an industry earns no revenue but it incurs no costs, fixed or variable.Mankiw, N Principles of Microeconomics 4th ed. (Thomson 2007) p 298. The long-run decision is based on the relationship of the price P and long-run average costs LRAC.In the long run there is no distinction between average variable costs and average costs because all costs are variable. Landsburg, S (2002) p.167 If P ≥ LRAC then the firm will not exit the industry. If P < LRAC, then the firm will exit the industry. These comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long-term adjustments.As Boyes notes the long run options of a firm are not limited to exiting or remaining in the industry - the firm can \\" expand, contract, relocate, enter a new business, exit any line of business or quit doing business altogether.\\"Boyes, W. (2004) p. 105. In the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long-run marginal costs, but only if it decides to remain in the industry.Perloff, J:2008 page 266. Thus a perfectly competitive firm's long-run supply curve is the long-run marginal cost curve above the minimum point of the long-run average cost curve.Landsburg, S (2002) p. 230. Calculating the shutdown point The short run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average variable cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is TC = Q3 -5Q2 +60Q +125. Then its variable cost function is Q3 –5Q2 +60Q, and its average variable cost function is (Q3 –5Q2 +60Q)/Q= Q2 –5Q + 60. The slope of the average variable cost curve is the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q – 5. Equating this to zero to find the minimum gives Q = 2.5, at which level of output average variable cost is 53.75. Thus if the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production. The long run shutdown point for a competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average total cost curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is the same as in the above example. To find the shutdown point in the long run, first take the derivative of ATC and then set it to zero and solve for Q. After getting Q plug it into the MC to get the price.

The band consists of Ben Thornewill (vocals & piano), Tommy Siegel (vocals & guitar) and Jesse Kristin (drums). The band has been active since 2003. History In 2003, Thornewill, Siegel, and Kristin met while attending George Washington University. and formed a band called \\"The Sunday Mail\\". After two years, they decided to change their name. After they thought they had enough new material, they renamed themselves \\"Jukebox the Ghost\\". The name was a combination of words chosen democratically, with \\"jukebox\\" originating from the lyrics of a Captain Beefheart song and \\"ghost\\" as a reference to a Nabokov novel. In 2008, they released their first album, Let Live & Let Ghosts which was recorded during winter break of their senior year of college. Jukebox the Ghost recorded a cover of Ace of Base's \\"Beautiful Life\\" for Engine Room Recordings' compilation album Guilt by Association Vol. 2, which was released in November 2008. After releasing their debut album, they toured with Say Hi and Nightmare of You, among others. In 2009 they toured with Ben Folds, followed shortly by a tour with Jenny Owen Youngs in the United States. The band began recording their sophomore album \\"Everything Under the Sun\\" on September 29, 2009 at Tarquin Studios in Bridgeport, Connecticut, an indie recording studio that specializes in analog recording. In February 2010, Jukebox the Ghost toured Europe with Adam Green of The Moldy Peaches. This was followed by more touring in the United States with the bands Tally Hall and Skybox. They took another break and started playing live shows once again in late May 2010 with the band Free Energy, and once headlined as a minor band at Lollapalooza in Chicago. September 1, 2010 marked a major milestone for the band, as they appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman. Jukebox the Ghost opened for Barenaked Ladies during the fall of 2010 from October through November, and were a featured band on the Barenaked Ladies-hosted Sixthman cruise, Ships & Dip 4, in February 2011. Jukebox The Ghost also was a featured band on another Sixthman Cruise \\"Rombello\\" in September 2011, and toured with Guster soon after. The band opened for Jack's Mannequin and Motion City Soundtrack in 2012. On June 12, 2012, Jukebox the Ghost released their third album, Safe Travels. The album marked a departure from their often-fictional narratives in favor of more personal lyrics. In an interview with Jukebox the Ghost, Ben Thornewill stated that \\"this record has a lot of songs that are directly from our own life experience. Whether they are journalistically accurate or not, probably not, but they come from something in our lives, not something we’re imagining.” On May 23, 2014, they released a new single, \\"The Great Unknown\\" from their self- titled fourth record, Jukebox the Ghost which was released on October 21, 2014. On January 21, 2015, the band announced they had signed with preeminent pop alternative label Cherrytree Records. Cherrytree Records is a subsidiary of Interscope Records. Jukebox the Ghost re-released their self-titled album in February 2015, under their new label. This was quickly followed by the band's performance of \\"Postcard\\" on Conan's late night show on January 26. As of January 2016, they are no longer affiliated with Cherrytree Records. In late March 2015, the group announced a national summer tour with Ingrid Michaelson. In early April they released the music video of \\"Postcard.\\" The band also wrote a song called \\"Black Hole\\" for The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show. \\"Black Hole\\" was featured on an episode in 2015, and the entire TV series has since been added to Netflix. That year, the band began their annual \\"HalloQueen\\" shows, a series of performances around Halloween in which the band wears costumes inspired by and covers songs by Queen. What began as a pair of small shows in 2015 evolved to tours in 2018 and 2019. On March 6, 2017, after nearly three years on tour leave from recording, the group released the single, \\"Stay the Night.\\" This song was featured in the second season of Rob Schneider's Netflix Series, Real Rob. While performing in late 2017, the group announced that they had recently finished recording a new album and debuted a new song from that album, \\"Boring.\\" On January 19, 2018, the group announced the new single \\"Everybody's Lonely\\" along with a new album titled Off to the Races. The album was released on March 30, 2018. In addition, the group announced a national tour to support the album beginning in Spring 2018.

Further requirements for being shut down may include having the reactor control key be secured and having no fuel movements or control systems maintenance in progress. The shutdown margin is defined in terms of reactivity, frequently in units of delta-k/k (where k is taken to mean k-effective, the effective multiplication factor) or occasionally in dollars (the dollar is a unit equal to the change in reactivity needed to go from critical to prompt critical). Shutdown margin can refer either to the margin by which the reactor is subcritical when all control rods are inserted or to the margin by which the reactor would be shut down in the event of a scram. Hence, care must be taken to define shutdown margin in the most conservative way in the reactor's technical specifications; a typical research reactor will specify the margin when in the cold condition, without xenon. Under this specification, the shutdown margin can be simply calculated as the sum of the control rod worths minus the core excess. Minimum shutdown margin can be calculated in the same way as shutdown margin, except that the negative reactivity of the most reactive control rod and non-scramable rods is ignored. This definition allows the reactor to be designed so that it remains safely shut down even if that most reactive control rod becomes stuck out of the core.

That freedom contributes to their wide sound landscape and insures incorporation of ever changing musical influences from other styles. Albums A significant part of the OGOGO sound is use of \\"funny instruments\\" (closely related to prepared piano of John Cage) in addition to the traditional jazz lineup of guitars, saxophones, trumpets, trombones, bass and drums, as well as the theatrical outfits and invited guest artists while performing. All these aspects make the OGOGO's performances a unique experience. In 2000 the OGOGO recorded album with Ira Schulman, Ira & Igor.

She is the only member of the family whose known descendants continue down to the present day. Life Joan was Shakespeare's younger sister. She married a hatter named William Hart with whom she had four children, William (1600–1639), Mary (1603–1606), Thomas (1605–1661), and Michael (1608–1618). Little is known about Joan's husband, William, apart from the fact that he was sued for debt in 1600 and 1601. He died in April 1616, and was buried 17 April, a week before William Shakespeare died. In his will her brother left her a legacy of £20, some clothing and the right to live in the western part of the double family house on Henley Street in Stratford for a nominal yearly rent of one shilling. She continued to reside there for the remainder of her life, dying at the age of 77. Her son William never married. Her other descendants via Thomas lived in Stratford until 1806. Thomas inherited the Henley Street house known as Shakespeare's Birthplace. He had many descendants. By the 18th century Joan's descendants were identifying themselves as carrying the poet's family line. John Hart (1755–1800) was identified as \\"the 6th descendant of the poet Shakespeare\\" on his gravestone in Tewkesbury Abbey Churchyard, Gloucestershire. In literature In her essay A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf created a character, \\"Judith Shakespeare\\", supposed to be Shakespeare's sister. In fact Judith was his daughter. It is unknown whether this was a mistake or a deliberate conflation of the two women. In her story Shakespeare's sister is denied the education of her brother despite her obvious talent as a writer. When her father tries to marry her off, she runs away to join a theatre company but is ultimately rejected because of her sex. She becomes pregnant, is abandoned by her partner and commits suicide. A teenage Joan appears in Laurie Lawlor's novel The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare (2006), in which she is presented as an aspirant poet who resents the restrictions placed on her as a woman. She writes sonnets, one of which her brother plagiarises. She is in love with Richard Field, but he pursues Anne Whateley.

History In the early years of the village there was no church in Pohorelá, only a cemetery with a small wooden chapel next to it. The village was considered part of the parish of Sumiac, about 8 km to the east of the village. Records from 1643 and 1653 show that the villagers were Catholic and were continuously petitioning for their own parish. A wooden church was built in Pohorelá around 1660. It was built by local craftsmen under direction of Count Ferenc Wesselényi. Wesselenyi was the local governor (Palatine) for Hungary and resident of nearby Muran Castle. The church was dedicated to Saint Stephen I of Hungary. An attempt by the villagers in 1669 to join the parish of the village of Polomka some 15 km to the west of Pohorelá forced the issue of an independent parish for Pohorelá. With the help of contributions from the nearby village of Helpa a separate parish was declared on 26 January 1669 and the first parish priest appointed. This is also the time when the first parish registers were recorded. There has been a simple wooden parish school built next to the rectory from the time of the first wooden church in 1669. Records from 1697 show that a schoolmaster (one individual serving as both director and teacher) would be paid out of the parish income. The original parish church was destroyed by fire around 1742 along with the parish register up to that date. Construction of the current brick church began at this time and was completed in the summer of 1768. It stands on the site of the wooden church. It was built with an endowment by Earl Stephan II Koháry (1649–1731), also an occupant of Muran castle. On 4 May 1883, a great fire broke out destroying nearly all the village. The church was also damaged and was repaired in 1906. The original church was dedicated to Saint Stephen I of Hungary. In 1964 it was re-consecrated to Our Lady of Sorrows, the patron saint of Slovakia. Style and interior The church is built in a Romanesque style, with a single-nave. The church contains a picture of St Stephen painted in 1855 by the master artist Vojtech Klimkovics. There is an artistically carved neo-gothic bench of King Ferdinand Coburg in the presbytery. The altar is from the beginning of 20th century. It is decorated with statues of St Elizabeth of Hungary and of St Emeric of Hungary. The church is built with the traditional Christian nave orientation, with the main altar on the east end and the church tower on the west side. The choir contains an organ built by the Austrian firm of Gebrüder Rieger. The organ was donated around 1910 by King Ferdinand.

One of the simplest examples is \\\\cos \\\\frac \\\\pi 4=\\\\frac \\\\sqrt 2 2. A real number different from is a trigonometric number if and only if it is the real part of a root of unity (see Niven's theorem). Thus every trigonometric number is half the sum of two complex conjugate roots of unity. This implies that a trigonometric number is an algebraic number, and twice a trigonometric number is an algebraic integer. Ivan Niven gave proofs of theorems regarding these numbers.Niven, Ivan. Numbers: Rational and Irrational, 1961. Random House. New Mathematical Library, Vol. 1. .Niven, Ivan. Irrational Numbers, Carus Mathematical Monographs no. 11, 1956. Cambridge University Press (2005): . Li Zhou and Lubomir Markov recently improved and simplified Niven's proofs. Any trigonometric number can be expressed in terms of radicals. Those that can be expressed in terms of square roots are well characterized (see Trigonometric constants expressed in real radicals). To express the other ones in terms of radicals, one requires th roots of non-real complex numbers, with . An elementary proof that every trigonometric number is an algebraic number is as follows.. One starts with the statement of de Moivre's formula for the case of \\\\theta = 2\\\\pi k/n for coprime k and n: :(\\\\cos \\\\theta + i \\\\sin \\\\theta )^n =1. Expanding the left side and equating real parts gives an equation in \\\\cos \\\\theta and \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta; substituting \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta =1-\\\\cos^2 \\\\theta gives a polynomial equation having \\\\cos \\\\theta as a solution, so by definition the latter is an algebraic number. Also \\\\sin \\\\theta is algebraic since it equals the algebraic number \\\\cos(\\\\theta-\\\\pi /2). Finally, \\\\tan \\\\theta, where again \\\\theta is a rational multiple of , is algebraic as being the ratio of two algebraic numbers. In a more elementary way, this can also be seen by equating the imaginary parts of the two sides of the expansion of the de Moivre equation to each other and dividing through by \\\\cos^n \\\\theta to obtain a polynomial equation in \\\\tan \\\\theta.

She was born Ellen Kraal in the Netherlands but learned to speak English from time spent growing up in New Zealand in the 1960s, this gave her a unique and instantly recognisable accent. She joined Radio Caroline originally as the girlfriend of Peter Chicago, the transmitter engineer and occasional broadcaster, and at first she helped out with the cooking on the radio ship Mi Amigo. She was first heard on the air on 6 February 1973, making an announcement in Dutch on Norman Barrington's show, using her real name. Her first programme was on 3 March 1973, when she called herself 'Ellen the cook'. In 1974, she began working as a regular broadcaster in the 3am-6am slot, using the name 'Samantha Dubois' and later just 'Samantha'. Later in her career she also presented late night and some daytime shows. Her intervals on board dated from 6 March to 10 May 1974, from 16 December 1975 to September 1976, a short period from 24 February to 24 March 1977, and finally from 21 September to 17 October 1978. According to tabulations from the late Buster Pearson of Monitor magazine, she was on the air for a total of 792 hours. On 12 January 1977, she was put on trial and was fined by a Dutch court for her involvement with the station. Despite this, she returned to Radio Caroline in February of that year. She made her final broadcast, from the Mi Amigo, on 17 October 1978. After she left the station, she later got married and moved to New Zealand. She did, however, return to the station in 1984, from 14 September to 10 November, during which she added another 147 hours 'live on the air' from the radio ship Ross Revenge. After leaving Radio Caroline for the last time, she lived in The Hague, before returning to New Zealand to have a child named Luke on 18 September 1991, she then later died from liver cancer on 1 October 1992, and is buried at North Shore Memorial Park in Auckland. Samantha Dubois began broadcasting on Radio Caroline at a time when there were still few female broadcasters, and there is no doubt that she laid the groundwork for others to follow, such as Caroline Martin, who presented on Radio Caroline in the 1980s. She remains much admired and missed by her former colleagues and her listeners. Due to the late night/early morning timing of many of her programmes, the number of recordings of her broadcasts are limited. However, recordings have begun to emerge in the last few years.

Literally Northern Land or Section in Sanskrit, the name of Uttarakhand finds mention in the early Hindu scriptures as the combined region of Kedarkhand and Manaskhand. Uttarakhand was the ancient Puranic term for the central stretch of the Indian Himalayas. Its peaks and valleys were well known in ancient times as the abode of gods and goddesses and source of the Ganges River. Around 200 B.C Khas Aryan people entered the Himalayan range all the way from Caucasus Mountains, Unlike Vedic Aryan who took southern,western,and eastern route, Khas Aryan took whole new route of walking northern route of great Himalaya from Caucasus Mountains of Europe to North- Western Himalayas. Today, it is often called \\"the Land of the Gods\\" (Devbhumi uttrakhand) because of the presence of a multitude of Hindu pilgrimage spots. Uttarakhand is known as Devbhumi from ancient times. The Pauravas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Katyuris, Palas, the Chands, and Parmars or Panwars, Shahs and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns.Kandari, O. P., & Gusain, O. P. (Eds.). (2001). Garhwal Himalaya : Nature, Culture & Society. Srinagar, Garhwal: Transmedia. Early history Kedarnath Temple, one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites. The region was settled by the Kol people, a population speaking a language that belongs to the Munda language family. The Kol peoples were later joined by Indo-Aryan [Khas] tribes that arrived from the north by the Vedic period. At that time, present-day Uttarakhand also served as a haunt for Rishis and Sadhus. It is believed that Sage Vyasa scripted the Mahabharata here as the Pandavas are believed to have traveled and camped in the region. Among the first major dynasties of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century B.C. who practiced an early form of Shaivism. They traded salt with Western Tibet. It is evident from the Ashokan edict at Kalsi, near Dehradun in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this region. Shamanic religions are practiced by the Kol peoples and Folk Hinduism would emerge as a Hindu tradition distinct from Hindu orthodoxy. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were restored to nominal Brahmanical rule due to the travails of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains. In the fourth century, the Kunindas gave way to the Naga Dynasties. Between the 7th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty of Khas origin dominated lands of varying extent from the Katyur (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon. Other peoples of the Tibeto-Burman group known as Kiratas are thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and believed to be the ancestors to the modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Buksha, and Tharu peoples.Saklani, D.

While western Hindi is popular in most of the neighbouring hill areas, Jaunsari, a language of the Central Pahari group, is spoken by most of the people of the region.Agriculture The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 11, p. 215. United Province, 1903 By the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. From the 13th–18th century, Kumaon prospered under the Chand Rajas who had their origins in the plains of India. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed.Pande, B. D. (1993). History of Kumaun : English version of \\"Kumaun ka itihas\\". Almora, U.P., India: Shyam Prakashan : Shree Almora Book Depot. Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmar/Panwar Rajas, who along with a mass migration of Brahmins and Rajputs, also arrived from the plains.Rawat, A. S. (1989). History of Garhwal, 1358–1947: an erstwhile kingdom in the Himalayas. New Delhi: Indus Pub. Co. In 1791, the expanding Gurkha Empire of Nepal, overran Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom also fell to the Gurkhas. With the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816, a rump portion of the Garhwal Kingdom was reestablished from Tehri, and eastern British Garhwal and Kumaon ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli.  British Colonial period  IIT Roorkee was established as Thomason College of Civil Engineering in 1847. Post-independence In the post-independence period, the Tehri princely state was merged into Uttar Pradesh state, where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions.Saklani, A. (1987).

Delhi: Durga Publications. Until 1998, Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region, as various political groups including most significantly the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (Uttarakhand Revolutionary Party est. 1979), began agitating for separate statehood under its banner. Although the erstwhile hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals with diverse lingual and cultural influences due to the proximity of different neighbouring ethnic groups, the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography, economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions.Aggarwal, J. C., Agrawal, S. P., & Gupta, S. S. (Eds.). (1995). Uttarakhand: past, present, and future. New Delhi: Concept Pub. Co. These bonds formed the basis of the new political identity of Uttarakhand, which gained significant momentum in 1994, when demand for separate statehood (within the Union of India) achieved almost unanimous acceptance among the local populace as well as political parties at the national level.Kumar, P. (2000). The Uttarakhand Movement: Construction of a Regional Identity. New Delhi: Kanishka Publishers. Most notable incident during this period was the Rampur Tiraha firing case on the night of 1 October 1994, which led to public uproar and eventually to the division of the state of Uttar Pradesh in 2000.Rampur Tiraha firing The Times of India, 31 July 2003. However, the term Uttaranchal came into use when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led central and Uttar Pradesh state governments initiated a new round of state reorganization in 1998 and introduced its preferred name. Chosen for its allegedly less separatist connotations, the name change generated enormous controversy among the rank and file of the separate state activists who saw it as a political act,Negi, B. (2001). \\"Round One to the Lobbyists, Politicians and Bureaucrats.\\" Indian Express, 2 January. however they were not quite as successful as Jharkhand state that successfully thwarted a similar move to impose the name Vananchal. Nevertheless, the name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region, even while Uttaranchal was promulgated through official usage. In August 2006, India's Union Cabinet assented to the four-year-old demand of the Uttaranchal state assembly and leading members of the Uttarakhand movement to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand. Legislation to that effect was passed by the State Legislative Assembly in October 2006,UNI.

The history of the Indian state Madhya Pradesh is divided into three periods. During the ancient period, the region was dominated by the Nanda, Maurya, and Gupta Empires. The medieval period saw the rise of Rajput clans including the Paramara and Chandela clans, the latter is known for constructing the temples of Khajuraho. The Malwa Sultanate also ruled during this period. The modern period in Madhya Pradesh saw the rise of the Mughal and Maratha empires, and later, the British Empire. The British princely states of Gwalior, Indore, and Bhopal, were a part of modern Madhya Pradesh. The British rule continued until the middle of the 20th century, when India gained independence in 1947. The state of Madhya Pradesh was formed in 1956, and Chhattisgarh was carved out from the state in 2000. Ancient History Sanchi Stupa at Sanchi, Madhya Pradesh built by emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE.alt= The Bhimbetka caves show evidence of paleolithic settlements in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Stone Age tools have also been discovered at various places along the Narmada river valley. Rock shelters with cave paintings, the earliest of which can be dated to 30,000 BCE, have also been discovered at a number of places. The settlements of humans in present-day Madhya Pradesh developed primarily in the valleys of rivers such as Narmada, Chambal, and Betwa. Chalcolithic sites of the Malwa culture have been discovered at a number of places including Eran, Kayatha, Maheshwar, Nagda, and Navdatoli. During the early Vedic period, the Vindhya mountains formed the southern boundary of the Indo-Aryan territory. Rigveda, the earliest extant Sanskrit text, does not mention the Narmada river. The 4th century BCE grammarian Pāṇini mentions the Avanti janapada in central India. It mentions only one territory lying to the south of Narmada: the Ashmaka. The Buddhist text Anguttara Nikaya names the sixteen mahajanapadas, of which Avanti, Chedi and Vatsa occupied parts of Madhya Pradesh. The Mahavastu mentions another kingdom called Dasharna in the eastern Malwa region. The Pali language Buddhist works mention several important cities in central India, including Ujjeni (Ujjayani), Vedisa (Vidisha) and Mahissati (Mahishmati). According to ancient texts, Avanti was ruled successively by the Haihaya dynasty, the Vitihotra dynasty (a branch of the Haihayas) and the Pradyota dynasty. Under the Pradyotas, Avanti became a major power of the Indian subcontinent. It was later annexed by Shishunaga into the Magadha empire. The Shishunaga dynasty was overthrown by the Nandas, who were replaced by the Mauryans.  Mauryans and their successors  The Udayagiri Caves date back to the fifth century CE. The city of Ujjain arose as a major center in the second wave of Indian urbanization in the sixth century BC, and served as the chief city of the kingdom of Malwa or Avanti. Further east, the kingdom of Chedi lie in Bundelkhand. Chandragupta Maurya united northern India c. 1500 BCE, establishing the Maurya Empire (1500 to 185 BCE), which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. King Ashoka's wife was said to come from Vidisha- a town north of today's Bhopal. The Maurya Empire went into decline after the death of Ashoka, and Central India was contested among the Sakas, Kushanas, and local dynasties during the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE. Ujjain emerged as the predominant commercial center of western India from the first century BCE, located on the trade routes between the Ganges plain and India's Arabian Sea ports. It was also an important Hindu and Buddhist center. The Satavahana dynasty of the northern Deccan and the Saka dynasty of the Western Satraps fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. The south Indian king Gautamiputra Satakarni of the Satavahana dynasty inflicted a crushing defeat upon the saka rulers and conquered parts of Malwa and Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.Ramesh Chandra Majumdar. Ancient India, p. 134 Northern India was conquered by the Gupta empire in the 4th and 5th centuries, which was India's \\"classical age\\". The Parivrajaka and the Uchchhakalpa dynasties ruled as feudatories of the Guptas in Madhya Pradesh. The Vakataka dynasty were the southern neighbors of the Guptas, ruling the northern Deccan plateau from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal. These empires collapsed towards the end of the 5th century.  Middle Kingdoms and Late Medieval period (c. 230 BCE – 1526 CE)  Javari Temple at Khajuraho. The temples at Khajuraho were built by the Chandela kingdom in the 10th and 11th centuries. The attacks of the Hephthalites or White Huns brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, and India broke up into smaller states. A king Yasodharman of Malwa defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. King Harsha of Thanesar reunited northern India for a few decades before his death in 647. Malwa was ruled by the South Indian Rashtrakuta Dynasty from the late 8th century to the 10th century.Chandra Mauli Mani. A Journey through India's Past (Great Hindu Kings after Harshavardhana), p. 13 The Medieval period saw the rise of the Rajput clans, including the Paramaras of Malwa and the Chandelas of Bundelkhand.  Rajput clans  = Paramaras = The left The Paramaras ruled between the 9th and 14th centuries CE. The Paramara king Bhoja (c. 1010–1060) was a brilliant polymath and prolific writer. He is famous for his patronage of the arts, and for commissioning inscriptions found all over the region. The last known Paramara king, was defeated and killed by the forces of Alauddin Khalji of Delhi in 1305 CE. = Chandelas = The Gwalior Fort at Gwalior was expanded by several dynasties during the medieval and early modern periods. The Chandelas ruled between the 9th and the 13th centuries CE. They created the temple city of Khajuraho between c. 950 and c. 1050. The temple complex is famous for their erotic sculptures. The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views. The Chandela power effectively ended around the beginning of the 13th century, following Chahamana and Ghurid invasions. Northern Madhya Pradesh was conquered by the Turkic Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century. After the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of the 14th century, independent regional kingdoms reemerged, including the Tomara kingdom of Gwalior and the Sultanate of Malwa, with its capital at Mandu.  Malwa Sultanate  left The sultanate of Malwa was founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, the governor of Malwa for the Delhi Sultanate, who asserted his independence in 1392, but did not actually assume the ensigns of royalty till 1401. Initially Dhar was the capital of the new kingdom, but soon it was shifted to Mandu. The Malwa Sultanate was conquered by the Sultanate of Gujarat in 1531. Malwa painting originated during this period.  Early Modern period (1526–1858 CE)  Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century observatory at Ujjain.alt= Most of Madhya Pradesh came under Mughal rule during the reign of the emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged Mughal supremacy but enjoyed virtual autonomy. During the Mughal period, Gwalior became a center for music, and the home of the famous Gwalior Gharana. After the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, Mughal control began to weaken, and the Marathas began to expand from their base in central Maharashtra. In the 18th century, the Maratha Empire began to expand and gained large amounts of territory. The Battle of Bhopal was fought in Bhopal in 1737, where the Marathas defeated the Mughal forces. Large tracts of land in Malwa were ceded to the Marathas. The Shindes (Scindia) of Gwalior ruled most of Gird region, the Holkars of Indore ruled much of Malwa, and the Bhonsles of Nagpur dominated Mahakoshal and Gondwana as well as Vidarbha in Maharashtra. Jhansi was founded by a Maratha general. Bhopal was ruled by a Muslim dynasty descended from the Afghan General Dost Mohammed Khan. Maratha expansion was checked at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761.  British Colonial period (1858–1947 CE)  Jubbalpore, c. 1898. There were numerous preventable famines during British rule in India, resulting in millions of deaths. The British were expanding their Indian dominions from bases in Bengal, Bombay, and Madras, and the three Anglo-Maratha Wars were fought between 1775 and 1818. The Third Anglo-Maratha War left the British supreme in India. Most of Madhya Pradesh, including the large states of Indore, Bhopal, Nagpur, Rewa, and dozens of smaller states, became princely states of British India, and the Mahakoshal region became a British province, the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories. In 1853 the British annexed the state of Nagpur, which included southeastern Madhya Pradesh, eastern Maharashtra and most of Chhattisgarh, which were combined with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the Central Provinces in 1861. The princely states of northern Madhya Pradesh were governed by the Central India Agency. The British rule was marked by numerous famines. The first railway lines and airports were also built during this period.  Post-Independence (1947 CE – present)  thumb state. The new states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were formed out of the Central India Agency. In 1956, according to the States Reorganization Act, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh, and the Marathi-speaking southern region Vidarbha, which included Nagpur, was ceded to Bombay State. Bhopal became the new capital of the state, and Ravishankar Shukla was elected as the first Chief Minister. In December 1984, the Bhopal disaster killed more than 3,787 people and affected more than 500,000 people. A Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal leaked around 32 tons of toxic gases, including methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas which led to the worst industrial disaster to date. In November 2000, as part of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act, the southeastern portion of the state split off to form the new state of Chhattisgarh.

Pete Smith, as the narrator, diagnoses John's stomach trouble as a \\"simple case of bad cooking.\\" As the scene transitions to Mrs. Omsk in a disheveled kitchen, Smith's diagnosis is offered confirmation. Frustrated with her attempts to follow a cookbook on \\"How to Stuff a Duck\\", Mrs. Omsk throws down the book and beats the frozen duck, which surprisingly quacks each time it's struck. Smith decides to help the inept Mrs. Omsk by conjuring up Bizetti, a Master Chef, to show her how to cook. Unable to work in such messy surroundings, Bizetti accepts Smith's offer to tidy up by reversing the scene back to the spotless, organized kitchen before Mrs. Omsk's culinary attempts. Smith's uncanny film-editing magic of replacing the old frozen duck with a better one surprises Mrs. Omsk and excites Bizetti, who cleans the duck, stuffs it and sews it up. As the duck cooks in the oven, Bizetti shows Mrs. Omsk how to fix her husband's favorite dessert, baked apples.

Seventh-day Adventists have a lower risk than other Americans of certain diseases, and many researchers hypothesize that this is due to dietary and other lifestyle habits. This provides a special opportunity to answer scientific questions about how diet and other health habits affect the risk of suffering from many chronic diseases. Two studies on Adventist health involving 24,000 and 34,000 Californian Adventists were conducted over the last 40 years. Although not sponsored by the Adventist church itself, the church is supportive of the studies. These studies have been the subject of significant national media coverage on programs such as ABC News: World News Tonight, Good Morning America and in the National Geographic feature article \\"Longevity: The Secrets of a Long Life\\". There is a third larger ongoing study that includes Adventists throughout the United States and Canada.  Studies   Adventist Mortality Study  The first major study of Adventists began in 1960, and has become known as the Adventist Mortality Study. Consisting of 22,940 California Adventists, it entailed an intensive 5-year follow-up and a more informal 25-year follow-up. > \\"...[The] Adventist Mortality Study (1960–1965) did indicate that Adventist > men lived 6.2 years longer than non-Adventist men in the concurrent American > Cancer Society Study and Adventist women had a 3.7-year advantage over their > counterparts. These statistics were based on life table analyses.\\" Specifically, comparing death rates of Adventist compared to other Californians: *Death rates from all cancers was 40% lower for Adventist men and 24% lower for Adventist women *Lung cancer 79% lower *Colorectal cancer 38% lower *Breast cancer 15% lower *Coronary heart disease 34% lower for Adventist men, 2% lower for Adventist women  Adventist Health Study 1 (AHS-1)  An additional study (1974–1988) involved approximately 34,000 Californian Adventists over 25 years of age. Unlike the mortality study, the purpose was to find out which components of the Adventist lifestyle give protection against disease. The data from the study have been studied for more than a decade and the findings are numerous – linking diet to cancer and coronary heart disease. Specifically: *On average Adventist men live 7.3 years longer and Adventist women live 4.4 years longer than other Californians. *Five simple health behaviors promoted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for more than 100 years (not smoking, eating a plant-based diet, eating nuts several times per week, regular exercise, and maintaining normal body weight) increase life span up to 10 years. *Reducing consumption of red and white meat was associated with a decrease of colon cancer. *Eating legumes was protective against colon cancer. *Eating nuts several times a week reduces the risk of heart attack by up to 50%. *Eating whole meal bread instead of white bread reduced non-fatal heart attack risk by 45%. *Drinking 5 or more glasses of water a day may reduce heart disease by 50%. *Men who had a high consumption of tomatoes reduced their risk of prostate cancer by 40%. *Drinking soy milk more than once daily may reduce prostate cancer by 70%. Adventist Health Air Pollution Study (ASHMOG) This is a sub-study of AHS-1. It began in 1976 and is still being conducted. It includes 6,328 Adventists from California. The study was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency. The study linked the effects of various indoor and outdoor pollutants with respiratory diseases and lung cancer.  Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2)  The current study which began in 2002 with a goal of 125,000 Adventists continues to explore the links between lifestyle, diet and disease among the broader base of Seventh-day Adventists in America and Canada. As of May 2006 it had an enrollment of 96,741. Dr. Gary Fraser with a team of researchers from the School of Public Health at Loma Linda University is conducting the study which is funded by the National Cancer Institute. In July 2011, National Institutes of Health awarded AHS-2 a $5.5 million 5-year grant to continue the study. While the study is on-going, some findings have been reported: *\\"The 5-unit BMI difference between vegans and nonvegetarians indicates a substantial potential of vegetarianism to protect against obesity. Increased conformity to vegetarian diets protected against risk of type 2 diabetes after lifestyle characteristics and BMI were taken into account. Pesco- and semi-vegetarian diets afforded intermediate protection.\\" *\\"A vegetarian dietary pattern is associated with a more favorable profile of MRFs and a lower risk of MetS.\\" Adventist Religion & Health Study (AHRS) This sub-study of AHS-2 began in 2006 and is funded by the National Institute on Aging.

Copper tools from the Chalcolithic period have been discovered. This area entered the Iron Age during the mid-2nd millennium BCE. According to writers including Gautam Kumar Bera, there was already a distinct geo-political, cultural entity called Jharkhand even before the Magadha Empire. Bera's book (page 33) also refers to the Hindu epic Bhavishya Purana. The region came under control of the Maurya Empire and much later (17th century) was later conquered by the Mughal emperors Jahangir and Aurangzeb. With the Mughal decline the region came under local rulers from the Chero caste and others, before its subjugation by the British East India Company in the late 18th century, succeeded by the British Raj from the mid-19th century, both encountering much local resistance. At this time the territory was covered by nine princely states. Under the Raj, up to 1905 the region fell within the Bengal Presidency, most of it then being transferred to the Central Provinces and Orissa Tributary States; then in 1936 the whole region was assigned to the Eastern States Agency. Following Indian independence in 1947, the region was divided between the new states of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar. In 2000 a campaign led by the BJP for a separate state culminated with the passage of the Bihar Reorganisation Act, creating Jharkhand as a new Indian state. Prehistoric era Stone tools and Microliths have discovered from Chota Nagpur Plateau region which are from Mesolithic and Neolithic period. There are ancient Cave Paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000–5,000 BC). There is a group of megaliths found close to Barkagaon that is about 25 km from Hazaribagh at Punkri Barwadih, which has been proven to date back to beyond 3000 BCE. There are several Cooper tools have found in Chota Nagpur Plateau which are from 2nd millennium BCE. These Copper finds known as Copper Hoard Culture. In Kabra- Kala mound at the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Palamu district various antiquities and art objects have found which are from Neolithic to Medieval period and the pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to late medieval period. Iron age (c. 1800 – c. 200 BCE) Barudih in the Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, yielded evidence of microliths, Neolithic celts, iron slags, wheel made pottery, and iron objects include a sickle. The earliest radio carbon dating give a range of 1401–837 BCE for this site. Magadha and other Mahajanapadas in the Post Vedic period Around –1000 BCE, Vedic Aryans spread eastward to the fertile western Ganges Plain and adopted iron tools which allowed for clearing of forest and the adoption of a more settled, agricultural way of life. During this time, the central Ganges Plain was dominated by a related but non-Vedic Indo-Aryan culture. The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of cities and large states (called mahajanapadas) as well as śramaṇa movements (including Jainism and Buddhism) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy. According to Bronkhorst, the Sramana culture arose in \\"greater Magadha,\\" which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. In those days the Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga . In Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya Empire during Ashoka's reign (c. 232 BCE). Classical to medieval periods (c. 200 BCE – c. 1200 CE) Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chota Nagpur region, directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley. In the 7th century, Chinese traveler Xuanzang passed through the region. He described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna and Shashanka as its ruler. To the north of the kingdom was Magadha, Champa was in East, Mahendra in the west and Orissa in the south. The region was also part of Pala Empire. Jain statues) at Bhadrakali in Itury (10th Tirthankar the birthplace of Shitalnath). It is worshipped by assuming the Sahasrara shivling Itkhori Early modern period Palamau Fort was built in the 17th century CE. By the end of medieval and beginning of modern period this region was under the rule of many dynasties including Nagvanshi, Khayaravala, Ramgarh Raj, Raksel, Chero, Raj Dhanwar and notable Kharagdiha Zamindari estates of Koderma, Gadi Palganj and Ledo Gadi. In Akbarnama the region of Chota Nagpur is described as Jharkhand (Jangal Pradesh). During the Mughal period the Jharkhand region, then known by the name Khukhra, was famous for its diamonds. Akbar was informed of a rebel Afghan sardar, Junaid Kararani, was taking shelter in Chotanagpur. Besides, the emperor also received information on diamonds being found in this area. Consequently, Akbar ordered Shahbaz Khan Kamboh to attack Khukhra. At that time Raja Madhu Singh, the 42nd Nagvanshi king was ruling at Kokhra. Consequently, Kokhra was subdued by the armies of Akbar and a sum of rupees six thousand was fixed as its annual revenues payable to the Mughals. Till the reign of Akbar, Chota Nagpur had not come under the suzerainty of the Mughals and the Nagvanshi rulers had been ruling over this region as independent rulers. Navratangarh fort By the advent of the reign of Jahangir, Nagvanshi Raja Durjan Sal had come to power in Chota Nagpur. He refused to pay the rent fixed by the Emperor Akbar. Jahangir ordered Ibrahim Khan (governor of Bihar) to attack Kokhra. There was also another reason behind the invasion. This was the acquisition of the diamonds found in the bed of the Sankh River in the region. Thus to subdue the Raja of Chotanagpur and to acquire valuable diamonds, Jahangir decided to invade Chota Nagpur. On getting orders from the emperor, Ibrahim Khan marched against Kokhra in 1615 AD. The Nagvanshi Raja Durjan Sal found himself beleaguered himself within the hills and vales. He was arrested and all diamonds which were in the possession of Durjan Sal and his family were captured. Twenty four elephants also fell into the hands of Ibrahim Khan. After this, Kokhara was subdued and the diamonds found there were sent to the Imperial court. After his defeat and arrest, Durjan Sal offered as ransom jewels, gold and silver to the value of crores of rupees, but Ibrahim Khan did not release him and took him as a captive to Patna. From there he was sent to the Imperial court and subsequently imprisoned in the fort of Gwalior. According to Nagvanshi traditions, Raja Durjan Sal's confinement lasted twelve years. Ultimately, the very diamonds which had caused the misfortune of Durjan Sal secured him his release and former prosperity. Due to his ability to distinguish real diamonds, Jahangir released him and restored the prosperity taken from him in addition to his kingdom. The generous Durjan Sal further begged the Emperor to release the other Rajas who had been his companions in prison and his prayer was granted. Being pleased with Durjan Sal, Jahangir conferred the title of ‘Shah’ on the Kokhra ruler. On his return to Chotanagpur, Durjan Sal assumed the title of Maharaja and changed his surname. He shifted his capital from Khukhragarh to Doisa also known as Navratangarh. The reign of Durjan Sal lasted for about thirteen years. He died in 1639 or 1640 AD. He was succeeded by Raghunath Shah. He constructed several temples. He was also a poet and written several poem in Nagpuri language. In Palamu district, the old fort in the plains, was built by the King of Raksel Rajput Dynasty. However, it was during the reign of King Medini Ray (1658–1674), who ruled from 1658 to 1674 in Palamau, the old fort was rebuilt into a defensive structure. His rule extended to areas in South Gaya and Hazaribagh. He attacked Navratangarh ( and defeated the Nagvanshi Maharaja. With war bounty he constructed the lower fort close to Satbarwa. Daud Khan, who launched his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally arrived at the Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were not acceptable to the Cheros; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chero rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Cheros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Cheros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed.http://palamu.nic.in/palamufort.html Following the death of Medini Ray, there was rivalry within the royal family of the Chero dynasty which ultimately led to its downfall; this was engineered by the ministers and advisers in the court. In 1765, the region came under the control of the British East India Company. Chitrajeet Rai's nephew Gopal Rai betrayed him and facilitated the Patna Council of the East India Company to attack the fort. When the new fort was attacked by Captain Camac on 28 January 1771, the Chero soldiers fought valiantly but had to retreat to the old fort on account of water shortage. This facilitated the British army to occupy the new fort located on a hill without any struggle. This location was strategic and enabled the British to mount cannon-supported attacks on the old fort. The Cheros fought valiantly with their own cannons but the old fort was besieged by the British on 19 March 1771. The fort was finally occupied by the British in 1772. Kharagdiha Kingdom was founded in 15th century when the then Maharaja of Bhumihar clan, was able to influence and impress the ghatwals of Kharagdiha Gadis. The Hazaribagh Gazetteer describes this kingdom 600 miles long which spread from Hazaribagh to Gaya. After the Treaty of Allahabad this region along with the rest of Suba Bengal came under the rule of East India Company. The kingdom was considerably reduced and in 1809 the Maharajas of Kharagdiha were settled as the Rajas of Raj Dhanwar. The Kharagdiha gadis were semi- independent chiefdoms. Camptain Camac found the rulers of these gadis very prominent in their countries and as a result, these gadis were permanently settled as zamindari estates. Koderma, Gadi Palganj and Ledo Gadi were notable zamindari estates in the district. Region under Kings of Chero dynasty, Nagvansh and Ramgarh also became parts of British Raj. The Princely states in Chota Nagpur Plateau, came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary states of East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States. The subjugation and colonisation of Jharkhand region by the East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the rule of the British East India Company was transferred to the Crown in the person of Queen Victoria, who, in 1876, was proclaimed Empress of India. In 1874, Kherwar Movement shot into fame under the leadership of Bhagirathi Manjhi. The Cheros and Kharwars again rebelled against the British in 1882 but the attack was repulsed. Between 1895–1900, a movement against the British Raj was led by Birsa Munda (born 15 November 1875). Birsa Munda was captured by British forces and declared dead on 9 June 1900 in Ranchi Jail, due to Cholera, according to records of the British colonial government. All of these uprisings were quelled by the British through massive deployment of troops across the region. In 1914 the Tana Bhagat resistance movement started, which gained the participation of more than 26,000 adivasis, and eventually merged with Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha and Civil Disobedience movement. In October 1905, the exercise of British influence over the predominantly Hindi-speaking states of Chang Bhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja, and Udaipur was transferred from the Bengal government to that of the Central Provinces, while the two Oriya-speaking states of Gangpur and Bonai were attached to the Orissa Tributary States, leaving only Kharsawan and Saraikela answerable to the Bengal governor.Hunter, William Wilson, Sir, et al. (1908). Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 12. 1908–1931; Clarendon Press, Oxford In 1936, all nine states were transferred to the Eastern States Agency, the officials of which came under the direct authority of the Governor-General of India, rather than under that of any Provinces.

At that time, under the leadership of Netajee Subhas Chandra Bose conference against Samjhauta was also completed. In Ramgarh, Bose was seen as president of All India Forward Block and M.N. Roy was seen as leader of Radical democratic party. Post-independence After Indian independence in 1947, the rulers of the states all chose to accede to the Dominion of India. Changbhakar, Jashpur, Koriya, Surguja and Udaipur States later became part of Madhya Pradesh state, but Gangpur and Bonai became part of Orissa state, and Kharsawan and Saraikela part of Bihar state.Eastern States Agency. List of ruling chiefs & leading personages Delhi: Agent to Governor-General, Eastern States, 1936 In 1912, the state of Jharkhand was first proposed by a student of St.Columba's College in Hazaribagh. Initially it was demand of tribals, Unnati Samaj, political wings of Christian tribals submitted memorandum to Simon Commission to constitute a tribal state in Eastern India. Prominent leader like Jaipal Singh Munda and Ram Narayan Singh demanded separate state. Jharkhand Party led by Jaipal Singh Munda submitted memorandum to States Reorganization Commission for Jharkhand state, but it was rejected due to there was many languages and no link language in the region, tribal were not in majority and adverse effects on economy after separation from Bihar. In 1972, Binod Bihari Mahato, Shibu Soren and A. K. Roy founded Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Nirmal Mahto founded All Jharkhand Students Union. They spearheaded movement for separate state of Jharkhand. AJSU introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for bycott of election while JMM opposed it. Due to differences these party parted away from each other. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of Assam. Other tribal area were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and Santal Pargana development board constituted under the chairmanship of then Chief minister of Bihar under the provinsion of fifth schedule in 1972. It failed to meet desire result. Jharkhand coordination committee (JCC) led by Ram Dayal Munda, Dr. B.P. Keshri, Binod Bihari Mahato, Santosh Rana and Suraj Singh Besra started fresh initiative in the matter. Dr. B.P Keshri sent memoradum to form Jharkhand state. Centre government formed a commeetee on Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need of greater allocation of the development funds for the area. Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council(JAAC) Bill passed in Bihar legislative assembly in December 1994. Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council(JAAC) have given charge of 40 subjects including Agriculture, rural health, public work, public health and minerals. The council has power to recommend for legislation to the Assembly through the state government and to frames bylaws and regulations. In 1998, when the separate state movement was falling apart, Justice Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo had led the movement. In 1998, the Union government decided to send the Bill concerning formation of Jharkhand State to Bihar Legislative Assembly to which Lalu Prasad Yadav had said that the State would be divided over his dead body. BJP, JMM, AJSU, Congress, a total of 16 political parties came in one platform and formed 'All Party Separate State Formation Committee' to start the movement. Justice Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee. The voting on Jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 September 1998 in Bihar legislation. On that day the committee, under the leadership of Justice Shahdeo called for Jharkhand Bandh and organised a protest march. Thousands of supporters of separate state took to streets in leadership of Justice Shahdeo. He was arrested and detained in police station for hours along with many supporters. After the last Assembly election in the state resulted in a hung assembly, RJD's dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD would not pose a hurdle to the passage of the Bihar reorganisation Bill (Jharkhand Bill). Finally, with the support from both RJD and Congress, the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the BJP which had made statehood a policy plank in the region in several previous elections, cleared the Jharkhand Bill in the monsoon session of the Parliament in 2000, thus paving the way for the creation of a separate Jharkhand state.

The history of Haryana dates back thousands of years. The state houses several sites from the Indus Valley Civilization, which was a cradle of civilization.. Most likely to be part of Punjab During Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire,Haryana was known as Delhi Subah. Many great battles are fought here such as Battle of Tarain, Battle of Panipat, Battle of Karnal, etc. After Mughals, Haryana became Maratha Empire possession. After the treaty of Surji-Anjangaon of 1803,Haryana was annexed by British and was later merged with North West Provinces. After revolt of 1857, on 13 April 1858 Haryana then known as Delhi Territory was merged with Punjab Province as a punishment. During the British Colonial period,from 1858 to 1947 it was administered as a part of the Punjab province. It became a separate administrative entity in 1966. Chandigarh became the joint capital for the states of Punjab and Haryana for 5 years Chronological history Vedic period In some ancient Hindu texts, the boundaries of Kurukshetra correspond roughly to the state of Haryana. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin.Agarwal, Vishal: Is There Vedic Evidence for the Indo-Aryan Immigration to India? Pre-Islamic Hindu-Buddhist period c. 1910s portrayal of Hemu Vikramaditya After ousting the Huns, king Harshavardhana established his capital at Thanesar near Kurukshetra in the 7th century CE. After his death, the kingdom of his clansmen, the Pratiharas ruled over a vast region for quite a while from Harsha's adopted capital Kannauj. The region remained strategically important for the rulers of North India even though Thanesar was no more as central as Kannauj. Prithviraj Chauhan established forts at Taraori and Hansi in the 12th century. Sultanate period Muhammad Ghori conquered Haryana after the Second Battle of Tarain. Following his death, the Delhi Sultanate was established that ruled much of India for several centuries. The earliest reference to 'Hariana' occurs in a Sanskrit inscription dated 1328 AD kept in Delhi Museum, which refers to this region as The heaven on earth, indicating that it was fertile and relatively peaceful at that time. Firuz Shah Tughlaq established a fort at Hisar in 1354 to further fortify the region, and also constructed canals or rajwahas as they were referred to in the Indo-Persian historical texts.  Mughal Empire  The defeat of Hemu at the Second Battle of Panipat, c. 1556, Akbarnama. The three famous battles of Panipat took place near the modern town of Panipat. The first battle took place in 1526, where Babur, the ruler of Kabul defeated Ibrahim Lodi of the Delhi Sultanate, through the use of field artillery. This battle marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire in India. In the Second Battle of Panipat (5 November 1556), Akbar's general Bairam Khan defeated Hemu, the local Haryanvi who grew up in Rewari. Hemu, who belonged to Rewari in Haryana, rose from a businessman to become adviser to Afghan kings and then Prime Minister-cum-Chief of Army. He fought and won 22 battles in between 1553 and 1556, from Punjab to Bengal against Afghans and Mughals and won all of them without losing any. Hemu defeated Akbar's army at Tughlaqabad in Battle of Delhi-1556 and became king at Delhi on 7 October 1556 declaring himself as Vikramaditya following the reigns of earlier Vedic kings.Kar, L. Colonel H. C. \\"Military History of India\\", Calcutta (1980), p.283 Hemu lost his life in the Second Battle of Panipat. Maratha period (1756–1801) The Third Battle of Panipat was fought in 1761 between the Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Abdali and the Maratha Empire under Sadashivrao Bhau of Pune. Ahmad Shah won decisively, on 13 January 1761. Colonial period =1857 war of independence= The first war of independence in 1857 war started first at Ambala Cantonment, 8 hours before revolt started in Meerut, when the soldiers of 5th Indian Infantry Brigade and 60th Indian Infantry Brigade revolted but it was crushed.Haryana Samvad , Jan 2018. 5th and 60th Regiments of Benga Native Infantry rebelled at Umballa (Ambala). During the Battle of Narnaul at Nasibpur on 16 November 1857, British lost 70 British soldiers and their commanders colonel Gerrard and Captain Wallace. 40 British soldiers and officers Captain Craige, Captain Kennedy and Captain Pearse were wounded.Dr Malti Malik, History of India, Page 356. The major centers of rebellion were at Hisar, Hansi, Sirsa, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh, Farrukhnagar, Ballabhgarh, Rewari, Ambala, Panipat and Thanesar. Under the \\"Delhi Agency\\" there were seven Princely states, Jhajjar, Farrukhnagar, Ballabhgarh, Loharu, Pataudi and Dujana. The Chiefs of the last two estates remained loyal to the British and others rebelled.Madan Gopal, 1977, Sir Chhotu Ram: a political biography, Page 9. The Rajput rulers of Rajasthan also kept out of the mutiny.M.K. Singh, 2009, Encyclopaedia Of Indian War Of Independence (1857–1947) (Set Of 19 Vols.) Raja Nahar Singh the Jat ruler of Ballabhgarh, Rao Tula Ram ruler of Rewari and his cousin Gopal Dev, Nawab Abdur Rahman Khan Jhajjar, Nawab Ahmad Ali of Farrukhnagar, Sadruddin the peasant leader of Mewat, Harsukh Rai and Mirza Gauhar Ali of Palwal and Imam of Bu Ali Shah Qalandar mosque in Panipat played key role. After the failure of revolt by Indians, Haryana was taken out of North-Western Provinces and merged with Punjab as a punishment. This rebellion was partly caused by the unjust tax system implemented through the use of The Great Hedge of India, a historic inland customs border which ran through several states including Haryana. =Independence and riots= Lala Lajpat Rai worked towards the social reform, spread of Arya Samaj, creation of mass support for the Indian independence movement and he died protesting against the Simon Commission. Lala Murlidhar of Ambala and journalist Balmukund Gupt of Rewari were the members of the founding session of congress who promoted Swadeshi movement. Chhotu Ram, Pandit Nekiram Sharma, Lala Ugrasen and Ramswaroop Jaglan of Bidhwan were also key independence activists. During the 1907 Punjab unrest, which coincided with the upheaval resulting from the Partition of Bengal in 1905, the soldiers of Jat paltan revolted and sided with Bengali revolutionaries to take over the government treasury. Their revolt was crushed by British colonists, and several Jat soldiers had to suffer long sentences of imprisonment . In 1914, Kasi Ram Joshi a member of the Ghadar Party hailing from Haryana, returned to India from America. On 15 March 1915 he was hanged by the colonial rulers. Subhas Chandra Bose's Azad Hind Fauj had 2847 soldiers from Haryana, of whom 346 attained martyrdom. During the partition of India in 1947, state experienced riots at many places, which also scores of death and migration of millions of people from Haryana to Pakistan and vice versa. Formation of Haryana = Hindi language movement = A map of the distribution of native Punjabi speakers in India and Pakistan Hindi language movement of Punjab in the Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab started on 30 April 1957 and lasted till 27 December 1957, which paved the way for the demand for the formation of Haryana as a separate state for the Hindi speaking people of the united Punjab province. At the same time Punjab also had Punjabi suba & Punjabi language movement, under which Punjabi and gurmukhi were made official state language and script respectively, which was also made mandatory in schools of the whole of post-independence united Punjab. People of Hindi speaking areas of Punjab resisted this imposition. Punjab government retaliated by mass arrests and imprisonments, some of arrested activists were tortured in the prison. Sumer Singh of Naya Bans in Rohtak district gave his life for this cause during this movement.Har Samvand, Sept 2018, p12.

Haryana state was formed on the recommendation of the Sardar Hukam Singh Parliamentary Committee. The formation of this committee was announced in the Parliament on 23 September 1965. On 23 April 1966, acting on the recommendation of the Hukam Singh Committee, the Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice J. C. Shah, to divide and set up the boundaries of Punjab and Haryana. The commission gave its report on 31 May 1966. According to this report the then districts of Hissar, Mahendragarh, Gurgaon, Rohtak, and Karnal were to be a part of the new state of Haryana. Further the Tehsils of Jind (district Sangrur), Narwana (district Sangrur) Naraingarh, Ambala and Jagadhari of district Ambala were also included.

The hotel, financed by the Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, was opened in 2005 and completed on time by local contractor the Fouad Takla Company. Four Seasons concluded its management of the hotel effective June 19, 2019, due to US sanctions on its co-owner Samer Foz.

The hotel is situated in downtown Damascus, within easy reach of other areas of downtown Damascus such as business companies and embassies as well as the Ancient City of Damascus. The hotel has 297 guest rooms, including 66 suites, with high-speed internet, a CD/DVD system and an in-room coffee maker. The Barada River flows near the hotel.

From May to October 1921 he was the Foreign Minister of Germany.  Background  Friedrich Rosen's grandfather, Friedrich Ballhorn-Rosen, was Chancellor of the Principality of Lippe; his father, Georg Rosen, an orientalist, published writings on Islam. However, Georg Rosen decided to enter the diplomatic service of Prussia. He was active as a consul in the Middle East and the Balkans. Friedrich's mother Serena Anna, daughter of Ignaz Moscheles, came from a British scholarly family of Jewish faith (who had converted to Christianity).  Early years  In this cosmopolitan atmosphere, Friedrich Rosen was born in 1856 in Leipzig. However, he grew up in Jerusalem, where his father was consul. Friedrich Rosen enjoyed an education in four languages (German, English, Arabic and Turkish). He early decided to study modern and oriental languages, which brought him to Berlin, Leipzig, Göttingen, and Paris. After graduating, he worked for several months in London as a tutor for the children of Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, the viceroy of India. He retained a basically anglophilic attitude and a passion for oriental culture all his life. From 1887 onwards, he taught Persian and Urdu at the Department of Oriental Languages of the Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universität in Berlin.  Diplomatic career  Rosen in his office, 1930. After a dispute with the university department leadership in 1890, he gave up his academic position, and as his father before him he entered a career at the Foreign Office. He was employed as a representative in Beirut and Tehran, until 1898 when he was placed in charge of establishing a consulate in Baghdad. The diplomatic work in the Middle East was compatible with Rosen's orientalist interests. He was conversant in Arabic and Persian, and obtained an intimate knowledge of Persian culture. In 1890, he published a modern Persian grammar, with Nāsir al-Din Shāh, the Shah of Iran, as co-author; parts of the diary of the latter were employed as texts. In 1899, he accompanied the archeologist Gertrude Bell on her visit to Jerusalem.Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, KT., M.A. & Litt.D. Cambridge, M.A. & D.Litt. Oxford, D.LiT. Durham, F.S.A. A NARRATIVE OF JOURNEYS IN EGYPT AND MESOPOTAMIA ON BEHALF OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BETWEEN THE YEARS 1886 AND 1913, journal in the library of the University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, 1920. After his travel to Palestine, Kaiser Wilhelm II appointed Rosen as consul in Jerusalem. Only two years later in 1900, he was appointed to the Political Department of Foreign Affairs. Rosen was considered as an expert on the Arab world. Moreover, like his friend Wilhelm Solf, he held liberal views, and simultaneously supported the monarchy and was an anglophile, and thus was considered as the right person for achieving an understanding with Britain. From 1904 to 1905, Friedrich Rosen represented the interests of the German Empire in Ethiopia, in what after him was called the Rosengesandtschaft (\\"the Rosen Embassy\\"). Ethiopia hardly had as good relations with any other major power as with Germany. Returning to Europe, Rosen was appointed envoy in Tangiers. From 1910 to 1912, Rosen was envoy in Bucharest, and from 1912 to 1916 in Lisbon. In 1916, Germany declared war to Portugal, with thoughts of a German Central Africa in mind. Rosen returned with free passage back to his homeland. Wilhelm II then appointed him as envoy in The Hague, where he remained until his ascent to a high political position. Still as envoy, he helped preparing and visited the former Kaiser Wilhelm in his exile at Huis Doorn, a visit which the German public noted with mixed feelings.  Foreign minister  In the spring of 1921 the German chancellor, Joseph Wirth, appointed Rosen as Foreign Minister. On the issue of war reparations, the Centre Party's Wirth considered an anglophilic and also independent foreign minister to be advantageous. In the five months Rosen's tenure lasted, he acquired a peace treaty with the United States as a permanent result. Rosen retired in protest against the London ultimatum, in which the Entente powers combined demands of high reparations from Germany with threats of sanctions. He considered the policy of the victorious powers as an application of double standards: On the one hand, they would proclaim the self-determination of peoples, but on the other hand showed no respect to the referendum in Upper Silesia, where a 60 percent majority voted in favour of retaining the area as a part of Germany. Thus, Friedrich Rosen retired in October 1921 from civil service. Following the same policy, Wirth named Walther Rathenau as his successor, who was committed to similar principles.  Orientalist again  Rosen became chairman of the German Oriental Society, the umbrella organization of the Orientalists in Germany, and dedicated himself increasingly to scientific work. In this field, his today still well-known translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam has been published in several editions. Since the seizure of power by the Nazis, whose ideology Friedrich Rosen opposed from the beginning, the former Foreign Minister was subjected to anti-Semitic hatred, because of his descent. Hence until his death he maintained contact with the SeSiSo Club of his friend Wilhelm Solf, from which a few years later the resistance group Solf Circle developed. As the result of a fracture, Friedrich Rosen died in 1935 during a stay in Beijing, where his son Dr. Georg Rosen was working at the German embassy. Because of the racist policy of the Nazi regime, the younger Dr. Rosen, who was sending reports to the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin about the Nanjing Massacre, was forced to retire from the diplomatic service in 1938.

He is the grandson of Shaikh Bahauddin Zakaria Multani and son of Shaikh Sadruddin Arif Multani. He is commonly known as Makhdoom Shah of Bamrauli. Birth and education Shaikh Ismail was born in 1259 /1260 AD in Multan and was brought up in under the guidance of his father Shaikh Sadruddin and grandfather Shaikh Bahauddin Zakaria. He was initiated into Suharwardi order at the hands of his grandfather Shaikh Bahauddin Zakaria and trained by his father and his elder brother Shaikh Ruknuddin Abul Fateh alias Shah Rukn e Alam of Multan. Shah Ruknuddin kept his brother always with him and even in his visits to Delhi at the call of Alauddin Khalji. When Shah Ruknuddin visited Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya, his younger brother Shaikh Ismail was with him and asked some questions from both the holy men From Multan to Allahabad Shaikh Ismail used to live mainly at Multan looking after the propagation and educative activities of his Khanqaah but a divine intuition propelled him to migrate and shift to Allahabad. Before the death of his brother he had a divine intuition to move to Allahabad which was called Prayag at that time, at this distance he travelled first to Delhi where the emperor Alauddin Khalji and his successor welcomed him. From there he travelled to Allahabad via kara and settled in a village named Bamhrauli or Bamrauli (Chail, Allahabad). Thus he is considered to be one of the earliest Shaikhs who settled in the environs of the present city of Allahabad. Adherence to Shariah Shaikh Ismail strictly adhered to the basic tenets of Islam and did not like anything outside Shariah. He did not approve of singing, dancing in the name of Sam'a. He exhorted all to live a live of piety respecting their parents and fulfilling the duty of their creation by carrying out the responsibilities as the slave and vicegerent of Allah. He erected a mosque over a small mound exactly on the banks of river ganges and it is where he was laid down to rest after his departure from this world. To this day the mosque stands as it was erected by the Shaikh with he himself resting there. After spending more than 50 years in that village and commanding respect and honour from all, he died silently in 1349 AD. He was bestowed with the honorific title as \\"Makhdoom-i-Hind\\". Since centuries all the great saints of Allahabad and environs have paid their obeisance to this great personality. No big dome and massive tomb kind of structure was erected as per his wish and no Urs rituals take place at his grave in accordance with the instructions of Shariah.He is the only Saint in whole of North India where no Urs rituals are performed.This is one of the most evident and striking evidence of saint's adherence and strict following of the Shariah. The writer of Mirat al Asrar paid a special visit to this mosque and tomb in the reign of Shahjahan and commented \\" that it is a great place of Barkat\\". He never allowed his name and works to be highlighted in books and discourses, so is the case that except a very few people, not all know about him even in Allahabad. Disciples Students from all areas including Kara, Manikpur, Zafarabad, Jaunpur, Jhunsi, Awadh, thronged to be his student. Though a lot of students were his disciples but he authorized only three students with Khailafat,One Shaikh Abdul Rahim, Second Shaikh Ali, and third Sayyid Muhammad alias Shah Karak who eventually rose to become his most famous disciple and became popularly known as Shah Karak Majzoob(Abdal) of Kara Manikpur,Allahabad who is resting at Kara and is the most famous saint of Allahabad to this day. The fact is that he is more known than his master and mentor. Khwaja Karak is alternatively known as Khwaja Gurg of Karra/Kara.

Part of Shvabe Holding (Rostec state corporation). During the Soviet period it was called Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works (, ). The abbreviation KMZ () is still in common use.  Products  KMZ is known largely for its photographic and movie cameras of the Zorki, Zenit and Krasnogorsk series, several million of which were produced. It also has a large military optics and mechanical engineering division.

The existing factories were either inaccessible, such as LOMO in besieged Leningrad, or overloaded with demand, such as FED which had just been evacuated from Kharkiv to Berdsk. The KMZ factory was set up in 1942 near Moscow, which by then was no longer in immediate danger from German troops, on the site of a recently evacuated mechanical plant. Initially the company took over production of scopes and binoculars as well as reconnaissance cameras. After the end of the war, KMZ began producing photographic lenses in 1945 to the specifications of the Carl Zeiss corporation, whose factory in Jena had been overrun by the Red Army and largely carted off as war reparations. In the post-war years KMZ also began producing the Zorki camera, a close copy of the German Leica II and the Soviet FED, as well as copies of Zeiss medium-format cameras under the name Moskva. These mark the beginning of consumer production at KMZ besides the original military focus of the company. During the following years, KMZ was the main supplier of photographic lenses in the Soviet Union.  1950s and 1960s: Years of creativity  The mid-1950s saw the beginning of a period of heightened R&D; activity at KMZ. One reason was that lens production could be offloaded to a number of other new optical plants, including Arsenal in Kiev which began producing lenses in 1955. This freed up valuable resources at KMZ. Another reason was the changed economic policy under Nikita Khrushchev, which placed more emphasis on producing consumer goods, such as cameras, instead of investment goods and heavy industry. As a result, KMZ produced several highly interesting concept cameras that won international prizes at fairs such as the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels. The company's Zorki line of rangefinder cameras underwent significant modifications that moved it gradually from being a direct Leica copy towards an original camera line of its own. Several other highly interesting rangefinder camera lines were developed out of the Zorki in the early 1960s and put to market in relatively small numbers. However, the most influential camera developed during this period was the Zenit, a single- lens reflex camera based on the Zorki rangefinder body. The Zenit line was presented in 1953, and of the first generation of Zenit cameras, more than 1.2 million units were produced until the end of the 1960s. A major redesign was presented in 1967 that made the line compatible with the M42 lens mount that was in use worldwide. In 1965, KMZ also began producing movie cameras, of which was the Krasnogorsk series for 16 mm film was the most well-known. During this time, there was substantial cooperation between the military and the civilian sections at KMZ; an example of this is the Horizont panoramic camera of 1967, which was developed out of an older artillery camera and continues to be produced in modified fashion to this day. During this period, KMZ also produced the world's first subminiature SLR camera, the Narciss, an all-metal camera using 16mm unperforated film in special cassette, frame size 14x21mm. Narciss has a focal plane shutter, speed B,1/2,1/5,1/10,1/25,1/50,1/125,1/250 and 1/500 sec.  1970s and 1980s: Catering to the domestic market  The pace of R&D; for consumer products at KMZ substantially slowed down at the end of the 1960s. One reason for this might have been the relatively low output figures. Since large amounts of resources were channeled towards research and development, production figures itself were low. Under the conditions of the Soviet planned economy, these absolute production figures tended to be the main indicator for a company's productivity, which made it somewhat undesirable to invest in research and development. Another reason may have been the changed economic policy under Leonid Brezhnev, which again focused increasingly on heavy industry and arms production. During the 1970s consumer production at KMZ shifted towards producing large numbers of individual, relatively simple models of the existing product lines. These still underwent smaller modifications and innovations, but there was a clear focus on mass production. The Zorki line of rangefinder cameras was continued until 1980 with a single model dating back to the 1956, of which 2.2 million were produced with some modifications. The Krasnogorsk-3 movie camera was produced in a largely unchanged fashion from 1971 to 1989. The Zenit line of SLRs saw somewhat more substantial modifications, such as the addition of light metering, but here too the focus was primarily on mass-producing tried-and-true models, rather than implementing technical innovations such as automatic exposure that had been standard in the West for almost a decade before they appeared on the Zenit. To cope with domestic demand, Zenit production was outsourced to several other camera works in the Soviet Union as well. More than 6 million Zenit cameras were produced at KMZ until the end of the 1980s, but by that time the Zenit comparatively outdated. During this time, the relative importance of the military section of KMZ grew, in response to the increasing focus on arms production in the USSR in general. KMZ also developed a major focus in metallurgy, mechanical engineering and optoelectronics. In 1989, KMZ had about 32,000 employees.  Since the 1990s: Collapse and reconstruction  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, KMZ production was largely in disarray. Consumer products such as the Zenit line continued to be produced for some time, but found competition on the international market increasingly hard. KMZ continued to be present at international photography fairs such as Photokina or PMA and even presented some new products, today the company has found a niche in rifle scopes, night vision scopes, binoculars and other optical products. Now, it is a group member of the multi-national Russian Shvabe Holding.  Logo  Before 1949 the KMZ logo was a simple dove prism, nicknamed \\"tomb\\" by factory workers. In 1949 the logo was changed to the present form, depicting a prism with a refracted ray of light.

Fluroelastomers generally have wide chemical resistance. Composition Several compositions of fluroelastomers exist including FKM (by ASTM D1418 standard, equivalent to FPM by ISO/DIN 1629 standard); perfluoro-elastomers (FFKM); and tetrafluoro ethylene/propylene rubbers (FEPM). Performance The performance of fluoroelastomers in aggressive chemicals depends on the nature of the base polymer and the compounding ingredients used for moulding the final products (e.g. O-rings, shaft seals). This performance can vary significantly when end- users purchase polymer containing rubber goods from different sources.

She was one of the earliest female rulers in a Muslim nation and one of the few female rulers in the recorded history of Maldives. Khadeeja was the eldest daughter of Omar I of the Maldives. After the death of her father Sultan Omar in 1341, his son Ahmed Shihabuddine ascended the throne as Ahmed Shihabuddine of the Maldives. Khadija had her brother, the Sultan Ahmed Shihabuddine assassinated and took the throne for herself in 1347, becoming the first female ruler of Theemuge Dynasty. The army of the Sultana of Maldives consists of a thousand men of foreign birth; some of them are natives. They attend everyday to the hall of audience to salute her. Biography First reign Khadijah was the eldest daughter of Sultan Omar I of the Maldives. She was also half-sister of Raadhafathi who succeeded her after her (Khadijah's) final reign. Her first accession to the throne was in 1347 after deposing her own brother, Sultan Ahmed Shihabuddine, which lasted until 1363. Ibn Battuta: \\"One of the wonders of these islands is that its ruler (sultana) is a woman named Khadija ... . Sovereignty was exercised first by her grandfather, and then by her father. When the latter died her brother Shihab-ud-din became king. He was still young and the vezir 'Abdallah son of Muhammad al-Hazrami married the mother of Shihab-uddin and overpowered him. And it was he who married also this Sultana Khadija after the death of her husband, the vezir Jamal-uddin.\\" He then confirms the power struggles which resulted in the death of her brother and her enthronement: \\"The only survivors from the ruling house were his three sisters ... . The inhabitants of the Maldive islands preferred for sovereign Khadija and she was the wife of their orator (khatib) Jamal-ud-din who became vezir. He took over the reins of power . . . but orders were issued in the name of Khadija only. The orders were written on palm leaves with a bent piece of iron similar to a knife, while paper was not used except for writing the Qur'an and books of learning.\\" According to Ibn Battuta: :\\"The orator (khatib) mentioned the queen (sultana) in the Friday prayer and also on other occasions. 'O my God!' says he, 'help Thy female slave whom Thou in Thy wisdom hast chosen from all creatures and made an instrument of Thy grace for all Muslims.\\" Ibn Battuta describe that the women in the Maldives did not cover themselves with veils as other Muslim women, neither does queen Khadija, and that his efforts to make them do so failed. Second reign In 1363 she was deposed by her vizier and husband Muhammad el-Jameel. However 1364 she came to the throne once more after deposing and assassinating her first husband. Her second reign lasted from 1364 to 1374 until she was deposed again, by her second husband and minister Abdullah I. Third reign In the third year after her deposition, she assassinated and deposed her second husband Abdullah I in 1376. Hence her third and final reign began in 1376 which lasted until 1380. Despite being deposed twice by her husbands she ruled the country for nearly 30 years. She was succeeded by Raadhafathi. Legacy Sultana Khadeeja is one of the most popular historical figures of the Maldives. The history of Maldives records the exploits of heroes such as Mohamed Thakurufaanu and Dhon Bandaarain, but the records of the few Queens that have been passed down through the generations are nothing more than a few lines recording their titles and genealogy. One of the few exceptions to this general trend has been the stories of Queen Khadeeja. Her hold on to power for more than 30 years despite the challenges, would have been noteworthy even if she were of the opposite gender. Her power came at a great personal cost for her, loss of a beloved brother, two husbands and possibly several other contemporaries. She was deposed twice, each time by her own husband, forcing her to stand up against him and quite possibly her own courtiers who conspired against her. She successfully deposed three Kings; her brother and two husbands. Despite successfully managing to assassinate three Kings, it is impressive how she managed to escape a similar fate. The stories of the brave Queen who killed her husbands who dared to take the throne from her has captivated the Maldivians for generations. She has become the symbol of female empowerment for Maldivians. An underground feminist movement in the early 2000s named themselves \\"Rehendhi\\", after the formidable Queen.

People can gather the Four Fs so long as it is for personal use, and not for sale or commercial gain. This does not mean that people can enter land unlawfully to do so, but in areas where they can lawfully be, for example on a country park, or walking along a right of way, they are entitled to collect and take away the Four Fs. Like most common law this provision does not apply if some other legal provision over-rides it, for example the species in question is specially protected, say by listing in Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The same act also prohibits uprooting of any wild plant without the landowner's permission, so the Four Fs only applies to picking, for example daisies in a public park; not to digging up, for example, bluebell bulbs or young trees. Another significant exception is that land made accessible through the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 is not subject to these rights. This principle was put into statute in the Theft Act 1968 which states: \\"A person who picks mushrooms growing wild on any land, or who pick flowers, fruit or foliage from a plant growing wild on any land, does not (although not in possession of the land) steal what he picks, unless he does it for reward or for sale or other commercial purpose. (For purposes of this subsection 'mushroom' includes any fungus, and 'plant' includes any shrub or tree.)\\" Legal challenges to this right are unusual, and not always successful.

Description Sargent's cherry in 300px Prunus sargentii is a deciduous tree that grows 20–40 feet or 6-12 meter in height. Its crown spreads to a width of 20–40 feet. New growth is a reddish or bronze in color, which changes to shiny dark green. The leaves are obovate and have serrated margins. Leaves are in length and are arranged alternately. In fall, the leaves turn red, orange, or yellow. It grows single pink flowers on 1-in pedicels, which result in purple-black fruit in summer. The fruit is a favorite of birds, but because of their size (small, pea sized) and color, are considered inconspicuous to humans. Cultivation P. sargentii is a fast-growing ornamental tree requiring sun and well-drained soil. The tree can tolerate wind, but not air pollution; it is one of the hardiest cherries, and can be easily transplanted. This makes the tree suitable for use as a street tree. The tree is moderately drought- tolerant.https://www.gardenia.net/plant/Prunus-sargentii-Sargent-Cherry History Native to Korea and Japan, the tree was introduced to America and then the United Kingdom in 1908.

In Kenya a clinical officer operates under the jurisdiction of the Clinical Officers Council which is responsible for their training, registration and licensing and each officer must (1) study clinical medicine and surgery for three or four years (2) graduate from an approved medical training institution (3) pass a national government licensing examination (4) complete an internship year at a teaching hospital (5) register as a clinical officer (6) apply for a practicing licence (7) complete a three-year period of clinical supervision under a senior clinical officer or a senior medical officer and may thereafter (8) apply for a practising certificate which allows one to provide general medical services directly to the public or (9) go into training for specialization and (10) become a trainer. Clinical Officer (CO) is a protected title and its use by unregistered persons is prohibited by law and punishable by up to five years in jail with or without a fine. Globally, the title may not have legal restrictions and can refer to a job grade rather than a medical qualification such as junior assistive clinical staff (e.g. in Zambia and Tanzania), licensed medical professionals (e.g. in Kenya and Malawi) or high-level corporate officers, directors, and managers (e.g. Chief Clinical Officers in Europe and the United States). A clinical officer observes, interviews and examines sick and healthy individuals in all specialties to determine and document their health status and applies relevant pathological, radiological, psychiatric and community health techniques, procedures and findings needed to classify diseases and related health problems and to establish a provisional or final diagnosis upon which to prescribe, initiate, carry out or terminate treatment or therapy based on their specialized knowledge, skills and experience in clinical pharmacology, use of clinical guidelines, best practices and disease patterns as well as individual patient and community characteristics while being actively pharmacovigilant to prevent, identify, minimize and manage drug reactions, drug errors, side effects and poisoning, overdiagnosis, overscreening, overtreatment and futile care. A clinical officer performs general and specialized medical duties such as diagnosis and treatment of disease and injury, ordering and interpreting medical tests, performing routine medical and surgical procedures, referring patients to other practitioners and managing health departments, institutions, projects and systems. As a gazetted officer a clinical officer generates credible health data and information within communities and health institutions and cascades the same to the county and national governments, government agencies and third parties through standard recording and reporting tools from the Ministry of Health which are used to capture data on disease outbreaks, physical injuries and deformities, mental illness, drug resistance, disability, nutritional disorders, births and deaths among others. Overview To practice medicine and surgery or dentistry as a clinical officer one requires at least four years of full-time medical training, supervised clinical practice and internship at an accredited medical training institution and hospitals and registration with the relevant medical board in their country. After a prescribed number of years in active practice, one may complete a further one or two-year residency programme in order to specialize in any approved branch of clinical medicine and surgery such as anesthesia or pediatrics, or get an advanced medical qualification from the university. There are no pathways (post-basic or post-graduate entry- level conversion programs) for nurses and other health workers hence it takes at least eight years of specialised medical training and experience for a clinical officer to graduate with a post-basic qualification. \\"Clinical officer\\" in some countries such as Tanzania and Zambia refers to a different cadre of health workers, comparable to \\"medical assistants\\" in Malawi, who have less than three years of training but who may upgrade to a similar level by becoming Assistant Medical Officers (AMOs) or Medical Licentiates (MLs).\\"medical assistants/Sub Assistant Community Medical Officer\\" in Bangladesh, a Four Year medical diploma course conducting state medical faculty of Bangladesh under ministry of Health and family welfare. A clinician can specialize in any other field that is deemed appropriate by them and not just clinical medicine. China also has masters of clinical medicine. In countries like Tanzania, UK, and other countries, clinical medicine is regarded as a medical course and graduates are allowed to apply to masters of medicine specialties. No significant difference has been demonstrated in studies comparing treatment decisions, patient outcomes, quality of care provided and level of knowledge about diseases between a clinical officer and a medical officer (a non-specialist physician) except in countries where nurses were mistakenly assessed as clinical officers. However, because of the nature of practice, populations served and resources at ones disposal, a clinical officer is less likely to administer expensive treatment, prescribe expensive (but not necessarily better) drugs or engage in futile care. The success of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment initiatives in Africa is mostly attributed to use of clinical officers to diagnose the disease and provide comprehensive medical care. Access to emergency obstetric care through greater deployment of the clinical officer is one way of attaining the Millennium Development Goals 4 (reducing child mortality) and 5 (improving maternal health).University of Birmingham. Major analysis shows value of non-physician clinicians for maternal health in sub-Saharan Africa. Posted on 20 May 2011. Worldwide, patients are seen by many other practitioners other than the traditional doctor such as: *Osteopathic physicians, Podiatrists, Optometrists and Anesthesiologist assistants in the United States *Emergency and Clinical Officer Pakistan *Physician Assistants in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Liberia and Ghana *Assistant Doctors in China, *Surgical Care and Emergency Care Practitioners in the UK, *Assistant Physicians in Saudi Arabia, *Health Extension Officers in Papua New Guinea *medical assistants/Sub Assistant Community Medical Officer in Bangladesh *Medical Assistants in Fiji *Assistant Medical Officers in Malaysia *Surgical Technologists in Mozambique *Clinical Associates in South Africa.World Health Organization. Classifying health workers. Geneva, WHO, 2010. Scope of practice A clinical officer takes the Hippocratic oath and, depending on jurisdiction, may be registered by the same statutory board as physicians (in the southern countries such as Zambia and Malawi) or a separate board (in the eastern countries such as Kenya and Uganda). The broad nature of medical training prepares one to work at all levels of the health care system. Most work in primary care health centres and clinics, and casualty departments in hospitals where one will diagnose and treat all common diseases, including serious and life-threatening ones, in all age groups; and stabilise then admit, discharge or refer emergency cases. In smaller hospitals one may work as a hospitalist and one who has specialized in a clinical field provides advanced medical and surgical care and treatment such as administering anesthesia, performing general or specialised surgery, supervising other health workers and other administrative duties. A clinical officer's scope of practice depends on one's training and experience, jurisdiction and workplace policies. In Malawi, for instance, a clinical officer performs all routine surgical and obstetric operations such as exploratory laparatomy, emergency orthopaedics and Caesarean section. However, in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique one has to undergo further specialized training in order to perform such major operations safely. In rural and small urban health facilities a clinical officer is usually the highest medical care provider and works with minimal resources, relying on the traditional medical history and physical examination, often with little or no laboratory facilities, to make a diagnosis and provide treatment. In bigger and better equipped facilities a clinical officer generally acquires superior knowledge, experience and skills and provides high quality and a wider range of services in district, provincial and national hospitals, universities and colleges, research institutions and private medical facilities. A clinical officer is usually the lowest entry-level cadre in the medical hierarchy but with years of experience and/or further training one can rise to the same or a higher grade than a physician. In most countries, however, wages are usually low compared to training and responsibilities and career progression is usually restricted by awarding terminal degrees and diplomas, training students who have not attained the minimum university entry grade and, in some countries, not awarding any degree or recognition for advanced training. In such countries, this usually results in a demotivated and low quality workforce and resulting poor health indicators. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other international health and research institutions make extensive use of COs in their projects in Africa and clinical officers have been the backbone of HIV care and treatment enabling the rollout of ARVS to even the most rural hard to reach areas in Africa. Research done by the University of Birmingham and published in the British Medical Journal concluded that the effectiveness and safety of caeserian sections carried out by clinical officers did not differ significantly compared with doctors. Better health outcomes including lower maternal mortality rates were observed where COs had completed further specialised training particularly in anaesthesia. In the multi-country study, poor outcomes were observed in Burkina Faso and Zaire - the only countries where the procedure was performed by trained nurses. Higher rates of wound infection and Wound dehiscence in these countries was thought to be due to the nurses' poor surgical technique and need for enhanced training. ≠ Kenya Kenya has a comprehensive framework of parallel laws and regulations that govern the medical practice of medical officers and clinical officers. The supreme health policy and medical authorities in the republic are the cabinet secretary of health and the director of medical services who oversee the registration and licensing of medical institutions and the training, registration and licensing of medical practitioners through the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board and the Clinical Officers Council. As a British colony in 1928, Kenya started training a select group of natives to practice medicine and care for the local population who were increasingly accepting and seeking western medicine. After independence from Britain in 1963, medical training in Kenya initially adopted the four-year medical school system used in the US rather than the six-year UK model. This was heavily influenced by the Kennedy Airlift which followed initial funding by the African-American Students Foundation (AASF) in 1959 and led to hundreds of young Kenyan students getting scholarships to study in American institutions: These students came back to Kenya after their studies and joined the civil service in the early post-independence Kenya. It was also around this time that the first DOs were accepted as medical officers by the US civil service and by 1967 the structure and duration of medical training in Kenya was similar to the US MD training. When the University of Nairobi split from the University of East Africa and became the first university in Kenya in 1970, it continued to teach the six-year British degree which led to the creation of two statutory bodies: the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board in 1978 which had jurisdiction over medical officers and physicians, and the Clinical Officers Council in 1989 which had jurisdiction over clinical officers. Instead of residency for the clinical officer, the higher diploma in paediatrics, ophthalmology and other specializations was introduced in the late 1970s as a post-basic course for those who had worked for three or more years and, after ten years of service, one became a Senior Clinical Officer and qualified for a licence to practice under his own name as a private medical practitioner. The BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery degree was later introduced in 2006. Clinical officers play a central role in Kenya's medical sector today. There were 8,600 clinical officers on the register in 2010 compared to 7,100 medical officers. They are trained by the universities, the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), St. Mary's School of Clinical Medicine and other private institutions. The Ministry of Health, through the Clinical Officers Council (COC) regulates their training and practice, accredits training institutions, and approves the syllabi of the universities and colleges. The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC), also under the Ministry of Health, has campuses in regional teaching hospitals and trains the majority of clinical officers. St. Mary's School of Clinical Medicine and St. Mary's Mission Hospital in Mumias, owned by the Roman Catholic diocese of Kakamega, was the first private institution to train clinical officers. It admits students who got the minimum university entry grade in high school and have passed a written examination and oral interview. The students sit the same examination as their counterparts at the KMTC and are examined by consultants from the public service. On 28 October 1981 lawmakers addressed the National Assembly as follows: *Mr. Orengo: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir. Is it really in order for the hon. Member for Butere to impute that this house does not know that clinical officers are not allowed to practice. I think the motion is just after legalizing the position and not saying that they are not allowed to practice. *Mr. Shikuku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, we heard Dr. Chibule saying that he is going to give us a list of 20 clinical officers who are being refused permission to practice and forced to go back to government practice and this is the thing I am trying to reply to. The hon. Member was in the house when Dr. Chibule said this but I do not know why he did not hear him say so, but nevertheless, let me continue. Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, the clinical officers helped the government during the recent doctors' strike in the country when we virtually depended on them. Now, Sir, part (a) of this motion is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Health because if anybody wants to pursue higher education, even from this house, it is upon him first to make sure he has the prerequisite qualifications to pursue higher studies. So, with that, the ministry is not concerned. Part (b) of the motion is the most important. We are requiring the enactment of a law to cover our present clinical officers to allow them to practice and be covered by the law as the doctors are covered. This is the point and the assistant minister for health has produced a paper which is going to be presented before the cabinet after which it will come to the house. Now, Sir, where do we disagree? There is no place where we disagree. What we are trying to say is that the government is already doing what it is being asked to do, and that is why we are saying that this matter has more or less been overtaken by events. Therefore, we are not going to be asked to do what we are already doing. *Mr. Orengo: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. *Mr. Shikuku: You can have as many points of order as you like! The dual diploma in clinical medicine and surgery plus an internship year is the standard qualification for clinical officers which is awarded on completion of a four-year training programme which started as various programmes that were used to train medical practitioners in the East Africa Protectorate in the 1920s and which now resembles the North American four-year MD and DO medical school programmes (including being structured in 9 trimesters over 3 years to meet the minimum 130 weeks of instruction recommended by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education) instead of the more recent six-year MBChB programme that was introduced in the 1970s and is more common in European and commonwealth countries: Medical Officers training: * Is a six-year professional degree programme accredited by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board involving * Two years of pre-clinical training in medical sciences followed by * Four years of training in clinical medicine, surgery and community health including a mandatory one-year internship and * Registration, licensing and gazettment by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board giving * Unlimited practice rights with * Specialisation and private practice allowed and eligible for full professional membership of the Kenya Medical Association (KMA) Clinical Officers training: * Is a four or five-year professional diploma or degree programme accredited by the Clinical Officers Council involving * One year of pre-clinical training in medical sciences followed by * Three or four years of training in clinical medicine, surgery and community health including a mandatory one-year internship and * Registration, licensing and gazettment by the Clinical Officers Council giving *Unlimited practice rights with * Specialisation and private practice allowed and eligible for full professional membership of the Kenya Clinical Officers Association (KCOA) The current training follows international guidelines and the two qualifications are awarded jointly on successful completion of a comprehensive nine trimester programme of full-time study, practicals and examinations which are covered over three years leading to a fourth mandatory year of internship in a teaching hospital. A fifth and sixth residency specialisation years are undertaken after registration by the Clinical Officers Council and three years of work experience in general medicine which leads to the award of a general degree in clinical medicine or a specialist diploma in pediatrics, orthopedics, psychiatry, anaesthesia, reproductive health and other specialties. A clinical officer is therefore able to graduate and join the workforce in a minimum of four calendar years and provides medical services within the full scope of family and emergency medicine or within a narrower scope depending on their area of specialisation. Registration by the Clinical Officers Council (COC) entitles one to render medical services in any public or private medical institution or to practice medicine independently as a private practitioner. Registration also qualifies one to join and participate in the affairs of the Kenya Clinical Officers Association (KCOA), including its annual KCOA Scientific Conference, and the Kenya Union of Clinical Officers (KUCO). As per the government's Revised Scheme of Service for Clinical Personnel (2014) a clinical officer works at any of 8 grades depending on ones seniority. Table showing different grades of clinical officers, medical officers and medical practitioners in Kenya's public service As gazetted officers all registered clinical officers are legally authorized to prepare, sign, issue and keep safe custody of official state documents such as medical examination reports, sick notes, postmortem examination reports and death certificates and to appear in courts of law as expert witnesses. For this reason, a clinical officer is the officer in-charge of a health center or a district hospital and is part of the medical team in bigger hospitals where one may head a department or work under a senior clinical officer or a physician.Mullan F, Frehywot S. Non-physician clinicians in 47 sub-Saharan African countries. Lancet; 2007, 370: 2158–63.AMREF. Clinical Officers. Accessed 6 April 2011.Kruk ME et al. Human Resource and Funding Constraints for Essential Surgery in District Hospitals in Africa: A Retrospective Cross-Sectional Survey. PLoS Medicine; 2010 http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000242 Clinical officers are direct healthcare providers who manage and administer health institutions, medical schemes and projects in primary healthcare (PHC) settings and are frontline stakeholders in Universal Health Coverage in Kenya which is one of the key pillars of the government's 5-year development plan under President Uhuru Kenyatta. The four pillars of the 5-year development plan are 1. Manufacturing 2. Affordable housing 3. Universal Health Coverage and 4. Food security. Legal status In Kenya's public health system, a clinical officer is an alternative practitioner who is trained and authorized by law to perform any technical, administrative or legal duties that require a medical doctor. However, due to the shorter training period when compared to medical officers (i.e. 4 years instead of 6 years), a clinical officer joins the public service at a lower grade and gains seniority through experience, additional training or further education. Like the term medical officer, the term clinical officer is a protected title whose use without the authority of the Clinical Officers Council is prohibited and a punishable offense under Kenyan laws. Court rulings uphold that a registration certificate or a licence issued by the council automatically confers the status of a medical officer or a qualified medical practitioner to a clinician and the titles are used interchangeably in medico-legal documents because a qualified clinical officer has a recognized medical qualification and is eligible for registration as a medical practitioner under Section 11(1) of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act in addition to being expressly authorized to practice medicine, surgery or dentistry by Section 7(4) of the Clinical Officers ActCriminal Appeal 198 of 2008 - Kenya LawCriminal Case 6 of 2004 - Kenya LawCAP. 249 From the Anatomy Act, the legal definition of a medical officer is any public officer who is entitled to be registered as a medical practitioner if he applied under any law in the country: Section 14(1) of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Act and Section 7(4) of the Clinical Officers Act are the only two laws that can authorize one to practice medicine and render medical or dental services in the public sector if they hold a registration certificate or in the private sector if they hold a current licence as well. The Public Health Act further defines a medical officer of health as a public officer who is responsible for health nationally (the Director of Medical Services and the Director clinical services) or regionally (the County or Sub- County Medical Officer of Health and the County or Sub-County Clinical Officer). Like his counterparts in the public service, a clinical officer in the private sector has the same practice rights and privileges as a medical officer and both are authorized to work independently and specialize in any approved branch of general or specialised medicine. The Competition Act No.12 of 2010 directly prohibits and addresses multi-sectoral abuse of dominance, consumer welfare, exemptions, cartels and unwarranted concentration of economic power among practitioners. A register of active clinical officers and medical institutions is available online on the Clinical Officers Council and Ministry of Health websites. The Clinical Officers (Training, Registration and Licensing) Act No. 20 of 2017 The Clinical Officers (Training, Registration and Licensing) Act No.20 of 2017 is the law that governs the medical practice of a clinical Officer. It establishes the Clinical Officers Council whose functions are to: *advise the government on policy matters relating to clinical medicine practice *prescribe the minimum educational entry requirements for persons wishing to be trained as clinical officers *approve institutions other than those established or accredited under the Universities Act, 2012 for the training of clinical officers *establish, approve and accredit programs for continuing professional educational programs *register and license clinical officers for the purposes of this Act *maintain a register and records of all clinical officers registered under this Act *cause to be published in the Kenya Gazette every calendar year the names of all registered clinical officers *promote development and adoption of codes of practice *regulate the professional conduct and ensure the maintenance and improvement of the standards of practice of clinical medicine *collaborate with other medical professional associations, organisations and other relevant bodies, in the furtherance of the functions of the Council and those bodies *consider and deal with any other matter pertaining to clinical officers including prescribing badges, insignias or uniforms to be worn by clinical officers and *carry out other functions related to the implementation of this Act. Training Although training programmes existed as early as 1928, the first university to train clinical officers was Egerton UniversityEgerton University, Kenya in 1999. Programs also exist at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology,Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya Kenya Methodist University (KEMU)Kenya Methodist University, Mt Kenya University. and Presbyterian university of East Africa (PUEA)., Kenya The diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery is completed in nine 15-week trimesters over three calendar years (or 135 weeks which, notably, exceeds the minimum 130 weeks of instruction required to complete US MD programs). The BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery is completed over 4 years. Students study the biomedical and clinical sciences such as anatomy, physiology and pathology in the first year followed by the clinical subjects (medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology) in the second year. The third and fourth year involves supervised clinical practice and internship in teaching hospitals where they rotate in all the departments, receive beside lectures, attend consultants' ward rounds, clerk patients and present medical histories, perform deliveries and first-assist in major surgery. They also attend clinical meetings and write prescriptions which at this stage must be counter- signed by a supervising clinician. There is special emphasis on primary care with modules on community health taught throughout the course. Before starting their internship after the third year, clinical officers spend at least one month in a Provincial Rural Health Training Centre where they immunize children, examine pregnant women and offer family planning services in mother and child health clinics. They also treat in-patients and out-patients under the guidance of qualified Clinical officers and organise outreach services where they venture into remote rural villages, seeing patients and immunising children. During this time they complete a project in community diagnosis. They also learn Health Service Management which prepares them for their management and leadership roles in health centers and other institutions. Internship and registration All clinical officers must work as full-time interns for one year without pay or any form of motivation at an approved public or mission hospital before getting a licence to practice medicine, a situation that has resulted to major strikes by clinical officers in the past leading to operation standstills in public hospitals when these strikes occur. On passing the final qualifying examination, they take the hippocratic oath then apply for provisional registration by the Clinical Officers Council, the statutory body that regulates the practice of clinical officers in the country. The internship involves supervised rotations in the major clinical departments namely casualty, medicine, paediatrics, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology. They are supervised by consultants in the respective fields. The consultants ensure that they can practice clinical medicine safely before signing them off for registration. An internship booklet signed by the consultants is required for registration. After registration one is required to apply for a licence from the COC which allows them to practice medicine, surgery and dentistry legally in the country. This licence is renewable every two years. Renewal requires evidence of having attained 60 Continuous Professional Development (CPD) points in the CPD diary by further training, research and publications, attending conferences and Continuing Medical Education (CME) sessions or major ward rounds and outreach activities. Bsc.Clinical medicine Careers Progression and Advancement An experienced clinical officer usually holds a senior clinical, administrative or teaching position within their organisation or establishes and manages his/her own private practice. One who holds the Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery can upgrade his/her qualification to the BSc. Clinical Medicine and Surgery or undertake postgraduate training at the university. One may also enroll for the Higher Diploma programme at the Kenya Medical Training College. The Higher Diploma in Clinical Medicine and Surgery requires at least three years of working experience and lasts twelve to eighteen months leading to a specialised qualification and re-designation as a specialised clinical officer in one of the medical specialties such as paediatrics, reproductive health, anaesthesia, ENT, ophthalmology and cataract surgery, orthopaedics, psychiatry/clinical psychology, skin and chest diseases, epidemiology, pathology and Community medicine. A specialised clinical officer provides advanced medical and surgical care including invasive procedures in their specialty such as caeserian section, cataract surgery, tonsillectomy, psychotherapy and administration of anaesthesia. A graduate clinical officer who holds Bsc. Clinical medicine and surgery is at the mercy of the consultant or medical officer incharge of the hospital allowed to undertake minimal invasive surgical procedures including Caesarean section. Currently After the Bsc.Clinical medicine a C. O in kenya has no available areas of specialization on a masters level but can however take a higher diploma from KMTC in Pediatrics and childhealth, Reproductive health, Oncology and palliative medicine,Accident and emergency medicine, Ophthalmology, ENT, Dermatology and venereal disease, Lung health among others. Or Undertake a Masters in Forensic and coroner medicine offered at Mount Kenya University. Or decide to pursue a Masters in a field dominated by physicians in the hope of getting His/Her own niche of practice, this includes a Masters in Family health offered at Mount Kenya University. At the current Situation much of the practical acumen and knonwledge assimilated by the Bsc.Clinical medicine a C. O has no areas of practice at employment level as the primary duties at employment is running outpatient facilities at County and Sub county hospitals. With no available niche and well structured masters in clinical medicine courses available for only Bsc.Clinical medicine C. O, This is a truly truly Unsolvable crossroad that the practitioners find themselves In with No notable Career progression in the field of medicine but rather a Plateau or a Fall to a Higher Diploma level. Malawi Medical care is generally provided by clinical officers who are even capable of providing surgical care. Clinical Officers are trained for 4 years, (3+1 year of clinical internship at designated teaching hospitals). One meta-analysis documented that the provision of caesarean section by clinical officers does not result in a significant increase in maternal or perinatal mortality. In other, words there was no difference whether the operation was done by clinical officers or medical doctor Sudan Southern Sudan separated from the Arab North (Sudan) in July 2011 after years of civil war that left much of the southern part in ruins. The healthcare system is almost non-existent. AMREF started training clinical officers by setting up the Maridi National Health Training Institute. The graduates supplement the efforts of COs trained in neighboring countries, e.g. Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, most of whom work for international humanitarian agencies. Tanzania In Tanzania, training is under the Ministry of Health. There are numerous clinical officer training schools and programs last three years. Internship is not required for registration. Experienced clinical officers may enrol for an advanced diploma in clinical medicine which takes two years to complete. This qualification is regarded as equivalent to a first degree in medicine by universities and the Ministry of Health in the country. The graduates are known as Assistant Medical Officers which no longer exist since 2017 so a clinical officer can upgrade by studying a bachelor's degree in clinical medicine in any East African country for three years or study it in Tanzania for four years and graduate as a doctor equivalent to an MD graduate even in salary and job opportunities or can study the Medical Doctor(MD) which is a 5-year course plus 1 internship year making a total of 6 years and can add 1 year to be Medical bachelor and Bachelor in Surgery(MBBS) if interested. A further two years training from the Clinical Officer level leads to a specialist qualification in anaesthesia, medicine, surgery and radiology etc. Kampala International University has opened a campus in Dar es Salaam where it is now offering its Bachelor of Clinical Medicine and Community Health. Uganda By 1918, Uganda was training clinical officers who were called medical assistants at the time. The training is under the Ministry of Education and takes place in clinical officer training schools.Health Training Institutions in Uganda Information Portal. Accessed 6 April 2011. Postsecondary programs last three years, focusing on medicine and hospice care, followed by a two-year internship. Kampala International University offers a Bachelor of Clinical Medicine and Community Health.Kampala International University , Uganda High school graduates take four-and-a-half years to complete this degree while practicing clinical officers take three years. Zambia In Zambia, clinical officers who complete a three-year diploma of Science in Clinical Medicine course are called CLINICAL OFFICER -GENERAL (COG). Those who complete a three-year diploma in clinical psychiatry are called CLINICAL OFFICER -PSYCHIATRY (COP). Currently the upgrade of this diploma is a bachelor of science and holders are called medical licentiates. Medical licentiates have advanced skills in medicine and surgery and may be deployed interchangeably with physicians. Medical licentiates outnumber general physicians (with university degree) across all regions, with the ratio ranging from 3.8 COs per physician in Lusaka to 19.3 in the Northwestern provinces.Ferrinho P et al. \\"The human resource for health situation in Zambia: deficit and maldistribution.\\" Human Resources for Health 2011, 9:30 (19 December 2011) They perform routine surgical and obstetric operations as well as providing clinical care in hospitals. The College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA) is involved in their training to increase their surgical skills through the Clinical Officers Surgical Training (COST) programme. Burkina Faso In Burkina Faso, as elsewhere in sub- Saharan Africa, the use of non-physician clinicians began as a temporary measure while more doctors were trained, but has become a permanent strategy in the face of a crisis in health human resources. Different training alternatives have been used. Two-year advanced training programs in surgery were developed for registered nurses. Clinical officers (known as attachés de santé en chirurgie) were district medical officers trained with an additional six-month curriculum in emergency surgery. Many studies show that trained COs provide quality medical and surgical care with outcomes similar to physicians' providing similar care in the same setting. However, nurses re-trained to become COs have been associated with more adverse outcomes as shown in a study using 2004-2005 hospital data from six regions of Burkina Faso, which associated them with higher maternal and neonatal mortality when they performed caeserian sections. The observed higher fatality rate pointed to a need for refresher courses and closer supervision of the nurses. Ethiopia The first medical school in Ethiopia was initially a \\"health officer\\" training institution. The training of health officers started at Gonder University in 1954. Health officers training programs across Ethiopia require that students have some of the highest scores in National University Entrance Examination to be admitted. Health officers hold bachelor's degrees and undergo a three-year training program plus one-year internship. Those who complete a 2–3 years master's degree programs provide advanced care (e.g. emergency surgery). Ghana In Ghana, Medical Assistants (MAs) have traditionally been experienced nurses who have undergone an 18-month post-basic course to become MAs. High school graduates can now attend a three-year diploma course to become MAs.Narhbita College. The Medical Assistant Course. In Ghana, from 2012, the nomenclature Medical Assistant had been changed to Physician Assistant..The Physician Assistant Profession in Ghana The new name Physician Assistant is not known among most Ghanaians The term Physician Assistant (PA) refers to three (3) distinct groups of health professionals trained on the medical model to practise medicine and dentistry. They are the PA-Medical, PA- Dental and also known as Community Oral Health Officers and PA-Anaesthesia (also known as Nurse Anesthetists). These groups of mid-level health providers were trained exclusively in the past by Health Training Institutions (HTIs) under the Ministry of Health with the aim of extending care to the populace where physician numbers were scanty or not present. Currently, there are eight universities in Ghana offering a 4-year Bachelor of Science degree in Physician Assistantship. The objective of the Bachelor of Physician Assistantship programme is to train graduates who will possess the ability to evaluate the health status of an individual, diagnose and treat acute illness as well as life saving interventions, manage chronic diseases, deliver preventive care and counsel individuals on psychosocial problems in independently or in collaboration with a physician.Central University College In 2016, the PA-Anaesthesia group broke away and became certified registered anaesthetist (CRA) according to the Health Professions Regulatory Acts 857 which addressed them as certified registered anaesthetist. PAs are qualified by graduation from the PA educational programme and certification by the Ghana Medical and Dental Council. Newly qualified PAs who are successful in their licentiate examinations by the MDC are issued with provisional registrations to enable them undertake one-year internship in an accredited institution, a prerequisite for permanent registration which would also serve as national service but without pay for the twelve months. PA students in all PA training schools belong to the Physician Assistant Association of Ghana (PASAG). In order to foster unity, camaraderie and bond among members of the association, and to promote excellence in the discharge of their professional mandate, quiz competitions are held every year. The maiden edition was won by the Presbyterian University College, Ghana. After permanent certification, among other things, PAs diagnose and treat illnesses, conduct physical examinations, counsel individuals on preventative health issues, and order and interpret laboratory tests. In addition, PAs are first or second assistants in major surgery, and provide pre- and post-operative care, and for that matter are trained and well versed in surgical skills. Thus, PAs play roles in preventive Medicine, as well as in educational, research, and administrative activities. The physician assistant is part of the medical team and is placed above the nurse but below the medical officer They perform tasks originally performed by doctors. Some call PAs as \\"village doctors\\" or \\"chiefs.\\" To the patient, a PA is a doctor, since the PA practises medicine just as a doctor The Ghana Physician Assistant Association-Medical at their last annual delegate congress, voted for a name change from the current name Physician Assistant to Clinical Officer. The members of the association believes that the Assistant attached to their name is limitation to what the PA actually does. The PA is not an assistant but an independent medical professional trained and licensed to practise medicine and dentistry. The association has therefore presented a new job description and the new name clinical officer to the Ministry of Health. The meeting which was chaired by the chief director of the ministry of health Dr. Afisah Zakariah who promised to address the grievances of the PAs soon to be known as Clinical Officers Liberia In Liberia, the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts (TNIMA) was established in 1945. In 1965, the physician assistant (PA) programme was established as a joint venture between the Liberian government, WHO and UNICEF. Initially it was a one-year course, but currently it is a three-year diploma course accredited by the Liberia National Physician Assistant Association (LINPAA) and the Liberia Medical and Dental Association Board. In order to legally practice medicine as a PA one must sit and pass a state exam administered by the medical board.Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts , Liberia Mozambique In Mozambique, tecnicos de cirurgia, or surgical technologists, are experienced Clinical Officers who undergo further residential training in surgery under the supervision of senior surgeons lasting two years at Maputo Central Hospital, and a one-year internship at a provincial hospital. They are trained to carry out emergency surgery, obstetrics and traumatology and are deployed to the district hospitals where they are usually the sole surgical care providers. South Africa South Africa trains clinical associates for three years and awards them the Bachelor of Clinical Medical Practice degree. The first program was launched by the late Health Minister Tshabalala Msimang on 18 August 2008 at the Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha. The first class graduated in December 2010.Walter Sisulu University. First South African Clinical Associates take their pledge at WSU. Programs also exist at the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand. International The specialised nature of medical training in the developed world has created a shortage of general practitioners and runaway expenditure on healthcare by governments. primary care is increasingly being provided by non-physician providers such as physician assistants. United States Physician assistants in the United States train for at least two years at the postsecondary level and can hold an associate, bachelors or master's degree. Most PAs have earned a master's degree. Some institutions offer a Doctor of Science degree in the same. According to Money magazine, this is currently one of the best careers in the US.CNNMoney.com. Best Jobs in America: #2. Physician Assistant The profession is represented by the American Academy of Physician Assistants. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has in recent years employed physician assistants from the United States on a trial basis as it plans to introduce this cadre into their health care system. Several UK universities are already offering a post-graduate diploma in Physician Assistant studies. The PAs of the UK are represented by the Association of UK PAs. Australia The University of Queensland offers a one-and-a-half-year Master of Physician Assistant Studies to those with a bachelor's degree. Those with a post-secondary healthcare qualification such as registered nurses and paramedics can access the programme via a Graduate Certificate in Physician Assistant Studies; as long as they have at least five years full-time working experience.University of Queensland , Australia It has been announced that PAs will be allowed to work in Queensland as fully licensed practitioners in 2014. China China has about 880,000 Rural Doctors and 110,000 assistant doctors who provide primary care to rural populations where they are also known as barefoot doctors. They typically have about one year of training; those who sit and pass government examinations qualify to be rural doctors. Those who fail become community health workers. However, there is a government move to have all rural doctors complete three years training. Fiji Africa and the rest of the world are perhaps following a well trode path. In 1879, a group of Indians arrived in Fiji by ship having survived cholera and smallpox en route. During a period of crew quarantine, a small group was trained in vaccination. The experience was considered so successful that a few years later, in 1885, a group of young Fijian men started a three-year training program at the Suva Medical School, now known as the Fiji School of Medicine.Fiji School of Medicine. History. Accessed 6 April 2011. The title given to the professional practice has had many names over the years, including Native Medical Practitioner, Assistant Medical Practitioner, Assistant Medical Officer, and Primary Care Practitioner (PCP). By 1987, the PCPs were training for three years before going back to their communities to serve one-year internship, followed by another two years of study after which they were awarded a MBBS degree. India Under British rule, India trained licentiate doctors for three years. They were then registered with the General Medical Council of Britain. Most of them worked among the rural population providing medical care. After independence, and on the recommendation of the bhore committee in 1946, the training of licentiate doctors was stopped and their qualifications converted to MBBS degrees. They were then grandfathered into the Medical Council of India. The plan was to train enough doctors who would serve the whole country. However, the plan has not borne fruit and doctors generally leave their rural posts after their internship for more lucrative and glamorous careers in the big cities. As of 2009, the Indian government plans to introduce a three-and-a-half-year Bachelor of Rural Medicine and Surgery (BRMS) degree to train doctors who will work in remote Indian villages. On graduation they will undergo a one-year internship period at a regional hospital before being licensed. Those with five years' experience will qualify for post-graduate studies on equal standing with their MBBS counterparts. In India, the Madras Medical Mission in Chennai, collaborating with Birla Institute of Technology and Frontier Lifeline has since 1992 offered a bachelor of science degree in Physician Assistant studies. The program duration is four years, comprising three years classroom and laboratory coursework then one year compulsory internship. Several other universities offer similar courses in partnership with US universities. PAs in India can pursue masters and doctor of science degrees.

It is located in Neasden, London opposite the Swaminarayan Mandir, Hindu temple.  Introduction  The Swaminarayan School is an independent day school located in Neasden, London, which was founded in 1991 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj. As of 2015, approximately 500 students of ages 3 through 18 attend the school and receive instruction following the British National Curriculum. The Swaminarayan School also offers courses in religious studies as part of other religious studies with a focus on Hinduism, classical Indian music, and South Asian languages. Students study the Swaminarayan scriptures and are encouraged to participate in daily prayers as well as Hindu and other religious festivals like Christmas. The Independent Schools Inspectorate judged the school as excellent in all years in a full inspection in October 2014. The official report said, \\"The Swaminarayan School enables pupils to obtain excellent standards in their work and to develop outstanding qualities as young people. They combine this with achieving excellent results in public examinations throughout the school. Pupils in the EYFS receive an outstanding preparation for the move into Year 1. Excellent teaching throughout the school supports pupils’ academic progress, and provides a good focus on meeting different pupils’ needs. Both at GCSE and in the sixth form, pupils benefit from first class curricular arrangements, and from a wide-ranging programme of activities.\\" “At GCSE pupils achieve three times as many A*/A grades as the national average. At A Level the proportion of pupils gaining A*/B was higher than the national average for maintained schools.” The contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision is excellent.\\" “The quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians, is excellent. The leadership of the school provides a clear moral compass, which guides every aspect of school life. The quality of governance is excellent. Governors bring considerable commitment and expertise to their work. History The school was founded in 1991 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj with the aim of promoting Hindu cultures, values, and way of life. Since its creation, it has been visited by many famous people, including Tony Blair, General Sir Richard Dannatt GCB, The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall. The School Building was formerly part of Sladebrook High School which closed down in 1990. At its founding, the school was located on a 3.2 acre area and its initial student body included 315 pupils of ages of 2–17. As of 2015, 500 pupils attend the school. Also as of 2015, the school's head- teacher is Nilesh M. Manani and Dipak Patel is the Governor for the school.http://swaminarayan.brent.sch.uk/uploads/B53%20SMSC%20Policy.pdf Approximately 40% of the students’ tuition fees are paid by the BAPS Organization, in line with its socio-spiritual aims. Since the school's inception, students have primarily been of Indian background. The school has participated in many student diversity initiatives across the United Kingdom. For instance, it is a partner in the Football Association's community initiatives to involve more Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students playing and school is a scouting ground for recruiting more talent. The Swaminarayan School has announced it will shut in 2020, due to lack of demand and thus lack of private funding for the school. Curriculum It follows the National Curriculum of the United Kingdom, while promoting aspects of Hinduism and Hindu culture, such as dance, music in the form of Tabla, Harmonium and others as well as language. The Swaminarayan School has achieved first place in London in the Independent Schools League Tables published by The Daily Telegraph on 13 January 2011. Nationally, the school was ranked fourth amongst all independent schools across the UK.  General Curriculum  Students learn a broad range of subjects in Years 7 and 8 which is narrowed down at Year 9.http://swaminarayan.brent.sch.uk/uploads/senior-school-curriculum.pdf According to the school’s brochure, the school commences teaching the GCSE syllabus a year earlier in order to challenge the students and ensure greater success. To achieve this, science courses in Physics, Chemistry and Biology are offered separately. Other subjects offered include Geography, English, French, Religious Studies, Drama and Physical Education.  Cultural focus of curriculum The Swaminarayan School’s curriculum emphasises the ethics, culture, and epistemology of Hinduism in both its Prep School and Senior School. Every student takes instruction in religious studies, dedicating approximately 10% of class time towards it. Hinduism is studied from a pluralistic understanding with an emphasis on the Swaminarayan and Vaishnava traditions. Students receive training on texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Shikshapatri, and Upanishads. Other religions studied include Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism. Every student receives instruction in the Gujarati language until they reach the 10th level. Students may elect to take lessons in Indian performing arts such as tabla, harmonium, and singing.  Academic Achievements/Rankings  In 2010, the BBC ranked the school 23rd in the United Kingdom for best GCSE-level results in school league tables. The average GCSE points per student at the school was a 609. In the same year, the Daily Telegraph ranked the Swaminarayan School second in the country based on the league of tables of independent schools. In 2011, the national network of Science Learning Centres, the Association for Science Education, and the Wellcome Trust awarded a Gold standard to the Swaminarayan School for achieving a Primary Science Quality Mark. The programme provides a rubric for primary schools across the UK to evaluate and improve the science component in their respective curriculum. Schools are eligible to achieve bronze, silver or gold awards.  Extracurricular activities   Studies of the Performing Arts (Music, Dance, Drama)  The Swaminarayan School allocates two periods of its regular school day towards the performing arts by offering courses in instructional instrument practice (Indian & European), singing of cultural songs (bhajans), and traditional Indian dance (Kathak, Raas, and Garba). The Performing Arts Department has established itself both in the school's central curriculum in addition to encouraging students’ extra-curricular pursuits. The programme was named a finalist by the National Festival of Music for Youth for four consecutive years. The programme derives much of its support from both the parent body and the local Gujarati community. The students are encouraged to take instruction in an instrument in addition to their academic studies through a programme that offers a degree course and diploma in Indian music. Students of the school are introduced to a variety of instrumental styles, ranging from the traditional dhol to octopad fusion music. The school offers coursework in drama studies to students starting Year 7.. The school also operates a theatre company, known as the SSTC, that puts on several performances throughout the academic year. The department has won the independent school Association (ISA) Drama Competition numerous times. The school collaborates closely with the Performing Arts Department and London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).  Sports and Athletic Club Activities The school offers a diverse variety of athletic and sports-based activities, both during and after school hours. The programmes are oriented towards both competitive and recreational play. The school provides the facilities and equipment to traditional individual and team sports: football (soccer), rugby, cricket, hockey, volleyball, netball, basketball, tennis, golf, and badminton in addition to other health & fitness related activities: orienteering, gymnastics, trampolining, sailing, kayaking, canoeing, archery, fencing, indoor climbing, and hiking/mountaineering.  Community service  Upon 21 January 2015, the Swaminarayan School of London sent gifts to the Wings of Hope project school in Chennai, India for the winter holidays. Similar to this the school works to aid the community through volunteer work, alongside partner organisation BAPS charities. Pupils annually take part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Silver Award Scheme with many completing their service elements in local Hospices, Charity shops and Local Communities.

Pippard was the son of a carpenter and joiner and spent much of his early life helping his father on construction sites. Initially supposed to follow his father into the family business, Pippard instead decided to study for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Bristol, supporting himself with an Exhibition award. Pippard worked for a Bristol based consulting engineer and for the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Joint Water Board in his early career. He also completed his master's degree during this period. At the start of the First World War Pippard joined the Admiralty Air Department where he studied aircraft stresses. After the war he joined an aeronautical engineering consultancy with many of his colleagues and was involved in accident investigation cases. He gained his Doctorate of Science from Bristol in 1920 and took up the chair in Civil Engineering at University College, Cardiff in 1922. This began a long career in academia at Cardiff, Bristol and Imperial College during which he was responsible for the analysis of the methods used in the design of the R100 and R101 airships. The public enquiry into the latter's crash, which ended British participation in airship development, found no faults with Pippard's work but he withdrew from the field of aeronautical engineering – feeling keenly the loss of several of his friends amongst the 48 dead. During the Second World War Pippard was a member of the Civil Defence Research Committee which met at Princes Risborough and continued his teaching at Imperial College. Pippard was a member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers for fifteen years and was their president for the 1958-9 session. During his later career he chaired the fifteen-year investigation into pollution in the Thames tideway the length of which he was criticised for by the press. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and was pro- rector of Imperial college for the next year. He retired in 1956 and began a lecture tour of the United States and received honorary degrees from Bristol, Birmingham and Brunel Universities. Early life and training Alfred John Sutton Pippard was born on 6 April 1891 in Yeovil and was the son of Alfred Pippard, a carpenter, joiner and devout Baptist. His family had a strong connection with the construction industry and included masons, stonecutters and plasterers. The elder Alfred was a renowned craftsman and worked on Yeovil Post Office, the offices of the Western Gazette, Yeovil Girls' High School, a bank in Weymouth and several private houses, often working as his own architect and drawing up the plans. During his youth the younger Alfred helped his father on several building sites. Alfred attended several kindergarten schools before progressing to Yeovil School after which it was presumed that he would enter into the family business. However he particularly enjoyed his studies and wished to further them, to that end he applied to study at the Merchant Venturers College (which would become the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Bristol in 1909). He spent one year working for a local architect and engineer and studying for the London Matriculation exam which he passed in the summer of 1908 and started at the college in the autumn of that year. During the Easter vacation of his first year at Bristol Pippard's father died and the family was put under great financial strain. With three siblings still at school it was only Pippard's winning of the Proctor Baker Exhibition with the accompanying payment of his tuition fees that allowed him to continue his studies. He graduated from Bristol with first class honours in 1911. Apprenticeship The laws of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) at the time required prospective members to undertake articled work for two years for a corporate member and Pippard arranged to work for Mr Cotterell of Bristol, the father of one of his friends who he had undertaken work for with his father as a joiner. However the family finances were still poor and his mother could not afford to provide him with his keep for two years and pay the premium that all apprenticeships entailed. Fortunately the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 had just started an industrial bursary scheme and invited applications from universities across the country. Bristol University submitted Pippard's name and he was accepted as one of ten successful applicants from across the country. With the financial security provided by the bursary Pippard began work at Cotterell's offices in 1911. One of his first jobs was to design the steelwork for a warehouse in Bristol on which he gave a talk to the local students association of the ICE in 1913 for which he was awarded the Miller Prize and a set of drawing instruments which he used for the rest of his life. He completed his apprenticeship in 1913 and obtained a position as assistant engineer to the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Joint Water Board, he did not enjoy this routine work and disliked his district. To continue his interest in civil engineering he began a master of science dissertation on masonry dams which he wrote at evenings and weekends. This was submitted to his alma mater in April 1914, was approved and he subsequently received his MSc. He began repaying his mother's financial assistance in 1915 and deeply regretted her death in 1921 before he could make any substantial contribution to her retirement. Admiralty Air Department R38 airship wreckage A few months after the start of World War I Pippard resigned from the water board with the intention of helping the war effort. His poor eyesight barred him from a commission in the Royal Engineers so he entered his name of a register organised by the Institution of Civil Engineers to place their members in appropriate wartime jobs. Pippard's name was brought to the attention of HC Watts, who was a university classmate and a member of the technical section of the Admiralty Air Department. Pippard accepted a post as a technical advisor to the director of the department in January 1915. Pippard's work with the department was to analyse stresses in airframes to ensure that they could survive the rigours of aerial combat, the work was of great importance to the war effort and he often found himself working for ten to twelve hours at a time. In December 1917 he married Olive Field, also from Yeovil, and they moved into a flat together at Earls Court, London. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours of 1918. Pippard joined an engineering consultancy in 1919 which was set up by Alec Ogilvie, an Air Department engineer, and several colleagues. Later that year Pippard and JL Pritchard, another colleague, wrote Aeroplane Structures which became a standard reference for aeronautical engineers and was revised in 1935. For this work, amongst others, he was awarded a Doctorate of Science by Bristol University in 1920. The firm was awarded several accident investigation contracts such as investigating the failure of the Tarrant Tabor triplane and the R38 airship disaster but was unable to win many large contracts due to the military and large aeronautical firms controlling the market. Pippard preferred his work as a visiting lecturer at Imperial College, London which he had started in 1919 and applied, and was accepted, for the chair of engineering at University College, Cardiff in 1922. He also wrote a series of scripts for radio broadcasts, including two made for schools.AIM25 archive material Academic life R101 test flight Upon arriving at Cardiff Pippard set about modernising the department and attracting research opportunities. Pippard's most important research client was the Aeronautical Research Committee which agreed to pay the salary of a full-time assistant from January 1924. During this time Pippard and his assistant, John Baker, worked on proving the methods used to analyse airship frames which were proposed for use on the R100 and R101 airships. In 1928 Pippard was invited to take over the chair of civil engineering at Bristol University which he accepted. At Bristol Pippard implemented many of the modernising methods he has developed at Cardiff and continued his work on the R100 and R101. He took part in the first test flight of the R101 but due to political pressure for quick development he was unable to finish his structural report before the R101 crashed on her final test flight on 5 October 1930, spelling the end for airship development in the United Kingdom. The public enquiry found that there were no faults with the airship's structure or the design methods employed by Pippard. However Pippard was so affected by the episode, particularly as several of his friends were among the 48 dead, that he withdrew from the field of aeronautical engineering and thereafter concentrated on civil engineering. He moved to Imperial College in London in 1933 and took over the running of the civil engineering department there where he actively encouraged a more research centric teaching method. This attitude was demonstrated in a paper presented to the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1935 in which he states that \\"University years should be devoted to the study of engineering science with as little emphasis as possible on the practical interests of the work\\". Pippard himself remained involved with the department's research, being particularly interested in the structural aspects of dams. Pippard was also influential in the career of Letitia Chitty, recruiting the then promising mathematician to work at the Admiralty Air Department during World War I, an experience that prompted her to switch to engineering. She later joined Pippard at Imperial College working on aircraft and airship structural analysis projects. Second World War In April 1939, predicting the approaching war, Pippard joined the Civil Defence Research Committee at the invitation of Sir John Anderson, Lord Privy Seal and minister in charge of air raid precautions. At the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 he was assigned to the research and experiments section located in Princes Risborough. The section had little work to do and Pippard found himself bored, especially compared to his frantic work with the Air Department during the First World War. Fortunately the government's decision to allow university students to complete their degrees before compulsory national service meant that Pippard could spend four days of his week lecturing at Imperial College whilst remaining a member of the committee, a practice he continued for the rest of the war. Post-war Pippard's name on the list of Institution of Civil Engineers presidents, at their One Great George Street headquarters Pippard was elected to the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1944 in which he continued to sit for the next fifteen years, advocating an increased academic presence in that body. His dedication to the institution led to his election as president for the 1958-9 session. In 1946 he introduced concrete and soil mechanics lecturers to the staff of Imperial College for the first time.Imperial College biography In 1951 he was appointed by Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Local Government and Planning, to investigate pollution in the Thames tideway. This was a highly complex task which involved fifteen years of detailed investigation for which he was, perhaps unfairly, ridiculed in the press. Pippard was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and became pro-rector (assistant to the rector) of Imperial College the next year. After a year in this capacity Pippard retired in September 1956. Retirement Upon retirement Pippard began a series of visiting lectures at Northwestern University in Illinois, United States. During his time in the US Pippard also delivered lectures at Berkeley, Purdue, Harvard and Urbana. Upon returning from America he took on the duties of the president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which included a two-month visit to South Africa. In 1966 Pippard was awarded honorary degrees from both Bristol and Birmingham Universities and from Brunel University in 1968. Pippard continued to write on the theory of structures throughout his retirement and over the course of his life authored (or co-authored) more than 80 academic papers and six books. Towards the end of his life he began writing an autobiography which remained unfinished on his death. Pippard died in Putney, London on 2 November 1969 and the memorial service was held at St. Margaret's Church in Westminster.

Listeners with less patience for music theory -- and Zorn skeptics -- should save Pool for later, because it will not win anyone over; nor will the compositional theories become more clear upon listening.

Greener as a target round for the Martini Cadet rifle.Barnes, Frank C., Cartridges of the World, 7th Edition, p305 Firing a 120 grain heeled lead projectile at 1350 ft/s the round is similar in performance to the .32-20 Winchester and some rifles may chamber both rounds with some accuracy.Donnelly, John J., Handloaders Manual of Cartridge Conversions, p360 The full metal jacketed round was used in cadet rifles in Australia and New Zealand after early 20th-century Defence Acts. In New Zealand, after the start of the Boer War, a cadet corps had been started; by 1901 it was recommended that membership be compulsory. 500 Westley-Richards miniature Martini–Henry rifles were available by October 1902 (Auckland Star), and 5000 by April 1903 (Star). Such rifles gained popularity in Australia, New Zealand and the United States when thousands of Martini Cadet rifles were sold by the Australian government after World War II.  Current Use  After being sold by the Australian government many were converted to sporting or target rifles, often re-barreled to calibers like .22 Hornet, .218 Bee, .25-20 Winchester, .222 Rimmed, .357 Magnum and others to .22 rimfire by gun makers like Sportco. Those still using the .310 Cadet have to either buy cases to reload, by Bertram Bullet Co. in Victoria, Australia, or several small independent ammunition makers in Australia and the United Kingdom. However these new .310 Cadet cases are 3-4 times as expensive as new .32-20 Winchester cases, hence shooters modify .32-20 cases, as a cheaper alternative. Modifications involve length resizing, and in most cases reducing the rim thickness. Due to the .310 using a heeled projectile, the neck thickness of the .32-20 does not have to be reamed down, after first being case length resized to 1.075\\" (27.3 mm). Most .310 cadet chambered rifles need to have the rim of the .32-20 case reduced from 0.065\\" to 0.045\\" (1.7 mm to 1.14 mm), to allow proper head spacing and operation of rifle. However, in the unusual instance of a lever action .32-20 fitted with a .310 barrel, the rifle will cycle better without the case rim thickness being reduced.

It is asserted by some to be from ninth-century in date, while other scholars have argued for a tenth- or even early eleventh-century dating. It has illuminations including three full page miniatures and also contains numerous annotations in both Latin and Old Irish. In the tradition of Irish psalters, the 150 psalms are divided into three groups of fifty, each headed by a full-page miniature facing a text page with decorated initial and border. The figures in the miniatures are highly stylised in the tradition of Irish manuscripts at this time, and painted in a palette of yellow, purple and red. The three full page miniatures show David in two scenes with animals, a Crucifixion of Jesus and David and Goliath.

Robot motion is more easily done with wheels, but this robot was designed specifically to study human walking. It is 130 cm tall and weights 15 kg. Flame is a continuation of Denise, another walking robot developed at Delft University, which featured in a Science article in 2005. Just like Denise, Flame walks through controlled falling. It does not try to keep balance, but accepts that it loses balance and reacts to that by placing a foot such that it will stop the fall. Do this continuously, and the result is walking. The idea is that humans walk in the same manner. Flame uses just a little more energy than a human of the same weight. It turned out Flame walked most efficiently if the 'rear heel' is lifted the moment the 'front heel' hits the ground. Humans do the same. Flame works differently from Japanese robots, which are generally based on assembly line robots and know exactly what to do when because the environment is fixed. For example, they can walk up stairs quite impressively, but only the set of stairs that they have been programmed for. According to Hobbelen this approach is a dead end. Flame is more flexible and reacts to changing circumstances.

Baltasar de Echave Orio (late 16th century - mid-17th century) was a Basque Spanish painter. As there was a painter of the same name, thought to be his son, he is known as Echave the Elder. Life He was born at Zumaya, Guipuzcoa, Spain, and became one of the earliest Spanish artists to reach Mexico, arriving at about the same time, near the end of the 16th century, as Sebastian Arteaga and Alonzo Vasquez. As was tradition for young men of that time, his wife, also a painter, was his instructor. He died in Mexico. His son was Baltasar de Echave Ibía and his grandson was Baltasar de Echave Rioja, both painters.Jonathan Brown, \\"From Spanish to New Spanish Painting, 1550-1700\\" in Painting in Latin America, 1550-1820, Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds.

In the cathedral is his \\"Candelaria\\" and a \\"San Sebastian\\", believed to be by his wife. Among the smaller paintings of Echave is one of San Antonio Abad with St. Paul, the first hermit. The artist also had a reputation as an author, among his works being one on the Basque language (Discursos de la antigüedad de la lengua cántabra Bascongada, Mexico, 1607).

He was the captain of the Greece Under-19 team. He plays in a central midfield role predominantly, although he is capable of playing as a left midfielder and also as an attacking midfielder. Club career Iraklis Papadopoulos started out his career at Iraklis as a trainee. His second season was a very impressive one, catching the eye of major Greek teams in 2007–08, which eventually earned him a move to Olympiacos on 3 June 2008. The transfer fee was thought to be around 800,000 Euros. Papadopoulos is left-footed, and his main strength is his powerful shot which he uses to great effect by often shooting from long distances. Olympiacos On 5 October 2008, Papadopoulos became a man as he made his Olympiakos debut as a substitute for teammate Dudu Cearense against city rivals AEK Athens. He impressed, having played a creative role in the second goal of Olympiakos' 2–0 win. After he had terminated his contract with Olympiacos in July 2011, he switched to Dynamo Dresden. Dynamo Dresden On 12 August 2011 he debuted with the club in a victorious 4–0 home win against Union Berlin. His first year in 2. Bundesliga was an impressive one having 24 appearances, 15 as a starter. Unfortunately the period 2012/13 was mostly a substitute, therefore after he had terminated his contract with Dynamo Dresden in July 2013, he signed a 1-year contract with Aris, returning to Super League. Aris He made his debut with the club on 18 August in an away loss from Apollon Smyrni. On 2 March 2014 Papadopoulos terminates his contract with the club, signing with the Polish club Cracovia. There will have the opportunity to find a mate from Greek Super League,the former Croatian central defender of Panthrakikos Tomislav Mikulic. \\" Aris F.C. announces the termination of cooperation with the footballer Yannis Papadopoulos. The management team would like to thank the 24 years' old for his contribution and wishes him continued success in his career\\" said the announcement of the club. Papadopoulos had informed his coach Soulis Papadopoulos for his intention to leave the club due to serious economic problems and that was the reason that was not among the starting XI in the home game against OFI. Cracovia On 1 March 2014 he signed a one and a half-year contact with the Polish club Cracovia. He made his debut with the club on March, 17 in a 1–0 home win against Jagiellonia Białystok and a week later he scored the only goal in a 1–1 away draw against Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biała. At the end of the 2013/14 season Cracovia announced the end of cooperation with the Greek midfielder due to financial disagreements. Career in Israel On 11 July 2014, Papadopoulos signed a one-year contact with the Israeli football club Bnei Sakhnin F.C. playing for Israeli Premier League. In February 2015, he signed for the rest of the season with the Israeli club Hapoel Acre. During this period Hapoel Acre began to show a different face making a championship rally, as in the next nine games, managed to lose only from Hapoel Tel Aviv counting 5 wins and 4 draws. Papadopoulos described as \\"multi-tool\\" from the sports press, as in addition to defensive midfielder role in the game, he could play both as central back as well as an attacking midfielder, and with his goals helped his team in that achievement. As a result of this outstanding performance one of the biggest sports' sites in the country («sports.walla») indicate that his acquisition was crucial for the club, a fact that is also acknowledged from the team coach, Shlomi Dora, who in an interview he gave on the same site asked what were the five key moments of the year and of course stated that the acquisition of the Papadopoulos is one of them. \\"I had seen Yiannis several times at Bnei Sakhnin F.C. and I think he is an excellent player, so when his contract expired, we moved immediately for his acquisition and we have not been disappointed\\" he said among others. On 16 July 2015 signed to Hapoel Kfar Saba On 20 December 2015, he scored his first goal in the season, helping his club to escape with a 1-1 draw against Maccabi Haifa. On 30 April 2016, he scored with an incredible left kick in a 2-1 home win against Ironi Kiryat Shmona. Veria On 2 August 2016, he signed a year contract with Greek club Veria for an undisclosed fee, returning in Superleague after 2,5 years. Nea Salamina On 21 June 2017, he signed a two years contract with Cypriot club Nea Salamina for an undisclosed fee.

Works by Meijer are on view at the Jewish Historical Museum and the Kattenkabinet cat museum in Amsterdam, among others. Sal or \\"Sally\\" Meijer was born at Zwanenburgwal 10 as the son of Jewish diamond- cutters. In his youth, he worked in the diamond industry while studying art. He devoted himself full-time to painting in 1914. His first one-man exhibition was in 1926. His marriage to the non-Jewish Liesje Giehl in 1930 caused so much friction with his parents that he moved out of his parents' home and moved the following year to the village of Blaricum, which had a vibrant artists' community. Following the German occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, Meijer was banned from exhibiting his paintings; however, his mixed marriage enabled him to survive the war. In 1957, he was honored at a ceremony by the Blaricum artists' society to mark his 80th birthday. At this occasion, the Dutch state purchased one of his paintings, depicting the Raamgracht canal in Amsterdam. In 1958, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam presented an overview of his work. After his death in 1965, a memorial exhibition was held at Zeist palace. Meijer was buried at the Jewish cemetery in Muiderberg. Due to the simplicity of Meijer's paintings and his modest attitude - he did not regard his paintings as works of art but as craftmanship - his work was often labeled as \\"naive\\" and \\"primitive\\". However, a re- evaluation of his work began in 1957 with the article \\"Onze grootste moderne primitief - Schilder van betekenis\\" (\\"Our greatest modern primitive - Painter of importance\\") by Kasper Niehuis. The book Sal Meijer, zo naïef nog niet (\\"Sal Meijer, not that naive\\") by Agnes Grondman followed in 1986. In 1990, a small book about his paintings of cats was published, Sal Meijer: Raphaël der katten (\\"Sal Meijer: Raphael of cats\\") by Nicole Ex. (The title Raphael of Cats had previously been given to Swiss artist Gottfried Mind (1768–1814)).Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1898 And in 2007, an exhibition of never before-shown drawings and oil paintings by Meijer and Melle Oldeboerrigter was held at the Amsterdam artists' society Arti et Amicitiae.

An organist at St. Peter's Abbey in Salzburg, he lived in Vienna from 1815, and was in 1846 the conductor of the Court Orchestra. Assmayer was a friend of Franz Schubert. Life Assmayer was born at Salzburg. He studied under Andreas Brunmayr and Michael Haydn, and later, when he went to Vienna, he received further instruction from Joseph Leopold Eybler. In 1808 he was organist at St. Peter's in Salzburg, and here he wrote his oratorio \\"Die Sündfluth\\" (The Deluge) and his cantata \\"Worte der Weihe\\". Some time after his move to Vienna, in 1815, he became choirmaster at the Schotten Kirche, and in 1825 was appointed imperial organist. After having served eight years as vice-choirmaster, he received in 1846 the appointment of second choir-master to the Court, as successor to Joseph Weigl. He died in Vienna. Works His principal oratorios, \\"Das Gelübde\\", \\"Saul und David\\", and \\"Sauls Tod\\", were repeatedly performed by the Tonkünstler-Societät, of which he was conductor for fifteen years. He also wrote fifteen masses, two requiems, a Te Deum, and various smaller church pieces. Of these, two oratorios, one mass, the requiems, and Te Deum, and furthermore sixty secular compositions, comprising symphonies, overtures, pastorales, etc., were published. In the 1820s, he was one of 50 composers to write a Variation on a theme of Anton Diabelli for Part II of the Vaterländischer Künstlerverein. Part I was devoted to the 33 variations supplied by Beethoven, which have gained an independent identity as his Diabelli Variations, Op. 120. As to his style, Grove calls it correct and fluent, but wanting in both invention and force. References * Susanne Antonicek: Ignaz Assmayr (1790 – 1862).

When completed at the end of 2009, the power station was to consist of 26 solar dishes, each one 14 metres high, which would track the arc of the Sun. The power plant was to generate about 1860 megawatt-hours per year, 13 per cent of Coober Pedy's total electricity requirements. It would cut Diesel fuel consumption by up to 520,000 litres a year, saving 1,500 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.$7.1M Solar power plant for Coober Pedy The Government had negotiations with two proponents and failed to convince either of the viability of the project. The project never proceeded. In 2014, a new proposal was raised to create a hybrid solar, wind and Diesel power system for Coober Pedy. The contract was let to Energy Developments without an open tender process. The project will convert Coober Pedy's electricity from being generated 100% from Diesel to only 30% Diesel, with the other 70% provided by the combination of renewable energy sources.

In 1996, a second building with a roll off roof (the Ingham Family Rooms) was constructed. This contained a second hand 10\\" Meade LX-200 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. In August 2011, the 10\\" Meade in the Inghams building was replaced by a 14\\" Meade LX-200 GPS-ACF. This was purchased with a grant from the Education Minister (Jay Weatherill), topped up with fund raising money from the STAR Group. The observatory also houses a portable 10\\" Dobsonian, a 90mm computerised SkyWatcher refractor and two Coronado solar telescopes. In April 2012, the Heights School purchased a research-grade, 12.5\\" space-certified Ritchey–Chrétien built by Optical Guidance Systems. That replaced the 14\\" LX200 in the roll off roof building, and in July 2012 the 14\\" LX200 was installed in the Dome, in place of the old ASSA 12\\" Dall-Kirkham, which was moved to ASSA's Stockport Observatory for storage.  Current Activities  A group of students known as the STAR Group learns astronomy at an advanced level, both in theory and practice. Students are actively involved with the observatory. In 2011, a Yr 12 Student used the original 10\\" LX200 and an 8bit DMK camera to detect the transit of an Exo- planet as his SACE Research Project. Once a month on the Friday night nearest the First Quarter Moon, the Astronomical Society of South Australia holds a public viewing night at the observatory, where members of the general public can visit the observatory to view the night sky through the observatory's telescopes and telescopes brought in by members of ASSA. Members of STAR Group demonstrate real time imaging on their Research Grade OGS telescope, and show the Public through the 14\\" LX200 in the Dome and the portable scopes.

Like most English universities, Bristol evolved from earlier institutions, most notably University College, Bristol (founded 1876), Bristol Medical School (1833) and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (founded as a school 1595 and which became the university engineering faculty. Beginnings Henry Overton Wills was influential in allowing Bristol to gain a royal charter As early as 1906 Conwy Lloyd Morgan had stated his intention to give up the principalship of University College, Bristol. Sir Isambard Owen, nephew of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, became the first vice-chancellor of the university and worked upon the detail of the university's charter. Owen is also credited with the design of the university gowns, with the colour said to have been based upon the colour of the rocks of the Avon Gorge after rain.Cartleton 1984 p. 28. One area of early controversy was the re- advertising of some chair positions and the decision not to give one, Cowl, a reappointment. This caused the resignation of the Chair of Physics, Arthur P. Chattock. Henry Overton Wills became the first chancellor of the university. On Wills' death, Haladane was invited to succeed him. The installation of Haladane was used to honour all those who had been involved in the creation of the university and 70 honorary degrees were awarded by the university. This act, coming from a university not yet three years old caused some controversy and led to public criticism of the university in The Observer. After the death of their father, Henry Wills and George Wills donated money for the building of a university building in memory of their father. He met with George Oatley (later Sir George Oatley) to plan the building of what was to become the Wills Memorial Building which the brothers requested would be built to last for 400 years.Cartleton 1984 p34 When the Wills family acquired Royal Fort gardens as a site they were given to the university and were to be the site of a castle like building which became the physics department. Expansion In 1911, George Wills acquired the athletic ground at Coombe Dingle and in 1920 he bought the Victoria Rooms which became the Students' Union building. World War I caused a financial crisis with the university losing around 20% of its fee income but the government agreed to make up this loss because of important contributions which Bristol made to the study of poison gas and explosives. Economic problems continued after the war when it was announced that government funding of universities was to be cut. On 9 June 1925, the Wills Memorial Building was officially opened by King George V and Mary. Paul Dirac was the first academic from the University of Bristol to be awarded a Nobel Prize It was during the interwar years that Bristol's reputation as a university began to increase. In 1920 Helen Wodehouse was appointed as Chair of Education, the first woman to be appointed in such a role, and in 1928 Winifred Lucy Shepland was appointed as the first woman registrar of any British university. The growing strength was exemplified by the \\"poaching\\" of academics from other universities and the award of a Nobel Prize to Bristol graduate Paul Dirac for his work on quantum mechanics. From the early years of its formation, the university brought higher education to working people, with H. G. Leonard, a lecturer in history, becoming president of the Bristol branch of the Workers' Educational Association. After the war, government grants allowed the setting up of departments of extramural adult education. Bristol University also began to have an effect on the city of Bristol, when the university laboratories and the city laboratories combined to train health visitors at Canynge Hall. This had a pronounced effect on the City of Bristol's health, with death rates halving to 11 per 1,000 and the infant mortality rate falling from 165 per 1000 to 57 per 1000.Cartleton 1984, p. 45. However, the state of the medical school was described by the Ministry of Health described it as being at \\"sixes and sevens\\". The problem was the continuing rivalry between the General Hospital and Bristol Royal Infirmary, Sir George Wills had offered to build a new university hospital if the two could resolve their differences but this failed to create an agreement between them. Scientific discovery The 1920s and 1930s saw great scientific breakthroughs in the chemistry and physics departments. Sir Nevil Mott arrived from the University of Cambridge . His work on \\"solid state physics\\" led to the development of the transistor and the growth of industry around solid state electronics. The physics department became home to the Sutton Group, which worked on klystron and magnetron valves (the latter important in the development of radar). A \\"future physics\\" professor, Peter Fowler, used his scientific knowledge to destroy German radar jamming devices during the war. After the war Tomas Lovejoy succeeded Isambard Owen as vice-chancellor after a short interim period. Lovejoy was responsible for the creation of a system whereby the appointment of professors was made by joint senate and council committees after the two organisations disagreed over his replacement as Chair of Physics. Damage occurred to the Wills Memorial Building during the war caused then chancellor to give a defiant speech. Loveday remained as vice- chancellor despite being past retirement age until the end of the war when he was replaced by Phillip Morris. Post-War era During the 1950s new buildings for the medicine and engineering departments were provided on St Michael's Hill. The geography department were able take over the old. A new chemistry building was also planned on the slopes of St Michael's Hill but the project ran into difficulty when Bristol City Council's compulsory purchase orders displaced some local residents. New buildings to be built in Berkeley Square caused similar complaints. These would become home of the Department of Education as it was clear that Royal Fort house would prove too small. Further expansion In the 1950s, the government indicated that it would give support to students being able to choose any university within the national system at which they could study. This loss of local students caused some to see the university as a kind of alien \\"intellectual colony\\" disconnected to the university.Cartleton, 1984, p. 60. The development made it necessary for the university to invest in student accommodation. Clifton Hill House had already been opened soon after the gaining of the charter and it operated as a girls' hall of residence and Wills Hall was opened in 1929. To cope with increasing student numbers Churchill Hall, Hiatt Baker Hall and Badock Hall were built. The 1960s saw a large increase in the number of British universities built after Harold Wilson was elected prime minister. Many of these new institutions received criticism but Bristol was now seen as an older more established institution and was able to embark on a period of academic expansion. There was a new Department of Inorganic Chemistry and a Department of Biochemistry. However the greatest expansions occurred in the arts with the creation of the drama, theology, sociology, politics, and social and economic history departments. Sir Phillip Morris retired in 1966 but during his time as vice-chancellor the university tripled in size and witnessed the building of many departments such as the School of Veterinary Science and the School of Architecture. Student protest In 1968 the first large scale student protest occurred when students staged a sit in over allegations that they were unable to control their own union. The protest lasted over the weekend. At this time the vice-chancellorship had passed to John Harris who was said to be nonplussed by the protest. However, he died one week later after collapsing in his office. Further disagreement between the university and the union occurred over the issue of \\"reciprocal membership\\" of the union meaning that any students from Bristol would be able to use the union. This escalated into an 11-day sit-in at Senate House which gained Bristol national headlines, although it has been argued that the protest enjoyed little student support.Cartleton, 1984, p. 71. Several protests occurred in Bristol in 2010 in response to government spending cuts in education, including the increasing of tuition fees, and the scrapping of Education Maintenance Allowance in England. On 24 November, approximately 2000 students from the university and nearby schools gathered outside of the university and marched through the streets of Bristol.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-11829989 This was followed by an occupation of the Students Union building by students who criticised the union for failing to represent them on these issues.http://bristoloccupation.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/statement-from-bristol- university.html (Main article: University of Bristol Union#History) On 7 December a second occupation occurred, this time in the central university building of Senate House. The students occupying the building made a list of demands, including \\"greater student representation in Senate meetings\\" and \\"That the Vice-Chancellor, Eric Thomas, write and send an open letter to the Government condemning cuts in the education budget and appealing to them not to implement these policies, and to publicly call for Vice-Chancellors across the country to unite against these cuts, any rise in tuition fees and the removal of Educational Maintenance Allowance and Aimhigher.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101209035928/http://bristoluniresistance.org.uk/2010/12/statement- of-bristol-university-occupation/ The occupiers received a considerable amount of support from members of staff.https://web.archive.org/web/20101213015725/http://bristoluniresistance.org.uk/category/all/solidarity/ The occupation ended on 17 December 2010, with students leaving voluntarily and stating: \\"Although the occupiers' main demand [...] was not met, the occupation has, in many ways, yielded much more meaningful outcomes than being granted particular requests by senior management.\\" Conservative cuts Under the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, funding for universities was cut and Bristol's income was reduced by some 15%. This resulted in the selective closure of some departments, including Russian, education and architecture. A compromise agreement was eventually found but this episode damaged the research strength of the university. Recent history In May 2009, Bristol celebrated its centenary. As part of the celebrations degrees were bestowed upon individuals who had given extraordinary service to the Bristol community.

Geography The church is located in the middle of town near all significant buildings. History Roman - Catholic Church with Paulin's monastery was built in late-baroque style in 1778 by J. G. Altenburg. This church has got a single-nave hall with segmented breech of presbyter and barrel-vault with groins. Facade of the church is divided by pilasters. The portal with profiled chambranle has got thin pilasters with a volute on a sett. This sett is based on these pilasters and it is also finished by cut profiled cornice with a cross. The tower built into the pinnacle facade is hidden by a ball-shaped polygonal lantern. In the inside of the church are fresco paintings by Fr. Sigrist (1778). The interior is designed in late- baroque style and the interspace is solved in a particular way of uniformity. In the western side breech of sacrarium is stucco relief of Godfather. The members of strictly catholic Palffy family, landlords of the town, were convinced to turn local Calvinists to the Catholic Church. The count in 1652 notified the city council, that he is about to build a monastery and that he would like to base the members of the friary of Saint Francis on his property in this area. The king Carl III. on 21 August 1720 accepted activities of Saint Francis' friary in Hungary, so it means the same for the Samorin town. Later on, these monks built, in 1778, their own monastery and church, which was the only church belonging to the Saint Frances' (Paulin's) friary in the Hungarian empire. In the school, which was based in the building of the monastery, German language was used for teaching in the second half of the 18th century.

For the final standard exams, a 'normal pass' is given for an average mark 50%-59%, and a distinction is given for an average of 80% or more. Most universities follow a model based on the British system. Thus, at the University of Cape Town and the University of South Africa (UNISA), the percentages are calibrated as follows: a 1st class pass is given for 75% and above, a second (division one) for 70 - 74%, a second (division two) for 60%-69%, and a third for 50 - 59%. Any lower than 40% is a fail. The University of the Witwatersrand considers an A to be 75% and above.

The church was constructed in stages between 1863 and 1870 and is a notable example of English Gothic Revival style with fittings in the Arts and Crafts style. It was designated Grade I listed building status in 1950. It was vested in The Churches Conservation Trust in 1981. Opening times vary and it's recommended that visitors contact The Churches Conservation Trust to find the current arrangement. History All Saints in the Jewry All Saints in the Jewry in 1841 opposite Trinity's chapel (far left) and St John's College gatehouse A mediæval church stood in St John's Street, Cambridge. This was known as All Saints in the Jewry, and previously as All Saints by the Hospital (due to its proximity to the Hospital of St John the Evangelist). This was to distinguish it from the other All Saints' Church in Cambridge at the time, All Saints by the Castle, now demolished. By the 13th century, the church was in the patronage of St Radegund's Nunnery, later re-established as Jesus College. The church was rebuilt several times but by the nineteenth century was deemed too small for the growing congregation, being able to accommodate less than 400 of the 1,400 people of the parish. Consisting of box pews, for which there was a levy, the poor were doubly excluded. A plot of land in Jesus Lane was donated by Jesus College and the new building was erected at its junction with Manor Road. The old church was demolished in 1865. The churchyard of the original church is now an open space known as All Saints' Garden and contains a memorial cross designed by Basil Champneys in 1882. The cross in All Saints Garden A new church Although it was initially hoped that George Gilbert Scott would design the new church. G. F. Bodley who had been Scott's talented pupil (and was later a founder of Watts & Co.), was chosen. The foundation stone was laid on 27 May 1863 and the church was consecrated on 30 November 1864. Between 1869 and 1871 the present tower and spire were added, with St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne, Derbyshire, used as the model. The final ornament was a weather vane, donated by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and fixed in place by the priest and author Herbert Mortimer Luckock, later Dean of Lichfield. The author and academic A. C. Bouquet was the parish priest from 1923 to 1945. By the early 1970s the congregation had reduced dramatically and regular services ceased in 1973. It lay redundant for several years and fell into disrepair, during which time plans to demolish part of the building arose. These were abandoned in 1981. Today the church is used during term time by the neighbouring theological college, Westcott House, and is also available to hire for secular events, such as art exhibitions, concerts and talks. Architecture The church's spire is a prominent Cambridge landmark. At around in height it was, at its construction, the tallest building in the city; it remains the city's third tallest building, after the chimney of Addenbrooke's Hospital and Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church. It is constructed from brick as well as Ancaster and Casterton stone. The church was built from a second series of designs and in an early 14th-century style. It consists of a nave, large south aisle which extends almost to the easternmost wall, a chancel and vestry. The exterior is decorated with gargoyles and the spire has decorative lucarne openings.  Interior  The church is noted for its strikingly decorated interior, much of it to designs by Bodley. Fittings by Bodley include the alabaster font, the pulpit, south aisle screen, textiles, pews, candlesticks and tiles. The rood screen was designed in 1904 by John Morley, architect at Rattee & Kett of Cambridge. Its function was not purely liturgical as its cornice hid a large support beam which had been added to bolster the chancel arch from the massive weight of the spire. The wall and ceiling decorations were applied by F. R. Leach & Sons and form complex, bold stencilled patterns throughout the church. As well as exotic floral friezes there is much use of religious symbolism such as the Sacred Monogram and the Fleur-de-lis. Around the upper walls are texts from the Book of Revelation () and Psalms in the south aisle, and the Beatitudes () in the nave. Part of the Beatitudes have been lost due to water damage to the plaster. One of the team of artists was David Parr who is known to have decorated his own house in similar style/designs. His residence is currently being restored and is due to open to the public in 2019. The east window was designed by Edward Burne-Jones and executed by Morris & Co. It was installed in 1866 as a memorial to Lady Affleck, wife of William Whewell, master of Trinity College, Cambridge. She had lain the foundation stone of the church in 1863 and also donated £1,000 to its construction. The twenty figures, over four rows, were individually designed by Burne-Jones (12 panes), Ford Madox Brown (4 panes) and William Morris (4 panes). The diagonal lettering and oak leaf borders were designed by Philip Webb. It is most notable for its high proportion of pale, silver-tint glass, which is believed to be a rebellion against the dark, rich colours prevalent in stained glass of the time. In the north wall of the nave are three windows by Charles Eamer Kempe and one by Douglas Strachan installed in 1944 which features depictions of Elizabeth Fry, Josephine Butler, Edith Cavell and Mother Cecile Isherwood. There are also two south aisle windows, one by Ward & Hughes and the other by Philip Webb with possible additions by F. R. Leach. High in the west end window are two angels - a sun bearer and a moon bearer designed and produced by William Morris.
