It is the fifth episode from Season 4, and the 70th episode overall. Plot Betty gets off the phone with Ignacio and is spooked by Matt, who came by to talk and as Betty thinks he's going to hug her, he straighten's her hair out. Betty then runs into Daniel, who talk about their plans for a lunch to help find Daniel's assistant. When Wilhelmina run's into the two, she is spooked by Daniel thanking her for being part of an event involving Tibetan orphans, and as she walks into her office she confronts Marc about him using her name to be the recipient, which will be held at her apartment. Marc hopes that the event will repair her image, even though Wilhelmina is cash-strapped. Later that evening, Daniel and Natalie talk about the assistant's job. Natalie seems to be interested in it. The next day, Matt asked Betty about going to the event, but with other people. This is what Betty didn't want to hear, but after she got off the phone with Hilda, she sees Daniel by her former desk to show off his new assistant...Natalie! Betty is stunned. Betty is not so sure about this and when Daniel asks her to help Natalie out she reluctantly agrees. Natalie is a quick learner and she waste no time removing anything with Betty's name on it, including her computer files and her answering machine greeting. Wilhelmina is totally clueless about being involved in an event for a cause that she no idea what they actually do, so Marc tries to help the press by making up the story of how she got into this mess as if she had been involved. When Wilhelmina gets a phone call from Nico, she races home, leaves Marc and the press to scratch their heads. As she returns to her apartment, both Wili and Nico are confronted by detective Castelar, who insists on a bribe to keep what he discovered (the blood stains) at the yacht quiet. Wilhelmina refuses and vows to go to great lengths to protect Nico. As she returned to the office, Wilhelmina dragged Marc into the fray by coming clean about Nico, then gave him Castelar's card to find any info on him. As Marc runs into Amanda that evening, they're interrupted by Matt, who asks Amanda for a favor, and Marc doesn't like it. Later the next day Matt asks Amanda about going to the party with him, if she was interested, which Amanda thought was a yes. Marc, not happy about whether Amanda will accept the offer, believes that going with Matt is wrong because Betty still may have feelings for Matt. Marc suggests that Amanda tells Betty the truth, but Amanda is afraid that it may hurt Betty's feelings. When Betty runs into Amanda at the desk, Amanda asks Betty if she was going to the event. When Betty told her she was, Amanda freaked out, even when Matt's name came up. Amanda then hides the truth from Betty when she learns that Matt haven't asked her out yet either by setting her up with potential dates. Betty turns down the offer, believing that Matt will ask her. During a meeting with Cal and Claire, Daniel is not happy with Cal's decision to cut corners on advertising by cutting a regular feature from the magazine. When Cal told him to calm down \\"Son\\", Daniel stopped there and told him he wasn't his son and Claire, looking as if she almost freaked out, ended the meeting. Claire and Cal believed that their affair might hurt their families but Claire, being upset over Cal's feelings about their affair, is not going to let this one come between her and Daniel. At lunch, Betty was shocked to see Daniel showing up with Natalie. This is not what Betty was expecting, even as Natalie interjects herself into the conversation. As Betty returned to the office, she tells Amanda that she will take up that offer of setting her up for the event, prompting Amanda to panic over that response. Also returning to the office was Daniel, who after looking at the layout and discovered several pages, including the regular feature that he wanted to keep in, missing, Megan told him that it was Claire who made the decision and when he walked into her office Daniel sees both his mother and Cal kissing. Daniel couldn't believe this and walks out on them after she tried to explain about her relationship with Cal. As he returned to his office, Natalie began to seed some theories in Daniel's mind by accusing his mother, Cal, and Betty (of whom she sees as an obstacle) of causing \\"Drama\\" for him. While Daniel doesn't believe that Betty would be that capable, Natalie assures him that she can be a problem and thinks that he needs to break away from Betty's grip. Over at Amanda's that evening, Betty is stunned by Amanda's choice of guys for Betty. It turns out that Amanda has been placing ads and Betty is not interested in any of these guys after one of them mentioned Betty's \\"ad\\" (placed by Amanda) on Craigslist. After she leaves the apartment, she gets a call from Claire for help. When Betty returns to the office to talk to Daniel, she is confronted by Natalie, who does her best to keep Betty away from him. As Daniel walked into the office, Betty tried to talk to him about what happened between him and his mother. But it appears that Daniel's feelings towards Betty has turned cold as Natalie watches, resulting in Betty leaving the office upset. Hours later at the Suarez home, Betty gets a call from Amanda to apologize. Believing that she was being a good friend, Betty tells Amanda that she won't be going to the event. Hilda and Justin believe Betty just made a mistake in not going, which prompts Betty to change her mind. So Justin decides to show off his \\"Project Runway Moment\\" by taking Hilda's dress that she can't fit in and redesign it for his aunt. In another part of town that same evening, Marc and Wilhelmina pay a visit to a brothel to get information on Castelar, but are shocked to learn that the person they thought was the one blackmailing her was the real Oskar Castelar and not the one Wilhelmina knew. However blocks away we see Nico walking by herself, when that \\"detective\\" shows up...and then they kiss! It turns out that Nico and the phony Castelar‚Äîwho happens to be her supposedly dead boyfriend Jonathan‚Äîare trying to extort money from Wilhelmina. Nico, believing that her mother has the money, is determined to play her in more ways than one. At the event that evening, Betty does go stag in a dress designed by Justin. But just as Amanda arrives to tell Betty the truth, they both see Matt with another woman. Both are surprised at this, but its Amanda's feelings that got hurt the most. Amanda decided at this point not to tell Betty about her feelings for Matt. When Matt ran into Amanda, he told her that she wasn't the only choice and that he wanted ask six other people out. Amanda, hearing that comment, felt like a fool and walked off. Betty also run into Daniel and Natalie, who then tells her that she wants to be friends. As Betty and Daniel patches things up, Natalie excuses herself to take a phone call. But as she answers the phone, it appears that something sinister is going down when Natalie informs whoever was on the other end of that cellphone that she will have Daniel under their control soon. It looks like host Wilhelmina is still not pleased at how she got railroaded into hosting this event and is afraid to go out and embarrass herself. When Nico confronts her mother and tells her that she will turn herself in, Wilhelmina insists on her not to. During the speech, Wilhelmina tells the crowd that she was honored to help with the event and saving the Tibetian orphans, saying that she will everything to help protect the children. That message not only sunk into Wilhelmina's mind, but also Claire's, who after leaving the event and still upset about over Cal's remarks about \\"not bringing a child into the world,\\" called the adoption agency to help find the son she had with Cal. Finally, at the dancefloor, Betty is swaying to La Roux's \\"Bulletproof\\" when Matt shows up to get a chance to talk things over, mostly about each other. However, Betty tells Matt that maybe its better that they remain just friends and they agree that would be best. As Betty goes stepping on the dancefloor to dance by herself, it appears that Matt's feelings for Betty are still there as he watches her dancing to Billy Idol's \\"Dancing with Myself\\".

It is the ninth episode of the show's sixth season and aired on November 29, 2009. Plot News of the murder of Emily, a waitress at a local Coffee Shop, shakes up the town. At the beginning of the episode Mary Alice narrates that Emily was very popular, and that everyone was shocked to learn that she was murdered. Then it is shown that everyone is gathered at the scene of the crime at \\"The Coffee Cup\\" were Emily was killed, then a mystery guy whose face is not shown is seen walking and unwrapping a chewing gum and throwing the chewing gum wrapper on the floor, as this scene plays out, Mary Alice narrates: \\"Yes, everyone in fairview now knew a killer was walking among them, and they would soon learn he wasn't finished\\", confirming that the killer is a male. Upon hearing the news of Emily's death, several women rally together and consider taking up defense classes as a means of personal protection. Julie, shaken at the idea that a second strangulation victim is now dead while she remains alive, expresses her concern in that even with self-defense training, there is no true guarantee that one will remain truly protected from the supposed serial killer should he strike again. In sympathy, Julie's father Karl decides to let his daughter borrow his car in exchange for hers as an extra safety precaution. This leads to Susan eventually finding Julie's car, without her knowledge of the vehicle exchange between her ex-husband and her daughter, at a local motel. This observation leads Susan to initially believe that Julie is secretly continuing her relationship with a married man but instead discovers something far more shocking: Bree's affair with Karl. At the first defense class with the ladies of Wisteria Lane, Susan confronts Bree and tells her that she knows about the affair. After a comical tussle sparks between the pair, Bree leaves the class early out of frustration against Susan's insistent claims of betrayal towards both Orson as well as their friendship, all while defending her reasons for continuing her affair with Karl. Later that evening, Susan invites Karl and Bree over to discuss their relationship. Despite Susan's arguments towards Karl's shortcomings as an inconsiderate husband during their marriage, Bree blurts out she in fact does love Karl and truly believes that he can change into someone even better than the man that he once was. Susan, sensing Bree's sincerity towards her confession, ultimately yet awkwardly gives her blessing to hers and Karl's relationship. Lynette arrives at work in the morning to a surprise farewell party from all of her co-workers with all of them believing that she is to depart sometime soon for her promotion in Florida. Lynette confronts Carlos about the celebration and defends her position by expressing her desire to continue her role as Senior Executive VP of the company and refusing to relocate. Carlos, knowing that he cannot legally fire Lynette due to her pregnancy, continues to offer her the option of quitting her job willingly with no strings attached despite her violation against company policy by lying about her condition in order to obtain a higher paying corporate role. Lynette's continued refusal to meet Carlos' demands prompts him to relocate Lynette's former office into a heavily cramped storage unit, with her junior associate claiming ownership of her former work area. Later that evening, both the Solises and the Scavos come up to opposing sides of the entire Lynette/Carlos confrontation: Gaby and Carlos wish to mend the growing rift in their 15-year-long relationship between the Scavos, while Lynette expresses her desire Tom about hitting Carlos with a lawsuit for his continued harassment against her in the workplace. Both couples eventually decide to sleep on their respective ideas and confront the other about them in the morning. The following day, Gaby shows up at the Scavo's doorstep with a few gifts and a genuine apology for Carlos's recent behavior on her behalf. This of course, occurs right when Carlos is given the papers from the Scavo's lawyer indicating that he is being sued. This unexpected action angers Gaby which causes the already fragile bond of friendship between the two couples to rip apart even further. The next day, Carlos assigns Lynette a large stack of paper work that is to be completed and submitted to his desk at 9:00AM the next day. Seeing as how Carlos expects her to essentially perform a 2-day task in only one night, Lynette argues that she would have to miss her daughter's School Christmas Pageant and stay up all night in order to accomplish the job. Carlos, with the advice and physical presence of a company legal representative, ignores her excuse and explains to her that since she believes that she is fit to maintain her position, she needs to complete her assignment in a \\"timely fashion\\" if she wants to keep her job; to which Lynette begrudgingly accepts. Later that night, Lynette abandons her work out of rebellion in order to attend Penny's Christmas Pageant. The following morning, Lynette's insubordination and inability to complete her assigned task prompts Carlos to now legally terminate her employment with the company as the verbal agreement that she had made between herself, Carlos and a legal representative had now been violated due to her actions. During a small, informal gathering at the Coffee Shop, the site of Emily's murder, with some of the younger residents of Wisteria Lane, Danny tries another attempt at asking Julie to go out on a date with him. Julie declines his offer by claiming that it wouldn't really work out between the two of them. Danny then reveals to Julie that he knows about the affair that she had with his father Nick and that even though the secret is now out in the open between the pair, he doesn't care about the entire matter and simply states that he just really likes her. Julie then infers to Danny that the entire situation of her dating her ex-lover's son with both of them being aware of the former relationship would be just too weird, which then causes Julie to stand by her decision of refusing to date Danny. A heartbroken Danny returns home to find his parents caught up in a heated argument. Angie reveals during this fight that she had previously killed a man and that the family is on the run ever since because of it. As the argument intensifies, Danny retreats up to the sanctity of his room. Later in the evening Angie finds her son passed out on his bed, believing him to be simply taking a nap. She then horrifyingly discovers an empty bottle of pills by his hands and shouts for the presence of her husband. After sometime in the hospital, Danny wakes up in the care of his designated nurse, Mona Clark, a neighbor on Wisteria Lane. She kindly greets him by name and offers him some refreshments, but Danny, while in a state of semi-consciousness, reveals to Mona that his real name is actually \\"Tyler.\\" M.J. finds Katherine crying on her porch which causes him to innocently voice his concern for her sadness. Later that day, a slightly morose M.J. tells his father Mike that despite being invited to an upcoming birthday party for one of his friends, he is actually somewhat sad because of his encounter with Katherine. This news causes M.J. to reveal that Katherine told him that she was crying because his mother Susan was a \\"bad person.\\" Mike, realizing that Katherine had now resorted to babbling about her infidelity delusions to his 6 year old son, confronts her about it and threatens her to never to talk to M.J. again. However, in spite of Mike's warning, Katherine picks up M.J. from his friend's birthday party the next day without his father's consent which prompts Mike to rush over Katherine's in an instant. Upon his arrival, he finds Katherine harmlessly feeding M.J. some freshly cooked lasagna to which Mike angrily tells M.J. to immediately go home without question. With his son out of sight, Mike finally puts his foot down and commands Katherine to put a stop to her outrageous behavior. Katherine defends herself by claiming that on top of loving M.J., the love that she had, and continues to still have for Mike is real. Mike then coldly responds by claiming that he had never truly loved her and that even though he was with Katherine in body during their entire relationship, all he ever thought about was Susan. In her despair, Katherine then takes a nearby kitchen knife, directs it towards her chest and disturbingly pleads for him to kill her, reasoning that her death would be a less painful matter than her heartbreak. Instead of agreeing, Mike refuses to comply with Katherine's death wish by stating that he doesn't care about her enough to kill her. Following Mike's leave from her house, Katherine then calls 911, shakily telling the operators that she requires immediate medical attention from blood loss. After hanging up, it is only then when the now emotionally fragile Katherine proceeds with the act of her desperation: by stabbing herself with the same knife that she had previously offered to Mike.

He belonged to the Nadia Raj family. According to 1968‚Äôs History of Bengal: Mughal period, 1526-1762, Krishnachandra was ‚Äúthe most important man of the period in the Hindu society of Bengal.‚Äù He is credited not only with his resistance to the Mughal rule, but with his expansion of and patronage of the arts in his kingdom. Reign of Krishnachandra During his reign, Krishnachandra was highly influential for Hindu religious practices, for which reason Raja Rajballabh Sen of Bikrampur sought the assistance of Krishnachandra's pandits in supporting the overturning of the prohibition on widow remarriage after his own daughter was widowed young. However, Krishnachandra strongly opposed the measure. To illustrate his feelings, legend relates, he had the visitors served the meat of a buffalo calf. Offended, they rejected the food on their honor as orthodox Hindus, and when challenged indicated that though it was not explicitly prohibited it was not practice nor custom. Krishnachandra's courtiers pointed out that they had taken umbrage at being presented something not forbidden but against custom, but that they expected Krishnachandra to accept their own unorthodox proposal. With the opposition of Krishnachandra, Rajballabh failed to achieve the change he sought. Another legend connected to Krishnachandra involved the conflict between his diwan, Raghunandan, and Manikchandra, then diwan of Burdwan but in future to become raja himself. After Raghunandan and Manikchandra quarreled, Manikchandra accused the other man of theft and had sufficient power to order and see to his execution. In Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth-Century Bengal, John McLane speculates that the root of the disagreement may have been Manikchandra's well-known resentment of Krishnachandra's patronage of the poet Bharatchandra, who had insulted the Burdwan raj family in a poem in retaliation for their depriving him of his own family estate. Krishnachandra is also legendarily associated with the popularization of the worship of the goddess Jagaddhatri. According to the story, Krishnachandra had been imprisoned by Muslims, causing him to miss the celebration of Durga Puja. Durga appeared to him in the form of Jagaddhatri and ordered him to worship her in one month, which he did, commissioning a sculptor to create a statue of the goddess. The eminent Shakta poet of that era, Sadhak Ramprasad Sen, who had become well known for his devotional songs, eventually was appointed as the court poet of Raja Krishnachandra. Krishna Chandra was part of the group, which included Jagat Seth, Mir Jafar, Omichund, Ray Durlabh and others, which conspired against Siraj ud-Daulah and colluded with Robert Clive, which lead to defeat of Siraj ud-Dullah in Battle of Plassey and eventual foundation of British rule in India. It is arguable that Krishnachandra or other members of the conspiracy group had no particular intention to found British rule in India, rather they were purely interested in their own political futures. Krishnachandra remained on friendly terms with the British and especially with Robert Clive. This relationship served him well in the 1760s when Bengal Nawab Mir Qasim ordered Krishnachandra's execution, for Clive not only overruled it but gifted Krishnachandra five cannons, the title maharaja, and governance as zamindar of the area of Krishnanagar. Popular Culture Raja Krishnachandra features in all stories depicting the wit of the famous court jester Gopal Bhar. While it is debated whether Gopal Bhar was real or fictitious, the corpus of stories paint a vigorous portrait of Krishnachandra, as a ruler who was whimsical but humble, sometimes eager to display his punitive power and at other times accepting the lessons that Gopal taught him through his jokes. His depiction also shows character depth in the sense that, while the king is clearly in awe of Gopal's wit, he is also jealous and seeking revenge due to past embarrassments caused by Gopal's scathing remarks, and this dichotomy often creates comic situations.

The colors are often described as red and black, but the \\"red\\" patches can instead be orange, yellow, or cream, and the \\"black\\" can instead be chocolate, gray, tabby, or blue. Tortoiseshell cats with the tabby pattern as one of their colors are sometimes referred to as a torbie.King, Ingrid. \\"'Tortitude' ‚Äì The Unique Personality of Tortoiseshell Cats\\", The Conscious Cat. consciouscat.net. August 17, 2009. Retrieved 2015-12-19 \\"Tortoiseshell\\" is typically reserved for particolored cats with relatively small or no white markings. Those that are largely white with tortoiseshell patches are described as tricolor, tortoiseshell-and-white (in the United Kingdom), or calico (in Canada and the United States). Tortoiseshell markings appear in many different breeds, as well as in non-purebred domestic cats. This pattern is especially preferred in the Japanese Bobtail breed, and exists in the Cornish Rex group.Atkins (2003), p. 90  Patterns  A tortoiseshell with characteristic \\"split-face\\" pattern Cat with a dilute tortoiseshell coat. Tortoiseshell cats have particolored coats with patches of various shades of red and black, and sometimes white. The size of the patches can vary from a fine speckled pattern to large areas of color. Typically, the more white a cat has, the more solid the patches of color. Dilution genes may modify the coloring, lightening the fur to a mix of cream and blue, lilac or fawn; and the markings on tortoiseshell cats are usually asymmetrical. Occasionally tabby patterns of black and brown (eumelanistic) and red (phaeomelanistic) colors are also seen. These patched tabbies are often called a tortie-tabby, a torbie or, with large white areas, a caliby. Not uncommonly there will be a \\"split face\\" pattern with black on one side of the face and orange on the other, with a dividing line running down the bridge of the nose. Tortoiseshell coloring can also be expressed in the point pattern, referred to as a tortie point.  Genetics  Tortoiseshell and calico coats result from an interaction between genetic and developmental factors. The primary gene for coat color (B) for the colors brown, chocolate, cinnamon, etc., can be masked by the co-dominant gene for the orange color (O) which is on the X Chromosome and has two alleles, the orange (XO) and not-orange (Xo), that produce orange phaeomelanin and black eumelanin pigments, respectively. (NOTE: Typically, the X for the chromosome is assumed from context and the alleles are referred to by just the uppercase O for the orange, or lower case o for the not-orange.) The tortoiseshell and calico cats are indicated: Oo to indicate they are heterozygous on the O gene. The (B) and (O) genes can be further modified by a recessive dilute gene (dd) which softens the colors. Orange becomes cream, black becomes gray, etc. Various terms are used for specific colors, for example, gray is also called blue, orange is also called ginger. Therefore, a tortoiseshell cat may be a chocolate tortoiseshell or a blue/cream tortoiseshell or the like, based on the alleles for the (B) and (D) genes. The cells of female cats, which like other mammalian females have two X chromosomes (XX), undergo the phenomenon of X-inactivation, in which one or the other of the X-chromosomes is turned off at random in each cell in very early development. The inactivated X becomes a Barr body. Cells in which the chromosome carrying the orange (O) allele is inactivated express the alternative non-orange (o) allele, determined by the (B) gene. Cells in which the non-orange (o) allele is inactivated express the orange (O) allele. Pigment genes are expressed in melanocytes that migrate to the skin surface later in development. In bi-colored tortoiseshell cats, the melanocytes arrive relatively early, and the two cell types become intermingled, producing the characteristic brindled appearance consisting of an intimate mixture of orange and black cells, with occasional small diffuse spots of orange and black. In tri-colored calico cats, a separate gene interacts developmentally with the coat color gene. This spotting gene produces white, unpigmented patches by delaying the migration of the melanocytes to the skin surface. There are a number of alleles of this gene that produce greater or lesser delays. The amount of white is artificially divided into mitted, bicolor, harlequin, and van, going from almost no white to almost completely white. In the extreme case, no melanocytes make it to the skin and the cat is entirely white (but not an albino). In intermediate cases, melanocyte migration is slowed, so that the pigment cells arrive late in development and have less time to intermingle. Observation of tri-color cats will show that, with a little white color, the orange and black patches become more defined, and with still more white, the patches become completely distinct. Each patch represents a clone of cells derived from one original cell in the early embryo.Robinson, Roy. Genetics for Cat Breeders and Veterinarians. Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann Medical 1991. A male cat, like males of other therian mammals, has only one X and one Y chromosome (XY). That X chromosome does not undergo X-inactivation, and coat color is determined by which allele is present on the X. Accordingly, the cat's coat will be either entirely orange or non-orange. Very rarely (approximately 1 in 3,000) a male tortoiseshell or calico is born; these typically have an extra X chromosome (XXY), a condition known in humans as Klinefelter syndrome, and their cells undergo an X-inactivation process like in females. As in humans, these cats often are sterile because of the imbalance in sex chromosomes. Some male calico or tortoiseshell cats may be chimeras, which result from fusion in early development of two (fraternal twin) embryos with different color genotypes; these torties can pass only one color to their offspring, not both, according to which of the two original embryos its testes are descended from. Others are mosaics, in which the XXY condition arises after conception and the cat is a mixture of cells with different numbers of X chromosomes.

Dating back to Celtic times, tortoiseshell cats have been perceived to bring good fortune into their homes. Even today, the Irish and Scottish believe stray tortoiseshell cats bring them luck. In the United States, tortoiseshells are sometimes referred to as money cats. One study found that tortoiseshell owners frequently believe their cats have increased attitude (\\"tortitude\\"); but little existing scientific evidence supports this. However, a 2015 study from the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine surveying more than 1,200 cat guardians established links between a tortoiseshell coat pattern and a cat's inclination towards hissing, biting, chasing, and slapping/scratching their human companions. According to celebrity cat expert Jackson Galaxy, tortoiseshell cats tend to have much more distinct personalities and are more sensitive to the stimulus around them.

Overackers Corners School 1874 ‚Äì 1938 [4] In 1874, the brick schoolhouse on the corner of North Vine Valley Road and State Route 364 was built. The school was heated by a large round stove, had no running water, and no electricity. Students daily carried water from a local well to the school. There was a large woodshed, and as required, there were two separate outhouses. The teacher's desk was on a platform just inside the front door. The school was used until June 1938 when the Middlesex schools were consolidated. The last teacher was Hazel Dinehart Robeson. After it closed, the building was sold to Leon G. Button, who used it for grain storage until 1989 when it was leased to the Middlesex Heritage Group. In 1998, after 10 years of renovations, the school was opened as a museum. The school was placed on the National and State Registry of Historic Places in 1994. In 2014, the Pomeroy Foundation donated a plaque recognizing this achievement.

Attacks by fungi, bacteria, and nematodes can cause rapid killing of plants, large tree branches or even entire trees. Plants have viruses too. pine wilt Wilt diseases in woody plants tend to fall into two major categories, those that start with the branches and those that start with the roots. Those that start with the branches most often start with pathogens that feed on the leaves or bark, those that start with the roots start with wounding or direct entry by the pathogen into the roots, some are spread from one plant to another by way of root grafts. Pathogens that cause wilting diseases invade the vascular vessels and cause the xylem to fail to transport water to the foliage, thus causing wilting of stems and leaves. Wilt diseases Wilt diseases include: Bacterial wilt of cucurbits Bacterial wilt of cucurbits is cause by the bacteria Erwinia tracheiphila, it affects cucumber, squash, muskmelon, pumpkin, gourds; certain varieties of cucumber and squash have different degrees of resistance. Once a plant is infected, the bacteria spread through the xylem vessels from the area of infection to the main stem, and the entire plant wilts and dies. Initial symptoms may include the wilting of single leaves and smaller stems. Infected plants may produce a creamy white bacterial ooze when cut. The bacteria survive winter in the digestive tract of striped cucumber beetles and spotted cucumber beetles. In the spring when the beetles are feeding on susceptible plants, the bacteria, which are contained in the fecal matter of the beetles enters the plant through wounds in the epidermis. The bacteria need a film of water to facilitate infection. The bacteria can also be transmitted from one plant to another when beetles feed on an infected plant and the bacteria becomes attached to the beetles mouthparts. The bacteria Ralstonia solanacearum and related species cause bacterial wilt of bananas and plantains. The same bacteria also cause wilt diseases of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), aubergine (eggplant) (Solanum melongena), banana (Musa species), geranium (Pelargonium species), ginger (Zingiber officinale), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), sweet peppers (Capsicum species), olive (Olea europea), and others. Dutch elm disease Dutch elm disease is caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi, it affects elm trees. Elm yellows Elm yellows sometimes called elm phloem necrosis, affects elm trees and is caused by a Mycoplasma like organism. It is spread by the white-banded leafhopper. Mimosa wilt Mimosa wilt is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum. It enters through the roots and spreads into the vascular system through the tree's sap. As it grows it clogs the vascular tissue leading to yellowing leaves and defoliation.Bush, Elizabeth A. ‚ÄúFusarium Wilt of Mimosa (Albizia Julibrissin).‚Äù VCE Publications  Virginia Tech, 2014, pubs.ext.vt.edu/2811/2811-1020/2811-1020.html. Oak wilt Oak wilt is a fungal caused by Bretziella fagacearum, is a disease originating in eastern Russia. It can slowly or quickly kill an oak tree when the tree reacts to the fungus by plugging its own cambial tissue while attempting to block the spread of the fungus. This plug prevents the cambium vascular tissue from delivering nutrients and water to the rest of the plant, which eventually kills it. Red oaks are very susceptible. Persimmon wilt Persimmon wilt attacks persimmons and is caused by Acromonium diospyri, a fungus. In the United States it has nearly eliminated persimmons from the central basin of Tennessee. Because of its lethality to persimmons, it was proposed as a biological control agent to eliminate unwanted native persimmons. Pine wilt Pine wilt is caused by the North American native pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Where it is indigenous it is not major pathogen of native pine species, but in North America it causes wilt in a few non- native North American pine species. It has been introduced into Japan and China, where it has become a troubling disease of Japanese red pines (Pinus densiflora) and black pines (Pinus thunbergii). Over 46 million cubic meters of trees have been lost alone in Japan over a 50-year period. It is spread among conifers by pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus spp). The nematodes can reproduce quickly in the sapwood under favorable conditions within susceptible pine species, causing wilting and death, sometimes in only a few weeks. North America lumber products are under export restrictions because of the nematode. In the Midwest United States it has killed many Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris), and this attractive tree is no longer recommended for landscaping uses there. Stewart's wilt Stewart's wilt is caused by the bacteria Pantoea stewartii and affects corn plants especially sweet corn. It is a problem in the production of sweet corn in the Northeastern US. Verticillium wilt Verticillium wilt affects over 300 species of eudicot plants caused by one of two species of Verticillium fungus, V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum. Many economically important plants are susceptible including cotton, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, peppers and ornamentals, as well as others in natural vegetation communities. Chilli wilt Chilli wilt is caused by fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. capsici. The affected plant dies suddenly as a result of toxins produced by the fungus or by the chocking of vascular tissues by the fungal structures.

Volkswagen began its involvement in Ireland when in 1949, Motor Distributors Limited, founded by Stephen O'Flaherty secured the franchise for the country at that year's Paris Motor Show. Volkswagen assembly Motor Distributors' began to handle Volkswagen in Ireland in 1950, when Volkswagen Beetles started arriving into Dublin packed in crates in what was termed 'completely knocked down' (CKD) form ready to be assembled. The vehicles were assembled in a former tram depot at 162 Shelbourne Road in Ballsbridge. This is now the premises for Ballsbridge Motors who are still a Volkswagen dealer. The first Volkswagen ever built outside Germany was assembled here. This vehicle is now on display at the Volkswagen Museum in Wolfsburg. Irish-assembled Beetles rose from an output of 46 units in 1950 to 2,155 units in 1952. This necessitated a move in 1955 to a new factory premises on the Naas Road. Assembly of the Beetle continued there until 1977 when production of the car ceased in Europe. Volkswagen vehicle assembly continued in Dublin until the mid-1980s. During the same period, the Volkswagen Transporter van was also assembled at these premises. This premises remained as the headquarters for Motor Distributors Ltd. Volkswagen sales Between 1950 and 1980, Beetle sales in Ireland averaged at 3,000 - 4,000 units per annum peaking in 1972 when 5,288 units were sold. In 1953, O'Flaherty acquired the Volkswagen franchise for the United Kingdom, which he sold to the Thomas Tilling group in 1957. In 1956, Volkswagen sales were high enough to cause concern in D√°il √âireann that it was adversely affecting the balance of payments. The Volkswagen Golf Mk1 was introduced in 1975 and the Beetle ceased to be sold in 1980. Addition of other Volkswagen Group brands The rights to distribute the Audi brand were acquired in 1967 and the rights for Skoda acquired in 1993. Transfer back to manufacturer control In 2007, it was announced that Volkswagen AG would take direct control over its operations in Ireland from October 2008. This took effect on 10 October 2008 when the distribution business became Volkswagen Group Ireland. This came about as result of the lifting of block exemption regulations in 2003. Headquarter were moved from its premises on the Naas Road to Liffey Valley. In November 2009, Volkswagen Group Ireland also took control of the distribution business of SEAT in Ireland, another Volkswagen Group Brand.

American Malacological Society: http://www.malacological.org/publications/2400_malacology.html known professionally as Alan Solem, was an American malacologist, a biologist who studied mollusks. He was one of the most renowned land snail experts of his time and had earned a reputation for his comprehensive revisions of mainly terrestrial pulmonates. He worked on land snails from all regions of the world but became particularly known for his revisions of land snails from Australasia and various Pacific Islands. He named many taxa, amongst them about 350 species of Australian land snails, and several genera.Cameron, R. A. D., B. M. Pokryszko, and F. E. Wells. 2005.

Based on the Elric of Melnibon√© books by Michael Moorcock, the game takes its name from Elric's sword, Stormbringer (though one edition was published as Elric!). The rules are based on Chaosium's percentile-dice-based Basic Role-Playing system. System The game uses a variant of Chaosium's Basic Roleplaying, with its own rules for magic and other setting-specific elements. The first three editions are functionally similar, while the fourth edition changed the magic system extensively. Elric! was a substantial reworking of the game, and Stormbringer fifth edition is the Elric! rules with additional material from several older, out-of-print supplements incorporated. History Chaosium had already published a boardgame based on Moorcock's Elric of Melnibon√© series, called Elric in 1977. There have been several editions of the tabletop role-playing game: * 1st edition (1981) by Ken St. Andre and Steve Perrin; boxed set * 2nd edition (1985) by St. Andre; boxed set * 3rd edition (1987) by St. Andre, published jointly with Games Workshop * 4th edition (1990) by St. Andre, Steve Perrin, and John B. Monroe; boxed set * Elric! (1993) by Lynn Willis, Richard Watts, Mark Morrison, Jimmie W. Pursell Jr., Sam Shirley, and Joshua Shaw. ** The adventure The Bronze Grimoire (1994) for use with Elric! * 5th edition (2001) by Lynn Willis Chaosium no longer has the license for the Stormbringer roleplaying game. In August 2007, Mongoose Publishing published the Elric of Melnibon√© RPG by Lawrence Whittaker, which is based on Moongoose's first edition of RuneQuest, though it was itself discontinued when Mongoose's license ended., see Elric of Melnibone RPG series Reception In the February‚ÄìMarch 1982 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #29), Murray Writtle gave it an average overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that \\"So, if you want to have single death or glory adventures in the Young Kingdoms, Stormbringer will give you them, but to get a continuing campaign underway will take a certain amount of rewriting and careful thought.\\" In the January‚ÄìFebruary 1985 edition of Different Worlds (Issue #38), Keith Herber gave it a top rating of 4 stars out of 4, saying, \\"I thought Stormbringer not only an excellent adaptation of the Elric series but also found it an extremely enjoyable game. If you have ever read an Elric book (or one of Moorcock's related novels) and wished it could be a game, this is it. If you haven't read one yet do so and then consider the game. You may not find the \\"doomed\\" atmosphere to your liking, but around this neighborhood there is a growing movement for a permanent Stormbringer campaign.\\" In the August 1992 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #92), Jim Bambra called the percentile-based skill resolution system \\"quick and simple to play.\\" He also liked the experience system, calling it \\"simple and easy to use with no unwieldy book- keeping required between game sessions.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, \\"Come and enter the world of Elric, you won't be disappointed.\\" In a 1996 poll of readers conducted by Arcane to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Stormbringer was ranked 25th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"A simplified RuneQuest, only set in Elric's world. It captures the spirit of the books, but to play it properly you really need to be familiar with the novels, and they are of the type of fantasy that you either love or loathe.\\" Other reviews *White Wolf #21 (June/July, 1990) *White Wolf #39 (1994) - Elric! * Casus Belli #38 (June 1987) * Casus Belli #39 (Aug 1987) References  External links * Stormbringer! ‚Äì a website supporting all editions of the Stormbringer RPG Category:Basic Role- Playing System Category:Dark fantasy role-playing games Category:Michael Moorcock's Multiverse Category:Lynn Willis games Category:Role-playing games based on novels Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1981 ","title":"Stormbringer (role-playing game)"},{"id":"24998204","text":"Giorgia Surina Giorgia Surina (born 8 March 1975 in Milan) is an Italian television personality known for presenting TRL Italy, the Italian version of Total Request Live broadcast by MTV Italia.

It is a twelve-bar blues notated in 4/4 time in the key of D and includes a twelve-bar slide-guitar intro and two twelve-bar sections with Brown's sax solo. The chorus makes a pun on \\"blues\\": Music writer Don Snowden describes the session as \\"showcas[ing] his mature style‚Äîthe trademark bottleneck guitar licks and raw-edged, gritty vocals complemented by J.

It is situated along FM 3191, one mile west of State Highway 123 in northern Karnes County, approximately five miles north of Panna Maria and 50 miles southeast of San Antonio. History The Spanish built a fort, the Presidio Fuerte de Santa Cruz del Cibolo near Cestohowa, founded in 1734.Robert H. Thonhoff, \\"FUERTE DE SANTA CRUZ DEL CIBOLO,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed April 26, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The community's history is closely tied to the settlement of Panna Maria, five miles to the south. It was from Panna Maria, the oldest Polish settlement in the United States, that forty Silesian families established Cestohowa in 1873. The new settlement's name originated from the city in Poland that was home to the painting of Our Lady of Czƒôstochowa, a Roman Catholic patroness. A church was built in 1877‚Äì78. Cestohowa had its own post office between 1883 and 1918, and a public school that opened (by incorporating a parochial school) in 1937 and operated through the 1970s.

It is the tenth episode of the show's sixth season and was broadcast on December 6, 2009. Plot Jeff and Daphne are having trouble in their marriage since she complains about everything he does. While flying in their single engine plane, Jeff asks for a divorce but Daphne tells him that since he started the business with her father's money she is entitled to half of everything and plans on selling it. During their ensuing argument, Jeff suffers a heart attack and dies, leaving an untrained Daphne alone in the plane just as it flies over Wisteria Lane. The episode flashes back to three days before and leads up to the plane crash. The residents of Wisteria Lane are busy decorating for their annual Christmas party but Gaby and Lynette's feud intrigues them more. Gaby reveals to them that Lynette is suing Carlos and Lynette counters by saying it was because he fired her; Gaby then tells them it was because she lied about being pregnant. Bree and the others are shocked to hear that Lynette is pregnant with twins. Just as Susan tells them to put aside their differences and come together to celebrate, an ambulance arrives to take a wounded Katherine to the hospital. Everyone is gathered at Katherine's and Karen informs everyone that someone stabbed Katherine, who points at Mike. Mona Clark checks to see how Danny is doing and calls him by the name of Tyler which startles Danny. He covers it up by saying he was dreaming. Nick and Angie are in a bind because of some unforeseen expenses and since they do not have insurance with their current identities, they eventually settle with refusing to take assistance from government programs as they would have to give out their information. Mona speaks to them privately and tells them that she knows (at least in her belief) that the Bolens are part of the Witness Protection Program but agrees to keep it a secret. Later, after Danny's official discharge from the hospital, Mona drives the young teenager home. Upon hearing that his parents had told Mona everything about their \\"situation,\\" Danny accidentally reveals to the nurse the truth about his family, not realizing that Mona had sided with a far less incriminating story about the Bolens. With Danny's confession fresh in her mind, Mona resorts to blackmailing Angie into giving her $67,000 in exchange for her silence so that she can quit her job as a nurse and start anew. When the Bolen's are only able to come up with $10,000, Mona sternly demands for Angie to reach the full amount by the end of the day or else have her family face prosecution. After Angie finishes telling Mona her entire secret, she notices the plane descending onto the street so she runs away without warning Mona. Mona turns around and is hit by the wing of the plane, dropping Angie's envelope of cash. Bree informs Orson that she has filed for divorce and tells him that if he tries to send her to jail for insurance fraud then he is going with her. Orson reveals that he was bluffing throughout the entire ordeal and defeatedly agrees to sign the divorce papers upon realizing that his wife had truly believed that he would have sent her to prison, even when it wasn't his intention. Later, while Bree is telling Karl the good news, Orson walks in and discovers that Bree was having an affair but still unaware of with whom. She tells him she will not go public with her new relationship until after the divorce is final. Meanwhile, Karl hired the Bicks to fly a banner behind their plane with the message \\"Will you marry me, Bree? Love, Karl\\" over Wisteria Lane and also gives Jeff his card as he is a divorce lawyer. During the party, Karl shows up and tells Bree about the banner that will be flying overhead. Worried about embarrassing Orson, Karl tells him the truth and the two get into a fight in Santa's Workshop. Bree notices the activity going on inside Santa's Workshop, and goes in to stop Orson and Karl from fighting. When the plane slides into the party, it smashes into Santa's Workshop and after the crash a bloody hand is hanging out from one of the Workshop's windows. At the hospital, Susan is accompanied by Bob who reminds her that she is to act like a best friend to Katherine for the latter's accusation against Mike for attacking her with a weapon could cost him a lengthy jail sentence. After some light convincing from Bob to not be hostile, Susan then enters Katherine's room just as she finishes talking to Dylan over the phone. Susan engages Katherine by trying to understand as to why she would believe that Mike would stab her. Katherine responds by telling her that Mike had become enraged after informing him that she was in love with another man. Upon her exit, Susan then tells Bob of her skepticism towards Katherine's intentions for her stories and simply expresses her desire to have Katherine \\"put away\\" in an institute. Bob informs Susan that only a family member can commit someone into a mental institution. With this idea in mind, Susan has the nurse at reception contact Dylan's number in Maryland through the hospital's incoming phone records and hands the connected call over to Susan. Susan then adopts the persona of a Fairview Memorial doctor, complete with a British accent, and informs Dylan that she is concerned about Katherine's well-being and recommends for her to visit her mother immediately. Upon Dylan's arrival to her old home on Wisteria Lane, Susan runs over in an attempt to talk to her, but is instead greeted with hostility. Susan is shocked to learn that for the last few months, Katherine had been imposing onto Dylan with the lie that she was Mike's wife and that Susan was the one who had stabbed her. Susan is then forced to reveal to Dylan her wedding album to which Dylan is left stunned at the fact that her mother had been lying to her this whole time. When Dylan visits her mother at her hospital, Katherine unfortunately finds herself caught up in her own lies when Dylan adds her input to her mother's stories. When Susan comes in, Katherine tries to run out of the hospital in an attempt to get to Mike. Susan and Dylan watch on as Katherine suffers a complete nervous breakdown while being restrained by hospital staff. Lynette and Penny are cutting out coupons and Penny asks if they are poor. Since Lynette was fired, Tom is forced to drop out of school and learns that he will not be given a refund for any of his tuition. Tom tells Lynette that she should try to apologize to Gaby and Carlos. Carlos tells Gaby that if the lawsuit goes to court he will lose his job and even if it doesn't he still may lose his job. At the same time, Lynette drops by to apologize, but Gaby slams the door in her face. During the Christmas party, Lynette tries several times to apologize to Gaby, but she refuses to hear it. While singing Christmas songs, Gaby and Lynette get into a fight that results in knocking Bree to the ground, who then demands the two work out their differences. Just as the plane slides into the Christmas party, Celia is directly in the path of the plane, but Lynette quickly pushes her out of the way. The plane crashes into Santa's Workshop, with Bree, Karl and Orson inside. The episode ends with the camera zooming onto the window of the crushed Santa hut from which a limp blood-soaked hand hangs out.

Dritz, 1988 Selma Kaderman Dritz (June 29, 1917 ‚Äì September 3, 2008) was an American physician and epidemiologist who worked in San Francisco, California, where she began tracking the first known cases of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s.Dr. Dritz's obituary in The U.K. Independent  Early life  Selma Dritz was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 29, 1917. Dritz loved music, and began her career as a concert pianist, before deciding that she ultimately wanted to help others through her role in the medical field. Dritz studied medicine at the University of Illinois, and earned a medical degree (MD) in pediatrics. She then went on to obtain a master's of public health degree (MPH) at University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health in 1967, to complement her medical degree. Career In 1968, she was hired by the City of San Francisco as assistant director of the Health Department's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. She worked and followed general public health concerns of the community, such as food poisoning and influenza. Thirteen years later, along with Erwin Braff, the director of the bureau, Dritz took note of a rare form of pneumonia and a rare form of cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, both of which were afflicting gay men, and had, up to this point, only affected elderly Mediterranean men. She relayed the information to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. This data along with that of others was to become the first AIDS epidemic. HIV/AIDS lowers the immune system of the affected person, making them an easier target for viruses and other sicknesses, like the pneumonia and the cancer. She began to establish the etiology and epidemiology of what would be termed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, more commonly known by its acronym, AIDS. Dritz played an instrumental role in tracking the newly found disease, HIV. Her no- nonsense approach to epidemiology moved mountains and paved the road to the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In short, Selma Dritz saved countless lives and her work still continues to today because of all of the research she did and recorded and the information that she gave. Dritz wrote an article for the New England Journal of Medicine called \\"Medical Aspects of Homosexuality\\" in 1980. In this journal article, it explains some of the main medical and societal situations that have allowed to disease to be spread so quickly, one of these being the public bath houses that she had shut down, due to the fast spread of the disease. Paul Volberding, former president of the International AIDS Society who helped found the first AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1980s said of Dritz: > She was an absolutely wonderful person, and played an incredibly important > role during those early days of the epidemic... Dr. Dritz was the most > important person to whom the Centers for Disease Control came for the > details of the AIDS situation here, and the information she gathered was > invaluable for the CDC epidemiologists in understanding how the epidemic was > spreading. Dr. Dritz had a great impact in her career involving AIDS. After she pioneered the discovery of the disease, many came to her for advice and answers. In her San Francisco community, she was known as someone who looked at an epidemic and didn't back down. She continued on to educate all people about the risks of the disease, not only people in the gay or LGBTQ community. While her focus was on this community for most of her career, the effort and research she put into learning about this disease helped and continues to help all those affected by this horrible disease.  AIDS  In Dritz's days, AIDS was often coined \\"Gay Plague\\" or \\"Gay Cancer\\". She rejected these terms, emphasizing the official term of \\"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\\". Her children always made fun of her and teased her, calling her \\"den mother of the gays\\". While she made some unpopular decisions, like shutting down public bath houses for a time, she knew minimizing risk would reduce deaths. Dr. Dritz was featured in And The Band Played On, a 1987 book by Randy Shilts about the early days of the disease. Dritz's work was featured in the film adaptation of And The Band Played On, where she was portrayed by Lily Tomlin. In the movie she was referred to as \\"Attila the Hun\\" for her role in the prevention of spread of AIDS. Personal life Dritz married Dr. H. Fred Dritz in 1943 and had three children: Ronald, Deborah, and Ariel. Her marriage ended in divorce in 1973. Death She died in 2008, aged 91, at the Claremont House Retirement Center in Oakland, California. Since the death of Dritz, she has been featured throughout the study of the history of AIDS. A look into the life of Dritz is possible through the Selma Dritz Papers. The collection features pictures, correspondence, research, and other materials. These papers have allowed her work to continue into today and help not only those in the LGBTQ community but all those affected by HIV/AIDS.

Background In the early days of the Vietnam War, black service members represented less than 5% of the Navy. The draft enticed men of all races to get into the Navy as a way to dodge heavy combat. This resulted in stiff competition, allowing Navy recruiters to be selective, enlisting only the top performers on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. This was known as \\"Qualitative Recruitment\\"‚Äîrecruiting the \\"highest quality\\" sailors, of which nearly all happened to be white, as the quality of the education that white candidates had received was far superior to that of the black candidates. This made it improbable for black candidates to ever really compete with their white counterparts. By 1971, after Richard Nixon sought to remake the military into one of all-volunteers, and the U.S. was beginning to disengage from Vietnam, the number of men drafted dramatically decreased, and the demand to join the Navy decreased with it. The Navy recruitment quota fell by more than 50% from 1971 to 1972, which resulted in the Navy needing black men to achieve its recruitment goals. Black men joined at a high rate, increasing their overall representation to 20%. Under the Navy's tradition of Southern white leadership, and with their low test scores, blacks spent more time assigned to the least desirable, most difficult and least dignified jobs, while whites were routinely promoted to the most desirable and more respected jobs, and accounted for 99% of the Navy's officers. Racial tensions among the crew By October 1972, the majority of the black enlisted sailors on the Kitty Hawk had been serving less than a year. And, of approximately 4,500 sailors on the ship, less than 7% were black. Racial tensions were reportedly high on the ship. Politically, the black sailors were more likely to be against the war, and to support the advancement of social minorities. These views conflicted with the reality that they faced obstacles in advancing into higher skilled positions on the ship because they were undereducated. This created hostility on the ship and only compounded the frustration the sailors felt from being at sea for nearly eight months.  Subic Bay  The first racial incident occurred on October 8 at Subic Bay, in Olongapo, a town where racial segregation was enforced ‚Äì the white section was known as \\"The Strip,\\" while the black section was known as \\"The Jungle.\\"Freeman, p 81 That night, a fight between black and white sailors broke out at the enlisted men's club ‚Äì the EM Club. The fight began as a drunken misunderstanding, but escalated when a black sailor went on stage and began voicing his opposition to the \\"white man's war\\" and advocating \\"black power.\\" A white sailor threw a glass at the black sailor's head. A fight between blacks and whites spread throughout the club and ultimately was broken up by base Marines.Freeman, p88 The black sailors were told not to go back to the EM Club. Around 12:30 am on October 9, another incident occurred when a black airman, Dwight Horton, was en route to the ship. He was arrested for fighting with two white petty officers, though he contested that they beat him, arguing he could not fight back because his arm was in a cast. When he returned to the Kitty Hawk, the airman told the other black sailors about what happened, which further agitated them.Freeman, p 85 = Sampaguita Club = On October 10, the black sailors decided to disrupt a favorite hangout of white sailors on The Strip ‚Äì the Sampaguita Club ‚Äì to retaliate against Horton's treatment. That night was designated \\"Soul Night\\" at the club, which was the only night black sailors were welcome. Around 9:00 pm, a petty scuffle began when a white shore patrolman tapped a black sailor on the shoulder, and the black sailor punched him. To keep the situation from escalating, 15 additional shore patrolmen were summoned to monitor the club. Around 1:00 am, 10 black sailors walked on stage in mockery \\"soul brother\\" gear, and began \\"dapping\\" each other, and throwing their blackness in the face of the white sailors in the crowd. As the white sailors began berating the black sailors with racial epithets, the black sailors in the crowd voiced their solidarity.Freeman, p 87 As this was happening inside, outside Horton arrived and punched at a shore patrolman. This distracted several of the shore patrolmen also outside. While they were distracted, inside, white sailors began throwing beer bottles at the 10 black sailors on stage, and fighting began between the black sailors and white sailors in the crowd, resulting in a brawl that was broken up by Marines. In the morning, the sailors returned to the ship, bloodied and bruised, and the ship went to sea. Incident On the afternoon of October 12, while Kitty Hawk was participating in Operation Linebacker off the coast of North Vietnam, African American sailor Perry Pettus went on deck with two other black sailors. The three were approached by two Marines who told them, \\"You blacks can't walk in over two's.\\" When the black sailors ignored them and kept walking, Pettus was put into a stranglehold from behind with a nightstick by one of the Marines. When the ship's captain, Marland Townsend Jr., learned of the incident, he apologized to the three black sailors. Word of the incident made its rounds among black sailors, who were incensed by the Subic Bay events. Thirty minutes after flight operations, one of those black sailors ‚Äì 18-year-old black Airman Apprentice Terry Avinger ‚Äì went to the mess deck to eat. He requested two sandwiches. A white mess cook refused, and limited Avinger to one sandwich. Avinger then reached across the food line and took another sandwich, which resulted in a shouting match between him and the mess cook. Things escalated after another white mess cook, organizing food trays, stepped on a black sailor's foot, creating more tension. Upset about what transpired, Avinger went to a bunk area, where black sailors regularly got together, and expressed his frustration about the way they were being subjugated by whites on the ship, telling them he regretted \\"that he didn't just beat the racist cracker's ass right there.\\" He railed that \\"black sailors on the Kitty Hawk had had enough and it was time to stand up for themselves.\\" The black sailors then went into the ship's passageway and armed themselves with makeshift weapons ‚Äì broom handles, wrenches, a foam fog nozzle and pieces of pipe. They then began accosting white sailors, beating them, and vandalizing some of the ship's compartments. Around 8 p.m., a white cook called for the Marine detachment on board. When the white Marines arrived, they ordered the black sailors to the aft mess. The black sailors thought it was a trap ‚Äì that the Marines were corralling them in order to beat or kill them. This resulted in a stand-off between the two groups.  Deescalation  News of what was happening reached the executive officer, Commander Ben Cloud, a half‚ÄêAfrican American and half‚ÄêNative American aviation commander who had been aboard the Kitty Hawk for eight weeks. He was told the situation was so dire that men might die. Cloud went on the ship's communication system and ordered the violence to stop, pleading for the black sailors to go to the aft mess, and for the Marines to stand down and go to the forecastle. Cloud was unaware that the commanding officer, Captain Marland Townsend, had also been briefed on what was happening and was on his way to the mess deck. Cloud went to the mess deck to talk to the black sailors for about an hour, trying to calm them down and assure them that he could be trusted, telling them, \\"For the first time, you have a brother who is an executive officer. My door is always open.\\" Their anger subsiding, the black soldiers gave a Black Power salute in solidarity to Cloud, who returned the salute. The black sailors celebrated, feeling that they had someone in a position of authority who was sympathetic to their treatment on board. Cloud then dismissed the sailors and told them to get back to work. It was around that time when Townsend arrived on the mess deck, witnessing Cloud's handling of the situation. Townsend disagreed with it. He left the mess deck and summoned the Marine detachment. He ordered them to increase patrols in the black compartments. Tensions still high, about 15 black sailors continued to attack whites throughout the night. Cloud again intervened when he saw some black sailors heading to the forecastle and followed them. By Cloud's own admission, \\"he believed that had he not been black he would have been killed on the spot.\\" He talked to the sailors for two hours, appealing to them, not as a senior officer, but \\"as one black to another.\\" By 2:30 am, Cloud had calmed the sailors and got them to relinquish their weapons. About 40 black sailors went to the mess deck to eat, play cards and listen to music along with a few white sailors. At 3:00 a.m., Townsend told Cloud he did not want large groups of blacks congregating in the mess hall, and likened the gathering to a \\"victory party.\\" Townsend and Cloud dispersed the group and met with any sailors who were still upset in the forecastle until 5:00 a.m. Many white sailors on the massive ship were unaware that the incident had occurred, and began to hear rumors when they awoke. Becoming increasingly angry, about 150 white sailors began to arm themselves, and congregating in the berthing compartment, readying themselves for what they thought would be an outright racial battle for control of the ship. Hearing of the discord, Cloud went to address the group who dismissed him as being \\"nothing more than a nigger, like the rest of them.\\" Cloud pulled rank on them and threatened them with legal action if they proceeded. The white sailors dispersed. Cloud reported the incident to Townsend and then continued to talk to concerned sailors ‚Äì both white and black ‚Äì along with petty officers throughout the morning, reducing the threat of white retaliation. By 7:58 a.m., the confrontation had completely ended, and the Kitty Hawk resumed bombing North Vietnam. In total, the incident left 40 white and 6 black sailors injured, including three who had to be evacuated to onshore medical facilities. Courts-martial Six weeks after the incidents, the Kitty Hawk returned to San Diego, where 27 black sailors were arrested and charged. No white sailors were arrested. Twenty-one of those charged requested a court- martial trial. Lawyers for the black sailors stressed the bias shown in the pre-trial report against the black sailors, stating that it only contained testimony from prosecution witnesses. By December, Congress was investigating the incident and called Townsend and Cloud to testify. Most of those who requested a court-martial were also invited to testify, but they all declined and no subpoenas were issued to force them to do so. In January 1973, before a Navy court-martial, Commander Cloud testified that the fighting erupted when Marines, on orders to break up groups of three or more sailors, only enforced the order against groups of black sailors. He further testified that he had been threatened by black and white sailors alike, and that during the fighting between black sailors and Marines, he witnessed a white sailor seemingly directing Marines toward black sailors. He noted that Captain Townsend requested that the white sailor be identified, \\"but this was not done.\\" In February, on behalf of 17 of the black sailors, the NAACP brought a complaint against a prosecutor for racial prejudice in an attempt to get the charges against the black sailors dismissed. The complaint was also against Michael A. Laurie ‚Äì a white sailor who had been a key government witness ‚Äì for perjury, after tape recordings surfaced of Laurie admitting that white sailors had \\"exaggerated\\" about the violence of black sailors, then later affirming that he had lied about black sailors when he was asked outright. Laurie elaborated that, despite not seeing any black sailors actually hit any white sailors, white sailors would say that they did. Laurie also impugned his integrity and demonstrated racist leanings when he expressed his regret for not having a gun that night since it would have allowed him to have killed \\"at least 30 of them [niggers].\\" In April 1973, the courts-martial concluded with a total of 27 trials. Aftermath The Navy officially defined the incident as a \\"race riot.\\" However, only four sailors were convicted of rioting, with two of those pleading guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Fourteen were convicted of assault. Four were found not guilty of all charges. Five sailors had the charges dropped against them, and seven were sentenced to the brig. Most were given a demotion in rank. Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP, called the Navy's handling of the incident a \\"despicable perversion of justice\\" of the black sailors who were victims of \\"a spurious effort to discredit them, categorize them, and keep them in menial, low-paying jobs.\\" Black sailors went on record expressing that \\"little conflicts\\" led to the rioting, that they \\"just got tired of being treated like dogs,\\" and noted that the rioting was due to a combination of \\"anger at seeing the riot squad, the frustration with the war, and with the problems of institutional racism in the Navy.\\" Many black officers also expressed that the conflict was inevitable because the Navy was inept at treating black sailors as sailors rather than as blacks, which created differences in the way black sailors were treated over issues such as \\"promotion, assignments, interracial relationships.\\" However, despite these accounts, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee, Floyd Hicks, determined that the incident \\"consisted of unprovoked attacks\\" by blacks against whites. The subcommittee wrote that \\"the riot on Kitty Hawk consisted of unprovoked assaults by a very few men, most of whom were below- average mental capacity, most of whom had been aboard for less than one year, and all of whom were black. This group, as a whole, acted as 'thugs' which raises doubt as to whether they should ever have been accepted into military service in the first place.\\" The Subcommittee's final report concluded: > The subcommittee has been unable to determine any precipitous cause for > rampage aboard U.S.S. Kitty Hawk. Not only was there not one case wherein > racial discrimination could be pinpointed, but there is no evidence which > indicated that the blacks who participated in that incident perceived racial > discrimination, either in general or any specific, of such a nature as to > justify belief that violent reaction was required ...

The events on the Kitty Hawk inspired other ship riots and protests in the months that followed.

Events The jet, owned by the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, took off, with eleven crewmembers on board, from Mirny Airport, where the onboard cargo had been unloaded. The aircraft was bound for the city of Irkutsk, when several minutes after liftoff it banked to the right, hit a slag heap from an old mine and crashed. It exploded on impact and caught fire, about three kilometers (1.9 miles) from the airport in a deserted area. There are suggestions that the aircraft failed to gain altitude and deviated off its flight path. After the cargo was unloaded, the plane \\"took off but then deviated from the course and crashed 25 km away from the runway,\\" an official from the Russian Emergencies Ministry told reporters. Reports suggest that in the days following the accident eleven bodies were pulled from the jet by rescuers. Russia's air force had temporarily grounded all Il-76 aircraft after an engine broke off the wing of a plane while it was attempting to takeoff earlier that year. It was reported that the ban was still in place at the time of the accident, and it is not yet clear as to why the jet was used when the model had been grounded.

Per Federspiel was the son of lawyer Holger Federspiel (1868‚Äì1934) and Asta Nutzhorn (1880‚Äì1951). Because his father lived in England at the time, he received part of his schooling in Harrow school. Subsequently, he enrolled at the law school of the University of Copenhagen. As a student, he was secretary to Viggo Berg, his mother's cousin and son of the left wing leader Christen Berg. He graduated in law in 1931 and in 1937 joined the Bar of the Eastern High Court. Working for the legal firm of Max Rothenborg brought him into contact with Jewish clients and gave him an insight into the condition of the Jews in Hitler's Germany. During the German occupation, he was responsible for arranging the financing of a large part of the resistance movement. He was arrested by the Gestapo in October 1943 but managed to escape; however, he was again arrested in April 1944, and spent the next year in Vestre Prison, Horser√∏d camp and Fr√∏slev camp. After the war he became first president of the Freedom Fund, a charity for the families of resistance members. He was Minister for Special Affairs in the Kristensen cabinet from 1945 to 1947, then a member of the Folketing (first chamber of parliament) from 1947 to 1950 and again 1957 to 1973. He was a member of the Landsting (second chamber) from 1951 to 1953. He worked strongly for closer European cooperation, including for Denmark's membership of the European Communities, and from 1960 to 1963 was the only Danish chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Besides his political activities he ran his law practice, which has since become a part of the large law firm Gorrissen Federspiel Kierkegaard. He is buried at H√∏rsholm Cemetery.

The 15 foot (4.6m) long, 1-ton male was captured in 1964 near East Point, Saturna Island in British Columbia. A sculptor, Samuel Burich, had been commissioned by the Vancouver Aquarium to kill an orca in order to construct a life-sized model for the aquarium‚Äôs new British Columbia hall. Moby Doll was harpooned and shot at by Burich but did not die. The Vancouver Aquarium's founder director, Murray Newman, decided to tow the orca back to Vancouver and put him on display. Moby Doll was shown to the public in a pen at Burrard Drydocks but was listless and did not eat for the first two months in captivity. According to observers, :\\"The whale seemed to be suffering from shock...For a long time, Moby Doll...would not eat. He was offered everything from salmon to horse hearts, but the whale only circled the pool night and day in a counterclockwise pattern.\\" After 55 days in captivity, Moby Doll begins eating--up to 200 pounds of fish a day...(but) dies a month later\\"\\"Stories of Captive Killer Whales\\", PBS Frontline \\"A Whale of a Business\\"\\"The First Captive Killer Whales...\\" www.rockisland.com At the time, it was not known that \\"resident\\" killer whales ate only fish, not warm-blooded prey. After his keepers spent nearly two months offering a variety of inappropriate food items for a resident killer whale, someone offered a lingcod. The whale took it, and when offered more ended up eating 50 kg of cod that day.Francis and Hewlett, pp. 55 - 59 So little was known of killer whales at the time that furthermore, Moby Doll was mistakenly identified as a female. Most sources say that the whale was discovered to be a male only after his death, although according to one story, a four-year-old visitor witnessed the whale having an erection. Moby Doll was popular locally and abroad. The whale's captivity afforded scientists the opportunity to study an orca and orca sounds up close for the first time. According to the obituary in The Times of London, \\"the widespread publicity ‚Äì some of it the first positive press ever about killer whales ‚Äì marked the beginning of an important change in the public attitude toward the species.\\" Vancouver journalist Mark Leiren- Young published a book on the capture of Moby Doll, titled The Killer Whale Who Changed the World, which has been long-listed for the 2017 RBC Taylor Prize, in 2016. Leiren-Young developed a feature documentary about Moby Doll that is currently in post-production. The documentary is set to be distributed by Kinosmith (the Canadian distributors of Blackfish). Leiren-Young also developed Moby Doll: The Whale that Changed the World, which aired as a radio broadcast November 7, 2014 on CBC Radio's Ideas with Paul Kennedy. At the 2014 Jack Webster Awards, Leiren-Young won Best Feature Story in radio for the broadcast. In October 2014, Leiren-Young wrote the article ‚ÄúMoby Doll‚Äù for The Walrus.

It is a Federal-style structure that consists of a two-story, three-bay, gable- roofed central block with a two-part, -story saltbox ell on the west side. The central block and the front portion of the ell were built separately and joined together sometime before they were moved to their present location prior to 1833. The rear portion of the ell was added on-site at the current location at an unknown date. The house was the birthplace of noted agnostic and politician Robert G. Ingersoll (1833‚Äì1899).See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and added to New York State's Register of Historic Places in 1987. History of the home The central block was built circa 1800 as a Congregational church parsonage. It was originally located on Charles Street in Dresden, a few hundred feet south and east of its current location. It was constructed of donated materials by volunteer labor. The front portion of the ell was built circa 1800 in Hopeton, a settlement two miles east of Dresden which failed early in the nineteenth century. Several buildings were moved downhill to Dresden, presumably by sledge during a snowy winter. The front portion of the ell and the central block were united on the current Main Street site sometime prior to 1833 and the rear portion of the ell added on-site. Ingersoll Robert Green Ingersoll was born here while his father, the Rev. John Ingersoll, was employed as pastor of Dresden's Congregational Church. During that time his family resided in the parsonage. A staunch abolitionist well before this position became popular in the North, Rev. Ingersoll tended not to hold a ministerial appointment very long, and his tenure in Dresden was no exception. The Ingersolls left Dresden when baby Robert was but four months old. Given Robert's brief residence, one might question the appropriateness of placing an Ingersoll museum at the birthplace. This Dresden house is the only one of Robert Ingersoll's residences now standing. For this reason the Dresden building has been celebrated by freethinkers since shortly after his death. Upon Ingersoll's death in 1899, his brother-in-law and official publisher Charles P. Farrell launched the Dresden Publishing Company, named for the village of his birth, to publish a multi-volume set of Ingersoll's collected works. When published in 1900, the first volume bore an engraving of the birthplace. The birthplace has been restored and opened as an Ingersoll museum three times. In 1921 a large committee including Thomas Edison, Luther Burbank, Edgar Lee Masters, and members of the Ingersoll family opened the birthplace as a museum, community house, and public library. The facility closed during the Depression and fell into disrepair. In 1954, a committee led by atheist activist Joseph Lewis restored the building again and operated it as an Ingersoll museum for several years. Current museum Tom Flynn designed the freethought museum at the birthplace of nineteenth century agnostic orator, and has been its director since it opened to the public in 1993. In 1986 the birthplace, a two-story frame house in the small village of Dresden (pop. 300), was badly deteriorated. CODESH Inc., as the Council for Secular Humanism was then known, purchased the property for $7,000 and pressed successfully for its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Some $250,000 was then raised from grant-makers and the public; between 1987 and 1991 the house was stabilized and rehabilitated. Though Flynn was employed at CODESH during this period he was not closely involved with the purchase and rehabilitation, which were orchestrated primarily by chairman Paul Kurtz, then-Free Inquiry editor Tim Madigan, and colleague Richard Seymour. In 1992 it was decided to establish a museum at the birthplace, and Flynn was chosen to develop the museum. Flynn tells D.J. Grothe on Point of Inquiry, \\"He [Ingersoll] literally was seen or heard by more Americans than would see or hear any other human being until the advent of motion pictures or radio.\\" The Robert Green Ingersoll Birthplace Museum opened on Memorial Day weekend in 1993. The Museum has been open to the public on weekends each summer and fall ever since. Conspicuous developments have included, in 2001, installation of a large bust of Ingersoll that had decorated a Dowagiac, Michigan, theater razed in 1968. In 2003, a historically accurate front porch was added by volunteer contractor (and Ingersoll descendant) Jeff Ingersoll. In that year the Museum also adopted its current tagline, referring to Ingersoll as \\"the most remarkable American most people never heard of,\\" a reference to his near-exclusion from history by religious detractors. In 2004 a lost grand march titled Ingersolia, composed by prolific Gilded Age composer George Schleiffarth (died 1921), was rediscovered and its score displayed at the Museum. In 2005 two interpretive Web sites made their debut: a virtual tour of the Ingersoll Museum and a celebration of freethought and radical reform history within a rough 100-mile radius of the Ingersoll Museum, the Freethought Trail. In 2008 the large commemorative plaque marking the location of Ingersoll's New York City residence, removed from the Gramercy Park Hotel when that property was rehabilitated as a boutique hotel, was installed in the Museum. In 2009, the current high-definition widescreen orientation video was installed, featuring the Ingersolia March unearthed in 2004. In 2009 the Museum received a large number of artifacts and papers from the estate of Eva Ingersoll Wakefield, Robert Ingeroll's, last surviving granddaughter. Selected items were displayed beginning in 2010. In 2014, the museum interior was fully renovated. Display cases were refurbished and all-new interpretive signage was developed, including professionally designed mural-sized wall graphics. A formerly private room on the second floor was added to the public display space. The new interior was named the T. M. Scruggs Museum Interior, honoring the largest donor to a 2013 capital campaign to fund the renovation.

Armani and Francis Belge kept secret the location of the bodies of two women murdered by their client, Robert Garrow, Sr. Ahead of trial for an unrelated murder, Garrow confessed to his lawyers that he had murdered two missing women and hidden their bodies. Armani and Belge found the women's bodies but chose to keep the information confidential. Authorities continued to search for the missing women for months as their families grieved. When the public discovered Armani and Belge had kept this information secret, they faced criminal charges and disbarment proceedings. The attorneys claimed they were bound by the duty of confidentiality not to disclose information that could incriminate their client. Armani and Belge were later absolved of any wrongdoing. The case has become a touchstone in legal ethics courses. It highlights lawyers' ethical obligation to keep their clients' information confidential. It also showcases the ethical questions that can arise for lawyers related to confidentiality, attorney-client privilege, and clients' self-incrimination. The case has helped shape the development of ethical rules on confidentiality.  History   Background  In the summer of 1973, attorney Frank H. Armani was appointed to serve as counsel for Robert Garrow, Sr. Garrow, a 38-year old mechanic of a Syracuse bakery, was charged with murdering Philip Domblewski. Domblewski, an 18-year-old college student, was murdered while camping in the Adirondacks. He was tied to a tree and stabbed to death. Three friends were also ambushed, but escaped, leading to an eleven-day manhunt for the killer.Lerman, Lisa G. and Philip G. Schrag. (2016). Ethical Problems in the Practice of Law. Aspen Publishers (Fourth Edition). With no experience in murder trials, Armani recruited his friend Francis Belge, an experienced criminal defense attorney, to help represent Garrow. Ahead of trial, Garrow told his attorneys that he killed Domblewski. Garrow also claimed he murdered and hid the bodies of two missing women, Susan Petz and Alicia Hauck. He drew a diagram to show them where Petz was buried. Armani later claimed that Garrow confessed to the murders after Armani hypnotized him. Following Garrow's confession, Armani and Belge decided to confirm whether Garrow was telling the truth. They used Garrow's diagram to uncover Petz's body in an airshaft of a coal mine. Belge later uncovered Hauck's body in a nearby cemetery based on Garrow's description. The lawyers photographed the remains of both women. Belge moved Hauck's body to ensure a dismembered part was included in the photograph.N.Y. State Bar Ass'n Comm. on Professional Ethics, Op. 479 (1978). They later destroyed the photographs, the record of their conversation with Garrow, and the diagram he drew. Belge and Armani told no one about their discoveries. The attorneys believed they were bound by a duty of confidentiality not to disclose information that could incriminate their client. They chose not to alert authorities despite pleas from Hauck's father for information. Hauck and Armani's daughter went to the same school. Family members and authorities continued to search for the women. The bodies were discovered accidentally five months after Garrow confessed in private to his attorneys.  Trial  Armani and Belge proposed a plea bargain using the information they had uncovered ahead of trial. They told the prosecutor that they might be able to provide information to help authorities find the missing women if Garrow were sentenced to life in a mental hospital rather than prison. The prosecutor refused. In the summer of 1974, Garrow's trial for the murder of Domblewski began. Armani and Belge pursued an insanity defense. While testifying in his own defense, Garrow admitted to murdering four people including Petz and Hauck. During direct examination of Garrow, Belge asked, ‚ÄúIs that the one I found?‚Äù implying that he was aware of the dead women prior to trial. The attorneys held a press conference the next day, where they admitted they had known about the location of the missing women for six months. Garrow was convicted for Domblewski's murder. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.  Public scrutiny  Armani and Belge were harassed and threatened by the public for keeping information about the deceased women secret. They received death threats and angry letters. News outlets claimed they obstructed justice or acted as accomplices after the fact.People v. Belge, 72 N.Y. 2d 798 (1975). The public also criticized lawyers generally for their callousness and lack of concern for the public interest. Armani and Belge faced criminal and ethical proceedings that were later found to be unwarranted. = People v. Belge = A grand jury investigated the attorneys' conduct. Belge was indicted for allegedly violating two state public health laws by failing to disclose his discovery of the dead bodies. In People v. Belge, Belge claimed conversations about the missing women were confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege, which prevents lawyers from disclosing protected communications about their clients. He claimed he could not have shared the information with authorities. The National Association of Criminal Defense lawyers wrote a brief supporting Belge, arguing that attorney-client privilege would be destroyed if Belge were convicted. The New York county court dismissed the indictment \\"in the interests of justice.\\" The court found that Belge had protected the Fifth Amendment constitutional right of his client not to incriminate himself. It also found that Garrow's disclosure of information about the missing women was protected by confidentiality and the attorney- client privilege. In its decision, the court explained: > \\"The effectiveness of counsel is only as great as the confidentiality of its > client-attorney relationship. If the lawyer cannot get all the facts about > the case, he can only give his client half of a defense. This, of necessity, > involves telling his attorney everything remotely connected with the crime.\\" The prosecution appealed. The appeals court confirmed that the claims should be dismissed, but expressed concern about a limitless attorney-client privilege.People v. Belge, 376 N.Y.S. 2d 771 (1975). It noted that attorneys must protect their clients, but must also \\"observe basic human standards of decency.\\" = Ethics complaints = One of the victims' parents filed ethics complaints against Armani and Belge with New York State Bar Association disciplinary officials. The New York State Bar Association Committee on Professional Ethics found that the attorneys acted ethically by refusing to disclose information about the missing women. The committee explained that the attorneys would have violated their ethical obligations to keep their client's confidential information secret if they had disclosed the details to authorities. The ethics opinion emphasized that the attorney-client privilege is necessary to ensure clients disclose all possible pertinent information to their lawyers. It further explained that disclosure of all possibly pertinent information allows attorneys to craft the strongest defense and protect their clients' rights to the fullest extent.  Aftermath  Although both lawyers were ultimately absolved of wrongdoing, the fallout took a toll on Armani and Belge. Belge abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida. Armani suffered a heart attack. His law practice was initially destroyed though he later rebuilt it. Four years after his conviction, Garrow escaped from prison. When authorities searched his cell, they found a hit list including Armani and Belge's names. Armani gave police advice about where Garrow might have gone. This information led police to discover Garrow hiding near the prison. He was shot and killed.  Ethical issues  The central question Armani and Belge faced was whether to disclose the location of the missing women's bodies. Disclosure of their discoveries could have implicated their client in the women's murders. The case also raises broader ethical questions about the role of the lawyer, and their obligations to their clients and society as a whole. The case showcases the tension between protecting a client's interest and the potential emotional harm that victims, their family, or a community might experience. It also shows the potential tension between a lawyer's professional obligations and their personal interests or values. Some scholars have suggested the case presents further ethical questions if altered facts are considered. For example, scholars have asked whether Armani and Belge would have been required to assist the women or disclose their locations had they been found alive.  Legal doctrines  A few contemporary legal and ethical doctrines are relevant in cases like the Buried Bodies Case today.  Confidentiality  Lawyers have an ethical obligation to keep their clients' information secret. This duty of confidentiality extends beyond information the client tells the lawyer directly. Any information a lawyer learns \\"relating to the representation of the client\\" must be kept confidential, including information learned from interviews, photographs, or observations. A lawyer can disclose information if a client consents. If a lawyer violates their client's confidentiality, the lawyer may be subject to disciplinary proceedings. Some states have adopted exceptions to this rule. One exception adopted by some states is that a lawyer may reveal client information if they believe the disclosure is necessary to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.  Attorney-Client Privilege  Lawyers cannot be compelled to disclose certain lawyer-client communications due to the attorney-client privilege. \\"Privileged\\" information includes communications where a client seeks legal advice or services. Attorney-client privilege is not an ethical obligation, but rather a procedural rule. A court can quash a request for a lawyer to disclose information that violates the privilege.  Fifth Amendment  The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects defendants against self-incrimination.U.S. Const. amend. V.  Impact  The Buried Bodies Case attracted significant attention in the mid-1970s in the throes of the Watergate scandal. Several legal scholars believe Armani and Belge acted ethically in refraining from sharing their client's confession. During Watergate, the American Bar Association (ABA) began reconsidering attorneys' ethical obligations. Meanwhile, law schools too began reconsidering the form of legal ethics in their curriculum.  Confidentiality rules  While ethical rules are determined by each state, portions of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct have been adopted by 49 states. All states have some ethical duty of confidentiality in their code of professional responsibility. The Buried Bodies Case helped shape the development of one of the main exceptions to the ABA's rule on confidentiality (Model Rule 1.6). Model Rule 1.6 provides that a lawyer will not reveal information relevant to her representation of a client without the client's consent. The case contributed to an exception that allows lawyers to disclose information if a person could be imminently harmed. The exception states that a lawyer may reveal information relating to their client if they reasonably believe it is necessary \\"to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.\\" This exception, added by amendment in 2002, was hotly contested; lawyers worried the language might erode the duty of confidentiality.  Legal ethics education  The case has become a touchstone of legal ethics courses. The case is widely taught in law schools to examine concerns that arise out of the duty of confidentiality. It is a fixture in professional responsibility textbooks. It may have also encouraged legal ethics professors to incorporate problems or case studies into their teaching. The Buried Bodies Case provided professors with an example in the mid-1970s of how ethical issues could be taught from a human perspective with real world problems. The case has also been used by business schools to explore the challenges that can arise from role-based obligations.  Criticism  The mother of Susan Petz, one of the girls murdered by Garrow, remains unsatisfied by the case. In a 2016 interview with Radiolab, she criticized law schools for teaching the case. She suggested lawyers should consider the victims' families when deciding whether to keep information about missing victims confidential. Some legal scholars have also criticized the case. Some argue the attorneys' refusal to disclose the confidential information did not lead to a better outcome for the client. Others say the attorneys' refusal to share information with the women's families was appalling; they claim attorneys should disclose information that might provide closure for victims in a way that would not impact their client. Similarly, some have considered a new exception to confidentiality rules to allow disclosure when victims suffer severe emotional harm. Moreover, others criticize the case for exempting lawyers from laws, like the public health code requiring the disclosure of dead bodies, that apply to everyone else.  Popular culture  The case has been the subject of numerous books, including Privileged Information by Tom Alibrandi with Frank Armani (1984) and Terror in the Adirondacks: The True Story of Serial Killer Robert F. Garrow by Lawrence Gooley (2009). It was featured in ‚ÄúThe Buried Bodies Case‚Äù in 2016 on the podcast RadioLab. It has also been dramatized in the 1987 TV film Sworn to Silence, and a 2003 episode of the TV series Law & Order, ‚ÄúBodies.‚Äù In 2017, Fargo producer Noah Hawley announced the development of a feature film based on the case.

The Vellar river basin is in the northern part of Tamil Nadu State in South India, between the latitudes 11¬∞ 13'N - 12 00' N and longitude 78¬∞ 13'E - 79¬∞ 47 E. This basin is between the Ponnaiar, Paravanar and Cauvery river basins. The terrain lying in the Kalrayan hills, Attur Taluk of Salem District is drained by river upper velar, Vasis ta Nadhi known as Upper Vellar joined with to form the Vellar in the Perambalur Taluk of Permabalur District. Tributaries The river Vellar has six named tributaries. They are Anaimaduvu, Swethanadhi, Kallar, Chinnar, Manimukthanadhi, and Gomukhi. A portion of Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Perambalur, Trichy, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts fall within the Vellar river basin. Manimukthanadhi, which is the major tributary, also originates from Kalrayan hills in Villupuram district, traverses about and joins Vellar near Srimushnam in Chidambararm taluk of Cuddalore District. Upper Vellar drains the water from the southern slopes of the Kalrayan hills on the northern boundary of Attur Taluk of Salem district. It originates at an elevation of above mean sea level. At its starting point, it is known as Anaimaduvu River and flows southwards for and then south-east. One reservoir constructed across Anaimaduvu River is called Anaimaduvu reservoir.

Each map is independent from the others in style and function. A player may choose to be in a map inspired by the real- world Thames River in London for one game, and then switch over to one that's a larger than life recreation of a detailed dollhouse.Manga Fighter Peek #2 The current maps are: Moon, Garden, City Front, Diorama, Doll House, Flying Castle, Ossyria, Ground Zero, Temple of Fear, and Bridge. Games Campus even considered making a jungle map which was inspired by some members on the forums. Skills Skill Cards can be obtained from the CardShop or inside a game. Every player will have four card slots when they are in a game. Skills can be used when the Skill Gauge reaches a certain level. The skill Gauge is filled when the player inflicts or takes damage. Skills grant special abilities to a player temporarily, such as becoming invisible or transforming into a powerful being. Skill cards can be enabled or disabled in specific game rooms. GM Events Occasionally, there are GM events. These are events where players can obtain rare or good items (sometimes even CC) from a game master (GM). Players are notified 10 minutes before an event starts. The GM will create a room and announce the password so the fastest players can enter. Usually the event is just a normal match, but could also be a set of tournaments. Campus credits CC otherwise known as Campus Credits is the game currency. Whenever you buy an item or a weapon, you can use CC. CC could be brought from their official website or win in a GM Event.

The 1835 tunnel was the third rail tunnel constructed in the United States, and is the third oldest still in use.

These shafts were spaced at intervals to correct errors in the tunnel alignment. Construction of the tunnel cost an estimated $178,992. Noted local miner, geologist and palaentologist Charles M.

Roosevelt on June 16, 1933. The National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) was a US labor law and consumer law passed by the 73rd US Congress to authorize the President to regulate industry for fair wages and prices that would stimulate economic recovery., codified at ) It also established a national public works program known as the Public Works Administration (PWA), not to be confused with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of 1935.Ellis W. Hawley, New Deal and the Problem of Monopoly: A Study in Economic Ambivalence (1971) The National Recovery Administration (NRA) portion was widely hailed in 1933, but by 1934 business' opinion of the act had soured. By March 1934 the ‚ÄúNRA was engaged chiefly in drawing up these industrial codes for all industries to adopt.\\" However, the NIRA was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1935 and not replaced.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal, (2003) pp. 87‚Äì176.Roger Biles, A New Deal for the American People (1991) pp. 78‚Äì95)Kennedy, Freedom from Fear, (2001) pp. 151‚Äì54. The legislation was enacted in June 1933 during the Great Depression in the United States as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislative program. Section 7(a) of the bill, which protected collective bargaining rights for unions, proved contentious (especially in the Senate), but both chambers eventually passed the legislation. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The Act had two main sections (or \\"titles\\"). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, authorizing the promulgation of industrial codes of fair competition, guaranteed trade union rights, permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined petroleum products and their transportation. Title II established the Public Works Administration, outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in. Title II also provided funding for the Act. The Act was implemented by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA).Himmelberg, The Origins of the National Recovery Administration, 1993. Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act,Eisner, Regulatory Politics in Transition, 2000.Best, Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933‚Äì1938, 1991. which led to a significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today.Bellush, The Failure of the NRA, 1975.National Recovery Review Board, Report to the President of the United States, First report, May 21, 1934. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community,Paulsen, \\"The Federal Trade Commission v. the National Recovery Administration, 1935,\\" Social Science Quarterly, March 1989. and that it was poorly administered.Horwitz, The Irony of Regulatory Reform: The Deregulation of American Telecommunications, 1989. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest.Dubofsky and Dulles, Labor in America: A History, 1999; Bernstein, The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933‚Äì1941, 1970; Rayback, A History of American Labor, 1974. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass the National Labor Relations Act in 1935.Bernstein, The New Deal Collective Bargaining Policy, 1975; Vittoz, New Deal Labor Policy and the American Industrial Economy, 1987; Gross, The Making of the National Labor Relations Board, 1974; Tomlins, The State and the Unions, 1985; Fine, Automobile Under the Blue Eagle, 1963. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements. Background and enactment The Depression began in the United States in October 1929 and grew steadily worse to its nadir in early 1933.Galbraith, The Great Crash of 1929, 1997. President Herbert Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values. His laissez-faire views appeared to be shared by the Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon.Smith, The Shattered Dream: Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression, 1970; Barber, From New Era to New Deal, 1989; Sobel and Hyman, Herbert Hoover at the Onset of the Great Depression, 1929‚Äì1930, 1975. To combat with the growing economic decline, Hoover organized a number of voluntary measures with businesses, encouraged state and local government responses, and accelerated federal building projects. However his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: Crisis of the Old Order, 2003. Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (which provided funds for public works programs) and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses). Hoover was defeated for re- election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt was convinced that federal activism was needed to reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry. Enactment Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1933. Enactment of the National Industrial Recovery Act climaxed the first 100 days of Roosevelt's presidency. Hugh S. Johnson, Raymond Moley, Donald Richberg, Rexford Tugwell, Jerome Frank, and Bernard Baruch‚Äîkey Roosevelt advisors‚Äîbelieved that unrestrained competition had helped cause the Great Depression and that government had a critical role to play through national planning, limited regulation, the fostering of trade associations, support for \\"fair\\" trade practices, and support for \\"democratization of the workplace\\" (a standard work week, shorter working hours, and better working conditions).Johnson, The Blue Eagle From Egg to Earth, 1935.Moley, After Seven Years, 1939; Vadney, The Wayward Liberal: A Political Biography of Donald Richberg, 1970; Richberg, My Hero: The Autobiography of Donald Richberg, 1954; Sternsher, Rexford Tugwell and the New Deal, 1964. Roosevelt, himself the former head of a trade association, believed that government promotion of \\"self-organization\\" by trade associations was the least-intrusive and yet most effective method for achieving national planning and economic improvement. Some work on an industrial relief bill had been done in the weeks following Roosevelt's election, but much of this was in the nature of talk and the exchange of ideas rather than legislative research and drafting.Phillips and Mitgang, From the Crash to the Blitz, 1929‚Äì1939, 2000. The administration, preoccupied with banking and agriculture legislation, did not begin working on industrial relief legislation until early April 1933.McKenna, Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War, 2002.Houck, Rhetoric As Currency: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the Great Depression, 2001. Congress, however, was moving on its own industrial legislation. In the Senate, Robert F. Wagner, Edward P. Costigan, and Robert M. La Follette, Jr. were promoting public works legislation, and Hugo Black was pushing short-work-week legislation. Motivated to work on his own industrial relief bill by these efforts, Roosevelt ordered Moley to work with these Senators (and anyone else in government who seemed interested) to craft a bill. By May 1933, two draft bills had emerged, a cautious and legalistic one by John Dickinson (Under Secretary of Commerce) and an ambitious one focusing on trade associations by Hugh Johnson. Many leading businessmen‚Äîincluding Gerard Swope (head of General Electric), Charles M. Schwab (chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corporation), E. H. Harriman (chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad), and Henry I. Harriman, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce‚Äîhelped draft the legislation. A two-part bill, the first section promoting cooperative action among business to achieve fair competition and provide for national planning and a second section establishing a national public works program, was submitted to Congress on May 15, 1933. The House of Representatives easily passed the bill in just seven days. The most contentious issue was the inclusion of Section 7(a), which protected collective bargaining rights for unions.Morris, The Blue Eagle At Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights In The American Workplace, 2004. Section 7(a) was nearly passed into the bill, but Senator Wagner, Jerome Frank, and Leon Keyserling (another Roosevelt aide) worked to retain the section in order to win the support of the American labor movement. The bill had a more difficult time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to weaken Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth in the hands of the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression).Gould, The Most Exclusive Club: A History of the Modern United States Senate, 2006.\\"Borah Debates With Wagner.\\" Associated Press. June 8, 1933. Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor.

President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. Structure of the Act The National Industrial Recovery Act had two major titles. Title I was devoted to industrial recovery. Title I, Section 2 empowered the President to establish executive branch agencies to carry out the purposes of the Act, and provided for a sunset provision nullifying the Act in two years.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 2. The heart of the Act was Title I, Section 3, which permitted trade or industrial associations to seek presidential approval of codes of fair competition (so long as such codes did not promote monopolies or provide unfair competition against small businesses) and provided for enforcement of these codes.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 3. Title I, Section 5 exempted the codes from the federal antitrust laws.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 5. Title I, Section 7(a) guaranteed the right of workers to form unions and banned yellow-dog contracts: > ... employees shall have the right to organize and bargain collectively > through representatives of their own choosing, and shall be free from the > interference restraint, or coercion of employers of labor, or their agents, > in the designation of such representatives or in self-organization or in > other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other > mutual aid or protection; [and] (2) that no employee and no one seeking > employment shall be required as a condition of employment to join any > company union or to refrain from joining, organizing, or assisting a labor > organization of his own choosing... .National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. > 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 7(a). Title I, Section 7(b) permitted the establishment of standards regarding maximum hours of labor, minimum rates of pay, and working conditions in the industries covered by the codes, while Section 7(c) authorized the President to impose such standards on codes when voluntary agreement could not be reached.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 7(b). Title I, Section 9 authorized the regulation of oil pipelines and prices for the transportation of all petroleum products by pipeline.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 9(a). Section 9(b) permitted the executive to take over any oil pipeline company, subsidiary, or business if the parent company was found in violation of the Act.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 9(b). Title II established the Public Works Administration. Title II, Section 201 established the agency and provided for a two-year sunset provision.Sections in Title I of the NIRA are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. However, in a discrepancy, sections in Title II and III of the NIRA are numbered 201, 202, 203, etc. and 301, 302, 303, etc. National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 201. Section 202 outlines the types of public works which the new agency may seek to fund or build.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 202. Title II, Section 203 authorized the Public Works Administration to provide grants and/or loans to states and localities in order to more rapidly reduce unemployment as well as to use the power of eminent domain to seize land or materials to engage in public works.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 203. Title II, Section 204 explicitly provided $400 million for the construction of public highways, bridges, roads, railroad crossings, paths, and other transportation projects.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 204. Title II, Section 208 authorized the president to expend up to $25 million to purchase farms for the purpose of relocating individuals living in overcrowded urban areas (such as cities) to these farms and allowing them to raise crops and earn a living there.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 208. Title II, Sections 210‚Äì219 provided for revenues to fund the Act, and Section 220 appropriated money for the Act's implementation.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title II, Sec. 210‚Äì220. Title III of the Act contained miscellaneous provisions, and transferred the authority to engage in public works from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Public Works Administration.National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title III. Implementation Blue Eagle poster, the image most commonly associated with the NIRA. Implementation of the Act began immediately. Hugh Johnson spent most of May and June planning for implementation, and the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was established on June 20, 1933‚Äîa scant four days after the law's enactment. Roosevelt angered Johnson by having him administer only the NRA, while the Public Works Administration (PWA) went to Harold L. Ickes.Clarke, Roosevelt's Warrior: Harold L. Ickes and the New Deal, 2006. NRA and PWA reported to different cabinet agencies, making coordination difficult, and PWA money flowed so slowly into the economy that NRA proved to be the more important agency by far. The premiere symbol of the NIRA was the Blue Eagle. NIRA, as implemented by the NRA, became notorious for generating large numbers of regulations. The agency approved 557 basic and 189 supplemental industry codes in two years. Between 4,000 and 5,000 business practices were prohibited, some 3,000 administrative orders running to over 10,000 pages promulgated, and thousands of opinions and guides from national, regional, and local code boards interpreted and enforced the Act. The backlash against the Act was so significant that it generated a large loss of political support for the New Deal and turned a number of Roosevelt's closest aides against him. Roosevelt himself shifted his views on the best way to achieve economic recovery, and began a new legislative program (known as the \\"Second New Deal\\") in 1935.Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt, Vol. 3: The Politics of Upheaval, 1935‚Äì1936, 2003; Brinkley, The End Of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War, 1996; Venn, The New Deal, 1999; Shogan, Backlash: The Killing of the New Deal, 2006. Implementation of Section 7(a) of the NIRA proved immensely problematic as well. The protections of the Act led to a massive wave of union organizing punctuated by employer and union violence, general strikes, and recognition strikes. At the outset, NRA Administrator Hugh Johnson na√Øvely believed that Section 7(a) would be self-enforcing, but he quickly learned otherwise. In addition, the National Labor Board was established under the auspices of the NRA to implement the collective bargaining provisions of the Act. The National Labor Board, too, proved to be ineffective, and on July 5, 1935, a new law‚Äîthe National Labor Relations Act‚Äîsuperseded the NIRA and established a new, long-lasting federal labor policy. The leadership of the Public Works Authority was torn over the new agency's mission. PWA could initiate its own construction projects, distribute money to other federal agencies to fund their construction projects, or make loans to states and localities to fund their construction projects. But many in the Roosevelt administration felt PWA should not spend money, for fear of worsening the federal deficit, and so funds flowed slowly. Furthermore, the very nature of construction (planning, specifications, and blueprints) also held up the disbursement of money. Harold Ickes, too, was determined to ensure that graft and corruption did not tarnish the agency's reputation and lead to loss of political support in Congress, and so moved cautiously in spending the agency's money. Although the U.S. Supreme Court would rule Title I of NIRA unconstitutional, the severability clause in the Act enabled the PWA to survive. Among the projects it funded between 1935 and 1939 are: the USS Yorktown; USS Enterprise; the 30th Street railroad station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Triborough Bridge; the port of Brownsville; Grand Coulee Dam; Boulder Dam; Fort Peck Dam; Bonneville Dam; and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland. The agency survived until 1943, when the Reorganization Act of 1939 consolidated most federal public works and work relief functions of the federal government into the new Federal Works Agency.\\"Executive Order 9357 ‚Äì Transferring the Functions of the Public Works Administration to the Federal Works Agency.\\" June 30, 1943.

Historical Dictionary of the Great Depression, 1929‚Äì1940. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001. President Roosevelt sought re-authorization of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But the backlash against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead. By May 1935, the issue was moot as the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled Title I of NIRA unconstitutional. Legal challenge and nullification Chief Justice of the U.S. Charles Evans Hughes. On April 13, 1934, the President had approved the \\"Code of Fair Competition for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in and about the City of New York.\\"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. The United States, 295 U.S. 495, 555, fn. 5. The goal of the code was to ensure that live poultry (provided to kosher slaughterhouses for butchering and sale to observant Jews) were fit for human consumption and to prevent the submission of false sales and price reports. The industry was almost entirely centered on New York City. Under the new poultry code, the Schechter brothers were indicted on 60 counts (of which 27 were dismissed by the trial court), acquitted on 14, and convicted in 19.Schechter Poultry Corp. v. The United States, 295 U.S. 495, 555, fn. 2. One of the counts on which they were convicted was for selling a diseased bird, leading Hugh Johnson to jokingly call the suit the \\"sick chicken case\\". Even before these legal aspects became widely known, a number of court challenges to the NIRA were winding their way through the courts. The constitutionality of the NIRA was tested in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). Courts identified three problems with the NIRA: \\"(i) was the subject matter sought to be regulated by the power of Congress; (ii) if the regulations violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (iii) had Congress properly delegated its power to the executive.\\" \\"Some Legal Aspects of the National Industrial Recovery Act.\\" Harvard Law Review. 47:1 (1933): 85‚Äì125. Although Roosevelt, most of his aides, Johnson, and the NIRA staff felt the Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, declined to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code on the grounds that the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3. On May 27, 1935, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. The United States that Title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act was unconstitutional. First, Hughes concluded that the law was void for vagueness because of the critical term \\"fair competition\\"National Industrial Recovery Act, Ch. 90, 48 Stat. 195, Title I, Sec. 3(a) reads: \\"Upon the application to the President by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, the President may approve a code or codes of fair competition for the trade or industry or subdivision thereof ...\\" was nowhere defined in the Act.Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 531. Second, Hughes found the Act's delegation of authority to the executive branch unconstitutionally overbroad: > To summarize and conclude upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 > USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, > industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct > to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate > administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it > authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative > undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the > general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in > section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the nature > of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in > approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of > trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think > that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional > delegation of legislative power.Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, > 295 U.S. 495, 541‚Äì542. Finally, in a very restrictive reading of what constituted interstate commerce,Ross, The Chief Justiceship of Charles Evans Hughes, 1930‚Äì1941, 2007. Hughes held that the \\"'current' or 'flow'\\" of commerce involved was simply too minute to constitute interstate commerce, and subsequently Congress had no power under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation affecting such commercial transactions.Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 542‚Äì548. The Court dismissed with a bare paragraph the government's ability to regulate wages and hours.Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 548‚Äì550. Although the government had argued that the national economic emergency required special consideration, Hughes disagreed. The dire economic circumstances the country faced did not justify the overly broad delegation or overreach of the Act, the majority concluded. \\"Extraordinary conditions may call for extraordinary remedies. But the argument necessarily stops short of an attempt to justify action which lies outside the sphere of constitutional authority. Extraordinary conditions do not create or enlarge constitutional power.\\"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 528. Although the decision emasculated NIRA, it had little practical impact, as Congress was unlikely to have reauthorized the Act in any case.As of 2007, Schechter Poultry and Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), are the only cases in which the Supreme Court has struck down an act of Congress for overbroad delegation of legislative authority. See: Ross, The Chief Justiceship of Charles Evans Hughes, 1930‚Äì1941, 2007. Criticism A key criticism of the Act at the time as well as more recently is that the NIRA endorsed monopolies, with the attendant economic problems associated with that type of market failure. Even the National Recovery Review Board, established by President Roosevelt in March 1934 to review the performance of the NIRA, concluded that the Act hindered economic growth by promoting cartels and monopolies.This was not, however, unexpected: Senator Gerald Nye, an ardent opponent of monopolies, named five of the Board's six members, and long-time antitrust advocate Clarence Darrow led the Board. See: Schlesinger, The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal, 2003, pp. 132‚Äì34. One of the economic effects of monopoly and cartels is higher prices‚Äîthis was seen as necessary because the severe deflation of 1929‚Äì33 had depressed prices 20% and more.Farrell, Chris. Deflation: What Happens When Prices Fall. New York: HarperCollins, 2004. ; There is anecdotal evidence that these higher prices led to some stability in industry, but a number of scholars maintain that these prices were so high that economic recovery was inhibited.Weinstein, Recovery and Redistribution Under the NIRA, 1980; Roose, The Economics of Recession and Revival: An Interpretation of 1937‚Äì38, 1954; Hayes, Business Confidence and Business Activity: A Case Study of the Recession of 1937, 1951. But other economists disagree, pointing to far more important monetary, budgetary, and tax policies as contributors to the continuation of the Great Depression.Friedman and Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867‚Äì1960, 1963; Others point out that the cartels created by the Act were inherently unstable (as all cartels are), and that the effect on prices was minimal because the codes collapsed so quickly.; ; ; Perloff, Jeffrey M; Karp, Larry S.; and Golan, Amos. Estimating Market Power and Strategies. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007. A second key criticism of the Act is that it lacked support from the business community, and thus was doomed to failure. Business support for national planning and government intervention was very strong in 1933, but had collapsed by mid-1934. Many studies conclude, however, that business support for NIRA was never uniform. Larger, older businesses embraced the legislation while smaller, newer ones (more nimble in a highly competitive market and with less capital investment to lose if they failed) did not.Galambos, Competition and Cooperation: The Emergence of a National Trade Association, 1966; This is a classic problem of cartels, and thus NIRA codes failed as small business abandoned the cartels. Studies of the steel, automobile manufacturing, lumber, textile, and rubber industries and the level and source of support for the NIRA tend to support this conclusion.Stewart, Steel ‚Äì Problems of a Great Industry, 1937; Kennedy, The Automobile Industry: The Coming of Age of Capitalism's Favorite Child, 1941; Daugherty, et al., The Economics of the Iron and Steel Industry, 1937; Rae, American Automobile Manufacturers: The First Forty Years, 1959; ; Shaffer, In Restraint of Trade: The Business Campaign Against Competition, 1918‚Äì1938, 1997; Without the support of industry, the Act could never have performed as it was intended. A third major criticism of the Act is that it was poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing for interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NIRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NIRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies‚Äîcontributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes. There are a wide range of additional critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery.Lyon, et al., The National Recovery Administration: An Analysis and Appraisal, 1935. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NIRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery.Bernstein, The Great Depression: Delayed Recovery and Economic Change in America, 1929‚Äì1939, 1989. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever. As noted above, Section 7(a) led to significant increases in union organizing, as intended by the Act. But the enforcement of Section 7(a) and its legal limitations led to clear failures. Although Section 7(a) was not affected by the Supreme Court's decision in Schechter Poultry, the failure of the section led directly to passage of the National Labor Relations Act in July 1935. Historian Alan Brinkley stated that by 1935 the NIRA was a \\"woeful failure, even a political embarrassment.\\" Many liberals, probably including Roosevelt, were quietly relieved by its demise. However, New Dealers were worried by the Supreme Court's strict interpretation of the interstate commerce clause and worried that other legislation was jeopardized.Brinkley, The End Of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War, 1996, Kindle Location 385. Legacy In 1934, at the request of the Secretary Ickes, who wished to use the statute criminalizing making false statements to enforce Section 9(c) of the NIRA against producers of \\"hot oil\\", oil produced in violation of production restrictions established pursuant to the NIRA, Congress passed , which amended the False Claims Act of 1863 to read: > ... or whoever ~~, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the > payment or approval of such claim, or for the purpose and with the intent of > cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States, or > any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of > America is a stockholder,~~ shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal > or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or > cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or > make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, > roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the > same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry, in any > matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United > States or of any corporation in which the United States of America is a > stockholder ...

R. Rahman with song lyrics by Vairamuthu and Madhan Karky, to the 2016 Tamil film of the same name, produced by Suriya and directed by Vikram Kumar. The film stars Suriya, Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Nithya Menen in lead roles. The album features six tracks, and was released on 9 April 2016 by Eros Music. Background In November 2014, A. R. Rahman was announced as the film soundtrack and score composer. Rahman had a six-hour script narration session with Suriya and Vikram Kumar before signing the project. Recording of the track \\"Punnagaye\\" written by lyricist Vairamuthu was completed by February 2015. In an interview with The Hindu, Suriya told that recording of one more track was completed by September 2015. According to lyricist Madhan Karky, for the track \\"Naan Un\\": Rahman was trying out a tune on his piano and Karky was writing the lyrics while listening to him. He wrote a line in Tamil, \\"Undhan Azhagil Iraivanai Kaankiraen\\" that translates to, \\"In Your Beauty, I See God.\\" An inspiration before composing tunes, Rahman had read the same line from the Prophetic books before composing that track. However, the track was initially composed for some other film. Later, it was reworked to suit the film soundtrack. An additional composition written by Madhan Karky titled, \\"Dangerskku Hi5 Podu, Daredevilkku Vaanam Podu.\\" was as an intro song only in the film score. However, the track was released as a bonus single under the title \\"24 Carat\\" on 19 May 2016. Release The original and Telugu versions of the album were released at separate events held at Sathyam Cinemas in Chennai and Shilpkala Vedika in Hyderabad respectively on 9 April 2016. At the launch of original version of the album, there were live performances of songs from the film. Singer Benny Dayal sang the track \\"Kaalam En Kadhali\\", followed by Chinmayi singing \\"Naan Un\\". Shakthisree Gopalan was next with the track \\"Aararoo\\" and the Telugu version \\"Laalijo\\" was sung by actress Nithya Menen with A. R. Rahman playing the keyboard. The songs were released a day before the launch on 8 April.  Critical response  Gulf News based critic Mythily Ramachandran stated: \\"A. R. Rahman‚Äôs music grows on you and is refreshing.\\" Latha Srinivasan of DNA India mentioned: \\"A. R. Rahman's songs and score add tremendous value to this script as well.\\" Sify quoted: \\"Rahman‚Äôs songs are big plus for the film and the maestro scores well in the BGM of Athreya‚Äôs sequences, especially in the pre-climax portion.\\" Critical review board based at Behindwoods praised the music: \\"The score in typical A. R. Rahman style sets the mood right for the tale.\\" Mani Prabhu of NDTV Movies called the songs \\"eye popping\\" that fits into the entertainment.\\" Anupama Subramaniam of Deccan Chronicle stated: \\"AR Rahman‚Äôs background score elevates the proceedings while the songs are already a hit.\\" Subha Shetty Saha of Mid Day stated that the film has \\"melodius music\\" by A. R. Rahman. Critic S. Saraswathi of Rediff stated: \\"The beautifully composed songs by Rahman are well picturised, but act as speed breakers to the narrative.\\" Sreedhar Pillai, in his review for Firstpost wrote: \\"A. R. Rahman‚Äôs background music is in sync with the theme of the film, though songs are barely hummable\\". In his review for The Indian Express, Goutham VS writes: \\"A R Rahman‚Äôs background score blended perfectly with the scenes, especially when Mani‚Äôs wonderstruck mind was seeking answers about the mysterious watch, but Rahman seems to have lost his magic when it comes to the songs.\\" For his review to Filmibeat, Avinash Gopinath noted: \\"AR Rahman's music is not up to the mark. While background score is only average, his songs are made bearable by brilliant visuals.\\" Baradwaj Rangan, in his review for The Hindu, wrote that the numbers by A. R. Rahman are lead up to only for the film. M. Suganth of The Times of India wrote: \\"AR Rahman disappoints with a rather serviceable score.\\" Arathi Kanan for the online newspaper Manorama wrote: \\"Rahman interludes are welcome.

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers. Origin of the term A computer log entry from the Mark II, with a moth taped to the page The terms \\"bug\\" and \\"debugging\\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.InfoWorld Oct 5, 1981 While she was working on a Mark II computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \\"debugging\\" the system. However, the term \\"bug\\", in the sense of \\"technical error\\", dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion). Similarly, the term \\"debugging\\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers. Indeed, in an interview Grace Hopper remarked that she was not coining the term. The moth fit the already existing terminology, so it was saved. A letter from J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of the WWII atomic bomb \\"Manhattan\\" project at Los Alamos, NM) used the term in a letter to Dr. Ernest Lawrence at UC Berkeley, dated October 27, 1944,https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/images/bigscience25.jpg regarding the recruitment of additional technical staff. The Oxford English Dictionary entry for \\"debug\\" quotes the term \\"debugging\\" used in reference to airplane engine testing in a 1945 article in the Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. An article in \\"Airforce\\" (June 1945 p. 50) also refers to debugging, this time of aircraft cameras. Hopper's bug was found on September 9, 1947. Computer programmers did not adopt the term until the early 1950s. The seminal article by GillS. Gill, The Diagnosis of Mistakes in Programmes on the EDSAC, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 206, No. 1087 (May 22, 1951), pp. 538-554 in 1951 is the earliest in-depth discussion of programming errors, but it does not use the term \\"bug\\" or \\"debugging\\". In the ACM's digital library, the term \\"debugging\\" is first used in three papers from 1952 ACM National Meetings.Robert V. D. Campbell, Evolution of automatic computation, Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p 29-32, 1952.Alex Orden, Solution of systems of linear inequalities on a digital computer, Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p. 91-95, 1952.Howard B. Demuth, John B. Jackson, Edmund Klein, N. Metropolis, Walter Orvedahl, James H. Richardson, MANIAC doi=10.1145/800259.808982, Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Toronto), p. 13-16 Two of the three use the term in quotation marks. By 1963 \\"debugging\\" was a common-enough term to be mentioned in passing without explanation on page 1 of the CTSS manual.The Compatible Time-Sharing System, M.I.T. Press, 1963 Peggy A. Kidwell's article Stalking the Elusive Computer BugPeggy Aldrich Kidwell, Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug, IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 1998. discusses the etymology of \\"bug\\" and \\"debug\\" in greater detail. Scope As software and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words \\"anomaly\\" and \\"discrepancy\\" can be used, as being more neutral terms, to avoid the words \\"error\\" and \\"defect\\" or \\"bug\\" where there might be an implication that all so-called errors, defects or bugs must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an anomaly (or discrepancy) would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the unnecessary. Not all issues are safety-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long- term, than living with the known (where the \\"cure would be worse than the disease\\"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a \\"zero-defects\\" mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero defects. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same \\"bugs\\" occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system. Tools Xbox debug unit intended for developers. Debugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates. The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as debuggers. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term debugger can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging. Generally, high-level programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C or assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and it is often difficult to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugger tools may be needed. In certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful. These take the form of static code analysis tools. These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code, concentrating more on the semantics (e.g. data flow) rather than the syntax, as compilers and interpreters do. Both commercial and free tools exist for various languages; some claim to be able to detect hundreds of different problems. These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walk-throughs. A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs before the variable is assigned a value. As another example, some such tools perform strong type checking when the language does not require it. Thus, they are better at locating likely errors in code that is syntactically correct. But these tools have a reputation of false positives, where correct code is flagged as dubious. The old Unix lint program is an early example. For debugging electronic hardware (e.g., computer hardware) as well as low-level software (e.g., BIOSes, device drivers) and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, or in-circuit emulators (ICEs) are often used, alone or in combination. An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger's tasks on low-level software and firmware. Debugging process Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes and some Heisenbugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem. After the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear. After the test case is sufficiently simplified, a programmer can use a debugger tool to examine program states (values of variables, plus the call stack) and track down the origin of the . Alternatively, tracing can be used. In simple cases, tracing is just a few print statements, which output the values of variables at certain points of program execution. Techniques * Interactive debugging * ' (or tracing) is the act of watching (live or recorded) trace statements, or print statements, that indicate the flow of execution of a process. This is sometimes called ', due to the use of the printf function in C. This kind of debugging was turned on by the command TRON in the original versions of the novice-oriented BASIC programming language. TRON stood for, \\"Trace On.\\" TRON caused the line numbers of each BASIC command line to print as the program ran. * Remote debugging is the process of debugging a program running on a system different from the debugger. To start remote debugging, a debugger connects to a remote system over a communications link such as a local area network. The debugger can then control the execution of the program on the remote system and retrieve information about its state. * Post-mortem debugging is debugging of the program after it has already crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques like examining log files, outputting a call stack on crash, and analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when the process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer- inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user. * \\"Wolf fence\\" algorithm: Edward Gauss described this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for Communications of the ACM as follows: \\"There's one wolf in Alaska; how do you find it? First build a fence down the middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf.\\" This is implemented e.g. in the Git version control system as the command git bisect, which uses the above algorithm to determine which commit introduced a particular bug. * Record and replay debugging is the technique of creating a program execution recording (e.g. using Mozilla's free rr debugging tool; enabling reversible debugging/execution), which can be replayed and interactively debugged. Useful for remote debugging and debugging intermittent, non-determinstic, and other hard-to-reproduce defects. * Delta Debugging a technique of automating test case simplification. * Saff Squeeze a technique of isolating failure within the test using progressive inlining of parts of the failing test. * Causality tracking: There are techniques to track the cause effect chains in the computation. Those techniques can be tailored for specific bugs, such as null pointer dereferences. Debugging for embedded systems In contrast to the general purpose computer software design environment, a primary characteristic of embedded environments is the sheer number of different platforms available to the developers (CPU architectures, vendors, operating systems, and their variants). Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed for different platforms. Despite the challenge of heterogeneity mentioned above, some debuggers have been developed commercially as well as research prototypes. Examples of commercial solutions come from Green Hills Software, Lauterbach GmbH and Microchip's MPLAB-ICD (for in-circuit debugger). Two examples of research prototype tools are Aveksha and Flocklab. They all leverage a functionality available on low-cost embedded processors, an On-Chip Debug Module (OCDM), whose signals are exposed through a standard JTAG interface. They are benchmarked based on how much change to the application is needed and the rate of events that they can keep up with. In addition to the typical task of identifying bugs in the system, embedded system debugging also seeks to collect information about the operating states of the system that may then be used to analyze the system: to find ways to boost its performance or to optimize other important characteristics (e.g. energy consumption, reliability, real-time response, etc.). Anti-debugging Anti-debugging is \\"the implementation of one or more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering or debugging a target process\\". It is actively used by recognized publishers in copy-protection schemas, but is also used by malware to complicate its detection and elimination. Techniques used in anti-debugging include: * API-based: check for the existence of a debugger using system information * Exception-based: check to see if exceptions are interfered with * Process and thread blocks: check whether process and thread blocks have been manipulated * Modified code: check for code modifications made by a debugger handling software breakpoints * Hardware- and register- based: check for hardware breakpoints and CPU registers * Timing and latency: check the time taken for the execution of instructions * Detecting and penalizing debugger An early example of anti-debugging existed in early versions of Microsoft Word which, if a debugger was detected, produced a message that said, \\"The tree of evil bears bitter fruit. Now trashing program disk.\\", after which it caused the floppy disk drive to emit alarming noises with the intent of scaring the user away from attempting it again.

The Salmon Falls Creek valley served as a trade route between the Native American groups of the Snake River Plain and Great Basin. Today, most of its water is used for irrigation. Course Salmon Falls Creek headwaters area in Nevada, with the confluence of north and south forks and south fork tributary streams Salmon Falls Creek entering the southern end of Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir View south down the Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir from the east end of the Salmon Falls Creek Dam View north down the Salmon Falls Creek Gorge from the Salmon Falls Dam Salmon Falls Creek approaching Jackpot, Nevada, and the confluence with Cottonwood Creek (not the same Cottonwood Creek that is tributary to the South Fork) Salmon Falls Creek rises in the arid Jarbidge Mountains of northern Nevada at the confluence of its North and South Forks. The North Fork, sometimes considered the main stem of Salmon Falls Creek, is long, and the South Fork long. Many of the creek's headwater streams originate in the Humboldt National Forest and converge to form a short canyon. At the confluence with Jakes Creek the creek swings northeast into the O'Neil Basin, a valley along U.S. Highway 93, flowing north , then passes the town of Jackpot and receives Shoshone Creek, its largest tributary, from the right. From the Shoshone Creek confluence, Salmon Falls Creek enters another canyon that takes it across the Nevada-Idaho state border, merging with Cottonwood Creek, into Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir which is impounded by the arch concrete Salmon Falls Dam constructed across the creek between 1908‚Äì1910. After passing through the long and narrow lake, the creek cuts into a deep canyon as it enters the Snake River Plain, receiving Cedar Creek and Big Creek near Castleford. The creek empties into the Snake River south of Hagerman. Before irrigation diversions began in the early 20th century, the average flow at the mouth was . Following the construction of Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir and the diversion of many of its tributaries, the flow at its mouth from 2002 to 2005 averaged . The average discharge upstream of the reservoir was . Much of the flow in the last few miles is provided by four major irrigation drains that carry runoff from the extensive agricultural areas surrounding lower Salmon Falls Creek, because all the water released from Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir is diverted shortly below the dam. Work has been done to reduce pollutants flowing into the lower creek from these drains, including excess nitrogen, phosphorus and fecal coliforms. Watershed Spread across approximately with in the state of Idaho, the Salmon Falls Creek basin drains portions of Elko County in Nevada and Owyhee and Twin Falls County in Idaho. Much of the southern portion of the watershed is part of the Basin and Range Province of northern Nevada, while the lower watershed is characterized by the basalt plateau of the Snake River Plain. As a whole, the entire Salmon Falls Creek watershed is very arid. Much of the basin receives less than of rain annually, while the mountainous areas may get up to . Rainfall in the mountains provides most of the perennial flow into Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir, while springs from the Snake River Aquifer also provide some water.Watershed Characterization, p. 8-10 Several major tributary streams provide much of the flow of Salmon Falls Creek as well. The largest tributary is Shoshone Creek, which flows west from the Sawtooth National Forest and enters just upstream of the town of Jackpot. Cottonwood, China, Big, House, Jakes, and Cedar Creeks are some of the other perennial streams in the basin. Since Cedar Creek Reservoir was impounded in 1905, water no longer flows down the creek, whose course is mostly within Idaho. The southern portion of the watershed harbors many springs escaping from the foothills of the mountains, feeding the upper tributary streams.Watershed Characterization, p. 3 The lower Salmon Falls Creek forms part of the boundary between the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer and Western Snake River Plain Aquifer.Watershed Characterization, p. 4 Most of the southern basin lies between the Jarbidge Mountains and Granite Range on the west and the Sawtooth Mountains on the east, with many peaks rising to or more.Watershed Characterization, p. 11 The basin and range topography of northern Nevada and the extensive and flat Snake River Plain characterize the geologically young Salmon Falls Creek basin. The Basin and Range area was created by crustal stretching along an area dense in faults running north to south, with valleys forming along the fault lines. Sediments deposited by streams and lakes in the Pliocene and Miocene filled much of the present-day main stem valley. Lower on the creek, basalt rocks of volcanic origin and thick deposits of loess soil compose the primary surface geology. Beginning about 12 million years ago, the North American Plate slowly passed over a large volcanic hotspot, which formed and caused frequent volcanic activity throughout the Snake River Plain. The hotspot, which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park, deposited massive lava flows throughout the plain. About 14,500 years ago, the Bonneville Flood rushed through the Snake River Plain, carving out and extending many canyons including lower Salmon Falls Creek Canyon. The extent of the floods was so great that most of lower Salmon Falls Creek pooled up into a temporary lake as miles of land were submerged on both sides of the Snake. Wind-blown soil and sediment deposited by the floods have covered most of the basalt, which is still exposed in areas such as Salmon Falls Creek Canyon.Watershed Characterization, p. 19 Pollution from agricultural runoff and overtaxing of water resources is a prevailing issue in the Salmon Falls Creek watershed. With heavy groundwater withdrawal, many of the springs feeding the lower Salmon Falls Creek have decreased in volume. Because the -high Salmon Falls Dam has not released any water (except for that needed for irrigation) since the floods of 1984, the lower creek depends almost entirely on irrigation runoff drainage to sustain its flow. Pollutants in the runoff have, as a result, hurt the vegetation corridor in the lower canyon. Several tributaries flowing from northern Nevada into southern Idaho have been diverted, leaving even less water to replenish the lower creek. History Salmon Falls Creek Canyon in Idaho Salmon Falls Creek is probably named for Salmon Falls, a large cataract and historical Native American fishing spot on the Snake River upstream of their confluence. A short distance further upstream is Shoshone Falls, the natural upriver limit of migrating salmon on the Snake River. The stretch of the Snake River below Shoshone Falls was once known for its huge runs of spawning salmon, which were an important food source for the local Shoshone and Bannock peoples. The construction of many dams in the 20th century have since prevented the salmon from reaching this part of the river. Other names for the creek have included Holmes Creek, Salmon Creek, Salmon Falls River, and the Salmon River. Historically the creek was more of a river, fed by springs in the extensive Snake River Aquifer and snowmelt from the Jarbidge Mountains. The Salmon Falls Creek valley was an important trading route through which the Shoshone Indians in the Snake River Plain and the Paiute in the Great Basin interacted. The first Europeans to see the creek were likely fur trappers from the British Hudson's Bay Company traveling through the area in the early 19th century. In the early 1900s a canal system was built to supply irrigation water to Idaho's Magic Valley and the city of Twin Falls was incorporated in 1905. The first proposal to dam the nearby Salmon Falls Creek for irrigation was in 1909, and surmised that an additional of farm land could thusly be brought into production. The Salmon Falls Dam was completed in 1910Owen, Ruth (1999). Twin Falls Salmon River Land and Water Company, 1908-1911. and raised in 1934. However, the water supply was less than originally expected, and only ended up being developed.Watershed Characterization, p. 32 Biology and fish The Jarbidge Range from the O'Neil Basin of Salmon Falls Creek The Salmon Falls Creek watershed varies widely in terms of different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, the vast majority of the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, long-eared owl, great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon. Mule deer also inhabit areas of the middle and upper Salmon Falls Creek basin. Although the namesake Pacific salmon are no longer present in the creek, many fish inhabit the main stem and its tributaries throughout, but especially in Salmon Falls Creek Reservoir. Many fish are stocked in the reservoir including brown trout, Chinook salmon, kokanee salmon (landlocked sockeye), yellow perch, black crappie, channel catfish, smallmouth bass, and especially abundant is walleye. The Salmon Falls Creek reservoir is said to be one of the most plentiful fisheries in southern Idaho.

Other symptoms include red skin, headache, and dizziness. There is generally a lack of sweating in classic heat stroke while sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke. Onset can be sudden or gradual. Complications may include seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or kidney failure. Heat stroke occurs because of high external temperatures or physical exertion. Risk factors include heat waves, high humidity, certain drugs such as diuretics, beta blockers, or alcohol, heart disease, and skin disorders. Cases not associated with physical exertion typically occur in those at the extremes of age or with long term health problems. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. It is a type of hyperthermia. It is distinct from a fever, where there is a physiological increase in the temperature set point. Preventive measures include drinking sufficient fluids and avoiding excessive heat. Treatment is by rapid physical cooling of the body and supportive care. Recommended methods include spraying the person with water and using a fan, putting the person in ice water, or giving cold intravenous fluids. While it is reasonable to add ice packs around a person, this by itself is not routinely recommended. Heat stroke results in more than 600 deaths a year in the United States. Rates have increased between 1995 and 2015. The risk of death is less than 5% in those with exercise- induced heat stroke and as high as 65% in those with non-exercise induced cases. Signs and symptoms Heat stroke generally presents with a hyperthermia of greater than in combination with disorientation. There is generally a lack of sweating in classic heatstroke, while sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke. Before a heat stroke occurs, people show signs of heat exhaustion such as dizziness, mental confusion, headaches, and weakness; if a heat stroke occurs when the person is asleep, symptoms may be harder to notice. However, in exertional heat stroke, the affected person may sweat excessively. Young children, in particular, may have seizures. Eventually, unconsciousness, organ failure, and death will result. Causes Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature. Substances that inhibit cooling and cause dehydration such as alcohol, stimulants, medications, and age-related physiological changes predispose to so-called \\"classic\\" or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS), most often in elderly and infirm individuals in summer situations with insufficient ventilation. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) can happen in young people without health problems or medications most often in athletes, outdoor laborers, or military personnel engaged in strenuous hot- weather activity or in certified first responders wearing heavy personal protective equipment. In environments that are not only hot but also humid, it is important to recognize that humidity reduces the degree to which the body can cool itself by perspiration and evaporation. For humans and other warm- blooded animals, excessive body temperature can disrupt enzymes regulating biochemical reactions that are essential for cellular respiration and the functioning of major organs. Cars When the outside temperature is , the temperature inside a car parked in direct sunlight can quickly exceed . Young children or elderly adults left alone in a vehicle are at particular risk of succumbing to heat stroke. \\"Heat stroke in children and in the elderly can occur within minutes, even if a car window is opened slightly.\\" As these groups of individuals may not be able to open car doors or to express discomfort verbally (or audibly, inside a closed car), their plight may not be immediately noticed by others in the vicinity. In 2018, 51 children in the United States died in hot cars, more than the previous high of 49 in 2010. Dogs are even more susceptible than humans to heat stroke in cars, as they cannot produce whole-body sweat to cool themselves. Leaving the dog at home with plenty of water on hot days is recommended instead, or, if a dog must be brought along, it can be tied up in the shade outside the destination and provided with a full water bowl. Prevention The risk of heat stroke can be reduced by observing precautions to avoid overheating and dehydration. Light, loose-fitting clothes will allow perspiration to evaporate and cool the body. Wide-brimmed hats in light colors help prevent the sun from warming the head and neck. Vents on a hat will help cool the head, as will sweatbands wetted with cool water. Strenuous exercise should be avoided during hot weather, especially in the sun peak hours as well as avoiding confined spaces (such as automobiles) without air-conditioning or adequate ventilation. In hot weather, people need to drink plenty of cool liquids and mineral salts to replace fluids lost from sweating. Thirst is not a reliable sign that a person needs fluids. A better indicator is the color of urine. A dark yellow color may indicate dehydration. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States publishes a QuickCard with a checklist designed to help protect workers from heat stress: * Know signs/symptoms of heat-related illnesses. * Block out direct sun and other heat sources. * Drink fluids often, and before you are thirsty. * Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes. * Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine. Treatment Treatment of heat stroke involves rapid mechanical cooling along with standard resuscitation measures. The body temperature must be lowered quickly. The person should be moved to a cool area (indoors, or at least in the shade) and clothing removed to promote heat loss (passive cooling). Active cooling methods should also be used, if possible: The person is bathed in cold water, or a hyperthermia vest can be applied. (However, wrapping the person in wet towels or clothes can actually act as insulation and increase the body temperature.) Cold compresses to the torso, head, neck, and groin will help cool the victim. A fan or dehumidifying air-conditioning unit may be used to aid in evaporation of the water (evaporative method). Immersing a person into a tub of cold water (immersion method) is a widely recognized method of cooling. This method may require the effort of several people and the person should be monitored carefully during the treatment process. Immersion should be avoided for an unconscious person, but if there is no alternative, the person's head must be held above water. Immersion in very cold water was once thought to be counterproductive by reducing blood flow to the skin and thereby preventing heat from escaping the body core. However, this hypothesis has been challenged in experimental studies, as well as by systematic reviews of the clinical data, indicating that cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering thermogenesis do not play a dominant role in the decrease in core body temperature brought on by cold water immersion. This can be seen in the effect of submersion hypothermia, where the body temperature decrease is directly related to environmental temperature, and though bodily defenses slow the decrease in temperature for a time, they ultimately fail to maintain endothermic homeostasis. Dantrolene, a direct-acting paralytic which abolishes shuddering and is effective in many other forms of hyperthermia, including centrally-, peripherally- and cellularly-mediated thermogenesis, has no individual or additive effects to cooling in the context of heat stroke, showing a lack of endogenous thermogenic response to cold water immersion. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the gold standard for life- threatening heat stroke. Hydration is important in cooling the person. In mild cases of concomitant dehydration, this can be achieved by drinking water, or commercial isotonic sports drinks may be used as a substitute. In either exercise- or heat-induced dehydration, electrolyte imbalance can result, and can be worsened by excess consumption of water. Hyponatremia can be corrected by intake of hypertonic fluids. Absorption is rapid and complete in most people but if the person is confused, unconscious, or unable to tolerate oral fluid, then an intravenous drip may be necessary for rehydration and electrolyte replacement. The person's condition should be reassessed and stabilized by trained medical personnel. The person's heart rate and breathing should be monitored, and CPR may be necessary if the person goes into cardiac arrest. Prognosis It was long believed that heat strokes lead only rarely to permanent deficits and that convalescence is almost complete. However, following the 1995 Chicago heat wave, researchers from the University of Chicago Medical Center studied all 58 patients with heat stroke severe enough to require intensive care at 12 area hospitals between July 12 and 20, 1995, ranging in age from 25 to 95 years. Nearly half of these patients died within a year 21 percent before and 28 percent after release from the hospital. Many of the survivors had permanent loss of independent function; one-third had severe functional impairment at discharge, and none of them had improved after one year. The study also recognized that because of overcrowded conditions in all the participating hospitals during the crisis, the immediate care which is critical was not as comprehensive as it should have been. In rare cases, brain damage has been reported as a permanent sequela of severe heat stroke, most commonly cerebellar atrophy. Epidemiology In India, hundreds die every year from summer heat waves, including more than 2,500 in the year 2015. Later that same summer, the 2015 Pakistani heat wave caused about 2,000 deaths. Society and culture In Slavic mythology, there is a personification of sunstroke, Poludnitsa (lady midday), a feminine demon clad in white that causes impairment or death to people working in the fields at midday. There was a traditional short break in harvest work at noon, to avoid attack by the demon. Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's symphonic poem, The Noon Witch, was inspired by this tradition. Other animals Heatstroke can affect livestock, especially in hot, humid weather; or if the horse, cow, sheep or other is unfit, overweight, has a dense coat, is overworked, or is left in a horsebox in full sun. Symptoms include drooling, panting, high temperature, sweating, and rapid pulse. The animal should be moved to shade, drenched in cold water and offered water or electrolyte to drink.Horse and Hound, 'First Aid: Handling Heatstroke', 2/8/2004 References  External links  * Heat stroke on MedicineNet.com Category:Deaths from hyperthermia Category:Effects of external causes Category:Medical emergencies Category:wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:RTTEM Category:Thermoregulation ","title":"Heat stroke"},{"id":"24999098","text":"USCS Phoenix was a schooner that served as a survey ship in the United States Coast Survey from 1845 to 1857.

Her first commanding officer, Lieutenant Commanding Carlile P. Patterson (1816‚Äì1881), conducted the first surveys for the Coast Survey in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, including tide and current surveys and hydrographic surveys of Horn Island Passage, parts of Mississippi Sound, and the bar at Mobile, Alabama. Phoenix also performed hydrographic work in 1847, but beginning in 1848 she was used only to transport and house triangulation and topographic parties, a role she performed for the remainder of her career. A tornado struck Phoenix while she rode at anchor in Mississippi Sound on the U.S. Gulf Coast on the night of 31 March 1854, causing her to capsize and sink in 20 seconds. Her crew survived by clinging to her mastheads, which remained above water after she sank in 20 feet (6.1 meters) of water. The crew managed to free one of her boats about an hour after she sank and row to shore safely. She was raised three weeks later, repaired, and returned to service. Her captain, Coast Survey Assistant Julius E. Hilgard, took advantage of the calamity to examine and report on the condition of surveying instruments aboard Phoenix after their three-week immersion in seawater. Phoenix spent the 1855 field season transporting and housing Coast Survey teams who triangulated an approximately 60-mile (97-kilometer) stretch of coast between Pascagoula, Mississippi, and the entrance to Lake Ponchartrain in Louisiana. In 1856, she supported survey parties along the coast of Texas, arriving there with significant storm damage after a rough passage. Phoenix was retired from service in 1857.

It is located some south of the island's capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The basilica is dedicated to the Virgin of Candelaria (Patron of the Canary Islands). Virgen de Candelaria, Patrona de Canarias . Designed by architect Jos√© Enrique Marrero Regalado, it is listed as a Site of cultural interest by the Government of the Canary Islands. The Virgin of Candelaria is a black Madonna.  History  In 1390, Candelaria was a solitary place frequented by guanches herders of the menceyato de G√º√≠mar (pre-Hispanic kingdom). One evening, two natives leading their cattle, saw some goats refusing to come to the mouth of the ravine; they sent forward one of them thinking that there were people who wanted to steal them and they found, on a rock, the statue of the Virgin of Candelaria (later declared principal patron of the Canary Islands). The statue was found in a beach near to Candelaria. It was initially taken to the cave of Chinguaro, which was the palace of the king (mencey) of G√º√≠mar. Later the Guanches moved her to the cave of Achbinico in Candelaria, and from then on it was venerated there. At first the Guanches identified it with their goddess Chaxiraxi (the mother of the gods), but later the Christian conquerors identified it as the statue of the Virgin Mary. Shortly after, a chapel was built. This cave was also used as a cemetery for Christian devotees of the Virgin. In 1596, king Philip III was declared protector of the Virgin of Candelaria. After ascending the throne, the Spanish monarch gave the title of \\"Royal\\" to the sanctuary of the Candelaria. Therefore, it is also the first sanctuary in the Canary Islands to have received that title. Medio siglo de fervor en Candelaria (Historia del Santuario). Interior of the basilica and altar. Later, the present basilica was built over an old church that was destroyed by fire in 1789. However, the actual construction of the temple was postponed several times for various reasons: the economic crisis of 1931 following the proclamation of the Second Republic and later by World War II and the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the bishop of Tenerife, Domingo P√©rez C√°ceres promoted the construction, commissioning the architect Jose Enrique Marrero Regalado. The new sanctuary would be a neo-Canarian eclectic mix of all styles that have occurred in the Canary Islands. Several donations came from all the islands, the basilica would take almost a decade to finish. Finally, on February 1, 1959, the basilica was consecrated in a large religious ceremony. Nowadays Candelaria is the main Catholic centre of pilgrimage in the Canary Islands and one of the main ones in Spain; the basilica receives more than 2.5 million visitors annually.Remodelaci√≥n de la Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias .P√°gina sobre Candelaria del Cabildo de Tenerife. The Basilica of Our Lady of Candelaria can host up to 5,000 people. Among the most significant figures who have visited the basilica include heads of state or government, as well as the most prominent figures of the Church, military, politics, sports, art, etc. Among them are the former kings of Spain, Juan Carlos I de Borb√≥n and Sofia of Greece, who visited while still being princes, and later as kings, in 1977. The church holds the title and dignity of a minor basilica, bestowed upon it by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 January 2011. That title was officially celebrated on 2 February of that year, coinciding with the feast of Candlemas.T√≠tulo y dignidad de Bas√≠lica para la iglesia de la Patrona de Canarias . Currently, this Marian shrine attracts not only pilgrims and devout Catholics, but also followers of other religions. Among the latter are some people from the Hindu community in Tenerife, who donated some robes for the Virgin's statue. Every year in May is celebrated in the Plaza de la Patrona de Canarias, the Festival Intercultural India - Canarias (Intercultural Festival India - Canary Islands), which aims to present the Hindu customs through gastronomy and folklore.

Another feature of the basilica are the mural paintings that are mostly found on the altar. These paintings usually represent angels and other canarian saints who were devotees of the Virgin of Candelaria. On one side of the main altar is the flag of the Vatican City, referring to the close relationship of the sanctuary with the Pope because of its status as a minor basilica. Above the altar is the statue of the Virgin. *The Camar√≠n de la Virgen de Candelaria, a room just behind the altar, is the location of the wooden statue of the Virgin of Candelaria.

It was submitted by Representatives Bart Stupak (Democrat of Michigan) and Joseph R. Pitts (Republican of Pennsylvania). Its stated purpose was to prohibit the use of federal funds \\"to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\\" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.November 7, 2009 Congressional Record-House H12921 It was adopted by the House but not included in the Senate's version, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Many pro-choice representatives said they would oppose AHCAA with the Stupak-Pitts language, and proposed to adopt PPACA. Stupak and several supporters said they would oppose PPACA without the amendment, but withdrew their opposition after President Obama promised an executive order to bar such funding. Pro-life groups criticized this action, saying that the executive order would not be effective. Introduction of the amendment Under the Hyde Amendment, the federal government was prohibited from paying for abortion services. The AHCAA was to provide a \\"public option\\", under which individuals could buy subsidized health insurance from a federal agency, and also to set up health insurance exchanges through which individuals could buy health insurance from private companies, with federal financial assistance. Pro-life groups noted that both the public option and the exchanges allowed federal funds to pay for insurance which could pay for abortions, thus creating a loophole in the Hyde Amendment. The amendment to close this apparent loophole was submitted in late 2009 by Stupak and Pitts. Other prominent supporters of the amendment included Representatives Brad Ellsworth, Marcy Kaptur, Kathy Dahlkemper, Daniel Lipinski and Chris Smith. Its stated purpose was to prohibit the use of federal funds \\"to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion\\" except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother. This was interpreted by some to mean that the costs of abortions not included in the exceptions might therefore not be covered in the public option or in any exchange's private plans that accepted subsidized customers.\\"Health-care reform and abortion coverage: Questions and answers\\", The Washington Post, November 15, 2009 The exceptions are similar to those included in the Hyde Amendment. The amendment also specifically allowed individuals to purchase supplementary insurance that covers other abortions. Opposition NARAL Pro-Choice America criticized the amendment, stating it could mean that people whose health insurance currently covers abortions will lose that service.\\"Abortion: Which Side Is Fabricating?\\", FactCheck, August 25, 2009\\"The Truth About Abortion and Health Reform\\", NARAL Pro-Choice America, August 14, 2009 \\"House: Yes to Extreme Anti-Choice Politics, No to Women‚Äôs Health and Privacy\\", NARAL Pro-Choice America, November 7, 2009 Those who voted against the amendment argued that, because premiums of private individuals would pay for the abortions, they were distinguished from situations covered by the Hyde Amendment.November 7, 2009 Congressional Record ‚ÄîHouse H12922 The American Civil Liberties Union joined the opposition to the amendment, saying it \\"jeopardizes the abortion coverage that millions of women currently have\\".\\"ACLU Joins Crucial Lobby Effort To Protect Women‚Äôs Right To Comprehensive Health Care\\" American Civil Liberties Union, December 2, 2009 According to the Guttmacher Institute, 13% of all abortions in 2001 were directly billed to private insurance companies. Some in the debate used this statistic to argue that relatively few women seemed to use private insurance coverage to pay for abortion services, and therefore that absence of coverage would have minimal impact. The Institute responded that arguments based on the statistic alone misrepresented the situation: it omitted both women who paid for the procedure out of pocket, later seeking reimbursement from their insurance company, and those who had coverage but chose not to use it because they wanted their employer, insurer or primary policyholder (such as their spouse or parent) not to know that they obtained an abortion.\\"Misuse of Guttmacher Statistic on Insurance Coverage of Abortion\\", Guttmacher Institute Media Center, November 11, 2009 An analysis published by policy researchers at the George Washington University Medical School Department of Health Policy concluded that the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment would have the effect of eliminating coverage of medically indicated abortions for all women, not just those receiving subsidies or participating in the exchange. The analysis also said the Amendment's restrictions would hinder the insurance industry's ability to market supplemental coverage for abortions, and impact the current ability of individual states to provide such supplemental coverage to Medicaid recipients. Another issue raised was the possibility of private insurance companies denying coverage for other procedures if a relationship between those procedures and an abortion existed, especially in cases where an abortion was the result of other serious health conditions.Rosenbaum, Sara, et al., \\"An Analysis of the Implications of the Stupak/Pitts Amendment for Coverage of Medically Indicated Abortions\\", The George Washington University Medical Center, School of Public Health & Health Services, Washington, D.C., November 16, 2009 Catholic lay pro-life activist Judie Brown of the American Life League criticized the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment for being insufficiently pro-life. She said without the amendment, AHCAA would not have passed in the House, but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) support for the amended bill \\"gave cover for approximately 40 supposedly pro-life representatives to seemingly support the pro-life cause while also supporting all of the Pelosi bill‚Äôs major components.\\" Brown said the bill as passed contained \\"anti-life\\" \\"provisions for abortion, contraception, medical 'care' that allows euthanasia, promiscuity-promoting sex education, 'family planning services' provided by organizations such as Planned Parenthood, contradictory and inconsistent language regarding conscience protection and other loopholes.\\" She added, \\"USCCB made it possible for Catholic Democrats in the House to pay lip service to Church teaching on abortion while voting for a bill that violates Church teachings in several ways, including abortion.\\"Brown, Judie, \\"Don‚Äôt Be A Faceless Bureaucrat‚ÄîSay No To Stupak!\\", American Life League, November 16, 2009 Congressional action House action The House approved the Stupak‚ÄìPitts amendment on November 7, 2009, by a vote of 240‚Äì194. Stupak, the lead sponsor, had stated in late September that he wanted a full vote on the House floor on the amendment. After the amendment was adopted, Stupak voted in favor of the amended bill. Even though the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment was part of AHCAA as enacted by the House, its fate remained uncertain in early 2010. In mid-November 2009 it was reported that 40 House Democrats had said they would not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions.

Hillary Clinton served as the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama, from 2009 to 2013, overseeing the department that conducted the foreign policy of Barack Obama. She was preceded in office by Condoleezza Rice, and succeeded by John Kerry. She is also the only former First Lady of the United States to become a member of the United States Cabinet. Nomination and confirmation Within a week after the November 4, 2008, presidential election, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as U.S. Secretary of State in his administration. Clinton initially turned Obama down, but he persisted. When the possibility became public on November 14, it came as a surprising and dramatic move, especially given the long, sometimes bitter battle the two had waged during the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Obama had specifically criticized Clinton's foreign policy credentials during the contests, and the initial idea of him appointing her had been so unexpected that she had told one of her own aides, \\"Not in a million years.\\" However, Obama had been thinking of the idea as far back as the 2008 Democratic National Convention.Wolffe, Renegade, p. 313. Despite the aggressiveness of the campaign and the still-lingering animosities between the two campaign staffs, as with many primary battles, the political differences between the candidates were never that great,Libert and Faulk, Barack, Inc., pp. 133‚Äì134. the two rivals had reportedly developed a respect for one another, and she had campaigned for him in the general election. Consideration of Clinton was seen as Obama wanting to assemble a \\"team of rivals\\" in his administration, as had Abraham Lincoln. Clinton was conflicted whether she wanted to take the position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision. While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered. The prospect of her ever becoming Senate Majority Leader seemed dim.Wolffe, Renegade, p. 314. A different complication was her husband's role. She told Obama: \\"it will be a circus if I take this job\\", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries. In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of Bill Clinton's post- presidential activities would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members. There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations. Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, \\"But, you know, we kept talking. I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So at the end of the day, when your president asks you to serve, you say yes, if you can.\\" Clinton said she was reluctant to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a \\"difficult and exciting adventure\\". As part of the nomination, Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the Clinton Presidential Center and Clinton Global Initiative. The appointment required a Saxbe fix, which was passed and signed into law in December 2008 before confirmation hearings began. Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, a week before the Obama inauguration. Clinton stated during her confirmation hearings that she believed that \\"the best way to advance America's interests in reducing global threats and seizing global opportunities is to design and implement global solutions\\" and \\"We must use what has been called 'smart power', the full range of tools at our disposal‚Äîdiplomatic, economic, military, political, legal and cultural‚Äîpicking the right tool or combination of tools for each situation. With smart power, diplomacy will be the vanguard of our foreign policy.\\" On January 15, the Committee voted 16‚Äì1 to approve Clinton. Republican Senator David Vitter of Louisiana was the lone dissenting vote in the committee. By this time, Clinton's public favorable/unfavorable rating had reached 65 percent, the highest point in her public career since the Lewinsky scandal during her time as First Lady, and 71 percent of the public approved of the nomination to the cabinet. Even before taking office, Clinton was working together with Bush administration officials in assessing national security issues. The night before the inauguration of the new president, contingency plans against a purported plot by Somali extremists against Obama and the inauguration was being discussed. Clinton argued that typical security responses were not tenable: \\"Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address? I don't think so.\\" (The threat turned out to not exist.) On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94‚Äì2. Vitter and Republican Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina voted against the confirmation. Clinton took the oath of office of Secretary of State that same day. Just before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her Senate seat effective just hours before her oath as Secretary of State. She became the first former First Lady to serve in the United States Cabinet. She also became the first Secretary of State to have previously been an elected official since Edmund Muskie's less-than-a-year stint in 1980, with Christian Herter during the Eisenhower administration being the last one before that. In being selected by her formal rival Obama, she became only the fourth person in the preceding hundred years to join the cabinet of someone they had run against for their party's presidential nomination that election year (Jack Kemp ran against and was later chosen by George H. W. Bush to be Secretary of HUD in 1988, George W. Romney by Richard Nixon for Secretary of HUD in 1968, and Philander Knox by William Howard Taft for Secretary of State in 1908 preceded her; Obama's pick of Tom Vilsack for Secretary of Agriculture followed her a couple of weeks later to be the next such person). (On January 29, 2009, the constitutionality of her Saxbe fix was challenged in court by Judicial Watch; on October 30, 2009, the courts dismissed the case.) Staff During the presidential transition, Clinton's former campaign manager, Maggie Williams, handled the staff hiring process. Longtime counsel to both Clintons Cheryl Mills served as the secretary's Counselor and Chief of Staff. James B. Steinberg was named Deputy Secretary of State. Jacob \\"Jack\\" Lew, once Bill Clinton's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, was named Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, a new position. This was an unusual step intended by Hillary Clinton to push to the forefront the emphasis on getting higher budget allocations from Congress and overlooking internal workings. Anne-Marie Slaughter was appointed Director of Policy Planning with a view towards long-term policy towards Asia. Huma Abedin, Clinton's longtime personal assistant, was Deputy Chief of Staff for the secretary and remained a key member of Clinton's operation. Much like she did at the beginning of her Senate career, Clinton kept a low profile during her early months and worked hard to familiarize herself with the culture and institutional history of the department. She met or spoke with all of the living former secretaries, and especially relied upon her close friendship with Madeleine Albright. At the start of her tenure, Obama and Clinton announced several high-profile special envoys to trouble spots in the world, including former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell as Mideast envoy and Richard Holbrooke as envoy to South Asia and Afghanistan. Clinton appointed Todd Stern as the department's Special Envoy for Climate Change. By May 2009, Clinton and the Obama administration intended to nominate Paul Farmer as administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), but by August his nomination was dead. This caused Clinton to publicly criticize the long vetting process for administration appointments/ In November, an unconventional choice was nominated instead, Rajiv Shah, a young Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics. Clinton said, \\"He has a record of delivering results in both the private and public sectors, forging partnerships around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, and developing innovative solutions in global health, agriculture, and financial services for the poor.\\" Despite some early press predictions, in general Clinton's departmental staff has avoided the kind of leaks and infighting that troubled her 2008 presidential campaign. One possibly lingering line of internal tension was resolved in early 2011 when State Department spokesperson P. J. Crowley resigned after making personal comments about in-captivity leaker Chelsea Manning and her treatment by the Department of Defense. In other changes, Jacob Lew left in late 2010 to join the White House as Office of Management and Budget and was replaced as Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources by Thomas R. Nides (Lew would eventually become White House Chief of Staff and then the pick for U.S. Treasury Secretary for Obama's second term), and Steinberg left in mid-2011 and was replaced as Deputy Secretary by career diplomat William J. Burns. Early themes and structural initiatives During the transition period, Clinton sought to build a more powerful State Department. She began a push for a larger international affairs budget and an expanded role in global economic issues. She cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the U.S. Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates agreed with her, and also advocated larger State Department budgets. Indeed, the two, and their respective departments, would have a productive relationship, unlike the often fraught relations between State and Defense and their secretaries seen in prior administrations. In the Obama administration's proposed 2010 United States federal budget of February 2009, there was a proposed 9.5 percent budget increase for the State Department and other international programs, from $47.2 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $51.7 billion in fiscal year 2010. By the time of Clinton's May 2009 testimony before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, numbers had been restated following rounds of general federal budget cuts, and the proposed fiscal year 2010 budget request for the State Department and USAID was $48.6 billion, a 7 percent increase. That became the amount of increase that was obtained.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, p. 52. Clinton also brought a message of departmental reform to the position, especially in regarding foreign aid programs as something that deserves the same status and level of scrutiny as diplomatic initiatives. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives at the State Department on her first day greeted by a standing room only crowd of Department employees. Clinton spent her initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders. She said the world was eager to see a new American foreign policy and that, \\"There is a great exhalation of breath going on around the world. We've got a lot of damage to repair.\\" She did indicate that not every past policy would be repudiated, and specifically said it was essential that the six-party talks over the North Korean nuclear weapons program continue. Clinton re-emphasized her views during her first speech to State Department employees when she said, \\"There are three legs to the stool of American foreign policy: defense, diplomacy, and development. And we are responsible for two of the three legs. And we will make clear, as we go forward, that diplomacy and development are essential tools in achieving the long-term objectives of the United States. And I will do all that I can, working with you, to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future.\\" Clinton also soon visited the United States Agency for International Development, where she met employees and said they would be getting extra funds and attention during the new administration. She kept a low profile when diplomatic necessity or Obama's involvement required it, but maintained an influential relationship with the president and in foreign policy decisions. Her first 100 days found her travelling over , having no trouble adapting to being a team player subordinate to Obama, and gaining skills as an executive. Nevertheless, she remained an international celebrity with a much higher profile than most Secretaries of State. Her background as an elected official gave her insight into the needs and fears of elected officials of other countries. By the summer of 2009, there was considerable analysis and speculation in the media of what kind of role and level of influence Clinton had within the Obama administration, with a variety of assessments being produced. A prominent mid-July speech to the Council on Foreign Relations reasserted her role; she said, \\"We cannot be afraid or unwilling to engage. Our focus on diplomacy and development is not an alternative to our national security arsenal.\\" In July 2009, Clinton announced a new State Department initiative, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, to establish specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad. The most ambitious of Clinton's departmental reforms, it is modeled after the Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense Review, which Clinton was familiar with from her days on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first such Review came out in December 2010. Entitled Leading Through Civilian Power, its 220 pages centered on the notion of elevating \\"civilian power\\" as a cost- effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises. It also sought the elevation of U.S. ambassadors in coordinating work of all abroad-tasked U.S. agencies. Clinton said of the underlying message, \\"Leading with civilians saves lives and money.\\" She also resolved to get Congress to approve the QDDR as a required part of the State Department planning process, saying, \\"I am determined that this report will not merely gather dust, like so many others.\\" Another theme of the report was the goal of empowering the female population in developing countries around the world; the QDDR mentioned women and girls some 133 times. In part this reflected incorporation into the QDDR of the Hillary Doctrine, which stipulates that women's rights and violence against women around the world should be considered issues of national security to the United States.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 4, 53. In addition, by attempting to institutionalize her goals in this area, Clinton ‚Äì along with Anne-Marie Slaughter and Melanne Verveer, who also worked heavily in these efforts ‚Äì were hoping that her initiatives and concerns towards the empowerment of women would persist past Clinton's time in office as well as break a past pattern of chauvinism in the department. In September, Clinton unveiled the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative at the annual meeting of her husband's Clinton Global Initiative. The goal of the new initiative is to battle hunger worldwide on a strategic basis as a key part of U.S. foreign policy, rather than just react to food shortage emergencies as they occur. The secretary said that \\"Food security is not just about food. But it is all about security: economic security, environmental security, even national security. Massive hunger poses a threat to the stability of governments, societies and borders.\\" The initiative seeks to develop agricultural economies, counter malnourishment, increase productivity, expand trade, and spur innovation in developing nations. Clinton said that women would be placed at the center of the effort, as they constitute a majority of the world's farmers. The next month, to mark World Food Day, Clinton said, \\"Fighting hunger and poverty through sustainable agricultural development, making sure that enough food is available and that people have the resources to purchase it, is a key foreign policy objective of the Obama administration.\\" During October 2009, Clinton said, \\"this is a great job. It is a 24/7 job\\" and \\"this job is incredibly all-encompassing.\\" She said she never thought about if she were making the same foreign policy decisions as president, and had no intention of ever running for that office again. While some friends and former advisers thought she was primarily saying that to focus attention on her current role and that she might change her mind about running for president in the future, others felt that she was genuinely content with the direction her career and life had taken and no longer had presidential ambitions.Kornblut, Notes from the Cracked Ceiling, pp. 253‚Äì254. By the close of 2009 there were 25 female ambassadors posted by other nations to Washington; this was the highest number ever. This was dubbed the \\"Hillary effect\\" by some observers: \\"Hillary Clinton is so visible\\" as secretary of state, said Amelia Matos Sumbana, the Mozambique Ambassador to the United States, \\"she makes it easier for presidents to pick a woman for Washington.\\" An added fact, of course, was that two other recent U.S. Secretaries of State were women, but Clinton's international fame from her days as First Lady of the United States made her impact in this respect the greatest of the group. Clinton also included in the State Department budget for the first time a breakdown of programs that specifically concerned themselves with the well- being of women and girls around the world. By fiscal 2012, the department's budget request for such work was $1.2 billion, of which $832 million was for global health programs. Additionally, she initiated the Women in Public Service Project, a joint venture between the State Department and the Seven Sisters colleges. The goal was to entice more women into entering public service, such that within four decades an equal number of men and women would be working in the field. One specific cause Clinton advocated almost from the start of her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women. In September 2010, she announced a partnership with the United Nations Foundation to provide some 100 million such stoves around the world within the next ten years, and in subsequent travels she urged foreign leaders to adopt policies encouraging their use. In February 2010 testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, Secretary Clinton complained about the slow pace of Senate confirmations of Obama's nominations to diplomatic positions, a number of which were delayed for political reasons and had been subject to holds by individual Republican senators. Clinton said the problem damaged America's image abroad: \\"It became harder and harder to explain to countries, particularly countries of significance, why we had nobody in position for them to interact with.\\" In 2009, and again in 2010 and 2011, Clinton stated that she was committed to serving out her full term as secretary, but would not commit to serving a second term should Obama be re-elected. She later used U.S. allies and what she called \\"convening power\\" to help keep the Libyan rebels unified as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. Throughout her tenure, Clinton has looked towards \\"smart power\\" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values, combining military strength with U.S. capacities in global economics, development aid, and technology. In late 2011 she said, \\"All power has limits. In a much more networked and multipolar world we can't wave a magic wand and say to China or Brazil or India, 'Quit growing. Quit using your economies to assert power' ... It's up to us to figure out how we position ourselves to be as effective as possible at different times in the face of different threats and opportunities.\\" Clinton has also greatly expanded the State Department's use of social media, including Facebook and Twitter, both to get its message out and to help empower people vis √† via their rulers. Clinton said, \\"We are in the age of participation, and the challenge ... is to figure out how to be responsive, to help catalyze, unleash, channel the kind of participatory eagerness that is there.\\" She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter Chelsea Clinton to refer to the secretary as \\"TechnoMom\\". Regional issues and travels: 2009 21st NATO summit in April 2009 In February 2009, Clinton made her first trip as secretary to Asia, visiting Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and China on what she described as a \\"listening tour\\" that was \\"intended to really find a path forward.\\" She continued to travel heavily in her first months in office, often getting very enthusiastic responses by engaging with the local populace. In early March 2009, Clinton made her first trip as secretary to Israel. During this time, Clinton announced that the US government will dispatch two officials to the Syrian capital to explore Washington's relationship with Damascus. On March 5, Clinton attended the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels. At this meeting, Clinton proposed including Iran at a conference on Afghanistan. Clinton said the proposed conference could be held on March 31 in the Netherlands. On March 6, a photo-op with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov intended to demonstrate the U.S. and Russia pressing the \\"reset button\\" on their relationship, in an effort to mend frayed ties, went a bit awry due to a mistranslation. (The word the Americans chose, \\"peregruzka\\", meant \\"overloaded\\" or \\"overcharged\\", rather than \\"reset\\".) The episode became known as the Russian reset. More relevant to March 6th, 2009 is a visit Clinton made to Geneva Switzerland. UBS Group AG is a Swiss multinational investment bank. The day after settling its criminal case on 19 February 2009, the U.S. government filed a civil suit against UBS to reveal the names of all 52,000 American customers, alleging that the bank and these customers conspired to defraud the IRS and federal government of legitimately owed tax revenue. Shortly thereafter, Hillary Clinton, having been sworn in as Secretary of State in January, traveled to Geneva on March, 6 2009 to meet with the Swiss Foreign Minister to announce a settlement of the IRS suit. Within a few months, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice had arranged a tentative settlement in which the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) would reveal information on 4,450 of the 52,000 accounts sought by the IRS, preserving the anonymity of more than 90 percent of the United States customers of UBS's cross-border business. On 12 August 2009, UBS announced a settlement deal that ended its litigation with the IRS. U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), who conducted Senate hearings into the UBS tax evasion scandal, described the settlement agreement (known as the \\"Annex\\") \\"disappointing.\\" > [T]he tortured wording and the many limitations in this Annex shows the > Swiss Government trying to preserve as much bank secrecy as it can for the > future, while pushing to conceal the names of tens of thousands of suspected > U.S. tax cheats. It is disappointing that the U.S. government went along. However, this settlement set up a showdown between the U.S. and Swiss governments over the secrecy of Swiss bank accounts. It was not until June 2010 that Swiss lawmakers approved a deal to reveal client data and account details of U.S. clients who were suspected of tax evasion. During March 2009, Clinton prevailed over Vice President Joe Biden on an internal debate to send an additional 20,000 troops to Afghanistan. In June 2009, Clinton had surgery to repair a right elbow fracture caused by a fall in the State Department basement. The painful injury and recuperation caused her to miss two foreign trips. Nevertheless, during President Obama's trip without her to Russia, Clinton was named as co-coordinator, along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, of a newly created U.S.-Russian Presidential Commission to discuss nuclear, economic, and energy and environmental policies relating to the two countries. Clinton returned to the diplomatic scene and responded to the ongoing 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, in which plans for the Honduran fourth ballot box referendum had led to the 2009 Honduran coup d'√©tat, and which was becoming Latin America's worst political crisis in some years. In early July, she sat down with ousted President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya, who agreed on a U.S.-backed proposal to begin talks with the de facto Roberto Micheletti government. Later, in September, Zelaya returned to the country, and President of Costa Rica √ìscar Arias, who had become a mediator in the matter, as well as Clinton expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government. In particular, Clinton said, \\"Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances ‚Äì get on with the election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order.\\" At the end of October, Clinton took a leading role in convincing Micheletti to accept a deal ‚Äì which she termed an \\"historic agreement\\" ‚Äì in which Zelaya would return to power in advance of general elections in which neither figure was running. Micheletti said that Clinton had been insistent on this point: \\"I kept trying to explain our position to her, but all she kept saying was, 'Restitution, restitution, restitution.'\\" That agreement broke down, despite efforts of the State Department to revive it, and Clinton and the U.S. ended up supporting the winner of the 2009 Honduran general election, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, with Clinton characterizing the elections as \\"free and fair\\" and Lobo as holding a strong commitment to democracy and the rule of constitutional law. Clinton meets with President Hugo Ch√°vez at the Summit of the Americas on April 19, 2009 Clinton co-chaired the high-level U.S.‚ÄìChina Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington, D.C. on July 27‚Äì28, 2009 and led the Strategic Track for the United States. In August 2009, Clinton embarked on her longest trip yet, to a number of stops in Africa. On August 10, 2009, at a public event in Kinshasa, a Congolese student asked her what her husband, \\"Mr Clinton\\", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, \\"Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband.\\" The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what \\"Mr Obama\\" thought. In October 2009, Clinton's intervention ‚Äì including juggling conversations on two mobile phones while sitting in a limousine ‚Äì overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an historic Turkish‚ÄìArmenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations. Clinton with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani during an October 2009 visit to Islamabad. In late October 2009, Clinton travelled to Pakistan, where she had staged a memorable visit in 1995 while First Lady. Her arrival was followed within hours by the 28 October 2009 Peshawar bombing; in response, Clinton said of those responsible, \\"They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is.\\" In addition to meeting with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani, she also staged numerous public appearances. In those, she let students, talk show hosts, and tribal elders repeatedly complain about and criticize American foreign policy and American actions. Occasionally, she pushed back in a more blunt fashion than usual for diplomats, explicitly wondering why Pakistan had not been more successful in combating al Qaeda \\"if they wanted to.\\" Member of Parliament and government spokesperson Farahnaz Ispahani said, \\"In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home. Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile or not, has made a big impression ‚Äì and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it means so much more.\\" On the same trip, Clinton visited the Middle East, in an effort to restart the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. In November 2009, Secretary Clinton led the U.S. delegation at the 20th anniversary celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall. There, she said: \\"Our history did not end the night the wall came down, it began anew. ... To expand freedom to more people, we cannot accept that freedom does not belong to all people. We cannot allow oppression defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of ideology.\\" In December 2009, Clinton attended the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference, where she pushed forward a last-minute proposal of significant new amounts of foreign aid to help developing countries deal with the effects of global warming, in an attempt to unstick stuck negotiations and salvage some sort of agreement at the conference. The secretary said, \\"We're running out of time. Without the accord, the opportunity to mobilize significant resources to assist developing countries with mitigation and adaptation will be lost.\\" The amount of aid she proposed, $100 billion, was in the modest terms of the Copenhagen Accord that was agreed to by the summit. Secretary Clinton finished the year with very high approval ratings. She also narrowly edged out former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in being America's most- admired woman, per a Gallup finding. Regional issues and travels: 2010 Secretary Clinton met with Celso Amorim, Foreign Minister of Brazil, in March 2010 at the Pal√°cio do Itamaraty in Bras√≠lia In January 2010, Secretary Clinton cut short a trip to the Asia-Pacific region in order to see firsthand the destructive effects of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and to meet with President of Haiti Ren√© Pr√©val. Clinton said she would also evaluate the relief effort and help evacuate some Americans. She stressed that her visit was designed not to interfere with ongoing efforts: \\"It's a race against time. Everybody is pushing as hard as they can.\\" The Clintons had a special interest in Haiti going back decades, from their delayed honeymoon there up to Bill Clinton being the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti at the time of the earthquake. In a major speech on January 21, 2010, Clinton, speaking on behalf of the U.S., declared that \\"We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas\\", while highlighting how \\"even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable.\\" She also drew analogies between the Iron Curtain and the free and unfree Internet. Her speech, which followed a controversy surrounding Google's changed policy toward China and censorship, appears to mark a split between authoritarian capitalism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access. Chinese officials responded strongly, saying Clinton's remarks were \\"harmful to Sino-American relations\\" and demanded that U.S. officials \\"respect the truth\\", and some foreign policy observers thought that Clinton had been too provocative. But the White House stood behind Clinton, and demanded that China provide better answers regarding the recent Chinese cyberattack against Google. Clinton's speech garnered marked attention among diplomats, as it was the first time a senior American official had clearly put forth a vision in which the Internet was a key element of American foreign policy. By early 2010, the Obama administration's efforts towards forging a new relationship with Iran had failed to gain headway, and the U.S. adopted a policy of adopting international sanctions against it and isolating it diplomatically in order to curtail that country's nuclear program. This was a policy more in line with Clinton's thinking and went back to disagreements she and Obama had had during the 2008 presidential campaign. Clinton was put in charge of rallying support in the United Nations for these sanctions and spent considerable time over the following months and years doing so. At times Clinton suggested the possibility of military action against Iran should economic and diplomatic actions fail to deter it from its nuclear ambitions. In February 2010, Clinton made her first visit to Latin America as secretary. The tour would take her to Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Costa Rica and Guatemala and Argentina. She first visited Buenos Aires and talked to Argentine President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. They discussed Falkland Islands sovereignty and the issue of oil in the Falklands. Clinton said that \\"We would like to see Argentina and the United Kingdom sit down and resolve the issues between them across the table in a peaceful, productive way.\\" Clinton offered to help facilitate such discussions, but did not agree to an Argentinian request that she mediate such talks. Within 12 hours of Clinton's remarks, Downing Street categorically rejected a U.S. role: \\"We welcome the support of the secretary of state in terms of ensuring that we continue to keep diplomatic channels open but there is no need for [direct involvement].\\" Clinton then went on to Santiago, Chile to witness the aftereffects of the 2010 Chile earthquake and to bring some telecommunications equipment to aid in the rescue and recovery efforts. In April 2010, there was a flurry of speculation that Clinton would be nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by Justice John Paul Stevens' retirement, including a plug from ranking Senate Judiciary Committee member Orrin Hatch. The notion was quickly quashed by the White House, which said, \\"The president thinks Secretary Clinton is doing an excellent job as secretary of state and wants her to remain in that position.\\" A State Department spokesperson said that Clinton \\"loves her present job and is not looking for another one.\\" By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama had clearly forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor her husband would upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice with George W. Bush, James Baker with George H. W. Bush, or Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions. During an early June 2010 visit to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, Clinton dealt with questions at every stop about the recently passed and widely controversial Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law, which had damaged the image of the U.S. in Latin America. When answering a question from local television reporters in Quito about it, she said that President Obama was opposed to it and that \\"The Justice Department, under his direction, will be bringing a lawsuit against the act.\\" This was the first public confirmation that the Justice Department would act against the law; a month later, it became official as the lawsuit United States of America v. Arizona. While at a hotel bar in Lima, she completed an agreement with a representative of China over which companies could be specified in a UN resolution sanctioning the nuclear program of Iran. Returning to SB 1070, in August 2010 she included the dispute over it in a report to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as an example to other countries of how fractious issues can be resolved under the rule of law. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates tour the DMZ on July 21, 2010. In July 2010, Clinton visited Pakistan for the second time as secretary, announcing a large new U.S. economic assistance package to that country as well as a U.S.-led bilateral trade agreement between Pakistan and Afghanistan. She then traveled to Afghanistan for the Kabul Conference on the situation there, during which President Hamid Karzai vowed to implement much- promised legal, political, and economic reforms in exchange for a continued Western commitment there. Clinton said that despite the scheduled U.S. drawdown there in 2011, the U.S. has \\"no intention of abandoning our long-term mission of achieving a stable, secure, peaceful Afghanistan. Too many nations ‚Äì especially Afghanistan ‚Äì have suffered too many losses to see this country slide backward.\\" She then went on to Seoul and the Korean Demilitarized Zone where she and Defense Secretary Robert Gates met with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan and Minister of National Defense Kim Tae-young in a '2+2 meeting' to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There she said that the U.S. experience in staying in Korea for decades had led to a successful result, which might also be applicable to Afghanistan. Finally, she went to Hanoi, Vietnam, for the ASEAN Regional Forum, wrapping up what The New York Times termed \\"a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present\\". There she injected the U.S. into the long-running disputes over the sovereignty of the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands, much to the displeasure of the Chinese who view the South China Sea as part of their core interests, by saying \\"The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea.\\" By this time, Secretary Clinton was quite busy with another role of a kind, \\"M.O.T.B.\\" as she wrote in State Department memos, making reference to her being the mother of the bride in daughter Chelsea Clinton's July 31, 2010, wedding to Marc Mezvinsky. She confessed in an interview in Islamabad less than two weeks before the wedding that she and her husband were both nervous wrecks, and that \\"You should assume that if he makes it down the aisle in one piece it's going to be a major accomplishment. He is going to be so emotional, as am I.\\" The event itself gained a large amount of media attention. In a September 2010 speech before the Council on Foreign Relations, Clinton emphasized the continuing primacy of American power and involvement in the world, declaring a \\"new American moment\\". Making reference to actions from reviving the Middle East talks to U.S. aid following the 2010 Pakistan floods, Clinton said that \\"The world is counting on us\\" and that \\"After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century.\\" With Democrats facing possible large losses in the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led to the notion that Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled and shook her head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was \\"completely unfounded\\" and that \\"they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are.\\" (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) Department of State building with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and U.S. Special Envoy George J. Mitchell, at the start of direct talks on September 2, 2010 Over the summer of 2010, the stalled Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process was potentially revived when the various parties involved agreed to direct talks for the first time in a while. While President Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, Secretary Clinton had gone through months of cajoling just to get the parties to the table, and helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. She then assumed a prominent role in the talks; Speaking at a September 2 meeting at the State Department between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, she acknowledged that, \\"We've been here before, and we know how difficult the road ahead will be.\\" Her role in the ongoing talks would be to take over from U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George J. Mitchell when discussions threatened to break down. The talks were generally given little chance to succeed, and Clinton faced the history of many such past failures, including the near miss of her husband at the 2000 Camp David Summit. Nevertheless, her prominent role in them thrust her further into the international spotlight and had the potential to affect her legacy as secretary. In October, Clinton embarked on a seven-nation tour of Asia and Oceania. In New Zealand she signed the \\"Wellington Declaration\\", which normalized the diplomatic and military relationship between it and the United States. The signing marked twenty-five years after the United States suspended ANZUS treaty obligations with New Zealand in the wake of the USS Buchanan incident. Clinton maintained her high approval ratings during 2010. An aggregation of polls taken during the late portion or all of 2010 showed that Clinton (and her husband as well) had by far the best favorable-unfavorable ratings of any key contemporary American political figure. In late November, WikiLeaks released confidential State Department cables, selections of which were then published by several major newspapers around the world. The leak of the cables led to a crisis atmosphere in the State Department, as blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats became public. Clinton led the damage control effort for the U.S. abroad, and also sought to bolster the morale of shocked Foreign Service officers. In the days leading up to the publication of the cables, Clinton called officials in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada, and China to alert them to the pending disclosures. She did note that some foreign leaders were accepting of the frank language of the cables, with one telling her, \\"Don't worry about it. You should see what we say about you.\\" She harshly criticized WikiLeaks, saying: \\"Let's be clear: This disclosure is not just an attack on America's foreign policy interests. It is an attack on the international community ‚Äì the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity.\\" The State Department went into immediate \\"war room\\" mode in order to deal with the effects of the disclosures, and began implementing measures to try to prevent another such leak from happening in the future. A few of the cables released by WikiLeaks concerned Clinton directly: they revealed that directions to members of the foreign service had gone out in 2009 under Clinton's name to gather biometric details on foreign diplomats, including officials of the United Nations and U.S. allies. These included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flier account numbers, work schedules, and other targeted biographical information in a process known as the National Humint Collection Directive. State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said that Clinton had not drafted the directive and that the Secretary of State's name is systematically attached to the bottom of cables originating from Washington; it was unclear whether Clinton had actually seen them. The guidance in the cables was actually written by the CIA before being sent out under Clinton's name, as the CIA cannot directly instruct State Department personnel. The disclosed cables on the more aggressive intelligence gathering went back to 2008 when they went out under Condoleezza Rice's name during her tenure as Secretary of State. The practice of the U.S. and the State Department gathering intelligence on the U.N. or on friendly nations was not new, but the surprise in this case was that it was done by other diplomats rather than intelligence agencies, and that the specific types of information being asked for went beyond past practice and was not the kind of information diplomats would normally be expected to gather. In any case, the instructions given in these cables may have been largely ignored by American diplomats as ill-advised. Responding to calls from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and a few others that Clinton possibly step down from her post due to the revelation, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said, \\"I think that is absurd and ridiculous. I think Secretary of State Clinton is doing a wonderful job.\\" At this early December 2010 summit in Kazakhstan, Clinton dealt with the fallout from the United States diplomatic cables leak. On December 1, Clinton flew to a summit of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Astana, Kazakhstan. There she would encounter some fifty leaders who were subjects of embarrassing comments in the leaks, including President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. A Kazakh official said that during such encounters, Clinton \\"kept her face. She didn't run away from difficult questions.\\" During the encounters she emphasized that the leaked cables did not reflect official U.S. policy but rather were just instances of individual diplomats giving unfiltered feedback to Washington about what they saw happening in other countries. The situation led to some leaders turning her strong remarks about Internet freedom earlier in the year back against her. The OSCE summit also featured a meeting between Secretary Clinton and Ban Ki- moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations. In an attempt to repair the strain caused by the Humint spying relevations, Clinton expressed regret to Ban for the disclosures, but did not make an apology per se. A U.N. statement relayed that Ban thanked Clinton \\"for clarifying the matter and for expressing her concern about the difficulties created.\\" Upon the December 13 death of veteran U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke (who had initially fallen ill during a meeting with her), Clinton presided over a spontaneous gathering of some forty senior State Department personnel and Holbrooke aides at George Washington University Hospital, reminiscing about him. At a memorial service for him days later, both Clinton and her husband praised Holbrooke's work, and she said, \\"Everything that we have accomplished that is working in Afghanistan and Pakistan is largely because of Richard.\\" As it happened, however, Holbrooke had developed poor relations with the White House during his time as Afghanistan envoy, and Clinton's vision of him forging an agreement in that country that modeled the success of his prior Dayton Accords (that resolved the Bosnian War) were unrealized. On December 22, 2010, Secretary Clinton returned to the floor of the Senate during the lame-duck session of the 111th Congress to witness the ratification, by a 71‚Äì26 margin, of the New START treaty. Clinton had spent the several days beforehand repeatedly calling wavering senators and seeking to gain their support. As the year closed, Clinton was again named by Americans in Gallup's most admired man and woman poll as the woman around the world they most admired; it was her ninth win in a row and fifteenth overall. Regional issues and travels: 2011 Clinton and President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff at the inauguration of Dilma Rousseff, January 1, 2011 Secretary Clinton began the year 2011 abroad, attending the inauguration of Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, having been sent by President Obama to represent the U.S. \\"Posse de Dilma tem 14 chefes de Estado e governo confirmados\\". Terra. December 17, 2010. Retrieved December 22, 2010. AFP. \\"Hillary confirma presen√ßa na posse de Dilma\\". Google News. December 21, 2010. Retrieved December 22, 2010. Rousseff was the first woman to serve as that country's head of state. While there, she ran into Venezuelan ruler and U.S. antagonist Hugo Ch√°vez, but the two had a pleasant exchange; Ch√°vez said \\"She had a very spontaneous smile and I greeted her with the same effusiveness.\\" Secretary Clinton conversing with United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan prior to a Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Doha in January 2011. In mid-January, Clinton made a four-country trip to the Middle East, visiting Yemen, Oman, The United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Speaking at a conference in Doha, she criticized Arab governments' failure to move more rapidly vis √† vis reform in unusually blunt language, saying, \\"In too many places, in too many ways, the region's foundations are sinking into the sand. The new and dynamic Middle East that I have seen needs firmer ground if it is to take root and grow everywhere.\\" Her visit to Yemen, the first such visit by a Secretary of State in 20 years, found her focusing on the dangers of terrorism emanating from that country. An impromptu tour around the walled old city of Sana'a found Clinton being cheered by onlooking schoolchildren. A trip and fall while boarding the departing airplane left Clinton unhurt but news services making predictable witticisms. When the 2011 Egyptian protests began, Clinton was in the forefront of the administration's response. Her initial public assessment on January 25 that the government of President Hosni Mubarak was \\"stable\\" and \\"looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people\\" soon came under criticism for being tepid and behind the curve of developing events, although others agreed that the U.S. could not be out front in undermining the government of a long-term ally. By the next day, Clinton was criticizing the Egyptian government's blocking of social media sites. By January 29, Obama had put Clinton in charge of sorting out the administration's so-far confused response to developments. During the frenetic day of January 30, she combined appearances on all five Sunday morning talk shows ‚Äì where she stated publicly for the first time the U.S.'s view that there needed to be an \\"orderly transition\\" to a \\"democratic participatory government\\" and a \\"peaceful transition to real democracy\\", not Mubarak's \\"faux democracy\\" ‚Äì with a flight to Haiti and back to mark the anniversary of its terrible earthquake, all the while engaging in conference calls again regarding Egypt. The Egyptian protests became the most critical foreign policy crisis so far for the Obama administration, and Obama came to increasingly rely upon Clinton for advice and connections. Clinton had known Mubarak for some twenty years, and had formed a close relationship with Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak by supporting the latter's human rights work. Clinton originated the idea of sending Frank G. Wisner as an emissary to Cairo, to tell Mubarak not to seek another term as the country's leader. As Mubarak's response to the protests became violent in early February, Clinton strongly condemned the actions taking place, especially those against journalists covering the events, and urged new Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman to conduct an official investigation to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. When Wisner baldly stated that Mubarak's departure should be delayed to accommodate an orderly transition to another government, Clinton rebuked him, but shared a bit of the same sentiment. Mubarak did finally step down on February 11 as the protests became the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Clinton said that the U.S. realized that Egypt still had much work and some difficult times ahead of it. In mid-March, Clinton visited Egypt and indicated support for an Egyptian move towards democracy, but she avoided specific issues of U.S. aid and when elections should take place. President Obama was reportedly unhappy with U.S. intelligence agencies following their failure to foresee the 2010‚Äì2011 Tunisian uprising and the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali as well as the Egyptian protests. Responding to criticism that the State Department had failed to see the developments in Egypt coming, Clinton defended the U.S. in an interview on Al-Arabiya, saying \\"I don't think anybody could have predicted we'd be sitting here talking about the end of the Mubarak presidency at the time that this all started.\\" Reflecting on not just the situation in Tunisia and Egypt but also on the 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, \\"The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable.\\" She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic ‚Äì and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, and the rule of law in order to be effective ‚Äì in the end \\"free people govern themselves best\\". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters \\"is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform.\\" At the same time, she said that the U.S. \\"cannot tell countries what they are going to do [and] cannot dictate the outcomes.\\" As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, \\"Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so.\\" When the 2011 Libyan civil war began in mid-February and intensified into armed conflict with rebel successes in early March 2011, Clinton stated the administration's position that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi \\"must go now, without further violence or delay\\". As Gaddafi conducted counterattacks against the rebels, Clinton was initially reluctant, as was Obama, to back calls being made in various quarters for imposition of a Libyan no-fly zone. However, as the prospects of a Gaddafi victory and possible subsequent bloodbath that would kill many thousands emerged, and as Clinton traveled Europe and North Africa and found support for military intervention increasing among European and Arab leaders, she had a change of view. Together with Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power, who were already supporting military intervention, Clinton overcame opposition from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, security advisor Thomas Donilon, and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan, and the administration backed U.N. action to impose the no-fly zone and authorize other military actions as necessary. Clinton helped gain the financial and political support of several Arab countries, in particular convincing Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan that a no-fly zone urged by the Arab League would not be sufficient and that air-to-ground attacks would be necessary. Clinton then persuaded Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that his country should abstain on the UN resolution authorizing force against Gaddafi, and Rice and Clinton played major roles in getting the rest of the United Nations Security Council to approve United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. Regarding whether the U.S. or some other ally would send arms to the anti-Gaddafi forces, Clinton said that this would be permissible under the resolution, but that no decision had yet been made on doing so. Clinton testified to Congress in March that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya or for further decisions about it, despite congressional objections from members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution. During that classified briefing to Congress, she allegedly indicated that the administration would sidestep the Resolution's provision regarding a 60-day limit on unauthorized military actions. Months later, she stated that, with respect to the military operation in Libya, the United States was still flying a quarter of the sorties, and The New York Times reported that, while many presidents had bypassed other sections of the War Powers Resolution, there was little precedent for exceeding the 60-day statutory limit on unauthorized military actions ‚Äì a limit which the Justice Department had said in 1980 was constitutional. The State Department publicly took the position in June 2011 that there was no \\"hostility\\" in Libya within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, contrary to legal interpretations by the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.Cosgrove, Maureen. \\"State Department legal adviser: Obama acting lawfully in Libya\\", JURIST (June 28, 2011). The State Department requested (but never received) express Congressional authorization. The US House of Representatives voted to rebuke the administration for maintaining an American presence with the NATO operations in Libya, which they considered a violation of the War Powers Resolution.Dinan, Stephen, \\"Bipartisan Congress rebuffs Obama on Libya mission\\". The Washington Times, Saturday, June 4, 2011 Secretary Clinton appearing on Nessma TV in Tunis in March 2011 While Clinton recognized some of the contradictions of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others, she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual Gridiron Dinner that \\"I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East to talk about how these countries can transition to new leaders‚Äîthough, I've got to be honest, she's gotten a little passionate about the subject. These past few weeks it's been tough falling asleep with Hillary out there on Pennsylvania Avenue shouting, throwing rocks at the window.\\" In any case, Obama's reference to Clinton travelling a lot was true enough; by now she had logged in her Boeing 757, more than any other Secretary of State for a comparable period of time, and had visited 79 countries while in the office. Time magazine wrote that \\"Clinton's endurance is legendary\\" and that she would still be going at the end of long work days even as her staff members were glazing out. The key was her ability to fall asleep on demand, at any time and place, for power naps. Clinton also saw the potential political changes in the Mideast as an opportunity for an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative). She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt ‚Äì \\"If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible\\" ‚Äì as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present Nujood Ali and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age. At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: \\"I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings.\\" She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: \\"This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, but it is also a big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us.\\" She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying \\"A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately ‚Äì which I do ‚Äì but because I see it as [a way] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me.\\" In the midst of this turmoil, which also included Clinton pledging government- level support to Japan in the wake of the devastating 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re- elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: \\"Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to catch your breath. There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region.\\" But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66 percent (against 31 percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get. Secretary Clinton was among those in the White House Situation Room getting real-time updates on the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden. Throughout early 2011, the CIA thought there was a good chance it had discovered the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, and the White House held a final high-level discussion on April 28 about whether to go ahead with a raid to get him, and if so, what kind of mission to undertake. Clinton supported the option to send Navy SEALs in, believing that the U.S. could not afford to ignore this chance and that getting bin Laden was so important that it outweighed any risks. Following the successful May 1‚Äì2, 2011, U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden at his hideout compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and the resulting criticism from various Americans that Pakistan had not found, or had let, bin Laden hide in near plain sight, Clinton made a point of praising Pakistan's past record of helping the U.S. hunt down terrorists: \\"Our counter- terrorism cooperation over a number of years now, with Pakistan, has contributed greatly to our efforts to dismantle al-Qaeda. And in fact, cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding. Going forward, we are absolutely committed to continuing that cooperation.\\" Clinton then played a key role in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead bin Laden, reporting that U.S. allies in the Middle East did not favor the release and agreeing with Secretary Gates that such a release might cause an anti-U.S. backlash overseas. A June 2011 trip to Africa found Clinton consoling longtime aide Huma Abedin after the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal broke. She also emphatically denied published reports that she was interested in becoming the next president of the World Bank, which would need a successor to follow Robert Zoellick after the end of his term in mid-2012. A different suggestion, from wanting-to-depart U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner that Clinton replace him at that position, gained some traction in parts of the White House before economic and budget issues intensified and President Obama convinced Geithner to stay on. By July, Clinton was assuring China and other foreign governments that the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling crisis would not end with the U.S. going into sovereign default (a prediction that turned true when the Budget Control Act of 2011 was passed and signed the day before default loomed). She spent much of that summer in an eventually unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Palestinian National Authority not to attempt to gain membership in the United Nations at its September 2011 General Assembly meeting. Clinton continued to poll high, with a September 2011 Bloomberg News poll finding her with a 64 percent favorable rating, the highest of any political figure in the nation. A third of those polls said that Clinton would have been a better president than Obama, but when asked the likelihood she would stage a campaign against the president, she said, \\"It's below zero. One of the great things about being secretary of state is I am out of politics. I am not interested in being drawn back into it by anybody.\\" Following the October 2011 announcement by Obama that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq would complete by the close of that same year, Clinton forcefully defended the decision as emanating from an agreement originally signed with Iraq under the Bush administration and as evidence that Iraq's sovereignty was real, and said that despite the absence of military forces, the U.S. was still committed to strengthening Iraq's democracy with \\"robust\\" diplomatic measures. She also praised the effectiveness of Obama's foreign policy in general, implicitly pushing back on criticism from those running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Clinton specifically pointed to the death of Muammar Gaddafi and the conclusion of the Libyan intervention. She had been active during the final stages of the Libyan rebellion, and via Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, had urged the rebels forces to unify and avoid factional conflicts with each other. She visited Tripoli in October 2011 and, in private, was somewhat guarded about Libya's future following the rebel success. (A video of her exclaiming \\"Wow\\" upon first reading on her BlackBerry of Gaddafi's capture achieved wide circulation.) Over the next few years, the aftermath of the Libyan Civil War became characterized by instability, two rival governments, and a slide into status as a failed state; it became a refuge for extremists and terrorist groups, such as ISIL, and spurred a massive refugee crisis as immigrants crossed the Mediterranean to southern Europe. The wisdom of the intervention would continue to be debated, with President Obama maintaining that the intervention had been worthwhile but that the United States and Europe underestimated the ongoing effort needed to rebuild Libyan society afterward; former U.S. Representative to NATO Ivo Daalder stating that the limited goals of the intervention had all been met but that the Libyan people had not seized their opportunity to form a better future and that post-intervention military involvement by the West would have been counterproductive; and scholar Alan J. Kuperman (along with some other scholars and human rights groups) writing that the intervention had been based on the faulty notion that Libya had been headed towards humanitarian disaster when in fact it was not and was thus the intervention was \\"an abject failure, judged even by its own standards\\". Kuperman's view that Gaddafi son Saif al- Islam Gaddafi held promise as a Western-style political reformer was in turn disputed by former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Derek Chollet, who stated that such faith was misplaced and that Libyans were resistant to any post-intervention security mechanism and to many rebuilding programs. Clinton said in her 2014 memoir that she had been \\"worried that the challenges ahead would prove overwhelming for even the most well-meaning transitional leaders. If the new government could consolidate its authority, provide security, use oil revenues to rebuild, disarm the militias, and keep extremists out, then Libya would have a fighting chance at building a stable democracy. If not, then the country would face very difficult challenges translating the hopes of a revolution into a free, secure, and prosperous future.\\" Secretary Clinton cancelled a planned trip to the United Kingdom and Turkey to be with her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who died in Washington on November 1, 2011. In November 2011, Clinton declared, in both a speech at the East‚ÄìWest Center and in an article published in Foreign Policy magazine, that the 21st century would be \\"America's Pacific century\\". The term played on the notion of the \\"Pacific Century\\". Clinton said, \\"It is becoming increasingly clear that, in the 21st century, the world's strategic and economic center of gravity will be the Asia-Pacific, from the Indian subcontinent to western shores of the Americas.\\" The declaration was part of the Obama administration's \\"pivot to Asia\\" after the focus of the decade of the 2000s on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. When the 2011‚Äì2012 Russian protests had begun in late 2011, in response to the 2011 Russian legislative election, Clinton had been outspoken about the need for legitimate democratic processes there, saying in December 2011: \\"The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\\" She added that \\"Russian voters deserve a full investigation of electoral fraud and manipulation.\\" In return, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin denounced Clinton, accusing her of backing Russian protesters financially and in fact precipitating their actions: \\"They heard this signal and with the support of the U.S. State Department began their active work.\\" When Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential election in March 2012, some in the State Department wanted to denounce Russian process again, but they were overruled by the White House, and Clinton stated simply that \\"The election had a clear winner, and we are ready to work with President-elect Putin.\\" Secretary Clinton met with Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on December 2, 2011, as part of her historic visit to that country. In early December 2011, Clinton made the first visit to Burma by a U.S. secretary of state since John Foster Dulles's in 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms. Clinton said that due to the direct and indirect communications she had had with Suu Kyi over the years, \\"it was like seeing a friend you hadn't seen for a very long time even though it was our first meeting.\\" The outreach to Burma attracted both praise and criticism, with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen saying it \\"sends the wrong signal to the Burmese military thugs\\" but others saying the visit combined idealism with respect to reform and realpolitik with respect to keeping Burma out of the direct Chinese sphere of influence. Clinton had had to overcome internal administration opposition from the White House and Pentagon, as well as from Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, to make the move, eventually making a personal appeal to Obama and gaining his approval. Regarding whether the Burmese regime would follow up on reform pledges, Clinton said, \\"I can't predict what's going to happen, but I think it certainly is important for the United States to be on the side of democratic reform ... This is a first date, not a marriage, and we'll see where it leads.\\" She continued to address rights concerns in a December 2011 speech a few days later before the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights abroad and that \\"Gay rights are human rights\\" and that \\"It should never be a crime to be gay.\\" This itself drew criticism from some American social conservatives. As the year closed, Clinton was again named by Americans in Gallup's most admired man and woman poll as the woman around the world they most admired; it was her tenth win in a row and sixteenth overall. Regional issues and travels: 2012 Secretary Clinton and Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu following their bilateral meeting at the Department of State, February 13, 2012. In a State Department town hall meeting on January 26, 2012, Clinton indicated her desire to remove herself from \\"the high wire of American politics\\" after twenty tiring years of being on it and added, \\"I have made it clear that I will certainly stay on until the president nominates someone and that transition can occur.\\" She also indicated that she had not watched any of the 2012 Republican Party presidential debates. As the Syrian Civil War continued and intensified with the February 2012 bombardment of Homs, the U.S. sought a UN Security Council resolution that backed an Arab League plan that would urge Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to relinquish powers to the vice presidential level and permit a unity government to form. However, Russia and China vetoed the resolution, an action that Clinton characterized as a \\"travesty\\". After the failure of the effort, Clinton warned that Syria could degenerate into \\"a brutal civil war\\" and called for a \\"friends of democratic Syria\\" group of like-minded nations to promote a peaceful and democratic solution to the situation and pressure Syria accordingly. At a meeting in Tunis of the consequent Friends of Syria Group, Clinton again criticized the actions of Russia and China as \\"distressing\\" and \\"despicable\\", and predicted that the Assad regime would meet its end via a military coup. Later, during the summer of 2012, she repeated her criticism of those two countries. At that time, Clinton developed a plan with CIA Director David H. Petraeus to send arms to, and perform training of, vetted groups of Syrian rebels, using the assistance of a neighboring state. The plan also had the support of Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Joint Chiefs chair General Martin E. Dempsey. Reluctant to become entangled in the Syrian situation and in an election campaign, Obama rejected the idea. Clinton has visited 112 countries during her tenure, the most of any Secretary of State in U.S. history. In February 2012, a spokesman for Clinton denied again that Clinton wanted the President of the World Bank job, saying, \\"She has said this is not happening. Her view has not changed.\\" At a keynote speech before the International Crisis Group, the secretary brought her view regarding the empowerment of women specifically into the area of peacemaking, saying that women's multifaceted ties with a community make them more compelled to concern about social and quality of life issues that prosper under peacetime conditions. Furthermore, women identify more with minority groups, being discriminated against themselves. Thus, \\"Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their children's and grandchildren's fates, are decided.\\" She also continued to believe that empowerment of women would continue to grow as people saw that it would lead to economic growth. In April 2012, an Internet meme \\"Texts from Hillary\\", hosted on Tumblr and based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton with a group of colleagues relaxing, drinking √Åguila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, \\"There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'\\" One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, \\"There's no coin in criticizing her anymore.\\" At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, \\"As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you‚Äôre in and out of the plane. [The staff] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options.\\" Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: \\"I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back.\\" In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras. A late April/early May 2012 trip to China found Clinton in the middle of a drama involving blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng. He had escaped house arrest and, after finding his way to the Embassy of the United States, Beijing, requested an arrangement whereby he could stay in China with guarantees for his safety. After a deal towards that end fell through, he requested a seat on Clinton's plane when she flew back to the U.S. After further negotiations in parallel with the existing agenda of Clinton's trip, Chen left for the U.S. after Clinton's departure. Clinton had negotiated personally with senior Chinese diplomat Dai Bingguo in order to get the deal back in place. Despite an environment that had, as one aide said, \\"exploded into an absolute circus\\", Clinton managed to find a path for the U.S. that kept China from losing face and kept the overall agenda of the meetings intact. Following the June 2012 killing of high-ranking al Qaeda figure Abu Yahya al-Libi in one of the U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, Clinton defended the action, saying \\"We will always maintain our right to use force against groups such as al Qaeda that have attacked us and still threaten us with imminent attack. In doing so, we will comply with the applicable law, including the laws of war, and go to extraordinary lengths to ensure precision and avoid the loss of innocent life.\\" Indeed, beginning with her 2009 trip to Pakistan, Clinton had faced questions about U.S. drone strikes, which she refused to comment much upon at the time. Behind the scenes, Clinton was in fact one of the leading administration proponents of continuing and expanding the strikes there and elsewhere. She did, however, side with U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter in 2011 when he requested more input into, and control over, the U.S. \\"kill list\\" selections for that country.Mazzetti, The Way of the Knife, pp. 290‚Äì293. In June 2012, Clinton set down in Riga, Latvia, which represented the 100th country she had visited during her tenure, setting a mark for secretaries of state; the record had been Madeleine Albright with 96. In July 2012, Clinton became the first U.S. Secretary of State to visit Laos since John Foster Dulles in 1955. She held talks with Prime Minister Thongsing Thammavong and Foreign Minister Thongloun Sisoulith in Vientiane. Also in July 2012, Clinton visited Egypt for the first time since Mohammed Morsi became the first democratically elected president of the country. As she arrived in the country, her convoy was met with a protest and had shoes, tomatoes and bottled water thrown at it, although nothing hit either Clinton or her vehicle. Protesters also chanted \\"Monica, Monica\\", in reference to the Lewinsky scandal. She also faced conspiracy theories that the U.S. was secretly aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. An advocate of ending Somalia's transitional phase on time, Clinton showed support in August for the new Federal Government of Somalia, which took over as the permanent government. President Obama and Secretary Clinton honor the Benghazi victims at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony held at Andrews Air Force Base on September 14, 2012. On September 11, 2012, an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi took place, resulting in the death of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The next day, Clinton also made a statement describing the perpetrators as \\"heavily armed militants\\" and \\"a small and savage group ‚Äì not the people or government of Libya.\\" Clinton also responded to the notion that the attack had been related to the reactions in Egypt and elsewhere to the anti-Islamic online video known as Innocence of Muslims, saying: \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\" She and President Obama appearing together in the White House Rose Garden the same day and vowed to bring the attackers to justice. On September 14 the remains of the slain Americans were returned to the U.S. Obama and Clinton attended the ceremony; in her remarks, Clinton said, \\"One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said 'Thugs and killers don't represent Benghazi nor Islam.'\\"\\"Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya\\" , Hillary Rodham Clinton, September 14, 2012 The attack, and questions surrounding the U.S. Government's preparedness for it, and explanations for what had happened afterward, became a political firestorm in the U.S., especially in the context of the ongoing presidential election. The State Department had previously identified embassy and personnel security as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report. On the September 20, Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators, which several Republican attendees criticized, angry at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. She did announce the formation of an Accountability Review Board panel, chaired by longtime diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by retired Admiral and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, to investigate the attack from the State Department's viewpoint. On October 15, regarding the question of preparedness, Clinton said she was accountable: \\"I take responsibility. I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. ... I take this very personally. So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again.\\" Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, \\"In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens.\\" On November 6, 2012, Obama was re-elected for a second term as president. Clinton said shortly before the election that she would stay on until her successor was confirmed, but that \\"this is not an open-ended kind of time frame.\\" Despite her continuing to express a lack of interest, speculation continued about Clinton as a possible candidate in the 2016 presidential election. A poll taken in Iowa, the first state in the nomination process, showed that in a hypothetical 2016 caucuses contest, Clinton would have 58 percent support, with Vice President Biden coming in next at 17 percent. Later in November, Clinton traveled to Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Cairo, meeting with leaders Benjamin Netanyahu, Mahmoud Abbas and Mohamed Morsi respectively, in an effort to stop the 2012 Gaza conflict. On November 21, she participated in a joint appearance with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr to announce that a cease-fire agreement had been reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. When the 2012 Egyptian protests against Morsi broke out shortly thereafter, Clinton said that it showed how a dialogue between both sides was immediately needed on how to reshape that nation's constitution. In mid-December, Clinton fell victim to a stomach virus contracted on a trip to Europe. She subsequently became very dehydrated and then fainted, suffering a mild concussion. As a result, she cancelled another trip and scratched an appearance at scheduled Congressional hearings on the Benghazi matter. A few conservative figures, including Congressman Allen West and Ambassador to the UN John R. Bolton, accused Clinton of fabricating her illness to avoid testifying, but a State Department spokesperson said that was \\"completely untrue\\" and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham denounced the allegations. On December 19, the Pickering‚ÄìMullen Accountability Review Board report on the Benghazi matter was released.Thomas R. Pickering, Michael Mullen, et. al, Accountability Review Board report on Benghazi (Unclassified) U.S. Department of State. December 18, 2012. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It explicitly criticized the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs: \\"Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place.\\" Four State Department officials were removed from their posts as a consequence, including Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell (who resigned completely), a deputy assistant secretary for embassy security, Charlene R. Lamb, and a deputy assistant secretary for North Africa, Raymond Maxwell. The report did not criticize more senior officials in the department; Pickering said: \\"We fixed it at the assistant secretary level, which is, in our view, the appropriate place to look, where the decision-making in fact takes place, where, if you like, the rubber hits the road.\\" Clinton said in a letter to Congress that she accepted the conclusions of the Pickering‚ÄìMullen report, and a State Department task force was formed to implement some sixty action items recommended by the report. On December 20, the Deputy Secretary of State, William J. Burns, and the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Thomas R. Nides, testified in her place before two Congressional committees, and said that many of the report's recommendations would be in place before year-end. Clinton planned to testify herself in January. The Benghazi matter also had an effect on Clinton's successor as Secretary of State. Obama's first choice was Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice, but she came under heavy criticism from Congressional Republicans for what they felt were incorrect or deceptive statements in the aftermath of the attack, and by mid- December she withdrew her name from consideration. Obama then nominated Senator John Kerry for the position instead. By one report, Clinton had preferred Kerry over Rice all along anyway. Although still not well enough to attend the December 21 announcement of Kerry's nomination, Clinton was described by Obama as being \\"in good spirits\\" and, in a statement, praised Kerry as being of the \\"highest caliber\\". Clinton was scheduled to return to work the week of December 31, but then on December 30 was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital for treatment and observation after a blood clot related to the concussion was discovered. On December 31 it was announced that the clot was behind her ear near her brain, specifically a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis, that she was being treated with anticoagulants, that she had not suffered any neurological damage, and that she was expected to make a full recovery. Final days of tenure Secretary Clinton is welcomed back to work at the State Department on January 7, 2013 Secretary Clinton receives a football jersey with 112, the number of countries she visited during her tenure Clinton returned to work at the State Department on January 7. The illness put an end to her days of travel in the job. She finished with 112 countries visited, making her the most widely traveled secretary of state in history. Her total of 956,733 air miles ended up falling short of Condoleezza Rice's record for total mileage. That total, 1,059,207, was bolstered late in Rice's tenure by repeated trips to the Middle East. Clinton traveled during 401 days, with 306 of those spent in actual diplomatic meetings, and spent the equivalent of 87 full days on airplanes. Compared to other recent secretaries, Clinton traveled more broadly, with fewer repeat visits to certain countries. Secretary Clinton gives her farewell remarks to State Department employees on her last day in office, February 1, 2013 On January 23, Clinton finally gave more than five hours of testimony on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She said with a choking voice, \\"For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters.\\" She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, \\"I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them.\\" She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican associated with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, \\"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator.\\" Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of \\"national security malpractice\\" and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while \\"It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever\\", he was unsatisfied with her answers. Clinton also took the opportunity to address the ongoing conflict in Mali and the rest of Northern Africa, saying \\"this Pandora's Box if you will\\" of side effects from the Arab Spring had opened a new security challenge for the U.S. Specifically, she said \\"we cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven.\\" The next day, January 24, Clinton introduced John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as hearings were held on his nomination to succeed her. She called him \\"the right choice to carry forward the Obama Administration's foreign policy\\", and called out his testimony before the same committee in 1971 in opposition to the Vietnam War as \\"speaking hard truths about a war that had gone badly off track.\\" On January 27, 60 Minutes aired a joint interview with Obama and Clinton. The interview was Obama's idea and was the first he had done with a member of his administration. In it, Obama consistently praised Clinton's performance in the position, saying \\"I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretary of states we've had.\\" Both said the relationship between them had been very comfortable, and that getting past their 2008 primary campaign battles had not been difficult for them personally. Regarding her health, Clinton said, \\"I still have some lingering effects from falling on my head and having the blood clot. But the doctors tell me that will all recede. And so, thankfully, I'm looking forward to being at full speed.\\" On January 29, Clinton held a global and final town hall meeting, the 59th of her tenure. The YouTube link within shows the town hall being held. Also on January 29, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Kerry's nomination unanimously and the full Senate confirmed the nomination by a 94‚Äì3 vote. In her final public speech, on January 31 before the Council on Foreign Relations, Clinton returned to the themes of \\"smart power\\". She suggested that a new architecture was needed for relations within the world, giving an analogy of Frank Gehry compared to ancient Greek architecture: \\"Some of his work at first might appear haphazard, but in fact, it's highly intentional and sophisticated. Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, today we need a dynamic mix of materials and structures.\\" She added, echoing Madeleine Albright, \\"... we are truly the indispensable nation, it's not meant as a boast or an empty slogan. It's a recognition of our role and our responsibilities. That's why all the declinists are dead wrong. It's why the United States must and will continue to lead in this century even as we lead in new ways.\\" Clinton's final day as secretary was February 1, 2013, when she met with Obama to hand in her letter of resignation and later gave farewell remarks in a meeting with employees at State Department headquarters. Overall themes and legacy Although Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State was popular at the time among the public and praised by President Obama, observers have noted that there was no signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of Dean Acheson, George Marshall, or Henry Kissinger. The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left. Many of Clinton's initiatives in the \\"smart power\\" realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect. Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said that \\"She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy.\\" Michael E. O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution analyst, said that, \\"Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [She has been] more solid than spectacular.\\" Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz Cheney argue that Clinton's tenure, and the Obama administration's foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since World War II. Others, however, such as Eric Schmidt disagree, and have argued that Clinton was \\"perhaps the most significant secretary of state since\\" Acheson. All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, \\"She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do.\\" Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama discuss matters in 2009, at a picnic table on the grounds of the White House The divisions between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened. Indeed, a writer for The New York Times Magazine declared that \\"Obama and Clinton have instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front.\\" In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of the handling of the Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the White House or Pentagon during her tenure, and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept inside the White House among Obama's inner circle of advisors. There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011. Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances. Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the U.S. Commerce Department, by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies. In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Westinghouse Electric Company. Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals. Obama later referred to the Libya intervention when questioned about his worst mistake. Obama asserted that he had been reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice. Obama cited the lack of preparation the Administration had made for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya. However, Clinton's stance is that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario. Clinton's background as an elected politician showed in her touch for dealing with people, in remembering personal connections, in visiting State Department staff when overseas, and in sympathizing with the dilemmas of elected foreign leaders. It sometimes served to her detriment though, such as in Egypt when her personal relationship with the Mubaraks may have caused her to initially back them too long during the Egyptian Revolution. At least until the Benghazi matter, she retained personal support among a number of Republicans; in mid-2012, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, \\"I think she's represented our nation well. She is extremely well respected throughout the world, handles herself in a very classy way and has a work ethic second to none.\\" Especially in the Mideast turmoil but elsewhere as well, Clinton saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide. Moreover, she viewed women's rights and human rights as critical for U.S. security interests, as part of what has become known as the \\"Hillary Doctrine\\". Also published in Newsweek as \\"Did Hillary Implement a Women's-Issues Foreign Policy?\\", June 26, 2015. Former State Department director and coordinator Theresa Loar said in 2011 that, \\"I honestly think Hillary Clinton wakes up every day thinking about how to improve the lives of women and girls. And I don't know another world leader who is doing that.\\"Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 52‚Äì53. In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.Hudson and Leidl, The Hillary Doctrine, pp. 57‚Äì60. A mid-2012 Pew Research study of public opinions found that Clinton was viewed positively in Japan and most European countries in terms of people having confidence that she would do the right thing in world affairs. She received mixed marks in China, Russia, and some Central and South American countries, and low marks in Muslim countries, on this question. Overall, Clinton's attempts to improve the image of America in Muslim countries did not find any immediate success due to many factors, including the unpopularity of drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. Perceptions of the U.S. in those countries declined during her tenure according to a Pew Research, which found that only 15 percent of Muslims had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 25 percent in 2009. Specifically in Pakistan, only 12 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 16 percent in 2009, and only 3 percent had confidence in Clinton compared to 37 percent not. The first secretary of state to visit countries such as Togo and Timor-Leste, Clinton believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the digital age. As she said in remarks shortly before leaving office, \\"I have found it highly ironic that, in today's world, when we can be anywhere virtually, more than ever people want us to show up, actually. Somebody said to me the other day, 'I look at your travel schedule. Why Togo? Why the Cook Islands?' No secretary of state had ever been to Togo before. Togo happens to be on the U.N. Security Council. Going there, making the personal investment, has a real strategic purpose.\\" Post-tenure issues Financial accounting, document requests, Clinton Foundation According to the Office of the Inspector General report made in 2014, the State Department's records failed to properly account for some $6 billion in contracts over the prior six years, including around $2 billion for the department's mission in Iraq. The report said, \\"The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department's contract actions,\\" and added that investigators and auditors had found \\"repeated examples of poor contract file administration\\" which it had characterized as having been one of the department's \\"major management challenges\\" for several years. During 2014, the State Department failed to turn over documents to the Associated Press that it had asked for through a Freedom of Information Act request based on the possibility of Clinton running for president in 2016. The department said it \\"does its best to meet its FOIA responsibilities\\" but that it was under a heavy administrative load for such requests. The ethics agreement between the State Department and Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary's tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during early 2015. A Wall Street Journal report found that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended. A Washington Post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found a six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, which was permissible under the agreement, and also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria in January 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not. The Post noted that the donation \\"coincided with a spike\\" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record but that during 2010 and 2011 the Department still issued human rights reports critical of Algeria's restrictions on freedom of assembly, women's rights and labor rights that also pointed to instances of extrajudicial killings, corruption, and lack of transparency in the government. A Politico analysis of State Department documents found that the department approved virtually all of Bill Clinton's proposed speaking engagements, even when they lacked sufficient information about the valuation of those talks or links between them and possible subsequent donations to the Clinton Foundation. From 2009 to 2013, the Russian atomic energy agency Rosatom acquired Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20 percent of the uranium production capacity in the United States. The strategically sensitive acquisition required the approval of the Canadian government as well as a number of U.S. governmental bodies including the State Department. In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Also during this time, Bill Clinton received a $500,000 payment from Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank whose analysts were praising Uranium One stock, for making speech in Moscow. The Foundation donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation or the State Department, despite a prior agreement to do so, in part due to taking advantage of the donations going through a Canadian affiliate of the Foundation. A FactCheck.org analysis stated that while the reports raised \\"legitimate questions about the Clinton Foundation and its donations,\\" the reports \\"presented no evidence that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions.\\" Asked about the issue in June 2015, the former secretary said of the State Department's role in the approval, \\"There were nine government agencies that that had to sign off on that deal. I was not personally involved because that's not something [the] Secretary of State did.\\" Use of private email server In early March 2015, a New York Times report revealed that throughout her time as Secretary of State, Clinton used her own private email server, rather than government-issued departmental ones Further investigation revealed that the day of her first Senate hearing to become Secretary of State, Clinton, or an associate, purchased a private email server under the pseudonym \\"Eric Hoteham\\". The server was set up in her home in Chappaqua, New York. The matter gained widespread public attention due to concerns about the security of the mails she sent and received and whether they were exposed to hacking and surveillance; the availability and preservation of the mails for Freedom of Information Act requests and the archival historical record; and whether her action had violated any federal laws, regulations, or guidelines. Also in question was whether the use of the private email server violated State Department transparency protocols. In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and that she now wanted them made public. These 55,000 printed pages accounted for 30,490, or slightly less than half, of the 62,320 emails that Clinton had sent or received on her private email account during her time as secretary.The Problem With Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Email Record Search, Time, March 11, 2015 At a press conference Clinton said she had set up the separate server as a matter of convenience so that she could carry one device and not two, but that in retrospect \\"it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone\\". She said that she had sent mails to State Department employees on their government accounts, ensuring such mails would be preserved, but it then turned out that the department did not automatically or routinely save such mails. After the revelations, questions were raised about whether Clinton, when she resigned in February 2013, had signed Form OF-109, a standard document declaring that she had turned over all work- related records. After searching, the State Department said it had \\"no record\\" that Clinton had signed the form, were \\"fairly certain\\" that she had not, and that it appeared neither of her two immediate predecessors as secretary had either.State Department: Clinton didn‚Äôt sign form certifying return of documents, Washington Post, March 17, 2015 According to the text of the form, it warns individuals signing it that falsification is subject to criminal penalties under Section 1001 of Title 18. A portion of the emails on Clinton's private server were emails sent in 2011 and 2012 by Sidney Blumenthal, a political supporter and campaign staffer who worked for the Clinton Foundation. Blumenthal prepared, from public and other sources, about 25 memos which he sent to Clinton during 2011 and 2012 which she shared through her aide, Jake Sullivan, with senior State Department personnel. In the form of intelligence briefings, the memos sometimes touted his business associates and, at times contained inaccurate information. In August 2015, it was reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State.Rosalind S. Helderman and Carol D. Leonnig ‚Äì \\"Clintons personally paid State Department staffer to maintain server\\", The Washington Post, September 5, 2015. Retrieved 2015-09-05Cameron Joseph ‚Äì \\"Hillary Clinton 'takes responsibility' for email controversy, but won't apologize for using private server\\", New York Daily News, September 5, 2015. Retrieved 2015-09-01 According to a Clinton campaign official, this ensured that taxpayer dollars would not be spent on a private server that was shared by Clinton, her husband and their daughter, as well as several aides to the former president. On September 1, 2015, Pagliano's attorney sent letters to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which had subpoenaed Pagliano, and to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was inquiring about Pagliano's outside employment while a Federal employee, informing the committees that his client would invoke his constitutional Fifth Amendment rights not to answer any questions from the committees, and on September 10, in a closed-door session before the Benghazi Committee, Pagliano personally appeared to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify before the committee.Bryan Tau and Emma Court ‚Äì \\"Hillary Clinton Aide Bryan Pagliano Invokes Fifth Amendment in Email Probe: Move could prompt investigators to grant IT staffer immunity in exchange for testimony\\", Wall Street Journal, September 10, 2015. Retrieved 2015-09-11 Mis-handling of classified information On July 23, 2015, The New York Times reported the existence of a June 2015, memorandum to the Justice Department from the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the State Department regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State. A transmittal memorandum, written by State Department official Patrick F. Kennedy, said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Clinton's private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email. Clinton and her campaign reiterated that the information transmitted was not classified \\"at the time\\", but the inspectors general, as well as reporting by The New York Times and others, said that it, in fact, was classified at the time. Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and government procedures and protocols require that such information be sent or stored only on government computer networks with government safeguards. An FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. During the summer and fall of 2016 the probe was twice concluded with a recommendation of no charges, a recommendation that was followed by the Justice Department, but according to Clinton herself, the emails matter and the way in which it would not go away contributed to her electoral defeat. The Department of State finished its internal investigation of the matter in September 2019, citing 588 security violations. The review found that 38 current and former State Department officials ‚Äì some of whom might face a disciplinary action or security clearance review ‚Äì were culpable of mishandling classified information, but in 497 cases the culpability could not be established. The material was considered classified then or later, but none of the violations involved information marked classified. The investigation found Clinton's use of personal email server increased the risk of compromising State Department information, but \\"there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\\" The investigation added that although there was no evidence that Clinton's private server had been compromised, \\"the use of a private email system to conduct official business added an increased degree of risk of compromise as a private system lacks the network monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities of State Department networks.\\" Secret Service leaks through United States embassy in Moscow In a Guardian article in August 2018, a female Russian national at the United States embassy in Moscow, who worked for the United States Secret Service and had access to both classified and sensitive information for a decade, had met often with Russian intelligence officials. The Secret Service intranet data bases contained information which would have been useful for Russian hackers during their subsequent attacks on Clinton while she campaigned for President in 2016. Although she became under suspicion in 2016, the United States Department of State's Regional Security Office investigation began in January 2017 and led to actions which both revoked her security clearance and had her removed from the embassy staff during the summer of 2017 when 750 of the 1,200 persons in the staff were removed following the July 2017 United States sanctions against Russia due to Russia's interference in the United States 2016 elections. The FBI and CIA also had begun inquiries. A Secret Service investigation, however, denied that any information had been passed to FSB from the Russian national.

She is South Africa's leading wicket-taker in women's Test cricket, having claimed 27 wickets in her seven Test appearances, and taking five-wicket hauls on three occasions. She played in South Africa's first match in Test cricket at St George's Park. Ward represented Eastern Province, Natal and Southern Transvaal at provincial cricket. Test career England 1960‚Äì61 Playing in South Africa's first Test against the touring English side, Ward was the third South African to be run out in the first-innings as they posted a total of 211. Bowling in the reply, Ward took four wickets in the first innings to help restrict the English to 187 runs, giving South Africa a small first-innings lead. In a second innings in which Springboks captain Sheelagh Nefdt was criticised for not declaring earlier, Ward made 17 runs in support of her captain as they added an unbeaten 52 for the ninth-wicket. Ward was wicket-less in the fourth innings as England chased 284, the match eventually finishing in a draw with another 83 runs or 6 wickets required for a result. Ward had minimal involvement in the second Test; she only bowled two overs, taking no wickets and conceding seven runs, and as South Africa were forced to follow-on, she scored a duck in the first-innings and was 0 not out when the match finished in a draw in South Africa's second-innings. She was again wicket-less in the third Test, conceding 74 runs in her 26 overs in the first-innings. South Africa lost the match by eight wickets and, having been promoted to number nine, Ward only made seven runs in the two innings. The fourth Test saw Ward take a remarkable five-wicket haul in the first-innings. All five of her wickets were bowled as she finished the innings with 5/18. She failed to take a wicket in the second-innings, bowling expensively for her 18 overs, conceding 44 runs as England set a total of 194 for South Africa to win. In reply, South Africa managed a fast 126 from their 37 overs, but couldn't prevent the draw. Netherlands 1968‚Äì69 Ward was named as part of the squad to play the unofficial Test matches against the Netherlands when England failed to fulfil their fixtures. South Africa won all three Tests, and Ward claimed figures of 3/26 in the first-innings of the third Test followed by 4/36 in the second-innings. New Zealand 1971‚Äì72 One of only three survivors from the squad that faced the touring English side in 1960‚Äì61, Ward appeared in all three Tests against New Zealand eleven years later. She started the series well, taking five wickets in New Zealand's first-innings. She fell for another duck in the Springboks first-innings and didn't take a wicket in the second-innings as the match finished a draw. The South Africans bowled well in the first-innings of the second Test, with Ward, Gloria Williamson and Denise Weyers taking three wickets apiece to restrict the Kiwis to 168. In reply, South Africa could only manage 111, and in spite of another three wickets from Ward, taking an economical 3/38 in her 28 overs, New Zealand declared 277 ahead. South Africa were bowled out for 89 and lost the match. In her final Test, Ward achieved her best bowling performance, taking six wickets in the Kiwi's first-innings as they posted a lead of 98 runs. As South Africa managed 242 in the second-innings, New Zealand returned to bat needing 148 runs to win. Ward took 1/28 as the Kiwis finished just 31 runs short of their target.

It is located between the Cabreira River and the Tur√≠a River, southeast of the town of Taramundi, northwest of Veigas, and from Oviedo, the capital of Asturias. According to the census of 2005, the population is four people. The meaning behind the translated name is derived from the iron products region of the Oscos-Eo rivers. The Mazonovo forge stands near the road to Fonsagrada Vegadeo near Santa Eulalia de Oscos. The forge is reached by crossing the Mazonovo River, a tributary of the Ag√ºeira River. The current owners of the Mazonovo mill date back to the early 19th century. The first mill at Mazonovo was built in 1890. In 1941, a new mill was built on the Cabreira's opposite riverbank to house the mill and powerplant. The original mill, restored in 2003, was then incorporated into the museum. Asturias' director of Biodiversity and Landscape recently gave support to an initiative for natural spawning of trout at Mazonovo. Museum No longer a town, Mazonovo has been converted into a museum by Conjunto Etnogr√°fico de Mazonovo (Joint Mazonovo Ethnography). Known as \\"Museo de los Molinos de Mazonovo\\" (Museum of the Mills of Mazonovo), or \\"Mazonovo, Museo de los Molinos\\", it is dedicated to the mills, both water and manual, that were used for grinding cereal. At one time a maquiladoras, the mills of Mazonovo evolved from prehistoric times until present day. Some of the mills of Mazonovo are reproductions while others are restored originals. In addition, Mazonovo features utensils used by ancient millwrights. Building 1 has hand mills from Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations dating around 3500 BC. It also displays the interior of the gravity mill whose wheel, in diameter, is on the outside. There is also Mazonovo's first mill that used a hydraulic press, a medieval mill that visitors can set in motion, a manual Chinese mill, and a hydraulic Brazilian (Monjolo) mill. Building 2 has a power station for a modern mill running without interruption that can be disassembled to observe the moving parts. It features a glass top and panels with tools. A practical explanation of the operation of the mill's grinding stones is included. A wooden hammer mill, built entirely in oak, is located outside and features a water reservoir. The Al-Bayda mill dates from circa 7000 BC and was found approximately from the Dead Sea. Replicas of windmills from different eras and cultures are also displayed. The museum is not only composed of exhibits, but also allows for visitors to participate in milling activities. Other activities include a workshop to learn how to grind stone.

She is known for her paintings of a woman in white drapings. Markus is a self-taught artist who deploys a realistic painting style.  Expositions  Markus‚Äô first exposition was opened in 1981. In 1995, she opened her own exposition space. In 2003, her 25th anniversary as a painter was celebrated with the release of a book which featured a vast collection of her paintings. Recently, more of her work has been displayed in museums and expositions across Holland. In 2007, 2008, and 2010, her work was displayed in the Noord Brabants Museum, Kunstkerk Bakenes Haarlem Exposition, and Jan Van Der Togt Museum respectively.  Style and Technique  While Markus can be generally defined as a fashion painter, she is more specifically known for her work depicting women in white linen draping. These paintings are crafted using a realistic style, and many of these paintings feature the same woman. Interestingly, many of these works also feature a relationship to animals. In one of these pieces, the woman in drapings appears to have the horns of a ram whereas in another, she has the horns of a bull. Throughout Markus‚Äô collection, this woman can also be seen with scorpions, fish, bugs, and snakes. In all of these paintings featuring the woman in drapes, her head is tightly wound by the draping and her eyes are concealed. Markus has also worked on sculptures which feature a woman whose eyes are concealed by cloth.  Awards  In 2009, Markus was recognized as the Dutch painter of the year.

History   Background  Between June 1998 and March 1999, Randy Savage was on hiatus from WCW while recovering from at least two major knee surgeries. He made one appearance during this period, helping Ric Flair defeat Eric Bischoff for the Presidency of WCW on the December 28, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro. Stephanie Bellars accompanied Savage to the ring on this night, though she was not identified during the program. When Savage returned in April 1999, he debuted a new look and theme music, sporting a slicked back ponytail and a new heel attitude, as well as introducing Bellars as his valet, \\"Gorgeous George\\". His first action was as the guest referee in the main event at Spring Stampede, which was won by Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). For a short time afterward, Savage interfered in DDP's matches to make sure that Page kept the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.  Formation  Savage started feuding with Ric Flair while Gorgeous George started feuding with Flair's biased referee Charles Robinson. When Ric Flair fired Randy Savage, he suggested a \\"my girl against your girl\\" match, pointing at referee Charles Robinson, where the special stipulation would be that if Gorgeous George won, Savage would be reinstated. It was around that time that Madusa and Miss Madness joined Macho Man as his other two valets. Savage asked Miss Madness and Madusa to train Gorgeous George for the match. Behind the scenes, Nora and Madusa trained the other women of WCW at the WCW Power Plant. Gorgeous George had her wrestling match against Robinson at Slamboree on May 9, 1999, during which she used Savage's moves and Robinson mimicked Flair, who was his idol growing up. George pinned Robinson after a diving elbow drop. George was replaced in future matches with Madusa. When Kevin Nash won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship beating DDP at Slamboree, Savage went after the title himself. As part of the storyline, the villainous alliance would interfere in matches for the benefit of Savage. At The Great American Bash, Sid Vicious returned to WCW and helped Savage to attack Kevin Nash. This led to a tag team match at Bash at the Beach between Kevin Nash and Sting against Savage and Sid, in which whoever scored the winning fall would win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Savage won his fourth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship when he pinned Nash. Savage's last reign as champion did not last long. The next night on Nitro, he lost the title to a returning Hollywood Hogan, when Nash interfered and powerbombed Savage.  Separation and beyond  Team Madness slowly started to disband after Madusa and Miss Madness began fighting each other over who was responsible for Savage's title loss. Eventually, Savage fired both of them and started a feud with Dennis Rodman, defeating him at Road Wild using a chain given by Gorgeous George. After the disbandment, the villainous Madusa entered into a tournament for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, but she was defeated and eliminated by Chris Benoit. After her elimination, Madusa put all her focus on managing Evan Karagias, with whom she also formed a romantic relationship.

Early life and education Evers was born and raised in Rugby, Warwickshire. Her father Claude was a housemaster at the Rugby School for boys. Her mother Jessie was a talented water-colourist and instilled a love for the arts in Sybil, who quickly became interested in musical comedy, producing playlets and composing tunes as a child.Ryan, p. 188. Evers trained as a singer at the Royal College of Music.Ryan, p. 189. Career Evers made her professional stage debut on 9 July 1924, as Susan in Ralph Vaughan Williams' Hugh the Drover, a romantic ballad opera in two acts, at the Parry Opera Theatre.Parsons, Charles H. Opera Premieres: An Index of Casts/Performers: A‚ÄìJ, Edwin Mellen Press, 1993, p. 459. In 1927, at Daly's Theatre, she was Nixie in a single performance of The Ladder, a musical fantasy. From March 1930 to September 1931, Evers sang small roles at the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. These included Kate in The Pirates of Penzance, the Lady Saphir in Patience, Leila in Iolanthe, Peep-Bo in The Mikado and Vittoria in The Gondoliers. Occasionally she substituted for Marjorie Eyre in the larger mezzo-soprano roles of Tessa in The Gondoliers and Mad Margaret in Ruddigore.Stone, David. Sybil Evers , Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 28 January 2002, accessed 8 November 2009 Following her stint with D'Oyly Carte, Evers often alternated between the Webber-Douglas and the Chanticleer opera companies. She appeared in operettas, operas and plays in a variety of London venues. In 1934 she entertained the seven-year-old Princess Elizabeth at the Cambridge Theatre in Ever So Long Ago, a children's play by Brian Hill and Laura Wildig; the piece was reportedly the first play seen by the princess. At the Open Air Theatre in 1934, she played the Lady in Milton's Comus.Agate, James. More First Nights, New York: Benjamin Blom, 1937, p. 27. The Times wrote, \\"Miss Sybil Evers ... was the very incarnation of Milton's idea of the queen-hood of innocence, and her first entrance onto an empty stage was pure beauty.\\"Ryan, p. 190. In the mid-1930s, Evers also sang Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. One reviewer noted, \\"Figaro being what it is, a combination of 'opera buffa' and sophisticated comedy of manners, those who perform it must be able not only to sing well but also to act well. ... For Susanna we have Miss Sybil Evers and she is entrancing.

The number of Christians of all denominations in the Congo is estimated at over 63 million by the Pew Research Center, a figure representing approximately 95.7 percent of the national population or 2.9 percent of the world's Christians. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism which represents 50 percent of the national population, and is followed by Protestantism (20 percent) and Kimbanguism (10 percent) and other sects. The history of Christianity in the area of the modern-day Congo is closely linked to the history of European colonial expansion. History Congolese converts to Protestantism with white missionaries at the Congo-Balolo Mission, 1889 The earliest evidence for the adoption of Christian religious practices in the area of the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo dates to the late 15th century. In 1491, King Nzinga of the Kongo Kingdom converted to Roman Catholicism, taking the Christian name Jo√£o, after coming into contact with Portuguese colonial explorers. The conversion facilitated trade with the Portuguese and increased the status of the Kongo Kingdom in the eyes of European states. Afonso I (1506‚Äì43) even travelled to Europe where he studied religion. The Kongo Kingdom adopted a form of Catholicism and was recognised by the Papacy, preserving the beliefs for nearly 200 years. The largest expansion of Christianity occurred under Belgian colonial rule. In 1885, Belgium's monarch, Leopold II, established a personal colony in Central Africa known as the Congo Free State which, in 1908, was annexed by Belgium as the Belgian Congo. Under both the Free State and Belgian regimes, Christian missions were encouraged to work in the Congo as part of the civilising mission which served as the colonial project's justification to European public opinion. Missionaries played an important role in providing schooling during the colonial period. Catholic mission, for example, helped to establish the Congo's first university, Lovanium, in 1954. In the post-independence period, distrust between the Churches and the state grew, exacerbated in the early 1970s by attempts by the new Zairean government to secularise education. Since 2014, sporadic outbreaks of violence against Christians have occurred in North Kivu as part of the ongoing Kivu conflict. Massacres of approximately 645 people have been perpetrated by the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces rebel group which has been largely forced out of neighbouring Uganda. By denomination Catholicism For much of the colonial period, Catholic missions received preferential treatment and a subsidy from the state denied to missions from other denominations. In 2016, the CIA World Factbook estimated that 50 percent of the Congo's total population were Roman Catholic. The Pew Research Centre provides the estimate of 47.3 percent or over 31 million people, or 2.8 percent of the world's Catholic population. Protestantism The first Protestant mission in the Congo was sent by the British Baptist Missionary Society and arrived in 1878, shortly before the creation of the Congo Free State. Throughout the colonial period, Protestant missions maintained a difficult relationship with the colonial authorities. Most Belgian officials were Catholics and distrusted Protestant missionaries, which were often foreigners from the United Kingdom or the United States, but were unable to expel them under the terms of the Berlin Conference. In 2016, it was estimated that 20 percent of the Congo's population were Protestant, excluding Kimbanguists. The Pew Center provides a considerably higher estimate the number of Protestants (including Kimbanguists) at nearly 32 million or 48 percent of the population, representing 4 percent of the world's Protestants. Kimbanguism Kimbanguists in Nkamba, the spiritual centre of the sect, in Bas-Congo Kimbanguism, officially the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth by His Special Envoy Simon Kimbangu, is a major Christian new religious movement indigenous to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It holds that Simon Kimbangu (1887‚Äì1951) was a prophet but shares commonalities with Baptist Christianity. It is headquartered in Nkamba, Kongo Central which was Kimbangu's birthplace and is known as \\"New Jerusalem\\". It is estimated that as many as 10 percent of the Congo's population are followers. Others The Pew Center estimates the Congo's population of \\"Other Christians\\" at 260,000. Fewer than 0.1 percent of the population are Orthodox Christians. Chrysostomos Papasarantopoulos was notably influential in spreading Orthodox Christianity in the Congo over 1970‚Äì1972.

Begun in 1904 and completed in 1915, it is dedicated to the Virgin of Los Remedios (patron of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna and the island of Tenerife). The cathedral is the mother church of the diocese, which includes the islands of Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. It is therefore where the episcopal seat of the bishop of this diocese, currently occupied by Bishop Bernardo √Ålvarez Afonso. This is one of the most important churches of the Canary Islands.Historia de la Di√≥cesis Nivariense ‚Äì in Spanish The Cathedral of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna is located in the city of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna (Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain). In the cathedral lie the remains of Alonso Fernandez de Lugo, conqueror of the island and founder of the city. The cathedral is located in the historic center of the city of La Laguna, and was declared a World Heritage Site in 1999 by UNESCO. The cathedral contains elements of several architectural styles including Neoclassical and Neo-Gothic. The most representative elements of the Cathedral of La Laguna are its Neoclassical facade, inspired by the Cathedral of Pamplona, and the dome, which stands out prominently in the city landscape.  History   Primitive temples  Interior of the cathedral In 1511, a hermitage was erected on the site of the current Plaza de Fray Albino edifice. It was built by order of the conquistador, Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo. The area appears to have been an ancient Guanche necropolis. It is also known that the whole valley of Aguere (in which the city lies), especially the large lake that was in this place, was a place of pilgrimage for the indigenous people of the island.La Laguna. La ciudad de los sentidos This primitive chapel was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary in her Expectation, which is celebrated every 18 December.Datos hist√≥ricos del templo catedral de Tenerife The chapel was replaced in 1515 with a major construction dedicated to the Virgin of Los Remedios in the Mud√©jar architectural style, to which a tower was added in 1618. It was on 21 April 1515, when the site rose to the level of parish with the name \\"Santa Maria de los Remedios\\". The feast day of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary is celebrated on 8 September. That same year, the Portuguese mason Miguel Alonso built the main chapel, the main arch, the altar, the stands, the tabernacle and the door of the sacristy, all made of stone. On 7 April 1534, Saint Jos√© de Anchieta was baptized in the church. He was born in the city of La Laguna, became a missionary, and later became the founder of the city of Sao Paulo and one of the founders of Rio de Janeiro, both in Brazil.La Catedral custodia una reliquia de Anchieta Precisely the cathedral is the diocesan shrine of the saint in the Canary Islands. In 1752 a new transept was built, the main chapel vestries were widened and spacious dressing rooms were added for the image of the patron saint, the Virgen de los Remedios. Don Domingo de la Guerra, who directed the work and was later Marqu√©s de San Andr√©s, extended the main chapel, because he hoped that one day the temple would become the Cathedral of Tenerife.  Cathedral  Several times since the old chapel was converted into a parish in 1515, there were attempts to have it be designated a cathedral, collegiate, or auxiliary cathedral dependent on the Cathedral of Santa Ana of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, with some of the members of the Canary Cathedral Chapter residing in the Church of Los Remedios. These initial applications were not successful. In 1783, at the height of the Enlightenment (La Laguna was the center of this movement in the Canary Islands), a request was made for designation as a diocese to be located in the Church of Los Remedios but the request was received with suspicion by members of the Cathedral Chapter and the Bishop of Gran Canaria, and the establishment of an ecclesiastical institution on this island was again rejected.La Di√≥cesis de San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna en los inicios del siglo XIX: el Obispo Folgueras Si√≥n, el Cabildo Catedral y la jurisdicci√≥n eclesi√°stica Finally, on 1 February 1819, a papal bull approved the division of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias in two dioceses. The temple became a cathedral in 1819 by bull of Pope Pius VII, and the new diocese of La Laguna was created. The Diocese of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna includes the islands of Tenerife, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In obtaining the title of cathedral and the creation of the Diocese it had an important role priest Crist√≥bal Bencomo y Rodr√≠guez, confessor of King Ferdinand VII of SpainObispos canarios.

His tomb is now in the presbytery of the Cathedral of La Laguna, next to the Epistle.Biograf√≠a de Crist√≥bal Bencomo y Rodr√≠guez At the time the building was constructed and dedicated as a cathedral, the capital of the island was the city of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, which is why the cathedral was built there and not in the current capital of the island (Santa Cruz de Tenerife). The diocesan headquarters still remains in San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna. On 5 October 1983, the Cathedral of La Laguna was declared a National Historic-Artistic Monument in Spain. During the time of the suppression of the Bishopric of Tenerife (between 1851-1875) as a result of the Concordat of 1851, the Cathedral of La Laguna lost its cathedral title, becoming the collegiate church and being the only collegiate church that has existed in the Canary Islands. With the restoration of the diocese in 1875, the temple regains its status as a cathedral church with all the ecclesiastical privileges it enjoyed previously.Patrimonio e historia de la antigua Catedral de La Laguna. The cathedral is also a parish and a Marian shrine, as the Virgin of Los Remedios is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna and the island of Tenerife. There is some expectation that this church will be declared a minor basilica by the Holy See in the near future.  Restoration 2002‚Äì2014  Dome of the cathedral In 2002 the cathedral was closed to worship for a meticulous restoration, with the intention of reopening a few years later. However, due to bureaucratic disagreements, the cathedral remained closed for more than a decade. During the pre-restoration study, it had been discovered that the main dome and vaults were so damaged that the only viable solution was the demolition of these elements and their subsequent reconstruction. The new vaults and domes were built with a new material, polypropylene fiber, making the cathedral the first in the world to use this material. Finally, the doors were reopened on 25 January 2014, to be reopened to worship on 31 January of that year. To mark the centenary and the reopening of the cathedral, a Jubilee Year was heldA√±o jubilar con ocasi√≥n del Centenario de la Catedral de la Laguna y su reapertura al culto from 27 April 2014, until 12 April 2015, both dates coinciding with the Divine Mercy Sunday. That Jubilee was decreed by a special mandate of Pope Francis, with the chance of winning the faithful a plenary indulgence. During the remodeling, which included Cathedral Square in 2014, archaeological remains were discovered underground. Some evidence was unearthed in the rubble that suggested it belonged to the ancient Church of Los Remedios or to structures from the first European settlement in the city.El Ayuntamiento contrata un estudio de la plaza de la Catedral con georradares Later, in 2018 human remains of the XVI century were discovered in the place. One thinks that in the place the old parochial cemetery was located.Santana apuesta por mantener a la vista la excavaci√≥n de la Catedral  Architecture  The Neoclassical front dates back to 1820. The current building was constructed between 1904 and 1915 and is in the Neo-Gothic style. The cathedral has three wide aisles and an ambulatory (unique in the Canary Islands) that surrounds the chancel, or altar. These elements give the interior of the cathedral a typical medieval European feel in contrast to the colonial style of the exterior. The cathedral's large dome is topped by a large concrete cross. It is in height, which makes it the highest point in the old town. The vaults are topped by small windows that let in natural light. The dome is covered with copper plates, imitating the cathedrals of central and northern Europe.

Today, the altarpiece of the Immaculate is already restored. The sculpture Our Lady of Light (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Luz) is in this chapel, dating from the mid-sixteenth century. This image has been attributed to the sculptor working environment Roque Balduque,La Virgen de la Luz de la Catedral de La Laguna (Tenerife) en el arte sevillano del siglo XVI for its resemblance to the works of the Sevillian sculptor of Flemish origin, among which is the image of Our Lady of Evangelization venerated in the Cathedral of Lima (Peru).

Her feast is celebrated on 8 September. The altarpiece of the Our Lady of Remedies is in a chapel in the transept of the cathedral and is the largest altarpiece in the Canary Islands. It is a great Baroque altarpiece from the first half of the eighteenth century, with an impressive set of seven panels attributed to Hendrick Van Balen, Van Dyck's teacher. The image of the Virgin of Los Remedios is located in the central niche and is adorned in rich robes and dresses. It is located in a spectacular canopy over a silver throne, with a sunburst of the same framing material and a golden crescent moon at her feet.  Other artworks  Inside there is a pulpit of Carraran Italian marble carved by Pasquale Bocciardo (considered the best work done in marble of the Canary Islands), and part of Mazuelos's Altarpiece. In addition, there are valuable works by Crist√≥bal Hern√°ndez de Quintana, Luj√°n P√©rez and Fernando Est√©vez. Also inside the cathedral is the image of Christ of Los Remedios, which is considered the twin of Cristo de La Laguna. This image is located on the marble tabernacle of the main altar. The image dates from the sixteenth century and is by an unknown artist. The temple also houses a large canvas with the theme The Souls of Purgatory by the painter Crist√≥bal Hern√°ndez de Quintana, and a painting of the Last Supper, the work of Juan de Miranda. Inside the cathedral the relics of the martyrs are preserved: Saint Aurelio de C√≥rdoba, Saint Faustino, Saint Venusto and Saint Amado Nusco, plus a piece of the mantle of Saint Ferdinand and a bone of James the Less. But the most important relics of the cathedral are those belonging to the two saints of the Canary Islands, Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur and Jos√© de Anchieta. The Treasure of the Cathedral of La Laguna covers a period from the 16th century to the present. While most of the pieces correspond to the 17th century and 18th century.Tallas, joyas y ropas, tesoros de la Catedral This treasure is the set pieces goldsmith largest of the Canary Islands,La Catedral prepara la exposici√≥n del tesoro y visitas con audiogu√≠a among which two silver candlesticks are the largest in Spain, among many other pieces.

Music chapel attached to the cathedral was created. He served as choirmaster composer Miguel Jurado Bustamante born in Cadiz.M√∫sica del Siglo XIX para la Catedral de La Laguna Among the major composers of the cathedral include: Remigio Oliva, Manuel Fragoso and Nicol√°s Gonz√°lez. Choir of the Cathedral of La Laguna The musical production of Miguel Jurado Bustamante covers all genres of religious music in Latin (masses, motets, psalms, Magnificats, hymns, litanies, lamentations, responses and antiphons dedicated to the Virgin Mary) and Castilian (carols). Some 140 works have been located thus far by this composer, representing a large output. Miguel Jurado trained other local musicians, the most important of whom was Domingo Crisanto Delgado G√≥mez, one of the most famous composers from the Canaries in the nineteenth century, who in 1836 would become the first organist of the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista of Puerto Rico. Crisanto's production is predominantly vocal and choral, not only a cappella but also with accompaniment of organ, piano or instrumental group. Finally, another great composer who worked at the cathedral was Domingo Herrera Guill√©n, of whom only a single work is preserved.  Chapter house and icons museum  The chapter house is home to the Cathedral Chapter, also called the Chapter of Canons, which constitutes the corporation of priests responsible to serve in cult of the Cathedral and its religious and cultural activities.

It houses the icons museum, which contains the largest collection of Byzantine icons of Spain,La mayor colecci√≥n espa√±ola de iconos bizantinos se exhibe en La Laguna with 160 original pieces that are mostly about 300 years old. These artworks are owned by the Diocese of Tenerife and come mainly from countries such as Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Italy and Greece. These pieces came to Tenerife through private donations to the bishopric and through merchants who arrived in the Canary Islands.

Biography Raymond Couraud was born 12 January 1920 at Surg√®res, Charente-Maritime, France. Little is known of his early life, or education. French Foreign Legion On 19 March 1938, Couraud joined the French Foreign Legion under his real name, but with a birth date of 12 January 1916 in Namur, Belgium. This would have made him 22 and old enough to join, whereas he was actually just over 18 and too young. After training, on 3 March 1940, he was assigned to the 5th Company of the 13th Brigade. With this unit he took part in the Battles of Narvik, for which he won the Croix de Guerre with palm, for dislodging two enemy soldiers with a grenade attack: Returning to France, Courard found a France in turmoil, in July 1940 he joined retreating French Forces in Fuveau, near Marseille. After the unit was decimated in action, while trying to reach England, Couraud was captured and imprisoned in August 1940 at Fort Saint Nicolas. Acquitted before a military tribunal in December 1940, he was released by the Vichy government. Marseille and Mary Jayne Gold On release, Couraud joined the new French economy by becoming a gangster, arranging importation, trading, distribution and export of illegal goods and people. It was through this activity that he was introduced to American socialite Mary Jayne Gold, who had chosen to relocate from Paris to the new Vichy controlled area, over returning home. In Marseilles, Gold met American art student Miriam Davenport, and American journalist and intellect Varian Fry, who had come to France on a personal mission to help members of Europe's intellectual and artistic community escape the Nazi threat. The three became the core of a volunteer group who sheltered artistic refugees, and through Couraud organized their escape through the mountains to Spain, or smuggling them aboard freighters sailing to North Africa, or ports in North or South America. Through the organisation, Couraud and Gold started a relationship. Gold helped subsidize the organisation, which is credited with the rescue of over 2,000 refugees, among whom were: sculptor Jacques Lipchitz; artist Marc Chagall; writer Hannah Arendt; Nobel Prize winner Otto Meyerhof. While Gold remained in Marseille until Autumn 1941, in April 1941 Couraud crossed the Pyrenees with the aim of reporting to the British Consulate in Barcelona. Arrested at Madrid railway station, he was interned for four months in Miranda. Meanwhile, due to criminal activity and associated smuggling of people, he was sentenced by a military court in Marseille to 10 years in prison. SOE: Jack William Raymond Lee On arrival in England on 12 October 1941, Couraud joined the Free French Forces. He was immediately assigned to the Action militaire section of the Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action (English: Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations; commonly referred as just BCRA), the World War II era forerunner of the SDECE French intelligence service. Couraud was assigned to Colonel Maurice Buckmaster's section of the Special Operations Executive, which covered all of France. After specialist training, in December 1941, Couraud was commissioned as second-Lieutenant Jack William Raymond Lee. Name changes were not uncommon during the war, as various people and particularly criminals tried to hide their past while fighting what they saw as a true fight. St Nazaire Raid In January to February 1942, Couraud continued his SOE training with a combination of formal courses, including parachuting; to night training on British Southcoast beaches, and reconnaissance raids on northern French beaches from Normandy to Loire-Atlantique. On 28 March, Couraud became the only French national to participate in the Lord Mountbatten-led British Commandos raid on St. Nazaire, intended to deny the Tirpitz any base on the Atlantic Ocean. Couraud escaped, but was wounded in both legs. He recovered in Falmouth Hospital from April to July 1942. Couraud returned to operations with SOE in August 1942,with a beach raid near Cannes. In November 1942, in an operation near Narbonne, he felt obliged to kill three Vichy policemen. Escaping through the Pyrenees, he made his way to Barcelona, and then onwards to Lisbon, Portugal for return to England. 2nd SAS Regiment Because of repeated indiscretions and security breaches throughout the year 1942, Raymond Couraud is dismissed from the S.O.Es in January 1943 but recommended for transfer to a commando unit. He then joins the 62nd Commando under the command of Colonel Bill Stirling, the elder brother of SAS founder Colonel David Stirling. Assigned to Stirling's No.62 Commando, the unit later became 2nd regiment of SAS, a designated Small Scale Raiding Force. Based at the regimental HQ in Philippeville, Algeria, over the following 14 months the group undertook various raids into occupied Europe and North Africa: *Ousseltia front *Airports in southern Tunisia, with 21 aircraft destroyed on the ground at Metlaoui *Sea born operation on the Galite Islands *Sea born operation on Lampedusa *Submarine operation on airfields in Sardinia SAS, French 2nd Squadron In March 1943, after a meeting General Alphonse Juin, Stirling took 50 French soldiers out of 2 SAS to form the 2 SAS, French 2nd Squadron under Couraud, under his new title of Captain Lee. The squadron consisted of Couraud as captain and commander, three British lieutenants, two French officers (Lieutenant Robert Sablet, Raillard and Aspiring), and French soldiers, with a large proportion of former Legionnaires. In May 1943, taking advantage of the Churchill Act of 1940, Couraud took British citizenship. In September 1943, in Operation Slapstick the Allied assault on Taranto, French 2nd Squadron undertook initial reconnaissance. After the landings, they destroyed a large Wehrmacht convoy in the area of Chieti, and then harassed German units as they withdrew to Sangro via the advancing front. After further raids and operations on the Italian mainland, in April 1944 the unit withdrew for recuperation in Scotland. Operation Gaff After Couraud returned to the UK, he was commanded to set up a specialist six-man assassination unit in preparation for D-Day and the Invasion of Europe, which would target high- ranking Nazi Wehrmacht staff. From March 1943, British Intelligence had been trying to find Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's headquarters in France. Part of the brief looked at creating a timetable for Rommel, to assess how easy it would be to kill him. Much as though he had been against the plan pre-D-Day, with manpower losses escalating Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery approved the plan post D-Day, even though they still didn't know where Rommel's base was. In a bizarre coincidence, on 9 June SAS Lieutenant General was heading for a meeting with a French Resistance unit. Resting in a barn, he was approached by a man who lived in La Roche-Guyon, asking for assurances that as Rommel's headquarters was in the village, that the Royal Air Force would not bomb them. On learning of the location of Rommel's HQ, Couraud and his unit were moved to a flat in London, to wait for a storm to pass and be parachuted into Orl√©ans.Daring missions of World War II by William B. Breuer Arriving on 18 July, the team radioed in, but found that Rommel had been severely injured the previous day after his staff car had been over turned in an attack by RAF Hawker Typhoons, and replaced by G√ºnther von Kluge. Couraud and his team orders regarding Rommel were aborted, and they moved toward advancing US Army lines on foot, while ambushing trains and attacking German units along their route. After an attack on the German Command at Mantes, Couraud disguised as a policeman made his way through the judicial police of Pontchartrain, and joined the American 3rd Army of General George S. Patton on 12 August. Post August 1944 After Operation Gaff, Couraud was assigned as second in command of 2 SAS under Roy Farran. Split into two teams starting from Orl√©ans and Rennes, the teams met up near Langres, where they built an SAS field operations base. Returning to England in September 1944, with the liberation of France, Couraud left the British Army in December 1944. He returned to France to become part of the French Army General Staff. Later memorial In Varian Fry's later movie Crossroads Marseille, Couraud is referred to as \\"The Killer\\", due to his murder of the English language.

Independent financing was raised; actors Anthony Stewart Head, Lindsay Felton, and Tanya Roberts were attached to star in the film; and Roddy Bottum (from the band Faith No More) came aboard to provide the musical score. However, before production began, the September 11 attacks occurred, and investors, sensitive to the controversial nature of the screenplay, pulled out, causing the project to be shelved. In 2004, Lost Colony produced an independently-financed feature film entitled Communication Breakdown. The film's premise involved a faceless conglomerate taking over an indie radio station as the station employees struggled to maintain their jobs and their sanity. Described by director Richard O'Sullivan as a tribute to the John Hughes movies of the 1980s, the entire film took place over several hours ala The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles. \\"I always wondered what it would've been like to follow the Brat Pack as they got older,\\" said O'Sullivan. \\"To see them with real jobs in the real world but still trying to hold on to whatever it was that made them who they were.\\" In 2006, Lost Colony produced an unsold comedy pilot called Traveling Man.

Each player uses a specialized racquet that is strung to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over a net into the opponent's court.  Definition of tennis  * Exercise - bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health or wellness. ** Aerobic exercise - physical exercise that intends to improve the oxygen system.Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition) Aerobic means \\"with oxygen\\", and refers to the use of oxygen in the body's energy- generating process (the citric acid cycle). * Game - structured activity, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more concerned with the expression of ideas. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional sports). ** Ball game - a game played with a ball. There are many kinds of ball games, racquet-and-ball games being just one category of them. * Sport - form of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical fitness and provide entertainment to participants. ** Racquet sport - a sport in which players use racquets (or rackets) to hit a ball or other object. ** One-on-one sport - ** Competitive sport - sport in which one or more participants or teams compete against one another. The one that is the most successful in achieving the objective of the game or sport event is the winner. ** Team sport ‚Äì sport that involves players working together towards a shared objective. ** Recreational sport ‚Äì sport engaged in as a leisure time activity. ** Spectator sport ‚Äì sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches. Spectator sports are a form of entertainment. ** Professional sport ‚Äì sport in which the athletes receive payment for their performance.  Types of tennis   Types of tennis matches  Types of tennis match * Standard matches - are played in official tournaments and during casual play. ** Singles - two players compete, usually two men or two women, although games between a man and a woman may be played on an informal basis. Singles matches do not include the part of the tennis court called the alley. ** Doubles - two teams of two players each, most often all-male or all-female. The two players on the receiving side change positions after each point played: one at the net and the other near the baseline preparing to return serve. The full court is used in doubles matches, that is, the area in the alley is included. ** Mixed doubles - same as doubles, but with one man and one woman on each team. * Other informal matches ** Canadian doubles - two players play against one player, where the duo can only hit the ball within the single player's singles lines. Often used for training, or when the single player is much better than the other two.  Types of tennis games  Tennis games Besides standard tennis, other forms of tennis include: = Games to practice skills for singles matches = * One Ball Live - eight players, with two on a side at a time, with two balls active initially. * Tag Team Singles * King of the Court * Champs and Chumps * On-Off Singles *Hospital *Canoe = Games to practice skills for doubles matches = * Team Doubles - * All Position Doubles - * King of the Court Doubles - * Rush N' Crush - * Triples - * Monkey in the Middle - * Deep Desperation - * Wipe Out - * Around the World - * Touch the Curtain -  Equipment used in the game  Tennis technology * Tennis ball - hollow rubber ball approximately 6.7 cm (2.7 in.) in diameter, covered in bright green-yellow fibrous fluffy felt.

There are two alleys, one on the Ad side and one on the Deuce side. These are only used when playing doubles. *** Back court - area between the baseline and the service line, also called no man's land. It is not recommended to stand in this area because this is where balls usually bounce. *** Baseline - line marking the end of the court, at the back of the back court and the alleys. *** Center line - line dividing the two service boxes in the center of the court. *** Center mark - 12-inch mark at the halfway point of the baseline used to distinguish the right and left halves of a tennis court. *** Deuce court - right side of the receiving team, the left side of the opponent's court as viewed from the server's side, significant as the receiving side for a deuce point. *** Middle T - See T. *** Net - *** Service box - area bordered by the net, the singles sideline, the service line, and the center line. There are a left and a right service box on each side of the court, separated by the center line. *** Service line - line located between the net and the baseline, parallel to the net, marking the end of the service boxes. *** Side T - T-shape formed by the service line and the sideline.

A match consists of best of three sets or, only on the men's side, the best of five in grand slams and Davis Cup play. Doubles matches are usually the best of three sets, with the third set being played in a match tie break form. ** Sets - a maximum of 12 games, unless a player or team reach 6 or 7 games and are clear by two. If the set gets to 6-all then a tie breaker is played *** Games - which are the first to four points and clear by two, and a maximum of 12 games make up a set. **** Tie break - In regular play if the scores reach 6 all then a tie break is played. It is played to the first to seven points and must be won by at least two points. If not then play continues until one player is two points ahead. ***** Points - Points are a passages of play which players win points to make a game. The scoring is based on a clock face. The scoring is fifteen, thirty, forty five (although this was shortened to forty to make it easier for the umpire) and game. However, if the players are tied at 40-all, otherwise known as deuce, then a player must win two points consecutively from deuce to win the game.  Game play   Tennis moves  = Tennis shots = Tennis shots There are eight basic shots in the game of tennis: # Serve - a shot to start a point. A player begins a serve by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the highest point of the toss) into the diagonally opposite service box without being stopped by the net. #* Ace - a legal serve that is not touched by the receiver. Aces are usually powerful and generally land on or near one of the corners at the back of the service box. # Forehand - shot made by swinging the racquet across one's body in the direction of where the player wants to place the shot. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. # Backhand - shot in which one swings the racquet around one's body in the direction where one wants the ball to go, usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot. The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke. # Volley - # Half volley - (pick-up ball) # Overhead smash - # Drop shot - # Lob -  Strategy and styles of play  Tennis strategy Players are often described by their style of play: * Offensive baseliner - * Defensive baseliner - * Serve-and- volleyer - * All-court player - Doubles strategies include: * Both-up strategy - * Up-and-back strategy - * Both-back strategy -  History of tennis  History of tennis Governing bodies International * Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) - principal organizing body to protect men's professional tennis. * Women's Tennis Association (WTA) - principal organizing body to protect women's professional tennis. * International Tennis Federation (ITF) - principal organizing body to protect professional tennis.

Discovery and naming The genus was named in 1995 from fossils found from the Placerias quarry of the Chinle Group in Apache County, Arizona. It was named after the paleontologist J. Michael Parrish, with the type species being P. mccreai. Parrishia was distinguished from the closely related genus Hesperosuchus on the basis of more robust vertebral centra and the lack of dorsoventrally offset articular faces of the cervical centra, thus causing the neck to be straight rather than anterodorsally curved as in Hesperosuchus. In their description of a new crocodylomorph skeleton from the famous Whitaker quarry in Ghost Ranch, Clark et al. (2000) treated Parrishia as a nomen dubium because they considered the holotype and referred specimens undiagnostic. More complete postcranial skeletons such as PEFO 26681 have been found that clearly show that the cervical centra of Parrishia possess articular faces that are dorsoventrally offset as in Hesperosuchus. Additionally, in the holotype specimen (UCMP A269/139623) the anterior surfaces of the centa are positioned more dorsally than the posterior surfaces, giving the neck an anterodorsal curve like Hesperosuchus. Therefore, the only distinguishing character that distinguishes Parrishia from Hesperosuchus is the robustness of the vertebrae. Material from Parrishia cannot be assigned to any other known sphenosuchian genus because of the lack of postcranial apomorphies; as a result, it is considered an indeterminate genus. In an SVP 2018 conference abstract, William Parker and colleagues reported the discovery of new specimens indicating that Parrishia represents a phytosaur and not a crocodylomorph.

Synopsis Two German deserters, Kriegsmarine Ensign Bruno Grauber (Franco Nero) and Army Corporal Reiner Schultz (Larry Aubrey) are captured by the Canadian Army at the end of World War II. They are interned in a Canadian-run POW camp where the senior German officer, Colonel Von Bleicher, is a career officer. Their fellow German prisoners of war, led by Von Bleicher, discover that they are deserters. They are put through a formal military court martial organised by Von Bleicher and charged with cowardice. They are sentenced to death and are to be executed on the \\"fifth day of peace\\". Von Bleicher pressures the Canadian camp commandant to allow the execution to be carried out and requests rifles and ammunition to carry out the sentence. A Canadian general, Snow, persuades (but does not order) the Canadian camp commandant, Captain Miller, to allow the execution to be carried out for the higher purpose of preserving military discipline. He also motivates Miller with a promotion to major. This movie is based on the true story of two German sailors, leading seaman Bruno Dorfer and machinist's mate Rainer Beck, both executed for desertion on May 13, 1945, after being found guilty of cowardice by fellow POWs. The sentence was carried out by German POWs who were under Canadian command. Casting * Bud Spencer as Cpl. Jelinek * Richard Johnson as Capt. John Miller * Franco Nero as Ens.

He was born in the small midlands town of Estcourt, South Africa. Education Sahajananda did well in school, from primary through secondary and college, always gaining firsts. He was highly ambitious in the pursuit of his academic career, but Sivananda Saraswati, founder of the Divine Life Society movement worldwide, had other plans in store for him and his intervention came at the appropriate time. Sahajananda attempted to finish his PhD, but got only a second class pass as a result of doing poorly on the geometry portion of his final exams. He got a teacher's certificate instead. Beginning of his divinity career During his first year of teaching, he came across the Sivananda's book, Practice of Karma Yoga, and took it up, giving up sports and ambition in his teaching career in exchange for pursuit of this religion. In 1948 he gave up his teaching post and went to India to meet Sivananda. He was not qualified to reside at the Ashram and returned to South Africa. Sivananda readily gave consent, adding, \\"The qualities will come\\". The only instruction Sahajananda received from Sivananda during this visit was: \\"learn to type and to make tea!\\" The youthful seeker accepted the advice passively. Only years later did Sahajananda understand that Sivananda's cryptic words were pregnant with deep spiritual meaning‚Äîit was dissemination of spiritual knowledge through his literature, and service of the underprivileged. Return to South Africa Returning to South Africa, Sahajananda took up a teaching post at the FOSA (Friends of Sick Association) TB Settlement, teaching in the school and serving the sick in the wards. It was during this time that Sivananda wrote to him with a request to start a branch of Divine Life Society in South Africa. Being nervous and shy by temperament, and unaccustomed to any kind of organisational work, Sahajananda felt quite incompetent to undertake the task, and did not respond to his letter. Sivananda wrote a second letter dated 18 October 1949, requesting him to open a branch. Sahajananda was now in a fix, and thought that since he was a disciple, he should obey and forwarded the affiliation fee to register the branch. Sivananda was evidently impatient to get the branch opened, for before the affiliation fee could reach him, Sivananda sent a third letter, dated 11 November 1949, requesting a branch to be opened. Thus began the saga of Divine Life Society of South Africa. Sahajananda commenced with publishing Sivananda's writings and disseminating the literature (funding it himself), as well as conducting prayer services. He worked as a teacher and print the literature in the evenings together with a few devotees. They worked long hours, sometimes working until the early hours of the morning. They led a hard life, sleeping on the bare cement floor with newspapers as mattresses. Bricks served as pillows. Sahajananda recounted, \\"It was not that I was practising some kind of austerity. It was just that I wished to offer every spare cent of my income to the promotion of my Master's Mission.\\" In 1956 Sahajananda visited Sivananda and Sivanananda initiated him into the holy Order of Sannyas. At his farewell function, Sivananda said: \\"Swami Sahajananda is styled as the spiritual king of South Africa, Durban. He is also called African Chota Guru. He does not want anything. He is a silent worker. He is a man of renunciation, Vairagya (dispassion) and meditation. He is a very good organiser. He talks little. You have never seen him talking. He thinks much and does much. Such a spiritual Yogi is he. His devotion to his teacher is unique. He has a pure heart. So let us pray for the health of this small Yogi, full of strength. One who can transform the materialistic intellect of the whole of South Africa‚Äîwhat tremendous purity, what tremendous Yogic power, what tremendous meditation, spiritual aura and selfless aura!\\" Sahajananda returned to South Africa and served the spiritual and social needs of the country. His selflessness, love, kindness, high level of ethics, meticulousness, and strict discipline drew thousands to devotees to him. He wrote spiritual books. For the underprivileged and disadvantaged of South Africa, Sahajananda has undertaken over 300 projects that include schools, hospitals, clinics, cr√®ches, old age homes, children's homes, technical colleges, hydroponic gardening tunnels, sewing centres, feeding schemes, peace and skills training centres, low-cost housing, and more. Many of the projects are in rural areas where access to such facilities are scarce. For this humanitarian work, Sahajananda received numerous local and international awards, including the Martin Luther King Jnr. Peace Award from the Centre for Non-violent Social Change in Atlanta, USA, and from statesmen including the South African President, Dr Jacob Zuma, past Premiers of the Province of KwaZulu Natal, Mayors of district and local municipalities, the King and Prince of the Zulu Nation, etc. In 2008, in recognising Sahajananda for his efforts of uplifting the people of South Africa, the University of KwaZulu Natal posthumously conferred upon Sahajananda the Honorary Degree, Doctor of Theology, honoris causa. Sahajananda brought the teachings of Sivananda to the people of South Africa and the world. Sahajananda did not preach these teachings, he lived them. His entire life was an example of kindness, love, obedience, dedication and devotion to God and the Guru. Sahajananda built numerous ashrams (Hindu prayer centres) and provided the facilities to take people towards God. Worth mentioning are the Divine Life Society's headquarters‚ÄîSivanandashram, Reservoir Hills, and the Sivananda International Cultural Centre (or SICC), Sivananda Nagar, La Mercy, KwaZulu Natal. SICC is probably one of the largest Hindu spiritual centres in the southern hemisphere. Everyone that visits the place comments on the peace and bliss experienced there. The comment invariably made is that the place is \\"heaven on earth\\". Sahajananda had attracted around him a large congregation of devotees devoted to Sivananda. He never allowed himself to be worshipped and encouraged all to direct their devotion to Sivananda. He attributed all success of Divine Life society of South Africa to the Grace of Sivananda. For over 50 years, Sahajananda worked in the service of Sivananda. But this did not stop him from performing his spiritual practises. Sahajananda spent long hours in silent meditation. Death Sahajananda died on 10 December 2007, after a short illness. News of his death spread to all corners of the world from Swamis, statesmen, devotees, etc. His body lay in state the day of the 10th and throughout the night, allowing people to pay their final respects to him. His final request was for his body to be cremated and his sacred ashes to be immersed in the holy waters of Mother Ganga. Before his death, Sahajananda had trained persons in every facet of the Society's work, and put in place a Board of Management to manage the affairs of the Society, so that the Divine work he had begun would continue into the future.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Based on O.V. Vijayan's story of the same name, this is the story of Krishnan Unni and his wart. Krishnan Unni is a landlord living happily with his wife and son. He comes from a family that is well respected in the village. But things have changed now; labourers are no more the bonded slaves who used to bend over for their landlords. Krishnan Unni still lives in the past glory days and refuses to change with time. The story takes a \\"Kafkaish\\" turn when a wart in his face takes a life of its own. What happens to Krishnan Unni forms the rest of the story. The wart is a metaphor for the burden of old customs and traditions. Krishnan Unni, who is well rooted in the old traditional ways, refuses to change with the times. He refuses to get surgery on the wart, but tries to cure it with old way of herbal medicine. The lesson here is if one doesn't change with time, the old customs and blind faith will become a burden and, if one persists in them, there will be a time when they will take over, meaning all of a person's decisions will be based on how they traditionally did it or what the old scriptures or astrological charts dictate. After a while these old traditions and customs, will be taken out as something personal to an individual or a group and would be associated with god, it would be made into something holy. Now everybody has to do it as it is divine. Murali in the end shows how the wart which was growing in him escapes from Krishnan Unni and becomes a huge elephant. There are a bunch of priests who are looking at the elephant and they comment, such a big animal, we should keep it in the temple. The wart which was personal to one person has become divine and holy to everyone now. All he had to do to cure the wart was to seek the help of science.

Planned, designed and founded by Lama Lhatsun Chempo in 1647, it is one of the oldest and premier monasteries of Sikkim, also the most famous in Sikkim. Originally started as a small Lhakhang, it was subsequently enlarged during the reign of the third Chogyal Chakdor Namgyal and Khenchen Rolpai Dorjee in the year 1705 and consecrated by the third Lhatsun Chenpo Dzogchen Jigme Pawo in the year 1710 C.E. The monastery follows the Nyingma Order of Tibetan Buddhism and controls all other monasteries of that Order in Sikkim. The monks of this monastery are normally chosen from the Bhutias of Sikkim. The monastery was built for \\"pure monks\\" (ta-tshang) meaning \\"monks of pure lineage\\", celibate and without any physical abnormality. This practice is still retained. Only the monks of Pemayangtse Monastery are entitled to the title \\"ta-tshang\\". The head lama of this monastery had the unique privilege of anointing the Chogyals of the erstwhile monarchy of Sikkim with holy water. Pemayangtse means \\"Perfect Sublime Lotus\\", and is said to represent one of the four plexus of the human body. The Pemayangtse Monastery is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit starting with the first monastery at Yuksom known as the Dubdi Monastery, followed by Norbugang Chorten, Tashiding Monastery, the Rabdentse ruins, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, and the Khecheopalri Lake. History The history of the monastery is very closely linked to the reign of Chador Namgyal at Rabdentse. Chador, a very religious person, had taken several initiatives to the spread of Buddhist religion in Sikkim. He had decreed that the second of every three sons of Bhutia family shall be ordained a monk of the Pemayangtse Monastery. During his reign, the Guru Lhakhang Tashiding (1715) was built. He not only patronized Buddhist religious places but also introduced the religious dances (mystery plays) to highlight the martial and native traditions of Sikkim. Geography The monastery located on a hill top in the west district of Sikkim is at the beginning of the popular Dzongri trek route - Yuksom-Dzongri-GoechhaLa is a trek of 46 km, which was started prior to 1960 and which is the most popular trek in Sikkim) to the Kanchendzonga range of hills and Khangchendzonga National Park (KNP). It is away from Gyalshing on the main Pelling road and 44 km away from Pelling. From Upper Pelling on the Geyzing-Pelling road near a stupa, a bypass track of 1.3 km leads to the monastery; Pelling () is the nearest town to the monastery. The view of Mount Khanchendzonga is said to be a commanding and impressive view from this monastery. Architecture Front view of Pemayangtse Monastery The monastery, located at an elevation of 2085 m, is built with scenic backdrop of snow-capped mountains on two sides. Built as a three storied structure, the monastery depicts paintings on its walls and statues of saints and Rinpoches, deified in various floors. The monastery was damaged by earthquakes in 1913 and 1960 but has been refurbished several times. The monastery belongs to the Nyingma order (establishd in the 8th century by Padmasambhava) and characteristic feature seen in this monastery is of statues of Padmasambahva and his two consorts. In the main prayer hall ( area), the Dukhang or Lakhang, the main temple, which has colourfully painted doors and windows, depict Tibetan designs. The main statue of Padmasambahva (also known as Guru Rinpoche who revived Buddhism in Tibet and was also the propagator of Vajrayana or tantric form of Buddhism ) seen here is in his wrathful form as Dorje Bhurpa Vjarakila with multiple heads and arms. The monastery, which overlooks the Rabdantse ruins, has well manicured gardens within its compound where the residential accommodation for the monks is also located. Entrance to Pemangytse Monastery The first floor of the monastery has a notable collection of ancient Buddhist antique idols, scriptures as well as sculptures and decorated paintings. Padmasambahva's eight incarnations in fierce form are also seen here. Of particular note is a seven-tiered painted wooden structure, portraying Guru Rimpoche's Heavenly Palace known as \\"Sanghthokpalri\\" also spelt \\"Zandog-palri\\", on the top floor of the monastery. The painting has scenes of rainbows, angels with \\"whole panoply of Buddhas and Bodhistvas\\". This structure was constructed by Dungzin Rimpoche over a period of 5 years. Festival The Cham dance festival is held every year on the 28th and 29th day of the 12th lunar month of the Tibetan calendar, corresponding to February of the Gregorian calendar. It is performed by the lamas of this monastery. The lamas dress up as MahƒÅkƒÅla and Guru Drag-dmar (Sanskrit Vajrakila) in colourful costumes for the dance performance. Pilgrims from all parts of Sikkim visit the monastery to witness this festival. On this festive occasion, which marks the conclusion of Losar, on the last day of the festival, a very large and impressive embroidered scroll is displayed. Fireworks display is also a part of the concluding function, symbolizing driving away of evil spirits. There are 108 monks in this monastery and they are identified by the red hats that they wear. Refurbishments and conservation Preservation efforts at Pemayangtse Monastery Over the centuries the monastery has withstood earthquakes and other calamities common in high altitude areas. As a result, the monastery has been damaged time and again which can be spotted in the interiors, especially in the first floor. The Monastery has gone through series of refurbishments and preservation efforts to strengthen the structure. Most notably, on the rear left corner of the monastery the roof was tied to chains which were then planted to solid concrete floor to enable it to withstand the monsoon winds.

He was a fixture in Hollywood labor circles, having overseen some 400 labor contracts with writers, actors, film crews, musicians and scores of other professionals. He served as AMPTP's president for 27 years and was the chief negotiator for 311 major labor pacts, including six in 2008. He retired in February 2009, marking the end of an era. For most of his tenure, Counter presided over a period of relative labor calm, except for two major strikes that rocked Hollywood, in 1988 and 2008, both by the Writers Guild of America. Over the years, Counter was praised by his colleagues for giving the often-fractious alliance a unified voice, a task that became increasingly trying as studios became facets of media conglomerates with diverse businesses. The group often has had difficulty reaching consensus because it represents more than 350 film and television producers, including major media giants that are fierce competitors. At the same time, Counter's pugnacious style and tactics‚Äîwhich included staring down opponents and publicly rebuking union officials who angered him‚Äîalso made him the nemesis of many rank-and-file workers, especially during the most recent writers strike, when he was depicted as tone-deaf to their concerns. In the heat of negotiations with the Writers Guild in 2004 Counter gave an emotional speech paying tribute to Daniel Petrie Jr., the director and father of the former guild president. Early life Born in Phoenix on March 21, 1940, Counter grew up in the Denver area. During summers, he worked in a Colorado steel mill where his father rose from salesman to vice president. The experience piqued his interest in labor issues. \\"What I learned was that unions come about because of bad management,\\" he said in an interview with The Times in 2007. Counter was an amateur boxer and a star football player in high school, later playing halfback at the University of Colorado, where he earned a full Boettcher Scholarship to study electrical engineering. He shifted to law, studying at Stanford University before becoming a labor attorney in Los Angeles. The studios tapped him in 1982 to unify the newly formed alliance, whose members had previously squabbled over how labor negotiations should be conducted. \\"I planned on doing it for three years and then getting back to my practice,\\" Counter said. Career Counter stipulated that companies act with one voice, viewing a \\"strike against one as a strike against all.\\" Instead of responding to union demands, he made companies craft proposals. His biggest challenge came six years later during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike that lasted 22 weeks. Counter and his labor counterparts became convinced that future disruptions could be avoided if negotiations began well before contract's expired. The approach worked well, at least until fall 2007, when the writers‚Äîfearful that studios were shortchanging their future in the Internet era‚Äîagain went on strike. The walkout followed weeks of acrimonious talks between Counter and guild officials. He served as a trustee on 14 of the guild and union health and pension funds and also as a trustee for the Motion Picture & Television Fund.  Death  Counter died November 6, 2009 at the age of 69. \\"Nick's passing is a profound loss for the entire entertainment community,\\" said AMPTP President Carol Lombardini. \\"We will all remember Nick for his passionate leadership, which was always guided by a resolute sense of fair play and an earnest desire that everyone come out a winner.\\" \\"Although we sat on opposite sides during labor negotiations, Nick was a friend, man of honor and worthy adversary, doing his best to represent his constituents,\\" Directors Guild of America Secretary-Treasurer Gilbert Cates and National Executive Director Jay Roth said in a statement. \\"We shared the same goal -- protecting our industry -- yet often held different ideas at times about how to accomplish this. But ultimately Nick would always listen, evaluate and try to understand where we were coming from and look for a way to find a deal that worked for both parties.\\" He is survived by a son, Nicholas; a daughter, Samantha, and her husband, producer and screenwriter Alex Kurtzman; and a grandson, Jack.

The narrative poem recounts William & Mary's historic legacy as the seventh oldest college in the English-speaking world (second oldest in North America after Harvard University). Made popular by the Seven Society, Order of the Crown & Dagger, which adopted I Am the College as its official poem, Dean Woodbridge's verses are meant to foster unity and engender pride across the university.

Poliquin (March 5, 1961 ‚Äì September 26, 2018) was a Canadian strength coach. He was also the author of eight books. Early life Charles Poliquin was born on March 5, 1961 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. He earned a master's degree in Exercise Physiology. He started strength training at an early age. Career Poliquin began working as a strength coach while he was in graduate school in Canada. He helped popularize German Volume Training. In the late 1990s, Poliquin founded Poliquin Performance, opening the first Poliquin Performance Center in Phoenix, Arizona in 2001, and the Poliquin Strength Institute in East Greenwich, Rhode Island in 2009. Throughout this time he certified coaches in the Poliquin International Certification Program (PICP), which includes a body hormone profiling method, which he invented, called BioSignature Modulation. In September 2013 Poliquin parted ways with Poliquin Performance (now renamed Poliquin Group). He subsequently founded another fitness company called Strength Sensei. He trained numerous Olympic and professional athletes. Poliquin published articles in peer-reviewed journals of exercise science and strength and conditioning. His training theories were introduced to the bodybuilding community in 1993 through his articles for Muscle Media 2000 magazine, and after 1998 through the online and print versions of Testosterone Magazine (now known as T-Nation). He coined the phrase \\"the myth of discipline\\" to suggest that fitness results depend on how motivated a gym-goer is. As a columnist, he penned over 600 articles in numerous publications. Additionally, he is the author of eight books, many of which have been translated into 12 different languages, including Swedish, German, French, Italian, Dutch, and Japanese.

It is that a crime will be punished only if its prosecution is considered opportune. Therefore, public prosecutors have the discretion to cancel the prosecution of a crime. Cancelling the prosecution of a crime is called a sepot or seponering in Dutch and is mentioned in the First Book, First Title, Fourth Section of the Dutch Criminal Procedure Code (Articles 12, 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, 12f, 12g, 12h, 12i, 12j, 12k, 12l, 12m, 12n, 12o, 12p, 13 and 13a). In countries that do not recognise the principle of opportunity, the cancellation of the prosecution of a known felony can itself be considered a felony.Some similar provisions are in Belgian law and apparently Estonian law. There are three sorts of cancellation of prosecution: * policy sepot: petty crimes are not prosecuted to free up capacity in the legal system and to prosecute serious crimes. * technical sepot: there is not enough evidence to obtain a conviction from a court or such a conviction is highly unlikely. * conditional sepot: the crime suspect is spared from being prosecuted if the suspect commits no other crimes. In Belgium, that is called a \\"praetorian probation\\". A crime whose prosecution is cancelled can still be resumed later (the ne bis in idem principle does not apply to sepots),The sepot is not a verdict of a judge, in the meaning of the Art. 350, Sv. unless the Public Department has made a formal communication to the crime suspect that the suspect is no longer prosecuted (then, prosecution cannot be resumed according to the principle of administrative law trustworthiness). According to Article 12 of the Dutch Criminal Procedure Code,Art. 12, Sv. a person with a direct concern in the prosecution of a crime may file a complaint at a court of law against the cancellation of the prosecution. If the council chamber of the court decides that the crime should be prosecuted, the crime must be prosecuted.

History  Woods of Terror sits on 45 acres of land 12 miles outside of Greensboro, North Carolina. The land is said to be the permanent home to countless spirits who made their way out of this life during The Great Depression. At the time, local priest, Father Eddie Howie McMillan, was the owner of this land. He passed it on to his great grandson, Eddie Howie McLaurin, in 1970. It became known as McLaurin Farms. McLaurin used the area as a junk yard. He collected fees from individuals who would dump their unwanted belongings ranging from refrigerators to cars. These items remain as a part of the set used by Woods of Terror. The park opened in 1991. Attractions Woods of Terror offers a variety of attractions before patrons even enter the woods. Just beyond the ticket booth lies \\"The Monster Midway\\" which is the epicenter and waiting area of Woods of Terror. When he is in the Midway, Eddie McLaurin is affectionately known as \\"Bone Daddy\\" accompanied by his signature red mohawk and half-skeleton face makeup. Bone Daddy leads the monster parade to commence the night of haunts. Soon thereafter, Bone Daddy sings the National Anthem in a punk rock style accented by fireworks and a head-banging band. In the Midway, patrons can enjoy refreshments and photo opportunities. The fan favorite photo op is with Bone Daddy himself and his 80-pound albino Burmese python named Dawn who gets draped over the shoulders of guests who dare approach. Woods of Terror features 12 bone-chilling attractions. \\"Arachnophobia\\" is designed to exploit fears of creepy crawlers such as spiders, roaches, and snakes. \\"Chaos 3D\\" allows guests to get dizzyingly close to three-dimensional murals. After donning 3D glasses, guests must traverse halls filled with visual illusions. Other experiences include \\"Industrial Nightmare,\\" \\"The Blood House,\\" \\"Horror Movie Classics,\\" \\"The Awakening,\\" \\"Miner's Massacre,\\" \\"The Slaughter House,\\" and \\"The Purge Anarchy.\\" Approximately 175 employees make the production a success year after year.

In 1879, Doctor William Flemon Cowan, and his spouse, midwife Mary Ann Primm Cowan, moved to the community from Limestone County. The plot of land on which they settled became the community of Katemcy. Dr. and Mrs. Cowan provided medical services to the settlers by riding horseback throughout the county. In the style of the day, Mrs. Cowan rode sidesaddle in a riding skirt. Dr. Cowan's sons John, Elias and Alfred ran a sawmill, gristmill and cotton gin. School Baptist minister Lawson Jones donated land in 1883 for the construction of Friendship School. A community collection provided the building fund, and J.M. Heatherly became the first teacher of the one-room school. Funding for the school came from tuition, which could be off-set for needy families by having their child perform chores at the school. A public school was later built in Katemcy, and the Friendship School was moved and became the Friendship Baptist Church. Post office Alfred R. Cowan was appointed postmaster when Katemcy received its post office on November 17, 1884. Later years Katemcy became attractive to settlers with its inexpensive acreage and bountiful water supply. The area received its first telephone in 1914. Local farms were often tenant farms, an arrangement that contributed to the thriving rural community that supported three churches, a school, two doctors, two general stores, two blacksmith shops, and a cotton gin. By 1920, the tractor had replaced a lot of field hands, and farm employment began to disappear. The population began its decline in 1925. The Katemcy school system was consolidated with Mason in 1945. Today, the rural community population remains small. Notable people The late actor Dewey Martin was a native of Katemcy.

It is in an excellent state of repair. Description The south-facing entrance front has a central square tower, six bays to the left terminating in an octagonal tower and five bays to the right flanked by a square tower, the whole resembling a medieval castle with embattled parapets. Pevsner considered the inspiration to be the French semi-fortified houses in paintings by Claude Lorraine or Gaspard Poussin. History The estate of Downton was acquired by Richard Knight (1659‚Äì1749) a wealthy ironmaster from Madeley, Shropshire, and proprietor of the Bringewood Ironworks. It passed to his grandson the art connoisseur and MP Payne Knight (1750-1824), who rebuilt the house in the Gothic revival style. Payne Knight was an enthusiast of the picturesque style, and commissioned the landscape artist Thomas Hearne to produce drawings of the grounds.V&A;: The River Teme at Downton, Herefordshire Construction started in 1772/3 and was largely completed by 1778. In 1824 the estate was inherited by the horticulturalist Charlotte Knight (c.1801-1843), niece of Payne Knight, the daughter and heiress the botanist Thomas Andrew Knight, brother of Payne Knight. She was the wife of Sir William Edward Rouse-Boughton, 2nd and 10th Baronet (1788-1856), of Downton Hall, Stanton Lacy, Shropshire, (about to the NE of Downton Castle), a Member of Parliament for Evesham in Worcestershire. As her eldest son was heir to his father's estates and two baronetcies, she bequeathed the estate to their second son Andrew Rouse-Boughton-Knight (d.1947), who in 1857 adopted the additional surname of Knight. He served as High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1860 and at that time began improvements and extensions to the house, including a new entrance and porch, a north west tower, and a chapel. He added terraced gardens in 1865 to the design of W.A. Nesfield. In 1881 the family resided there with twelve servants.Public Records Office. 1881 Census ref RG11/2613/40/7 He died at Downton Castle in 1947.

The Nuvoletta clan Lorenzo Nuvoletta and his brothers Ciro, Gaetano and Angelo were the heirs to a family of landowners. His grandfather and mother had accumulated large areas of land, with its fruit crops exported to other areas. In the 1960s, they joined the clan of Antonio Maisto who was smuggling contraband cigarettes. After their early exploits with the Maisto clan, they diversified and became significant landowners using state funds designed to set up small agricultural landholdings. They made their fortune swindling the Italian government and the European Economic Community (EEC) and intimidating insurance officials, as well as local farmers who took loans from finance companies managed by the Nuvolettas.Behan, The Camorra, pp. 76‚Äì77 Links with the Sicilian Mafia Apart from being a member of the Camorra, Lorenzo Nuvoletta was also initiated in the Sicilian Mafia. According to Mafia turncoat (pentito) Tommaso Buscetta he was close to Luciano Leggio and Salvatore Riina and his Corleonesi, as well as Michele Greco, to which Mafia family the Nuvoletta clan answered. According to Mafia boss Giuseppe Di Cristina, the Nuvolettas managed a deposit and possibly a heroin refinery on Liggio's behalf.Behan, The Camorra, p. 78 Several Camorra and Mafia clans struck a deal on the division of the shiploads of contraband cigarettes arriving in the port of Naples at a meeting in 1974 in the villa of Lorenzo Nuvoletta in Marano.Behan, The Camorra, p. 51 With Umberto Ammaturo, the clan also engaged in cocaine trafficking.Behan, The Camorra, p. 77 The Nuvolettas, and in particular Lorenzo as one of the most charismatic members of the entire organisation, were important members of the Nuova Famiglia (NF) a coalition of Camorra clans created in the 1980s to face Raffaele Cutolo's Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO). Cutolo wanted to unite the Camorra under his leadership. The support of the Sicilian Mafia was crucial in the war between the NF and the NCO, which ended with the defeat of Cutolo. However, with Cutolo and the NCO out of the picture, the NF alliance soon disintegrated, with a war breaking out between the clan headed by Antonio Bardellino and the Nuvolettas towards the end of 1983. Arrest In 1984, the Antimafia judge Giovanni Falcone issued an arrest warrant against Nuvoletta for mafia association. On December 7, 1990, he was arrested, during a summit of the clan at his villa bunker just outside Marano, together with his brother Ciro and other members of the clan as well as the local Christian Democrat politician.

The referendum was planned to run concurrently with the November 2009 presidential, congressional, and mayoral elections (i.e. the first three ballot boxes). Some Hondurans opposed the plan, including many politicians from the two largest parties. When Zelaya pushed ahead with plans for this referendum (subsequently structured as a government-run 'poll') on whether to include a fourth ballot box (the second referendum), the Supreme Court issued a warrant for his arrest and the army expelled him from the country in a June 28 coup d'etat, precipitating the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. Honduras and ALBA Hugo Ch√°vez On July 22, 2008, Zelaya had revealed that he was seeking to incorporate the country into the ALBA, an organization founded by Hugo Ch√°vez. He said that the country had been \\"observer member\\" \\"four or more months\\". The Associated Press, citing Manuel Orozco of the Inter American Dialogue, said that \\"His [Zelaya's] campaign for changing the constitution has energized his support base of labour groups, farmers and civil organisations who have long felt marginalized in a country where a wealthy elite controls the media and much of politics.\\" Other leaders of ALBA have successfully sought to modify or even eliminate their term limits. \\"The constitution had since 1980 been tweaked in other areas around thirty times, to the point where politicians of all camps were convinced that the document was no longer adequate. This is where the formal change proposed by Manuel Zelaya comes in: that in the November 2009 election- round, the voters will be presented with four ballot-boxes - the fourth one being used for a referendum on the question: \\"Do you agree with convening a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution?\\" Most members of the political class have been in agreement with the idea - but most too are unhappy with the man promoting it; in great part because lurking behind the fourth ballot-box they see... Hugo Ch√°vez's shadow. The pre-coup political atmosphere revealed the fluidity surrounding the project of launching an independent candidate and the fourth ballot-box proposal. The establishment media owned by the country's elite were quick to connect them, and to try to see evidence of Hugo Ch√°vez's influence.\\" According to analyst Raul Pineda Alvarado, Zelaya's attempt to modify constitution was a \\"carbon copy\\" of what has happened in Venezuela, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Newt Gingrich wrote in the Washington Examiner that Chavez had used ALBA to create \\"a tide of incipient dictatorship\\" flowing out of Venezuela into other countries in Latin America. He noted that Chavez has subverted democracy in Venezuela to ensure his rule would be uncontested for decades, and \\"one-by-one, each of the members of ALBA have followed Chavez's lead and changed their constitutions to remove limits on the number of terms their presidents can serve.\\" When Zelaya issued Executive Decree PCM-05-2009 on March 24, the situation was: * Bolivia (Evo Morales) - Term limits modified in February 2009. * Cuba (Ra√∫l Castro) - De facto dictatorship. * Ecuador (Rafael Correa) - Term limits modified in September 2008. * Nicaragua (Daniel Ortega) - Modifications planned. * Venezuela (Hugo Ch√°vez) - Term limits modified in February 2009, allowing indefinite re-election. Daniel Ortega succeeded in modifying term limits in Nicaragua in November 2009. Emergency executive decree On September 30, 2008 Zelaya issued emergency executive decree 46-A-2208, which authorized 30 million lempiras of public money to advertise Zelaya's fourth ballot box. Soon after he issued another emergency executive decree, identical except that the money was transferred to his office. Auditors later found documentation of 29 checks and a total of 29,995,887.62 lempiras. The expenses weren't well documented. It is unclear whether another 30 million was withdrawn. The supposed advertisers paid no sales tax. The Supreme Audit Court's investigation raised concerns that 30-60 million was squandered with the two executive decrees. Constitutional assembly plans Zelaya's leftward drift during his presidency (which included raising the minimum wage by 60%) culminated in a plan to hold a Constitutional Assembly to write a new constitution. A publicity document produced for the fourth ballot box initiative that outlined the goals of a constitutional convention was inserted in an Armed Forces timeline document. Some of the topics of a constitutional convention include social order; the establishment of a recall mechanism for politicians; actual freedom of the press through equitable access; economic liberty with social responsibility; authentic political liberty resulting in a representative democracy where politicians are responsible to their electorate instead of their party; more consultation of the populace; and other suggested topics. Notably absent in the flyer was any mention of extending the term of the president. Zelaya was quoted by popular media outlets as saying \\"[t]he only one who can't be re-elected is the President, but re-election is a topic of the next National Constitutional Assembly\\". For minorities like the 400,000 ethnic Garifunas it held the promise of winning long-sought rights, such as proportional representation and legal title to communal and ancestral land.{} The Foreign Policy magazine's coverage stated there was nothing ideological about Zelaya's plan, noting that he never bothered to explain what kind of constitution he wanted, other than one that allowed his own reelection. The article concluded \\"In that respect, Zelaya is less a disciple of Ch√°vez than of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, another unsavory character bereft of any ideal other than staying in power by hook or by crook.\\"How to fix the mess in Honduras , Foreign Policy, June 29, 2009 The current Political Constitution of the Republic of Honduras was initially approved on 11 January 1982, three years after Honduras returned to civilian rule after many decades of mostly military governments. The provision of the constitution, at issue here, was written to prevent a president from extending his rule beyond one term to prevent another dictatorship. The National Congress of Honduras amended the Constitution 26 times from 1984 to 2005Dates of ratification and made 10 interpretations of the Constitution from 1982 to 2005. Referendum on constitutional assembly As early as August 2006, Central America report stated that \\"liberal sectors\\" were proposing to reform \\" 'obsolete articles' \\" in the constitution, including one against presidential reelection. The report said that this was causing controversy.Central America report, 4 August 2006, excerpted in University of California at San Diego libraries, Latin American election statistics, retrieved 2009. Archived 2009-07-26. Debate regarding the convening of a constituent assembly took place in Honduras, with support from many groups. On 11 November 2008, President Zelaya announced a non-binding referendum to see if the people wanted to have a fourth ballot box, \\"Cuarta Urna\\", installed at polling places during the next election, which is scheduled for 29 November 2009. The fourth ballot, which would be in addition to the usual ones for presidential, congressional and local elections, would ask voters whether they wanted to hold a National Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution. Zelaya, whose presidential term was to expire on 27 January 2010, would be ineligible, under the term-limitations of the present constitution, to run in the 2009 election.Am√©rica Latina, Democracia Cristiana y golpes de Estado, Argenpress, 31 August 2009.

Zelaya pointed out on at least one occasion (26 June) that since the electorate's decision whether to convoke a constituent assembly would not be made until 29 November 2009 ‚Äì simultaneously with the presidential election ‚Äì any constitutional changes that might result would be too late to allow him to run for reelection.\\"Honduras president: Nation calm before controversial vote\\", CNN, 27 June 2009. Others have also observed that the 29 November date set for the Constitutional Assembly poll is too late to facilitate Zelaya's continuation in office.\\"Its not about Zelaya\\", MRzine (published by Monthly Review), 4 July 2009. On February 17, at a public showcasing of tractor equipment received from Venezuela, Manuel Zelaya states that he will propose a fourth ballot box. On 24 March 2009, Zelaya called for a preliminary poll to be held on 28 June 2009 to gauge popular support for the idea of including the Constituent Assembly question in the November 2009 election. In May he issued executive decree PCM-05-2009 for the National Statistical Institute to hold the poll by 28 June 2009. The question to be asked in this preliminary poll was: Early coverage of the constitutional crisis often repeated that Zelaya wanted to call a constitutional convention because he sought either to continue in office as President, or sought a chance to seek re-election to President at some future point. Such reports echo the claims of three of the four daily newspapers in Honduras, which originated these claims. An example of this type of coverage is the German newspaper, Die Welt, which wrote \\"Opponents of Zelaya believe he was pushing the limits of democracy with his drive to extend the single four-year term of presidents to allow re-election.\\" As noted above, Zelaya pointed out on at least one occasion (26 June) that since the electorate's decision whether to convoke a constituent assembly would not be made until 29 November 2009 ‚Äì simultaneously with the presidential election ‚Äì any constitutional changes that might eventually result would be too late to allow him to run for reelection. Courts declare the referendum illegal The Article 5 of the constitution states that only the Supreme Electoral Tribunal can schedule, organize and supervise referendums and plebiscites. The President of the Congress, Micheletti, observed that article 374 of the constitution states that no referendum can be used to alter the entrenched articles in the constitution that are specified in article 384.\\"Honduras: buscar reforma constitucional\\", BBC Spanish op cit. Note that article 374 does not say that; and there is no article 384: the constitution has only 378 numbered articles. Apparently either the BBC, La Tribuna (the BBC's source), or Micheletti are in error. The quote from Micheletti, copied and pasted from the BBC article, is: \\"El art√≠culo 374 dice que no se podr√° utilizar el plebiscito y el referendo para reformar los art√≠culos p√©treos que establece el art√≠culo 384 y que se refiere a la forma de gobierno, al territorio nacional, al per√≠odo presidencial, a la prohibici√≥n para ser nuevamente Presidente de la Rep√∫blica al ciudadano que lo haya desempe√±ado bajo cualquier tipo y referente.\\" (BBC's source was La Tribuna.) Article 373 of the constitution states that the constitution can be modified by a two-thirds majority of the National Congress. Article 374, however, specifies that several articles are entrenched; that is, they cannot be modified under any circumstances (Spanish: \\"en ning√∫n caso\\"). The constitution (in Spanish) can be viewed at Georgetown University constitutional archive, retrieved July 2009. The entrenched clauses include those on the system of government that is permitted, and the presidential succession.Honduras Constitution: Titulo VII: De la Reforma y la Inviolabilabidad de la Constituci√≥n, Capitulo I De la Reforma de la Constituci√≥n: Articulo 373. - La reforma de esta Constituci√≥n podr√° decretarse por el Congreso Nacional, en sesiones ordinarias, con dos tercios de votos de la totalidad de sus miembros.

However, any charges brought under Article 239 require the observance of due process rights, such as those afforded by Article 94 of the Honduran Constitution. Article 239 was not mentioned as a basis for the charges discussed in the subsequent judicial case file against Zelaya.Expediente judicial, judiciary of Honduras. Accessed 2009-09-08. Archived 2009-09-10. On 25 March, the Attorney General's office formally notified President Zelaya that he would face criminal charges of abusing power if he proceeded with the referendum. In late May the court of contentious administration ruled the poll illegal. Honduras‚Äô Supreme Electoral Tribunal also ruled that such a poll would be illegal. On 27 May, Micheletti announced that he had submitted evidence to the public prosecutor that the Executive branch had put out a contract to have him killed. He said that for more than a month he'd been followed and menaced with death and placed responsibility on the executive branch. Zelaya responded that \\"whoever made these claims had swine flu and was delirious.\\"Quienes hacen esas denuncias tienen fiebre porcina y est√°n deliriando\\" The lower court decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. In late June the intended consultative poll was also rejected by Congress. Also New York Times, 29 June 2009, op cit. On June 3, Congress passes a resolution warning Zelaya to correct his administrative conduct. On June 11, the Bar Association of Honduras unanimously agreed that Zelaya's is violating the law. It asked Zelaya to stop the illegalities and recommended officials not follow his illegal orders. On 23 June 2009, Congress passed a law forbidding holding polls, referenda, and plebiscites less than 180 days before the next general election; as the next elections are set for 29 November 2009 this would have made the 28 June 2009 poll illegal. Since this bill was passed after the poll was scheduled, Zelaya rejected its applicability to this case. Zelaya violates court orders The military is in charge of security and logistics in elections in Honduras. Zelaya asked them to perform their election role for the poll, but the head of the military command, General Romeo V√°squez Vel√°squez, refused the order to pass out the poll materials, brought from Venezuela, because the Supreme Court had ruled the poll to be illegal. On 24 June Zelaya fired him. Later that day, the defense minister and the heads of the army, navy and air force resigned. On 25 June the Supreme Court ruled 5-0 that General Vel√°squez was to be reinstated. Tribunal member David Matamoros affirmed the Electoral Tribunal‚Äôs support for the military's actions. On June 25, just days before his illegal survey, Zelaya published executive decree PCM-019-2009, which revoked the earlier decree PCM-05-2009. Zelaya issued a new executive decree, PCM-020-2009. On the afternoon of June 25, Zelaya led several hundred people to the Hernan Acosta Mejia air force base and took possession of the disputed poll ballots, which he then kept in the presidential palace to avoid their destruction. Congress began discussing how to impeach Zelaya and opened an investigation into whether Zelaya had violated the constitution and also whether he was \\"mentally incapable\\" of holding office. Zelaya responded to the President of the National Congress Roberto Micheletti by saying \\"What's with you, Roberto. I was elected by the people, not the congress. How would you make me ineligible, you're a lousy second-rate congressman who got your post because I gave you space in my party.\\" On 23 June, tens of thousands of people marched in San Pedro Sula against Zelaya's alleged re-election plans.Honduras dismisses military chief amid political chaos.

Pat Berkeley (Bette Davis), who attended high school with Nan and Bill, is hired by his firm as an advertising copywriter, and her success prompts Nan to coerce her husband into asserting himself with his boss. When he fails to spark any interest with his ideas, Bill succumbs to his wife's suggestion that he start his own agency using the money she has managed to save. Spurred by Nan, he steals a major client from his former firm and hires Pat to help him handle it. Complications arise when the feelings the two had for each other years before are reignited and they embark upon an affair. Nan becomes aware of their relationship but chooses to ignore it. Bill announces he wants a divorce. When Nan refuses to grant him one, he angrily leaves the house and accidentally hits their son Buddy (Ronnie Cosby) with the car, seriously injuring him. Months pass, Buddy recovers, and Bill and Nan's divorce is in its final stages. Hearing Nan's court testimony, Bill realizes how good she is as a wife and mother and how much he loves and needs her, and the two decide to reconcile.

Waveguide post filter: a band-pass filter consisting of a length of WG15 (a standard waveguide size for X band use) divided into a row of five coupled resonant cavities by fences of three posts each. The ends of the posts can be seen protruding through the wall of the guide. A waveguide filter is an electronic filter constructed with waveguide technology. Waveguides are hollow metal conduits inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), while others are rejected (the stopband). Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. These include selection of signals and limitation of noise. Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting. Waveguide filters were developed during World War II to meet the needs of radar and electronic countermeasures, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators. A particular feature of waveguide filter design concerns the mode of transmission. Systems based on pairs of conducting wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission. In waveguide systems, any number of modes are possible. This can be both a disadvantage, as spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage, as a dual-mode design can be much smaller than the equivalent waveguide single mode design. The chief advantages of waveguide filters over other technologies are their ability to handle high power and their low loss. The chief disadvantages are their bulk and cost when compared with technologies such as microstrip filters. There is a wide array of different types of waveguide filters. Many of them consist of a chain of coupled resonators of some kind that can be modelled as a ladder network of LC circuits. One of the most common types consists of a number of coupled resonant cavities. Even within this type, there are many subtypes, mostly differentiated by the means of coupling. These coupling types include apertures, irises, and posts. Other waveguide filter types include dielectric resonator filters, insert filters, finline filters, corrugated-waveguide filters, and stub filters. A number of waveguide components have filter theory applied to their design, but their purpose is something other than to filter signals. Such devices include impedance matching components, directional couplers, and diplexers. These devices frequently take on the form of a filter, at least in part. Scope The common meaning of waveguide, when the term is used unqualified, is the hollow metal kind (or occasionally dielectric filled), but other waveguide technologies are possible.Gibilisco & Sclater, page 913 The scope of this article is limited to the metal-conduit type. The post-wall waveguide structure is something of a variant, but is related enough to include in this article‚Äîthe wave is mostly surrounded by conducting material. It is possible to construct waveguides out of dielectric rods,Yeh & Shimabukuro, page 1 the most well known example being optical fibres. This subject is outside the scope of the article with the exception that dielectric rod resonators are sometimes used inside hollow metal waveguides. Transmission line technologies such as conducting wires and microstrip can be thought of as waveguides,Russer, pages 131‚Äì132 but are not commonly called such and are also outside the scope of this article. Basic concepts Filters In electronics, filters are used to allow signals of a certain band of frequencies to pass while blocking others. They are a basic building block of electronic systems and have a great many applications. Amongst the uses of waveguide filters are the construction of duplexers, diplexers, and multiplexers; selectivity and noise limitation in receivers; and harmonic distortion suppression in transmitters.Belov et al., page 147 Waveguides Waveguides are metal conduits used to confine and direct radio signals. They are usually made of brass, but aluminium and copper are also used.Connor, page 52 Most commonly they are rectangular, but other cross-sections such as circular or elliptical are possible. A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components. It has much the same range of applications as other filter technologies in electronics and radio engineering but is very different mechanically and in principle of operation. The technology used for constructing filters is chosen to a large extent by the frequency of operation that is expected, although there is a large amount of overlap. Low frequency applications such as audio electronics use filters composed of discrete capacitors and inductors. Somewhere in the very high frequency band, designers switch to using components made of pieces of transmission line. These kinds of designs are called distributed element filters. Filters made from discrete components are sometimes called lumped element filters to distinguish them. At still higher frequencies, the microwave bands, the design switches to waveguide filters, or sometimes a combination of waveguides and transmission lines. Waveguide filters have much more in common with transmission line filters than lumped element filters; they do not contain any discrete capacitors or inductors. However, the waveguide design may frequently be equivalent (or approximately so) to a lumped element design. Indeed, the design of waveguide filters frequently starts from a lumped element design and then converts the elements of that design into waveguide components.Matthaei et al., page 83 Modes Figure 2. The field patterns of some common waveguide modes One of the most important differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the electromagnetic wave carrying the signal. In a transmission line, the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors. The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line, and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the electromagnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave. This transverse mode is designated TEM (transverse electromagnetic). On the other hand, there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support, but the TEM mode is not one of them. Waveguide modes are designated either TE (transverse electric) or TM (transverse magnetic), followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode. This multiplicity of modes can cause problems in waveguide filters when spurious modes are generated. Designs are usually based on a single mode and frequently incorporate features to suppress the unwanted modes. On the other hand, advantage can be had from choosing the right mode for the application, and even sometimes making use of more than one mode at once. Where only a single mode is in use, the waveguide can be modelled like a conducting transmission line and results from transmission line theory can be applied. Cutoff Another feature peculiar to waveguide filters is that there is a definite frequency, the cutoff frequency, below which no transmission can take place. This means that in theory low-pass filters cannot be made in waveguides. However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. Likewise, the guide wavelength (Œªg) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode. Dominant mode The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency of all the modes is called the dominant mode. Between cutoff and the next highest mode, this is the only mode it is possible to transmit, which is why it is described as dominant. Any spurious modes generated are rapidly attenuated along the length of the guide and soon disappear. Practical filter designs are frequently made to operate in the dominant mode. In rectangular waveguide, the TE10 mode (shown in figure 2) is the dominant mode. There is a band of frequencies between the dominant mode cutoff and the next highest mode cutoff in which the waveguide can be operated without any possibility of generating spurious modes. The next highest cutoff modes are TE20, at exactly twice the TE10 mode, and TE01 which is also twice TE10 if the waveguide used has the commonly used aspect ratio of 2:1. The lowest cutoff TM mode is TM11 (shown in figure 2) which is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt 5 times the dominant mode in 2:1 waveguide. Thus, there is an octave over which the dominant mode is free of spurious modes, although operating too close to cutoff is usually avoided because of phase distortion. In circular waveguide, the dominant mode is TE11 and is shown in figure 2. The next highest mode is TM01. The range over which the dominant mode is guaranteed to be spurious-mode free is less than that in rectangular waveguide; the ratio of highest to lowest frequency is approximately 1.3 in circular waveguide, compared to 2.0 in rectangular guide.Matthaei et al., pages 198, 201 Evanescent modes Evanescent modes are modes below the cutoff frequency. They cannot propagate down the waveguide for any distance, dying away exponentially. However, they are important in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts, described later, because energy is stored in the evanescent wave fields.Das & Das, page 112 Advantages and disadvantages Like transmission line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple passbands, replicas of the lumped element prototype. In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two in the case of band-stop filters) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function. For this reason, true low-pass and high-pass filters cannot exist in waveguide. At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest. The range of frequencies over which waveguide filters are useful is largely determined by the waveguide size needed. At lower frequencies the waveguide needs to be impractically large in order to keep the cutoff frequency below the operational frequency. On the other hand, filters whose operating frequencies are so high that the wavelengths are sub-millimetre cannot be manufactured with normal machine shop processes. At frequencies this high, fibre-optic technology starts to become an option. Waveguides are a low-loss medium. Losses in waveguides mostly come from ohmic dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide and is usually the preferred format, but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls. In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with a thin layer of gold or silver to improve surface conductivity. An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters. One of the main advantages of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies is the quality of their resonators. Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor, or just Q. The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. The resistance of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the Q of TEM resonators. This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection. The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q.Hunter, pages 201, 230 Waveguides have good power handling capability, which leads to filter applications in radar. Despite the performance advantages of waveguide filters, microstrip is often the preferred technology due to its low cost. This is especially true for consumer items and the lower microwave frequencies. Microstrip circuits can be manufactured by cheap printed circuit technology, and when integrated on the same printed board as other circuit blocks they incur little additional cost. History Lord Rayleigh first suggested waveguide transmission. The idea of a waveguide for electromagnetic waves was first suggested by Lord Rayleigh in 1897. Rayleigh proposed that a coaxial transmission line could have the centre conductor removed, and waves would still propagate down the inside of the remaining cylindrical conductor despite there no longer being a complete electrical circuit of conductors. He described this in terms of the wave reflecting repeatedly off the internal wall of the outer conductor in a zig- zag fashion as it progressed down the waveguide. Rayleigh was also the first to realise that there was a critical wavelength, the cutoff wavelength, proportional to the cylinder diameter, above which wave propagation is not possible. However, interest in waveguides waned because lower frequencies were more suitable for long distance radio communication. Rayleigh's results were forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others in the 1930s when interest in microwaves revived. Waveguides were first developed, in a circular form, by George Clark Southworth and J. F. Hargreaves in 1932.Sarkar et al., pages 90, 129, 545‚Äì546 The first analogue filter design which went beyond a simple single resonator was created by George Ashley Campbell in 1910 and marked the beginning of filter theory. Campbell's filter was a lumped-element design of capacitors and inductors suggested by his work with loading coils. Otto Zobel and others quickly developed this further.Bray, page 62 Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937; a patentMason, Warren P., \\"Wave filter\\", , filed: 1927, issued: 1930. filed by Mason in 1927 may contain the first published filter design using distributed elements.Millman et al., page 108 Hans Bethe developed waveguide aperture theory. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires, but other researchers later applied the principles to waveguides as well. Much development on waveguide filters was carried out during World War II driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic countermeasures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab), but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved such as the Telecommunications Research Establishment in the UK. Amongst the well- known scientists and engineers at Rad Lab were Julian Schwinger, Nathan Marcuvitz, Edward Mills Purcell, and Hans Bethe. Bethe was only at Rad Lab a short time but produced his aperture theory while there. Aperture theory is important for waveguide cavity filters, which were first developed at Rad Lab. Their work was published after the war in 1948 and includes an early description of dual-mode cavities by Fano and Lawson. Theoretical work following the war included the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards. Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. Richards' transformation allows any lumped element design to be taken \\"as is\\" and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation. In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as Kuroda's identities. These made Richard's work more usable in unbalanced and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic series connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world. Another theoretical development was the network synthesis filter approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he used the Chebyshev approximation to determine element values. Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended. While Cauer's work concerns lumped elements, it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the Chebyshev filter, a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs. Designs in the 1950s started with a lumped element prototype (a technique still in use today), arriving after various transformations at the desired filter in a waveguide form. At the time, this approach was yielding fractional bandwidths no more than about . In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype, the stepped impedance prototype. This filter was based on quarter-wave impedance transformers of various widths and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave (a fractional bandwidth of ). Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types. Figure 3. Pierce's waveguide implementation of a cross-coupled filter The first published account of a cross-coupled filter is due to John R. Pierce at Bell Labs in a 1948 patent. A cross-coupled filter is one in which resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled. The additional degrees of freedom thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance, or, alternatively, with fewer resonators. One version of Pierce's filter, shown in figure 3, uses circular waveguide cavity resonators to link between rectangular guide cavity resonators. This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers, but it was used extensively by mechanical filter designers in the 1960s, particularly R. A. Johnson at Collins Radio Company.Levy & Cohn, pages 1060‚Äì1061 The initial non-military application of waveguide filters was in the microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. They are now also used in satellite communications systems. The need for frequency-independent delay in satellite applications led to more research into the waveguide incarnation of cross- coupled filters. Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for delay equalisation. The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross-coupled filters held out the possibility of designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters. A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space. The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s. Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s. Another space-saving innovation was the dielectric resonator, which can be used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material. Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of invar, which led to instability of filter parameters. Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving. This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. The first of these was from Mass√© and Pucel using barium tetratitanateBarium tetratitanate, BaTi4O9 (Young et al., page 655) at Raytheon in 1972. Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and Murata Manufacturing. Bell Labs' barium nonatitanateBarium nonatitanate, Ba2Ti9O20 (Nalwa, page 443) resonator had a dielectric constant of 40 and Q of 5000‚Äì10,000 at . Modern temperature-stable materials have a dielectric constant of about 90 at microwave frequencies, but research is continuing to find materials with both low loss and high permittivity; lower permittivity materials, such as zirconium stannate titanateZirconium stannate titanate, Zr1‚àíxSnxTiO4 (Gusmano et al., page 690) (ZST) with a dielectric constant of 38, are still sometimes used for their low loss property. An alternative approach to designing smaller waveguide filters was provided by the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.Zhang, Wang, Li, and Lui (2008) A relatively recent technology being used inside hollow-metal-waveguide filters is finline, a kind of planar dielectric waveguide. Finline was first described by Paul Meier in 1972. Multiplexer history John R. Pierce invented the cross- coupled filter and the contiguous passband multiplexer. Multiplexers were first described by Fano and Lawson in 1948. Pierce was the first to describe multiplexers with contiguous passbands. Multiplexing using directional filters was invented by Seymour Cohn and Frank Coale in the 1950s. Multiplexers with compensating immittance resonators at each junction are largely the work of E. G. Cristal and G. L. Matthaei in the 1960s. This technique is still sometimes used, but the modern availability of computing power has led to the more common use of synthesis techniques which can directly produce matching filters without the need for these additional resonators. In 1965 R. J. Wenzel discovered that filters which were singly terminated, rather than the usual doubly terminated, were complementary‚Äîexactly what was needed for a diplexer. Wenzel was inspired by the lectures of circuit theorist Ernst Guillemin. Multi-channel, multi-octave multiplexers were investigated by Harold Schumacher at Microphase Corporation, and his results were published in 1976. The principle that multiplexer filters may be matched when joined together by modifying the first few elements, thus doing away with the compensating resonators, was discovered accidentally by E. J. Curly around 1968 when he mistuned a diplexer. A formal theory for this was provided by J. D. Rhodes in 1976 and generalised to multiplexers by Rhodes and Ralph Levy in 1979. From the 1980s, planar technologies, especially microstrip, have tended to replace other technologies used for constructing filters and multiplexers, especially in products aimed at the consumer market. The recent innovation of post-wall waveguide allows waveguide designs to be implemented on a flat substrate with low-cost manufacturing techniques similar to those used for microstrip. Components Figure 4. Ladder circuit implementation of a lumped element low-pass filter Waveguide filter designs frequently consist of two different components repeated a number of times. Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. Often, the filter type will take its name from the style of this component. These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network. Lumped element filters are commonly ladder topology, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. Figure 4 shows such a ladder. Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters with the use of a band-pass or band-stop transformation.Matthaei et al., pages 427‚Äì440 Filter performance parameters, such as stopband rejection and rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing the length of the filter. Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an image parameter filter design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle-iron filter. For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and Butterworth filters. In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.Hunter, page 230Matthaei et al., pages 83‚Äì84 Impedance transformer An impedance transformer is a device which makes an impedance at its output port appear as a different impedance at its input port. In waveguide, this device is simply a short length of waveguide. Especially useful is the quarter-wave impedance transformer which has a length of Œªg/4. This device can turn capacitances into inductances and vice versa.Matthaei et al., pages 144‚Äì145 It also has the useful property of turning shunt-connected elements into series-connected elements and vice versa. Series-connected elements are otherwise difficult to implement in waveguide.Matthaei et al., pages 595‚Äì596 Reflections and discontinuities Many waveguide filter components work by introducing a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission properties of the waveguide. Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point. This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction, the ratio of the two being known as the reflection coefficient. This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection. This impedance must be reactive, that is, it must be a capacitance or an inductance. It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed‚Äîit is all either transmitted onward or reflected. Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.Montgomery et al., page 162 Impedance step An impedance step is an example of a device introducing a discontinuity. It is achieved by a step change in the physical dimensions of the waveguide. This results in a step change in the characteristic impedance of the waveguide. The step can be in either the E-plane (change of height) or the H-plane (change of width) of the waveguide.Das & Das, pages 134‚Äì135 Resonant cavity filter Cavity resonator A basic component of waveguide filters is the cavity resonator. This consists of a short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected back and forth between the two ends. A given geometry of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency. The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter. The nomenclature for modes in a cavity introduces a third index, for example TE011. The first two indices describe the wave travelling up and down the length of the cavity, that is, they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide. The third index describes the longitudinal mode caused by the interference pattern of the forward travelling and reflected waves. The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths down the length of the guide. The most common modes used are the dominant modes: TE101 in rectangular waveguide, and TE111 in circular waveguide. TE011 circular mode is used where very low loss (hence high Q) is required but cannot be used in a dual-mode filter because it is circularly symmetric. Better modes for rectangular waveguide in dual-mode filters are TE103 and TE105. However, even better is the TE113 circular waveguide mode which can achieve a Q of 16,000 at . Tuning screw Tuning screws are screws inserted into resonant cavities which can be adjusted externally to the waveguide. They provide fine tuning of the resonant frequency by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide. Examples can be seen in the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw secured with jam nuts and thread-locking compound. For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted. However, when the screw has been inserted a distance Œª/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit. Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.Montgomery et al., pages 168‚Äì169 Iris Figure 5. Some waveguide iris geometries and their lumped element equivalent circuits An iris is a thin metal plate across the waveguide with one or more holes in it. It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5. An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit. A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes. These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes in the shape of a cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling. Irises are a form of discontinuity and work by exciting evanescent higher modes. Vertical edges are parallel to the electric field (E field) and excite TE modes. The stored energy in TE modes is predominately in the magnetic field (H field), and consequently the lumped equivalent of this structure is an inductor. Horizontal edges are parallel to the H field and excite TM modes. In this case the stored energy is predominately in the E field and the lumped equivalent is a capacitor.Montgomery et al., pages 162‚Äì179 It is fairly simple to make irises that are mechanically adjustable. A thin plate of metal can be pushed in and out of a narrow slot in the side of the waveguide. The iris construction is sometimes chosen for this ability to make a variable component.Bagad, page 3.41 Iris-coupled filter Figure 6. Iris-coupled filter with three irises An iris-coupled filter consists of a cascade of impedance transformers in the form of waveguide resonant cavities coupled together by irises. In high power applications capacitive irises are avoided. The reduction in height of the waveguide (the direction of the E field) causes the electric field strength across the gap to increase and arcing (or dielectric breakdown if the waveguide is filled with an insulator) will occur at a lower power than it would otherwise.Montgomery et al., page 167 Post filter Figure 7. Post filter with three rows of posts Posts are conducting bars, usually circular, fixed internally across the height of the waveguide and are another means of introducing a discontinuity. A thin post has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductor. A row of posts can be viewed as a form of inductive iris. A post filter consists of several rows of posts across the width of the waveguide which separate the waveguide into resonant cavities as shown in figure 7. Differing numbers of posts can be used in each row to achieve varying values of inductance. An example can be seen in figure 1. The filter operates in the same way as the iris-coupled filter but differs in the method of construction. Post-wall waveguide A post-wall waveguide, or substrate integrated waveguide, is a more recent format that seeks to combine the advantages of low radiation loss, high Q, and high power handling of traditional hollow metal pipe waveguide with the small size and ease of manufacture of planar technologies (such as the widely used microstrip format). It consists of an insulated substrate pierced with two rows of conducting posts which stand in for the side walls of the waveguide. The top and bottom of the substrate are covered with conducting sheets making this a similar construction to the triplate format. The existing manufacturing techniques of printed circuit board or low temperature co-fired ceramic can be used to make post-wall waveguide circuits. This format naturally lends itself to waveguide post filter designs.Xuan & Kishk, pages 1‚Äì2 Dual-mode filter A dual-mode filter is a kind of resonant cavity filter, but in this case each cavity is used to provide two resonators by employing two modes (two polarizations), so halving the volume of the filter for a given order. This improvement in size of the filter is a major advantage in aircraft avionics and space applications. High quality filters in these applications can require many cavities which occupy significant space.Hunter, pages 255‚Äì260 Dielectric resonator filter Figure 8. Dielectric resonator filter with three transverse resonators Dielectric resonators are pieces of dielectric material inserted into the waveguide. They are usually cylindrical since these can be made without machining but other shapes have been used. They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide. There is no field at the centre when the TE011 circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect. The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8. The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator. When dielectric resonators are made from a high permittivity material, such as one of the barium titanates, they have an important space saving advantage compared to cavity resonators. However, they are much more prone to spurious modes. In high-power applications, metal layers may be built into the resonators to conduct heat away since dielectric materials tend to have low thermal conductivity. The resonators can be coupled together with irises or impedance transformers. Alternatively, they can be placed in a stub-like side- housing and coupled through a small aperture. Insert filter Figure 9. Insert filter with six dielectric resonators in the E-plane. In insert filters one or more metal sheets are placed longitudinally down the length of the waveguide as shown in figure 9. These sheets have holes punched in them to form resonators. The air dielectric gives these resonators a high Q. Several parallel inserts may be used in the same length of waveguide. More compact resonators may be achieved with a thin sheet of dielectric material and printed metallisation instead of holes in metal sheets at the cost of a lower resonator Q.Jarry & Beneat, page 12 Finline filter Finline is a different kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. Finline is a variation of slot-waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal. This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design. Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths. Evanescent-mode filter It is possible to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes. This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, does not need to be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points. In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action. Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities. However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors. Corrugated-waveguide filter Figure 10. Corrugated waveguide filter with cutaway showing the corrugations inside Figure 11. Longitudinal section through a corrugated waveguide filter Corrugated- waveguide filters, also called ridged-waveguide filters, consist of a number of ridges, or teeth, that periodically reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown in figures 10 and 11. They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband, good passband matching, and a wide stopband. They are essentially low-pass designs (above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency), unlike most other forms which are usually band-pass. The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical Œª/4 distance between elements of other filter designs. Typically, they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical, but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture. In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of LC half sections. The filter operates in the dominant TE10 mode, but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present. In particular, there is little stopband attenuation of TE20 and TE30 modes.Matthaei et al., pages 380‚Äì390 Waffle-iron filter The waffle-iron filter is a variant of the corrugated-waveguide filter. It has similar properties to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE20 and TE30 modes are suppressed. In the waffle-iron filter, channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter. This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide. This pattern of teeth resembles a waffle iron, hence the name of the filter.Matthaei et al., pages 390‚Äì409 Waveguide stub filter Figure 12. Waveguide stub filter consisting of three stub resonators A stub is a short length of waveguide connected to some point in the filter at one end and short-circuited at the other end. Open-circuited stubs are also theoretically possible, but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the stub, resulting in high losses. Stubs are a kind of resonator, and the lumped element equivalent is an LC resonant circuit. However, over a narrow band, stubs can be viewed as an impedance transformer. The short- circuit is transformed into either an inductance or a capacitance depending on the stub length. A waveguide stub filter is made by placing one or more stubs along the length of a waveguide, usually Œªg/4 apart, as shown in figure 12. The ends of the stubs are blanked off to short-circuit them.Ke Wu et al., page 612 When the short-circuited stubs are Œªg/4 long the filter will be a band- stop filter and the stubs will have a lumped-element approximate equivalent circuit of parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line. When the stubs are Œªg/2 long, the filter will be a band-pass filter. In this case the lumped-element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line.Matthaei et al., pages 595‚Äì596, 726 Absorption filter Absorption filters dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material.Cristal, pages 182‚Äì183 Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.Minakova & Rud, page 1 Filter-like devices There are many applications of filters whose design objectives are something other than rejection or passing of certain frequencies. Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. However, a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes on the nature of a filter. Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks, directional couplers, power dividers, power combiners, and diplexers. Other possible applications include multiplexers, demultiplexers, negative-resistance amplifiers, and time-delay networks.Matthaei et al., pages 1‚Äì13 Impedance matching Figure 13. An orthomode transducer (a variety of duplexer) incorporating stepped impedance matching A simple method of impedance matching is stub matching with a single stub. However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency. This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications. To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on the form of a stub filter. The design proceeds as if it were a filter except that a different parameter is optimised. In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these. In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match. The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device. Stubs are not the only format of filter than can be used. In principle, any filter structure could be applied to impedance matching, but some will result in more practical designs than others. A frequent format used for impedance matching in waveguide is the stepped impedance filter. An example can be seen in the duplexer pictured in figure 13. Directional couplers and power combiners Figure 14. A multi-hole waveguide coupler Directional couplers, power splitters, and power combiners are all essentially the same type of device, at least when implemented with passive components. A directional coupler splits a small amount of power from the main line to a third port. A more strongly coupled, but otherwise identical, device may be called a power splitter. One that couples exactly half the power to the third port (a coupler) is the maximum coupling achievable without reversing the functions of the ports. Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse, whereupon they become power combiners.Lee, page 193, 201 A simple form of directional coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a Œª/4 length. This design is limited because the electrical length of the coupler will only be Œª/4 at one specific frequency. Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure.Matthaei et al., page 776 A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe-hole directional coupler in which two parallel waveguides are stacked on top of each other and a hole provided for coupling. To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied.Ishii, pages 205‚Äì206, 212,213 It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. For instance the rat-race coupler (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of Œª.Bagad, page 4.6 Diplexers and duplexers A diplexer is a device used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands into a single signal. This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device can be used to separate the signals again at the far end of the channel. The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. These problems could be overcome with the use of a directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.Maloratsky, pages 165‚Äì166 Two widely spaced narrowband signals can be diplexed by joining together the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters. Steps need to be taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance. This can be achieved by appropriate spacing. For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed Œªgb/4 from the junction where Œªgb is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed Œªga/4 from the junction. This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa. An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions. A decoupling resonator is placed Œªg/4 from the junction of each filter. This can be in the form of a short-circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter. This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands.Matthaei et al., pages 969‚Äì973 For diplexers dealing with contiguous passbands proper account of the crossover characteristics of filters needs to be considered in the design. An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands. Here a low-pass and a high- pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters. The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators. Directional filters Figure 15. A waveguide directional filter cut away to show the circular waveguide irises A directional filter is a device that combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer. As it is based on a directional coupler it is essentially a four-port device, but like directional couplers, port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally. Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function (usually band-pass). The remaining power exits port 2, and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2, in this case band-stop. In reverse, power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4. Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a directional filter. Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE10 mode provide the four ports. These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE11 mode. The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response.Matthaei et al., pages 843‚Äì847 Glossary where Œª is the wavelength the wave would have if unrestricted by the guide. For guides that are filled only with air, this will be the same, for all practical purposes, as the free space wavelength for the transmitted frequency, f.Connor, page 56}} Notes References Bibliography *Bagad, V.

Background He was the third and youngest son of Major-General John Charles Bentinck and his wife Jemima Helena, eldest daughter of Frederick de Ginkell, 6th Earl of Athlone. His older brothers were the generals William Bentinck, 3rd Count Bentinck and Charles Bentinck, 4th Count Bentinck. Early career Bentinck entered the British Army as ensign in March 1813 and was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards. He rose to lieutenant in 1820 and to captain nine years thereafter. In 1841, he was appointed an aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria with the rank of an brevet-colonel. Bentinck was promoted to major in 1846 and five years later he purchased a lieutenant-colonelship. Crimean war With the begin of the Baltic Campaign of 1854, he was transferred with his regiment to the Crimea and in June 1854 he was advanced to a major-general. Bentinck fought in the Battle of Alma in September of the latter year and having received command of the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot in the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October. A month later, he was shot in the arm in the Battle of Inkerman and then took part in the Siege of Sevastopol with the second division. Following the death of Sir George Cathcart, he was attached to the fourth division, however aftereffects of his wound delayed his accession until June 1855. Later life After his return to England he was awarded a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and a Commandeur of the French L√©gion d'honneur for his services in Russia. He was decorated with the Crimea Medal with four clasps and with the Sardinian Medal. In 1858, Bentinck obtained the 2nd class of the Turkish Order of the Medjidie. Bentinck was nominated Groom in Waiting in Ordinary to the Queen in 1859, a post he held for the next eight years. In 1860, he was promoted to lieutenant-general and in 1865, he received a commission as honorary colonel of the 1st London Artillery Volunteer Corps. He was made a full general in December 1867 and finally retired after another decade in service. Family In 1829, he married his distant cousin Renira Antoinette, the daughter of Admiral James Hawkins Whitshed. By her mother Sophia Henrietta, the daughter of John Albert Bentinck, she was just as her husband a descendant of William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland. Their marriage was childless. Bentinck died at Grosvenor Street in London on 29 September 1878, aged 82 and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His wife survived him for eleven years.

Davies and Donald W. Bouldin in 1979) is a metric for evaluating clustering algorithms. This is an internal evaluation scheme, where the validation of how well the clustering has been done is made using quantities and features inherent to the dataset. This has a drawback that a good value reported by this method does not imply the best information retrieval. Preliminaries Given n dimensional points, let Ci be a cluster of data points. Let Xj be an n-dimensional feature vector assigned to cluster Ci. : S_i = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{T_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{T_i} {\\\\left X_j-A_i\\\\right^p}\\\\right)^{1/p} Here A_i is the centroid of Ci and Ti is the size of the cluster i. Si is a measure of scatter within the cluster. Usually the value of p is 2, which makes this a Euclidean distance function between the centroid of the cluster, and the individual feature vectors. Many other distance metrics can be used, in the case of manifolds and higher dimensional data, where the euclidean distance may not be the best measure for determining the clusters. It is important to note that this distance metric has to match with the metric used in the clustering scheme itself for meaningful results. : M_{i,j} = \\\\left\\\\leftA_i-A_j\\\\right\\\\right_p = \\\\Bigl(\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\\\lefta_{k,i}-a_{k,j}\\\\right^p\\\\Bigr)^{\\\\frac 1 p} : M_{i,j} is a measure of separation between cluster C_i and cluster C_j. : a_{k,i} is the kth element of A_i, and there are n such elements in A for it is an n dimensional centroid. Here k indexes the features of the data, and this is essentially the Euclidean distance between the centers of clusters i and j when p equals 2. Definition Let Ri,j be a measure of how good the clustering scheme is. This measure, by definition has to account for Mi,j the separation between the ith and the jth cluster, which ideally has to be as large as possible, and Si, the within cluster scatter for cluster i, which has to be as low as possible. Hence the Davies‚ÄìBouldin index is defined as the ratio of Si and Mi,j such that these properties are conserved: # R_{i,j} \\\\geqslant 0 . # R_{i,j} = R_{j,i} . # When S_j \\\\geqslant S_k and M_{i,j} = M_{i,k} then R_{i,j} > R_{i,k} . # When S_j = S_k and M_{i,j} \\\\leqslant M_{i,k} then R_{i,j} > R_{i,k} . With this formulation, the lower the value, the better the separation of the clusters and the 'tightness' inside the clusters. A solution that satisfies these properties is: : R_{i,j} = \\\\frac{S_i + S_j}{M_{i,j}} This is used to define Di: : D_i \\\\equiv \\\\max_{j eq i} R_{i,j} If N is the number of clusters: : \\\\mathit{DB} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^N D_i DB is called the Davies‚ÄìBouldin index. This is dependent both on the data as well as the algorithm. Di chooses the worst-case scenario, and this value is equal to Ri,j for the most similar cluster to cluster i. There could be many variations to this formulation, like choosing the average of the cluster similarity, weighted average and so on. Explanation These conditions constrain the index so defined to be symmetric and non-negative. Due to the way it is defined, as a function of the ratio of the within cluster scatter, to the between cluster separation, a lower value will mean that the clustering is better. It happens to be the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar one, averaged over all the clusters, where the similarity is defined as Si above. This affirms the idea that no cluster has to be similar to another, and hence the best clustering scheme essentially minimizes the Davies‚ÄìBouldin index. This index thus defined is an average over all the i clusters, and hence a good measure of deciding how many clusters actually exists in the data is to plot it against the number of clusters it is calculated over. The number i for which this value is the lowest is a good measure of the number of clusters the data could be ideally classified into. This has applications in deciding the value of k in the kmeans algorithm, where the value of k is not known apriori. The SOM toolbox contains a MATLAB implementation. A MATLAB implementation is also available via the MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, using the \\"evalclusters\\" command. A Java implementation is found in ELKI, and can be compared to many other clustering quality indexes.

Frost House, also known as Asa Barnes Tavern, is an historic house at 1089 Marion Avenue in the Marion village of Southington, Connecticut, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historic significance. Asa Barnes established a tavern in this home at around 1765, when Marion Avenue was part of a north-south road connecting Bristol and New Haven. During the American Revolutionary War, in 1781, troops under French general Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau established their eighth campsite of their route nearby on French Hill, and Landlord Barnes entertained the officers in his tavern for the four nights of the encampment.H.R. Timlow, Ecclesiastical and Other Sketches of Southington, Conn., (1875) Rochambeau visited Barnes' Tavern again on the return march on October 27, 1782.David F.

Kopec, Southington, (Arcadia, 2007) The building that housed Barnes' house and tavern was partially destroyed in a fire in 1836. After the fire, the house's owner, Levi B. Frost, a local blacksmith, repaired the structure. Frost, who was later to become the proprietor of an early factory in Marion, restored the house in the Greek Revival style that was popular in the middle of the 19th century, incorporating a full pedimented gable, three-bay facade, recessed front doorway that is flanked by plain pilasters that support an entablature with projecting cyma cornice characteristic of Greek Revival buildings. What is uncharacteristic of the Greek Revival style is the building's length of 50 feet, which may be the result of the original 18th-century structure. Investigators believe that the large rear room with its well-worn chestnut planks, large cooking fireplace and stone hearth, gouged dado and separate exterior door, appears older than the rest of the house and is likely to be the pre-1836 taproom of the former tavern. The front of the building generally appears to be newer, as it bears the most characteristic details of the Greek Revival style, including wide pine floors, a front stairway rising to the left, a large front room on the right and detailing of stairway treads, risers, railing and handrail that appear to be original of the mid-century design. The house is now a private residence. In 1987 the house was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural and historical significance. It is also part of the Marion Historic District.

His parents Florentin and Philom√®ne Hugon were pious country folk. They had 13 children of which Florentin-Louis was the oldest.http://www.edizioniamiciziacristiana.it/presfuoridellachiesa.htm Accessed 8 October 2012 Formation Hugon was educated first by his mother, then in the local school where he gained a reputation as a bright and pious student. He was invited to attend the Domenicana school at Poitiers in February 1882 where he was an outstanding student. Hugon showed a special interest in Ancient Greek, especially the writings of Homer whose Iliad he had partially committed to memory, thus gaining for himself among his classmates the nickname \\"Homer's grandson\\". At eighteen years of age, having finished secondary school, he entered the Dominican Order in Rijckholt (nearby Maastricht, Holland), where the Studium of the Province of Lyons was taking refuge due to the persecutions and expulsions imposed by antagonistic members of the government. The following year he received the Dominican habit under the name Brother √âdouard. In 1898 during a trip to the United States, being inexplicably detained by his Prior, he narrowly escaped the sinking of the passenger steamship La Bourgogne of the Compagnie Generale on which he was scheduled to sail, and on which nearly 600 people drowned.http://www.edizioniamiciziacristiana.it/presfuoridellachiesa.htm Accessed 8 October 2012 He made his solemn profession on 13 January 1890 and was ordained priest on 24 September 1892. Career Hugon began his lifelong teaching career immediately after ordination. He successively taught in Rijckholt, at Rosary Hill (New York), in Poitiers (France), in Angers (France), again at Rijckholt, and finally at the Angelicum (Rome) from 1909 to 1929. He died in Rome in the latter year. Hugon was a member of the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas. On 21 March 1918 Pope Benedict XV appointed him as Consultant for the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church (now known as the Congregation for the Oriental Churches). In 1925 Pope Pius XI asked Hugon to work on the encyclical Quas primas on the kingship of Christ.http://www.edizioniamiciziacristiana.it/presfuoridellachiesa.htm Accessed 6 February 2013 He was instrumental in the causes to proclaim Saint Efrem and Saint Peter Canisius Doctors of the Church, and had a determining role in the canonization of Saint Joan of Arc. Hugon was a principal collaborator of Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, the Cardinal Secretary of State, in publishing his famous Catechism.http://www.edizioniamiciziacristiana.it/presfuoridellachiesa.htm Accessed 8 October 2012 Piety Rising each day at 4:30 Hugon celebrated Mass at 5:00 and spent the morning teaching and researching.

This document is the official pronouncement of the Catholic Church on which philosophical positions constitute Thomism, and constitutes the culmination of the Church's effort \\"to recover the real teaching of Aquinas, purifying it from distorting traditionsm, one-sidedness, and lack of historical perspective.\\"Benedict M.

Geography  The Gro√üer Knollen is located northeast of Herzberg am Harz and Scharzfeld, northwest of Bad Lauterberg im Harz and south of the hamlet of Sieber. It is surrounded by several other mountains and hills that range in height between 550 and 650 m above mean sea level. Just under 1 km away to the southwest the Kleiner Knollen rises to a height of 631 m.  Geology  The Gro√üer Knollen is a porphyritic volcano. When climbing the mountain walkers can see to the side of the path in places the reddish colouring in the rock that is due to the volcanic rock, porphyry. About 800 metres east of the Gro√üer Knollen is the Knollengrube (\\"Knollen Pit\\"), in which iron ore was mined in 1925.  Observation tower  From the roughly 20 m high observation tower, which stands next to the inn on the summit of the Gro√üer Knollen, there is a view not only over the mountain peaks of the Harz, but also southwards to the Rotenberg and Eichsfeld. In good conditions visitors can even see as far as the Thuringian Forest to the south.  Walking  Numerous walking trails radiate from the summit, including paths to Bad Lauterberg, Herzberg, Scharzfeld, Sieber and Sankt Andreasberg. The roughly 12 km long path to Sankt Andreasberg runs over a crest over 600 m high with many wonderful views. The Gro√üer Knollen is checkpoint no. 150 in the Harzer Wandernadel walking trail network.  Forest  Today the lower flanks of the Gro√üer Knollen are mainly covered by beech, but some spruce also grows in higher areas. In 1596 it was entirely covered in beech woods, in 1630 there were also some sycamores.Ina Begemann: Palynologische Untersuchungen zur Geschichte von Umwelt und Besiedlung im s√ºdwestlichen Harzvorland (unter Einbeziehung geochemischer Befunde), Dissertation zur Erlangung des Doktorgrades der Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftlichen Fakult√§ten der Georg- August-Universit√§t zu G√∂ttingen, G√∂ttingen 2003, p. 46, Weblink (pdf, 2,890 kB) See also: List of mountains and hills of Lower Saxony  Sources  * Topographic map 1:25,000 series, No. 4328 Bad Lauterberg im Harz * Topographic map 1:25,000 series, No. 4228 Riefensbeek (to determine the isolation and prominence)  References   External links  * Information about the Gro√üer Knollen * Information on the Knollengrube pit Category:Mountains of Lower Saxony Category:Mountains of the Harz Category:Osterode (district) ","title":"Gro√üer Knollen"},{"id":"25000552","text":"Fu Bingchang Fu Bingchang (; 1895‚Äì1965; known as Foo Ping-sheung) was a diplomat and politician in the early Republic of China and later in Taiwan.

The episode was written by supervising producer Matt Hubbard and directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller. It originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on November 5, 2009. Guest stars in this episode include Craig Castaldo, Nick Fondulis, Daniel Genalo, Marceline Hugot, Angela Grovey, Michael Mulheren, David Perlman, and Brian Williams. There are cameos by Gilbert Gottfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken, though, the three did not appear as themselves, but provided their voices in the episode. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) attempt to rig The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) auditions to guarantee that their preferred candidate (Fondulis) will be selected by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). Meanwhile, Jack learns a valuable lesson about humanity when he becomes infected with bedbugs. \\"Audition Day\\" has received generally good reception from television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 5.940 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.9 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) of the show TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions‚Äîin which they are in search of a new cast member on the show‚Äîby planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions. Meanwhile, Jack learns from NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that he has bedbugs. As a result of being ostracized due to his condition, and now feeling compassionate, Jack tells Liz to give everyone a chance to audition, after catching her trying to get rid of people trying out. During the audition process, Jack, Liz, and Pete witness auditions from TGS staff writers Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell), J.D. Lutz (John Lutz), NBC news anchor Brian Williams, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), the daughter of General Electric (GE) CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn), \\"Dot Com\\" Slattery (Kevin Brown), former TGS cast member Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and a robot street performer (Daniel Genalo). During Jayden's audition, Liz realizes that Jayden's supposed references‚ÄîGilbert Godfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken‚Äîwere not legit and that Jayden impersonated them. She confronts him about this, however, Jayden plans to blackmail Liz with a camera marked by her fingerprints‚Äîthat features provocative photos of Jayden, to make it look like Liz would only hire him if he would let her take pictures of his genitals. Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after he shook his hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs. Production alt=A head shot of Brian Williams, a caucasian male in his late-40s with dark hair.

The episode was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller, making it her eighth for the series. \\"Audition Day\\" originally aired in the United States on November 5, 2009, on NBC as the fourth episode of the show's fourth season and the 62nd overall episode of the series. This episode of 30 Rock was filmed on October 29, 2009.

News anchor Brian Williams, of NBC Nightly News, made his second appearance as himself with this episode, in which he auditions to become a cast member of TGS. He first appeared in the season three episode \\"The Ones\\". In one scene of \\"Audition Day\\", a homeless man keeps his distance from Jack Donaghy after Jack said he had bedbugs. The homeless man was credited as Moonvest and played by Craig Castaldo, or known as Radio Man. Castaldo has made numerous appearances on 30 Rock. At the end of the credits, Gilbert Gottfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken are credited as doing their actual voices on Liz Lemon's phone. Jack hiring the robot street performer in \\"Audition Day\\" was first introduced in the fourth- season premiere episode \\"Season 4\\". Actor Cheyenne Jackson made his 30 Rock debut as Danny Baker in \\"The Problem Solvers\\", the next episode. Jackson did not play the robot in this episode, instead actor Daniel Genalo played the character. This is the last episode to feature Lonny Ross as Josh Girard until the 100th episode. Cultural references alt=A woman with long black hair smiles and wears a black scarf and jacket. In the beginning of this episode, Jack tells Liz \\"That's what I'm talking about. Human empathy, it's as useless as the Winter Olympics ... this February on NBC.\\" Realizing Kenneth might know what is going on with the TGS auditions, Jenna floats towards him with the wind in her hair, and when Kenneth sees her he calls her \\"Vampyr!\\". Later, Jenna reveals to Liz that she has been brought into auditions, similar to what Liz and Pete are doing with rigging the TGS auditions, to make actress Kim Cattrall seem grounded and human. Jenna mentions that she met Jayden 20 years ago. The scene then flashes back to Jenna getting dissed by a young Jayden. The costume she is wearing is essentially the same costume that Jane Krakowski wore 20 years previously in the Broadway musical Starlight Express. In addition, Jayden is dressed similar to the street urchin Gavroche in Les Mis√©rables because the young boy playing that role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight. During her audition, Kathy sings as Scottish amateur singer Susan Boyle who gained worldwide attention for her performance of the song \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from the musical Les Mis√©rables on the reality show Britain's Got Talent. Kathy's performance (sung by operatic soprano Lisette Oropesa) gets Liz and Jack teared up, similar to Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent. It is revealed that Dot Com once portrayed the character Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin in Anton Chekhov's play The Seagull. When Kenneth refuses to embrace him, Jack asks him \\"Et tu, Kenneth?\\", prompting Kenneth to explain in Latin why he will not embrace Jack due to his bedbugs. During his meeting with fellow GE executives, in which Jack is not allowed to be with them due to his bedbugs condition, a telepresence system‚Äîa television screen in which the executives can be seen‚Äîis placed in Jack's office to witness the meeting. One of the executives (Michael Mulheren) asks Jack if he likes the Cisco Systems equipment, which he does, calling it \\"the gold standard by which all business technology is judged. Cisco: The Human Network\\", then after an argument with the executives, they mute him, prompting Jack to say \\"Did you just mute me!? Did you just use Cisco's cutting edge SureMute‚Ñ¢ technology to mute me!?\\" Some reviewers wondered whether or not 30 Rock continued doing more product placement with the addition of Cisco Systems, as they have done in the past with Snapple, Verizon, and SoyJoy. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Audition Day\\" was watched by 5.940 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.9 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This episode constituted a six percent drop in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Stone Mountain\\". During its original broadcast, \\"Audition Day\\" ranked third in its 9:30 p.m. slot, behind CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and ABC's Grey's Anatomy. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted \\"I use the phrase 'funny forgives a lot' in my 30 Rock reviews when an episode fails to cohere but is still entertaining. [...] That changed with 'Audition Day', which still wasn't 30 Rock at its peak but which had one perfect, hilarious sequence that almost singlehandedly redeemed the episode for me.\\" He enjoyed Jack's scene in the subway, calling it \\"the funniest moment\\" from the episode, and \\"one of the funniest things Alec Baldwin has done on the show in a long time\\". TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote that he did not enjoy Jack's plot, explaining that the bedbug bit \\"got to be a little too much\\", and much preferred Jenna and Tracy's storyline \\"because it fit in with the auditioning plot.\\" Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this was an \\"amusing episode overall\\", and was glad that it gave Scott Adsit's Pete \\"something to do\\" here. Los Angeles Times's Meredith Blake was favorable towards \\"Audition Day\\", writing it was a \\"fine return to form\\", following the airing of \\"Stone Mountain\\", which she disliked. IGN contributor Robert Canning said this episode of 30 Rock had fun, comedic chaos, and that it \\"worked well, but never quite reached the hilarity tipping point.\\" He disliked that Brian Williams' cameo was ruined by the promos \\"because the surprise of the bit would have been far funnier than what the bit actually turned out to be.\\" Canning said the auditions were \\"fun, though not a complete knockout\\", enjoyed the fact that Kathy participated in the auditions and her Susan Boyle reference \\"had great timing\\", and was \\"let down\\" by the revelation that Jayden was psychotic, noting it \\"[s]eemed like a bit of a cop out to the story as a whole.\\" In conclusion, Canning gave this episode an 8.2 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin said he did not laugh much during the broadcast of \\"Audition Day\\", but admitted he grinned during the closing segment of the episode in which Jack is in the subway along with a group quartet. Rabin said he enjoyed Brian Williams's \\"array of characters\\", during his audition, and gave this episode a B- grade rating. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that the episode \\"had a good premise ... but I wasn't really feeling the whole thing.\\" Gandert reported that the new cast member angle was \\"predictable and not too interesting, as well as the audition process in general.\\" References External links * * Category:30 Rock (season 4) episodes Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Television programs directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller ","title":"Audition Day"},{"id":"25001027","text":"General Manuel Serrano Airport () is a closed airport formerly serving Machala, the capital of El Oro Province in Ecuador.

A champion athlete in his youth, he negotiated for peace at several critical times and helped preserve the remains of several ancient leaders. Early life Naha Stone at the public library His father was Keawe-a-Heulu, chief legal counselor of Kamehameha I. His mother was High Chiefess Ululani of Hilo. His sister Keohohiwa would be great grandmother of two future monarchs. Literally nƒÅ ihe can mean \\"many spears\\" in the Hawaiian language, or \\"to have authority with a calm and quieted spear\\". His authority came because he could settle conflicts with appeals to justice that were sharper than physical weapons. Some early writers spell his name \\"Nahi\\", or call him \\"Naihe-Haiha\\" or \\"Naihenui\\". Naihe was known as a champion athlete and surfer in his early life. Historical chants and stories describe his surfing skill at Kahaluu Bay and Holualoa Bay, and of a contest in Hilo when the other chiefs were envious of his abilities. He took Kamehameha I to his mother's district of Hilo to move the Pohaku Naha, an enormous sacred stone that demonstrated Kamheameha's strength and power. He probably traveled along with Kamehameha during his conquest of the other islands, learning from his father how to give inspiring speeches to the troops. Kingdom established After the successful campaign to establish the Kingdom by the beginning of the 19th century, he settled down to what he hoped would be a quiet life with his wife Chiefess Kapiolani at Kaawaloa, at the north end of Kealakekua Bay starting about 1809. He served as magistrate of the south Kona district. The quiet was going to be interrupted with a year of great change in 1819 when King Kamehameha I died. Queen Kaahumanu declared the old traditions known as kapu were no longer in effect. In November 1819 Keaoua Kekuaokalani gathered followers of the old ways to Kaawaloa and threatened a rebellion. Hoapili and Naihe were sent to negotiate. Although Naihe respected the old traditions, he urged peace. At first, Keaoua sounded convinced, but the next morning the troops met in the battle of Kuamoo, and the rebellion was violently put down. Great changes Naihe and his wife Kapiolani at the rear of the funeral procession of Queen Ke≈çp≈´olani, 1823. At the end of 1820 he and Kapiolani followed the royal court to Lahaina and Honolulu. In Honolulu they learned to read and write with the system invented by missionaries. Previously Hawaiian only been an oral language, of which Naihe was an expert, so he quickly picked up the new skill. Naihe and Kapiolani happened to be on board a small boat that Kamehameha II suddenly ordered across the open sea to Kauai July 21, 1821. By spring of 1823 they moved back to Kaawaloa, along with the first missionaries to the island, Asa and Lucy Goodale Thurston. By 1824 they would send a boat to Kailua for a preacher to hold Sunday services in a thatched house they built near their home. In June 1823 British missionary William Ellis toured the island to survey for potential church sites. He was hosted by Naihe, and Kaawaloa was listed as one of the first places to establish a church. Naihe had an advisor or assistant named Kamakau (not to be confused with Samuel Kamakau who was younger) who told the story of the death of Captain James Cook at Kaawaloa when he was a young boy in 1779. Lord Byron returned in 1825 on with the bodies of Kamehameha II and his Queen KamƒÅmalu who had died on a state visit to England. Naihe traveled to Honolulu for the royal funeral; this was the first Hawaiian King to have a Christian memorial service. Naihe helped convene a national convention to agree on succession and discuss updating the laws. Chief Boki advocating quickly moving to the Parliamentary system he had seen in England. Naihe argued for a more moderate course; ensure stability by keeping existing laws, but adopt the more democratic system over time. Naihe lived among the people and knew the costs of social change. The official legislative body of the Kingdom was not defined until the 1840 Constitution. Byron called Naihe's district \\"one of the most civilized of the Sandwich Islands.\\" In July 1825 Naihe led the British to the ancient religious site called Puuhonua o H≈çnaunau and let them remove most of the wooden carvings and other relics at the Hale o Keawe burial site. Byron considered them \\"pagan symbols\\". When the Blonde left Hawaii for the last time on July 18, 1825, Naihe and his wife were there to say goodbye, being called \\"hospitable friends\\". Missionary Samuel Ruggles On September 27, 1826, Naihe gave a speech at the dedication of the first wood-framed Mokuaikaua Church in Kailua-Kona. In 1827 he decreed that all marriages in his district should be done by a minister. When the missionary Samuel Ruggles in 1828 wanted to move to a cooler higher elevation, Naihe allowed the missionaries to build on some of his farm land, which would eventually become a prime Kona coffee area. In 1829 Mrs. Gerit Judd visited the ruins of Hale o Keawe with Kapiolani and Naihe. After seeing the destruction, the remaining bones were put into two large coffins and hidden in a cave, until moved in 1858 to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii known as Mauna 'Ala. In November 1829 the arrived, on the first trip around the world by a ship of the U.S. Navy. The ship chaplain was Samuel Stewart, a former missionary to Hawaii. Naihe and Kapiolani welcomed them and served the officers tea in their home. On April 1, 1831 Naihe was appointed Governor of Hawaii island while John Adams Kuakini restored order on Oahu island after a rumored rebellion by Kuini Liliha. Naihe died in November or December 29, 1831, after a stroke of paralysis forty-four hours before. Lucy Goodale Thurston described Naihe as: > \\"He was of commanding stature, and distinguished for refinement and polish > of mind and manners. Such was his fluency and eloquence in speech that he > was styled the national orator. ...As a magistrate he was as firm as he was > affectionate, and in passing sentence upon offenders, the tears were often > down his cheek seen chasing each other in quick succession down his cheeks.\\" Legacy Cook Monument near his house site Residents of the Kona district tell stories of Kai mimiki o Naihe, the \\"roiling sea of Naihe\\", which was probably the tsunami after the 1868 Hawaii earthquake, or another about this time, which caused damage to the area. Various monuments to Captain Cook were constructed in front of Naihe's former home at the edge of the bay. The first was by Lord Byron in 1825, and a more permanent one in 1874. The village was abandoned, and the area is now on the National Register of Historic Places as the Kealakekua Bay Historic District and a state historic park. Stephanie N. Naihe Laxton of Kohala is said to be a direct descendant of Naihe. She is a member of the Royal Society of Ka'ahumanu, one of four royal societies which existed during the Kingdom of Hawai'i aka: 'Ahahui Ka'ahumanu, Chapter 7 in Kohala. She founded a non-profit group called ''Maika'i Kamakani 'O Kohala'' (\\"fine winds of Kohala, Hawaii\\") to protect and preserve traditions and customs of the Hawaiian community. \\"John W. Naihe\\" was a member of the House of Representatives of the Kingdom from 1856 to 1873. This \\"Naihe of Kohala\\", a descendant of the ancient priest Paao is said be connected with \\"Naihe of Kaawaloa\\". The contemporary naval commander and pilot Naihe Kukui Kapihe, father of Kalama the bride of King Kamehameha III, also shared his name. There are also several people with the \\"Naihe\\" surname that live in the Kona area where this Naihe lived. Naihe's estates and the magistrate position were inherited by Chiefess Kapiolani, who donated some of the land for the Kahikolu Church. On her death, many lands passed to Naihe's grand-niece Analea KeohokƒÅlole, matriarch of the KalƒÅkaua Dynasty.

My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule.\\" ‚Äî Nas, \\"N.Y. State of Mind\\", 1994 When rapping, MCs use braggadocio to boast‚Äîto speak about themselves with great pride. Braggadocio may include subjects such as physicality, fighting ability, financial riches, sexual prowess, or \\"coolness\\". Often heavily used in battle rap, braggadocio lyrics can range from just saying, \\"I'm the best MC ever,\\" to using elaborate phraseology and wit. Competition from the old-school hip hop ethic partially explains why braggadocio is used in rap‚Äî\\"my shit is better than yours and that's the bottom line,\\" said MC Esoteric. Gangsta rap helped develop the idea of a \\"larger-than-life\\" persona, sometimes to a comedic extreme; however, reading braggadocio literally and seeing it as integral to rap may suppress vulnerability, i.e. an artist's ability to connect emotionally. Braggadocio may also reflect young black men's relief with being given an audience‚Äîrapper Murs said, \\"when you get the microphone, you want to pump yourself up.\\" Unlike other bragging by young men about sex, wealth, and physical strength, the subject of rap's braggadocio can also be self- referential‚Äîtalking about the rapper's artistic or poetic ability. Paul Edwards's book How to Rap explains a short but complex example of braggadocio: Calling himself Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, then saying \\"no Omega\\" (the last letter), Rakim is suggesting that his flow could last forever‚Äîthat he starts without ever stopping. The term did not originate as a rap term; its origins are much older. The term originated in the late 16th century and denotes a boaster. It is from Braggadocchio, the name of a braggart in Spenser's The Faerie Queene. It is a composite of the word brag or braggart, and the Italian suffix -occio, denoting something large of its kind.

Biography Jack Wolfe was born in Omaha, Nebraska on January 14, 1924, to Blanche and Everett L. Wolfe. He grew up in Brockton, MA. He left school with an interest in pursuing a career in commercial illustration. Upon matriculating at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) at the age of 18, he developed an interest in fine art and painting. He described this change of direction by referencing the following experience: \\"One day, for the first time, I saw an exhibition of modern French art. It was like being struck by lightning.\\" At this time, he was particularly interested in the work of a number of European modernists, including Roualt, C√©zanne, Braque, Modigliani, and Picasso. Following his time at RISD, he completed a Master‚Äôs in Fine Arts degree at the Museum of Fine Arts School in Boston, MA, and was awarded a traveling scholarship in 1958-59, which allowed him to set up studio in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and then in San Francisco, California. Following his arts education, Wolfe returned to Boston, where he supported himself working as a truck driver, carpenter, and laborer; designing silverware chests, and as a restorer (with Gustav Klimann). In a review of his first solo show, a critic wrote: \\"It seems odd that such sensitive work is done by a painter who must spend part time driving a truck.\\" In the 1950s and 1960s, he was associated with a group of artists known as the Boston Expressionists. His work combined abstract expressionist, cubist and hard-edge techniques, often exploring geometry and depth with a highly saturated and unusual color palette.Bernhard, Pam, Enigmatic Figures. Folio, November,1982. In addition to abstract works, he was equally interested in portraiture, and painted many portraits from life. His portraiture was shown in a well-received joint exhibition with Elaine de Kooning in 1965. In Boston, his work was represented by the Margaret Brown gallery. Brown‚Äôs gallery showed artists from New York and New England as well as European artists, including Gyorgy Kepes, Congur Metcalf, and Alexander Calder.

Detail showing the binding of serpent's head and tail, with the runes fa√æur sin (\\"their father\\") carved on the tail. S√∂ 194 is the Rundata designation for a runic inscription on a memorial runestone located in Br√∂ssike, which is about 12 kilometers northeast of Str√§ngn√§s, S√∂dermanland County, Sweden, which was in the historic province of S√∂dermanland. There are many such memorial runestones in Scandinavia. While the tradition of carving inscriptions into boulders began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, most runestones date from the late Viking Age. Description Carved into a granite boulder that is 1.4 meters in height, this unsigned inscription has been attributed to the runemaster Balle, who was active during the last half of the eleventh century. The text of the inscription lies within a serpent band, a motif common on many memorial runestones. At the bottom of the inscription, there is a binding around the head and tail of the serpent as if to keep the serpent bound to the surface of the stone. The runestone is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp. This is the classification for inscriptions with runic bands that end with serpent or animal heads depicted as seen from above. The runic text states that the stone was raised by two sons named Ingimundr and √ûjalfi in memory of their father √ûorketill. The Old Norse name Ingimundr means \\"Tutelage of Youth.\\". √ûjalfi means \\"Digger\\" or \\"Delver,\\" and √ûj√°lfi was the name of a servant or follower of the Norse god Thor that is listed in the Prose Edda. The name √ûorketil signifies a \\"Vessel or Kettle of Thor,\\" possibly a type of sacrificial cauldron. The Poetic Edda poem Hymiskvi√∞a has a story in which Thor fetches a large cauldron to brew ale.

The doctrine is unique to the law of the United States and apportions liability among the manufacturers according to their share of the market for the product giving rise to the plaintiff's injury.Henderson, J.A. et al. The Torts Process, Seventh Edition.\\" Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007, p. 125 Origins Market share liability was introduced in the California case Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories. In Sindell, the plaintiffs were injured by DES, a drug prescribed to prevent miscarriage. The mothers of the plaintiffs had taken DES while pregnant, and expert testimony showed this to be a proximate cause of reproductive tract cancers in the plaintiffs years later. The plaintiffs, however, could not ascertain which drug company distributed the DES taken by their mothers. The court responded by allowing the plaintiffs to apportion liability among the defendant drug companies according to their respective shares in the DES market. Requirements Sindell laid out the requirements for applying the doctrine of market share liability: First, the defendants in court must constitute substantially all of the market. This is a distinguishing factor from alternative liability that requires that all of the defendants be in court (See Summers v. Tice). Having \\"substantially all\\" of the market makes it more likely that the actual wrongdoer will be in court. A main reason for not requiring all of the relevant market is that as time passes, some manufacturers drop out of the market, and it would raise the bar for the plaintiff too high. Also if all defendants were present, then market share liability would be unnecessary, because the plaintiff would be able to apply the doctrine of alternative liability to put the burden of proving causation onto the defendants. Second, the products must be fungible (i.e. interchangeable‚Äîthey must be of the same composition). For example, in Skipworth v. Lead Industries Association, 690 A.2d 169 (Pa. 1997), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that the lead paint the defendants sold to not be fungible because the paints had lead pigments containing different chemical formulations, different amounts of lead, and differed in potential toxicity. Third, the defendants (potential tortfeasors) must all have been in the market within the specific timeframe surrounding the incident. Fourth, the inability to point to a specific tortfeasor must not be the plaintiff's fault. This is particularly relevant in the pharmaceuticals context, as most plaintiffs are prescribed generic drugs and thus have no knowledge of who manufactured the product. Exculpatory evidence Jurisdictions and courts differ on the possibilities open to defendants to absolve themselves of market share liability. In Sindell (California), the court allowed defendants to bring forth exculpatory evidence and thus free themselves of liability. However, in Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly & Co. (New York), the court refused to allow exculpatory evidence because it felt that doing so would undermine the theory underpinning market share liability‚Äîbecause liability is based on relevant market share, providing exculpatory evidence will not reduce a defendant's overall share of the market. Subsequent cases Sindell required plaintiffs to join defendant drug companies in a single action. A Wisconsin court took a different approach on this issue in Collins v. Eli Lilly Co. In Collins, the court found that the plaintiff could bring a cause of action against a single defendant, and the burden of proof would be shifted to the defendant to show that they did not produce the DES taken by the plaintiff's mother.Henderson, p. 126 Efforts to expand the market share approach beyond DES cases have been mostly rejected because the strict requirements of applying market share liability. Courts have declined to expand the market-share approach to asbestos (Becker v. Baron Bros.), handguns (Hamilton v. Beretta), and lead paint (Santiago v. Sherwin Williams Co.). The market-share approach has been expanded to cases involving MTBE in the New York case In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether.Gilberti, Frank J.

A pioneer of the First Aliyah, Belkind founded the Biluim, a group of Jewish idealists aspiring to settle in the Land of Israel with the political purpose to redeem Eretz Yisrael and re-establish the Jewish State on it. Biography Israel Belkind was born in the region surrounding Minsk in Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire. He received a Hebrew education from his father, who was a leader in the movement which promoted Hebrew education in Russia. Belkind also attended a Russian gymnasium and initially intended to attend university. However, the wave of anti-semitic attacks and pogroms against Jews in southern Russia on 1881 instead led him to become intensively involved in Zionist activities. In 1929, Belkind died in Berlin where he had gone to seek medical treatment. His body was brought back to Palestine for burial. He was interred in Rishon LeZion. Zionist activism Belkind organized the first organized group of Biluim on 21 January 1882, with the aim of promoting settlement in Ottoman Palestine. To this end, he invited a group of fourteen Jewish ex-university students from Kharkov to his home and together they formed the group which was originally called DAVIO, an acronym for the Hebrew words from Exodus, \\"Speak unto the children of Israel that they will go forward\\". Belkind later changed the name to BILU, an acronym for the words from Isaiah, \\"Beit Yaakov Lechu V'nelcha,\\" \\"House of Jacob, come and we will go\\" (). The group shunned diplomatic or political channels, with their sole goal being to settle in Palestine. These first group of Bilu pioneers arrived at Palestine in July, 1882. He worked first in Mikveh Yisrael and Rishon LeTzion, and then moved to Gedera, the first official Bilu community. Belkind, however, was unable to adjust to agricultural labor, and therefore, devoted himself to education. Belkind was the key leader in the Yishuv's protest movement against representatives of Baron Rothschild. Belkind proposed a name for the agricultural moshava of Rehovot based on the Book of Genesis: \\"And he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land'.\\" ().Rehovot keeps an eye on the past as it looks to the future, Jerusalem Post Pedagogic career His first teaching post was at a private school in Jaffa, and he then moved to Jerusalem where he taught at the Alliance isra√©lite universelle. In 1904, Israel Belkind established an educational institute in the village of Meir Shfeya, which took in orphans from the Kishinev pogrom. This made it the first youth village in the country. He called it Kiryat Sefer. However, after two years of dispute with the Edmond James de Rothschild's emissaries at the colony, Belkind was prompted to move the children to Ben Shemen.Orphanage which became a youth village - Ynetnews, August 5, 2009 Literary career Belkin published several textbooks and wrote for contemporary journals. He was the editor of HaMeir, a monthly publication on settlement and the Yishuv. He published his memoirs, \\"The First Steps of the Jewish Settlement in Palestine\\" (1918) in the United States during World War I. In 1928 he published a geographical work in Russian, The Land of Israel Today, as well as an anthropological work on the Palestinian Arabs in Hebrew, Arabs in Eretz Israel, a book in which he advances the ideas that the Arabs of Palestine are descended from the ancient Hebrews and that the dispersion of Jews after the destruction of the Temple by the Roman general Titus is a \\"historic error\\" that must be corrected, for it dispersed much of the land's Jewish community around the world, while those \\"workers of the land that remained attached to their land\\" were eventually converted to Christianity and then Islam.Dear Brothers, Haaretz [in Hebrew] He therefore, argued that this historical wrong must be corrected by embracing the local Arabs as their own and proposed the opening of Hebrew schools for Muslim Arabs of Palestine to teach them Arabic, Hebrew and universal culture.Israel Belkind, \\"Arabs in Eretz Israel\\", Hermon Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1969, p.8 References External links * *Israel Belkind family album - Rishon LeTzion Category:1861 births Category:1929 deaths Category:People from Lahoysk District Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the Ottoman Empire Category:Bilu Category:Belarusian Zionists Category:Jewish writers Category:Jewish historians Category:Jewish educators Category:Jews in Ottoman Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine ","title":"Israel Belkind"},{"id":"25001398","text":"Dyfnwal may refer to: * Dyfnwal Hen (fl. 6th century), King of Alt Clut * Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde (died 908√ó915) * Dyfnwal ab Owain (died 975), King of Strathclyde See also *Dumnagual (disambiguation) ","title":"Dyfnwal"},{"id":"25001411","title":"Crossover (song)"},{"id":"25001435","text":"thumb thumb The Nyg√•rd Bridge () is a series of parallel bridges that cross Str√∏mmen, the sound entering Store Lungeg√•rdsvannet, in Bergen, Norway.

The Kagyed dance is performed on the 28th and 29th day of the 10th month of the Tibetan Calendar which usually falls in early December. The Kagyed dance symbolizes destruction of the evil forces by burning effigies made of wood, flour, and paper. Practitioners also pray for peace and prosperity for every Sikimmese home. Annually the festival is performed by the monks at the Tsuklakhang Palace two days before Sikkimese new year. The festival is associated with the Pang Lhabsol, practised not only at Tsuklakhang Palace but at Ralang Monastery and some other monasteries in Sikkim where earlier celebrations are held in mid-September in honor of Mount Khangchendzonga, and then finalized by the Kagyed in early December. Although the dance is very serious in nature, jesters perform in between to provide comic relief.

He was stabbed to death in December 2001 right in front of a Police Station in Ile Ife, Nigeria. In May 2002, eleven suspects were arraigned for the killing. In August, seven additional suspects were arrested. By the end of 2002, the original eleven had been freed on bail, but the incident remained under investigation.  Killings  Odunayo Olagbaju was bludgeoned to death in broad day light in his Ile-ife home town, sparking riots in which at least five people were reported killed. The dead included a local Alliance for Democracy (AD) chairman. A spokesman for the Ife community, Prince Olakunle Aderemi, said that Olagbaju mentioned a commissioner in the Akande cabinet, a member of the House of Representatives and a member of the State House of Assembly as responsible for the attack before he died \\"at the doorstep of Nigeria Police, Moore, Ile-Ife\\".  Motive for killings  The killing may have been related to a quarrel between governor Bisi Akande of Osun State and deputy governor Iyiola Omisore. Odunayo Olagbaju was a staunch supporter of Iyiola Omisore. The murder was followed a few days later by the killing of Bisi Akande's supporter, Bola Ige, the Justice Minister of Nigeria. After an emergency cabinet meeting, the Nigerian government deployed troops to prevent further violence. One of the suspects in the Bola Ige murder said Iyiola Omisore had become close to Olagbaju, and under-wrote a part of his campaign expenses. Sometime in 2001, Iyiola Omisore told Odunayo Olagbaju that he was crossing over to the People's Democratic Party (PDP), which would back him as candidate for the Osun State governorship. Odunayo Olagbaju and all of Omisore's supporters also crossed over. In August 2003, Chief Joseph Obadare of the PDP said that Olagbaju alerted the police about threats to his life but the police refused to come to his rescue before his assassins struck.  Conviction and release  The two convicted in connection to the killing were giving a prerogative pardon by the governor of Osun state Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, during his one-year anniversary in office.

However, he warmed to the Protestant Episcopal Church while still a very young man. Empie worked during his years as a student at Union College in Schenectady, as well as studied under Eliphalet Nott and Benjamin Allen. Despite his busy work schedule and some health issues, he graduated with honors in 1807. Empie lived in Rhinebeck and Hempstead, New York, for the next two years where he studied for the ministry and taught in the Classical Academy of the Rev. Seth Hart, as well as tutored the children of Thomas Tillotson, Secretary of State of New York. The Rev. John Henry Hobart, soon to be Bishop of New York, became Empie's mentor during this time. Ministry Empie was ordained deacon in 1809, then admitted into the priesthood. The Rt. Rev. Benjamin Moore, father of Clement Clarke Moore, a seminary professor and the author of \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\", led Empie's ordination service. His first assignment was St. George's Church in Hempstead, where he assisted the rector, Seth Hart. By this time, Empie was known for his superior thought processes, but he continued to be plagued health problems doctors diagnosed as \\"rheumatism.\\" Word of Empie's intellectual and inspirational sermons traveled fast. In 1810, St. James' Church, established 1729 in Wilmington, North Carolina, called him as their rector. To sweeten the deal, they vestry offered him a summer residence on breezy Wrightsville Sound, and suggested he could augment his $1200 a year salary by teaching at a local private school. Empie moved to Wilmington in 1811. The small congregation delighted in his mental calisthenics and supported him in his many projects. The young rector helped revitalize what he helped organize as the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina: conducting a census of North Carolina Episcopalians, as well as fighting to abolish the practice of creating vestries by public election. In 1814, the newly married Empies (see below) moved to West Point, NY, where the groom started a new job as professor of ethics, treasurer, and as the first chaplain of the U. S. Military Academy. Superintendent Joseph Gardner Swift, who had become acquainted with Empie during his work on North Carolina's coastal defenses in the War of 1812, arranged for Empie's employment at West Point. In 1816, the Empies returned to Wilmington, and to St. James Church. A year later, with the help of the Rev. Bethel Judd, Adam Empie succeeded in organizing the Diocese of North Carolina. Its first bishop, John Stark Ravenscroft, called Empie, \\"That emphatic preacher.\\" Over the next ten years, St. James Church experienced enormous growth. Empie created associations to educate the poor and to provide them with Bibles and books of their own. Also, he organized an effort to create a parochial library. Empie's strong approach, doubtless, influenced many, but especially moved two of his wife's relatives. Ann Eliza's cousin, a businessman named Thomas Wright, left his work to become a minister. He served churches in Wadesboro and Salisbury, before moving to Memphis where he founded Calvary Church in 1832. Ann Eliza's brother, Thomas Henry Wright, was a layman at St. James in Wilmington, and at Mt. Lebanon Chapel, a summer chapel he built on Wrightsville Sound. The chapel, now owned by St. James, is the oldest house of worship in New Hanover County. In 1827, the growing Empie family moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, where the Rev. William Holland Wilmer (like Empie an opponent of slavery) had died unexpectedly. Empie served there as rector of Bruton Parish Church. He also taught classes in belles letters, logic, and ethics and served as 11th president of the College of William and Mary. In 1830, Empie received an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina. During his decade in Williamsburg, enrollment increased,Minor T. Weisiger, Donald R. Traser, E. Randolph Trice, Margaret T. Peters, Not Hearers Only: A history of St. James's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia 1835-1985 (Richmond, 1986) p. 13 and William Barton Rogers became his prot√©g√©. The development of a quality technical school had always been one of Empie's pet projects, but the College of William & Mary had for decades been suffering financially. He sent Rogers out on a fund raising campaign in Boston for that purpose - and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the eventual result, rather than revitalization in Virginia. Family life and slavery On March 24, 1814, Empie married a 15-year-old Southern girl, Ann Eliza Wright. The daughter of Judge Joshua Grainger Wright, she grew up in a gracious home across the street from the church and, like Empie, spent summers on Wrightsville Sound. The Empies ultimately became parents to 12 children before Ann Eliza Empie died in 1843, but only eight lived to adulthood, and only John Joshua Empie, Anna Catharina Shepard, Adam Empie Jr., Susan Wright Smead, Charles Wright Empie, Lucy Wooster Brown and Ann Smith Hill survived their parents. Despite Empie's outspoken opposition to slavery, he received several slaves when he married Ann Eliza. Empie freed his slaves, but he treated them so kindly they refused to leave him. The most beloved of their slaves were buried in the Empie plot at Oakdale, a white cemetery in Wilmington. Later, Empie's opposition to slavery, and service to his African-American parishioners, caused friction at Bruton Parish and the College of William & Mary. When Empie baptised, married and buried \\"Africans\\" and invited them to worship services, other parishioners resisted.Francis L. Hawks, \\"A Narrative of Events Connected with the Rise and Progress of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia\\", in Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of the United States, 2 vols [New York: Harper and Brothers, 1836], I), available at https://archive.org/details/contributionstoe01hawk Empie appealed to Bishop William Meade (a fellow member of the American Colonization Society) as well as the Virginia State Legislature. His actions were upheld, but life became so unpleasant for him in Williamsburg that he resigned and moved his family to Raleigh. The William & Mary trustees selected 1820 graduate and prolific slavery apologist Thomas Roderick Dew to succeed Empie as the college's 12th president. Empie taught at Raleigh's Episcopal High School from 1836 until 1838, as Virginia once again debated slavery's role at its Constitutional Convention. Later career Empie served in Richmond during the final sixteen years of his ministry (1837 to 1853). In 1843, his wife died in Richmond and he returned her for burial in her family's plot at Wilmington's Oakdale cemetery. Nonetheless, he managed to scrimp enough funds to send his namesake son to the University of Virginia after a term at the United States Military Academy at West Point; Adam Empie Jr. graduated in 1845 and became a lawyer in Virginia. While in Richmond, Rev. Empie organized St. James's Church, named after his beloved post in Wilmington, and not far from the slave jail at Shockoe Bottom. Empie also established a private school for young men in Richmond, encouraged the creation of slave galleries in the city's existing white churches, and founded a slave mission on Broad Street that taught Bible lessons. Empie's favorite Bible verse still graces the entrance and altar of St. James's in Richmond: \\"Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only.\\" During his ministry in Richmond, Empie kept close business and personal ties with Wilmington. His business ventures consisted mostly of property and business ownership that came to him from his wife's family. He also received royalties from a book of his sermons that sold well in the Northern states. Death and legacy In 1853 as a widower, Empie returned to live in Wilmington, where his son Adam had married and moved his legal practice, to \\"seek repose in the society of his children.\\" His last years were spent in excruciating pain from rheumatism. He spent most of his time praying and meditating. At the very end, he lost his ability to speak, but could still write in a feeble hand. His last words, written shortly before his death on November 6, 1860, were \\"To die is gain.\\" He is buried with his wife in Oakdale cemetery. North Carolina erected a historical marker in his memory. His papers are at the Manuscripts and Rare Books Department, Swem Library, College of William and Mary, as well as the U. S. Military Academy, and the Lower Cape Fear Historical Society. The New Hanover County Public Library has a portrait, over which it asserts copyright.

He is the founder and director of the Centre for Research in Social Simulation (University of Surrey), author of several books on computational social science, social simulation and social research and past editor of the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS), the leading journal in the field. Career A Cambridge engineering graduate (Emmanuel College), he turned to the sociology of scientific knowledge for his PhD under the direction of Michael Mulkay. He was a lecturer at the University of York (1974‚Äì76) and then joined the University of Surrey where he became a professor in the Department of Sociology in 1991. At the University of Surrey he founded the Social and Computer Sciences research group in 1984 with a grant from the Alvey Programme. The group focused on applying social science to the design of intelligent knowledge-based systems. Later he established the Centre for Research in Social Simulation (1997), and the Digital World Research Centre (1998). He served as a Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Surrey (1998‚Äì2005) and he is the current Director of its Institute of Advanced Studies. In 2017, he was appointed a member of the Council of the Economic and Social Research Council. Work Sociology of scientific knowledge Gilbert and Mulkay (1984) is a key contribution on the use of discourse analysis methods in the sociology of scientific knowledge. By applying discourse analysis to extensive qualitative data on a scientific dispute in the field of chemistry, Gilbert and Mulkay account for the social processes that underpin knowledge production, especially when consensus has not yet been established within the scientific community. Secondary analysis of large government datasets With Sara Arber, he was a pioneer in the use for academic analysis of computer files of survey data collected by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, a data source that has now become commonplace in sociology. Access to social security information The regulations determining what claimants of UK welfare benefits are entitled to (e.g. income support, tax credits, Disability Living Allowance) are complicated and often very difficult for claimants to apprehend unaided. With the growing availability of personal computers in the 1980s, he realised that an interactive program, designed for claimants themselves to use, could be helpful. He developed a prototype, which was taken up by both the then Department of Health and Social Security and Citizens Advice Bureaux, and which was the forerunner of the systems nowadays routinely used in advice centres. This work also contributed to understanding the interface requirements for publicly accessible computer systems, using graphical interfaces and, later, speech dialogue interfaces . Social simulation Nigel Gilbert is one of the founders of modern computational sociology, a discipline that merges social science research with simulation techniques with the goal of modelling complex policy issues and fundamental aspects of human societies. His first work in this area was a project on modelling the emergence of organised society in prehistoric France, with Jim Doran . While this was only moderately successful, it led him to organise in 1992 the first of an influential series of workshops on 'Simulating Societies‚Äô Later he established: * the SIMSOC mailing list. In May 2016 the list had 1220 subscribers. * the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS), which was launched in 1998 to provide a publication outlet for simulation-based research. Professor Gilbert was the editor until 2014. JASSS is an online no-fee Open Access journal. In 1997, CRESS received funding from the FAIR programme of the European Commission for a project called IMAGES: Improving agri-environmental policies‚Äìa simulation approach to the role of the cognitive properties of farmers and institutions (1997‚Äì2000). This was the first of many Commission funded projects using social simulation to which he contributed , such as SEIN , FIRMA , SIMWEB , EMIL , NEMO , NEWTIES , PATRES , QLectives , ePolicy , TellMe , GLODERS and P2Pvalue . In 1999, Nigel Gilbert and Klaus G. Troitzsch published Simulation for the social scientist, the first \\"how to\\" text book on social simulation and, in 2008, Agent-based Models, now one of the standard references on agent-based modelling. Other research and advisory activity In 1993, Gilbert founded the journal Sociological Research Online. This pioneered the use of the web as a medium for academic publication. He is founding editor of Social Research Update, a quarterly publication of the University of Surrey. He and Stuart Peters created a journal management system, epress, originally to make running Sociological Research Online and JASSS easier, but now available commercially and used by about 40 journals. In 2016, he became the Director of a newly established Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus (CECAN) . The Centre, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Natural Environment Research Council with the support of DECC, DEFRA, the Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency, will pioneer, test and promote innovative evaluation approaches and methods across nexus problem domains, such as biofuel production or climate change, where food, energy, water and environmental issues intersect. Beside his research activity, he has served on a number of government and national committees: as the Deputy Chairman of the Manufacturing, Production and Business Processes Foresight Panel (1994‚Äì99), Deputy Chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council's Research Priorities Board (1997‚Äì2000) and on the Advisory Group of the Foresight Intelligent Infrastructures Project, as well as on many research council boards, both in the UK and abroad. As Chairman of the Royal Academy of Engineering's Group on Privacy and Surveillance, he published Dilemmas of Privacy and Surveillance: Challenges of Technological Change (2007). He was a member of the Sociology sub-panel for the 2001 and 2008 Research Assessment Exercises (RAE). From 2012 to 2016, he was a member of the Social Science Expert Panel for DEFRA and DECC. The panel's purpose was to bring high quality, multi-disciplinary social science advice to both departments. In 2016, it was replaced by the Social Science Expert Group (SSEG), a sub-group of the DEFRA Science Advisory Council, and he continues to be a member of this. He is member of the European Commission's Advisory Group for the Future and Emerging Technologies programme Awards and scientific recognitions In 1999, he was appointed Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in recognition of his work as \\"a pioneer of the application of computer modelling to social science\\", becoming the first practising social scientist to become a Fellow. He was awarded a Doctor of Science degree by the University of Cambridge in 2003. He is also a Fellow of the British Computer Society and of the Royal Society of Arts and a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences (for which he served as a Council Member). From 2004 to 2006, he was President of the European Social Simulation Association (ESSA). Gilbert was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to engineering and the social sciences.

History The station was awarded a two-year trial licence by the Australian Communications and Media Authority after the closure of previous Perth community station licence holder Access 31 in 2008 followed by an apparatus licence at the end of April 2009. On 4 November 2009 Communications Minister Stephen Conroy approved a digital TV only licence which allows West TV to broadcast with other community television stations which are planning to simulcast their services until the switch to digital-only television in capital cities by 2014. On 1 April 2010, the first video test was performed, with a testcard and then a promotional video loop going to air. In September 2014, Australian federal communications minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that licensing for community television stations would end in December 2015. In September 2015, Turnbull, now Prime Minister, announced an extension of the deadline to 31 December 2016. The deadline was further extended twice at the last minute by Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield, first to 30 June 2017, and later to 31 December 2017. Fifield made an additional extension to 30 June 2018 as part of the government's deal with the Nick Xenophon Team to garner support for large- scale media reforms in the Senate, while a further extension, announced on 1 June 2018, gave broadcasters an additional two years through 30 June 2020. WTV, like other community television stations, later began streaming its channel live on their website, which allowed access to viewers outside of its traditional broadcast area. On 20 February 2020 the station announced that it was forced to cease broadcasting on free-to-air television due to financial difficulties. The station will continue to engage with viewers and the community through social media and YouTube however. A GoFundMe campaign was also launched to try and raise $30,000 for facilities, equipment and administration costs. Programming West TV featured a broad range of programs broadcast around the clock, seven days a week. The programming reflected the diversity and needs of the Perth community and included documentaries, films, sport, music, education, religion, multicultural, entertainment, leisure and lifestyle programs. While the focus is on WA-based programming, some programs are sourced from interstate community channels and from other professional programme makers world-wide. Local programming included the entertainment show Friday Night Live and current affairs program Undercurrent. West TV also broadcast classic movies and television shows and also live programming and news bulletins from Deutsche Welle, Al Jazeera English, RT World News. West TV was given the broadcast rights to the world exclusive concert for UK superstar Sir Cliff Richard & The Shadows; the concert was screened in June 2010. West TV also produced local outside broadcasts such as the Tom Hoad Cup VIII international water polo tournament which was held in Melville.

Schober was born to Austrian parents in Sweden. Educated in the Schnepfenthal Salzmann School, Akademisches Gymnasium (Vienna) and Kremsm√ºnster Abbey, he returned to Vienna, where he began to study philosophy and met the composer Franz Schubert, his friends Johann Mayrhofer, Joseph von Spaun and the painters Leopold Kupelwieser and Moritz von Schwind. Between 1823 and 1825, Schober was an actor at the theatre in Breslau under the pseudonym \\"Torupson\\". In the 1840s, Schober was in close contact with Franz Liszt. In 1856 he married the author Thekla von Gumpert; afterwards he lived in Budapest, Munich and Dresden.

Earlier bridges The earliest record of a wooden bridge over the River Hebble is in 1277. A stone bridge recorded in 1719 collapsed on Rogation Day in April 1770 during a beating the bounds ceremony causing many injuries. Matthew Oates of Northowram began work on a new bridge in 1772, using stone from quarries in Crib Lane. This long six-arch bridge, wide and above the river, which carried the turnpike road was opened in 1774. There was a toll- booth at the north end. Iron palisades were fitted after a Mr Asquith of Hipperholme was pushed from the bridge and killed by an unknown attacker in 1819. Part of this bridge collapsed because of flash flooding on 23 July 1855. It was demolished in 1870 to make way for the new bridge. Design and construction North Bridge was designed in Victorian Gothic style by brothers John and James Fraser of Leeds. John had considerable experience of railway bridge design. Two spans of semi-elliptical arch ribs are supported by stone piers with ecclesiastical style buttresses, carrying a wide roadway. There are lancets in the spandrels. The parapets are richly decorated with quatre-foil piercings with central Maltese crosses and tri-foil pattern railings above with a crenellated top rail. The mainly cast iron parapet ribs have a wrought iron central section of . The central pier stands high and the bridge was built higher than its predecessor so that the Halifax and Ovenden Joint Railway could pass underneath the northern end. North Bridge Station was just east of the bridge, extending under it. A drinking fountain, named for James Oates who worked on the bridge, is set into the south west turret of the bridge. The cost of the bridge was ¬£21,000 or 17 shillings and six pence per square foot of roadway, claimed to be the cheapest bridge in England at the time. Opening ceremony The southern bridge pier The bridge was opened on 25 October 1871 amid scenes of confusion as local people, given a half-day holiday, swarmed over the bridge well in advance of the official opening by the mayor. The mayor and corporation and the borough's MP, together with the Halifax Artillery and Rifle Volunteers and a detachment of the 2nd West Yorkshire Yeomanry, formed a procession at the town hall at about 3 pm. The police had cleared some space at the southern end of the bridge, but by the time an advance party of yeomanry reached the bridge the crowds had reoccupied it. Twenty dragoons were drawn up across the southern entrance of the bridge to hold the crowds back. A ceremony was then held which included the town's MP Sir James Stansfeld, Lord Frederick Cavendish, Colonel Akroyd, the mayors of Bradford, Leeds and Wakefield, the Master Cutler of Sheffield, the Town Clerk of Leeds and the bridge engineers. This concluded with an artillery salute. Trams Starting in 1898 tram lines began to be extended from Halifax along the Calder Valley including lines running over the bridge. The steep terrain of the area was not ideal for trams and there were several fatal accidents. In 1906, an eight-ton double decker tram ran out of control down New Bank, Halifax, and overturned on North Bridge, killing two people and injuring 11 others. Modern times A weight restriction of seven tons was applied to the bridge in 1968, until strengthening work had been completed. Since Burdock Way, the modern flyover system, was opened in 1973 to take the A58 and A629 traffic over the River Hebble North Bridge remains in use for local traffic.

He rose to fame after beating Rafael Nadal in the 2014 Halle Open and Wimbledon 2015, and is known for his technique, speed, and entertaining playing style, often entertaining the crowd with trick shots. Brown competes mainly on the ATP Challenger Tour, in singles and doubles, having won 24 overall titles. His highest career singles world rank at No. 64 was in October 2016, and doubles world rank at No. 43 in May 2012. Brown is also notable for being one of the only two players to remain undefeated against Rafael Nadal after playing more than one match with him, holding a 2‚Äì0 head-to-head record.  Early life  Brown was born on 8 December 1984 in Celle, West Germany, a town situated near the city of Hanover. His father Leroy met his German born mother Inge in Jamaica and would settle in Celle for a time. This unusual dual nationality has earned him the nickname \\"Shabba\\" based on a line from Jamie Foxx in the 1997 comedy Booty Call where he claimed to be a \\"Germaican\\". He played several sports such as football, judo, and handball throughout his childhood. His focus on tennis began at the age of eight: \\"When I made the decision to pursue tennis instead of football, of course I wanted to be successful. I didn't want just to end up playing for a club somewhere.\\" His junior tennis career went well enough to draw the attention of Kim Michael Wittenberg, an American who ran a tennis academy near Hanover. Wittenberg regularly gave Brown lessons, and according to his pupil, he \\"taught him to play tennis.\\" At 11 years old, in 1996, the family returned to Jamaica, particularly Montego Bay. The move was motivated in part by the high cost of training in Germany as well as his need to develop discipline on the court: \\"I was pretty mentally soft when I was young. Anything could happen when I played‚ÄîI could lose my temper, I got disqualified.\\" In Jamaica, track and field, soccer, and cricket were the sports that commanded the best resources, tennis was played on poorly maintained public courts and with low-quality balls. Nevertheless, he continued to play junior tennis. In 2004, 20-year-old Brown became unhappy with tennis in Jamaica, his family thought his potential warranted returning to Germany and a Volkswagen campervan that could sleep up to three people set him up. The mobile lodgings enabled him to play in the various European tournaments: \\"It was a brilliant idea by my parents, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go on playing. It was a means of competing week in, week out.\\" He also brought in income with his racquet stringing machine, giving other players lower cost service, and letting out his spare mobile accommodations for a night.  Tennis career   2002‚Äì2009  Early in his career, Brown represented Jamaica.  2010‚Äì2019  Brown at the Boodles Challenge in 2010 In his second main circuit appearance after a first-round loss at the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in 2003, Brown defeated fourth seed Marco Chiudinelli and No. 139 Laurent Recouderc to reach the quarterfinals of the 2010 SA Tennis Open in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he lost to eventual runner-up St√©phane Robert. Brown became the second Jamaican after Doug Burke at the 1989 BP National Championships in Wellington, New Zealand, to reach the quarterfinals of a main ATP Tour event. On 17 May 2010 Brown cracked a singles career top 100 world rank at No. 99. Brown played his third ATP tour event at the 2010 Aegon Championships (Queen's Club), defeating first-round opponent Frank Dancevic, in three sets; his loss came in the second round to Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. By June 2010, a lack of funding and support from the Jamaican Tennis Association tempted him to switch national association to Great Britain, his paternal grandparents being British. In October 2010 he decided to compete for Germany and his debut event playing under the German flag was Eckental. His first title success playing under the German flag came at 2010 Lambertz Open. Brown partnered Jonathan Marray at the 2012 French Open; they lost in the first round. Brown/Marray also reached four Challenger tour finals in 2012, winning two in Bosnia and Italy. 2014 US Open. In 2014 he achieved his most significant career win by defeating world No. 1 tennis player Rafael Nadal at the Halle Open. At Wimbledon in 2015 Brown came through qualifying without dropping a set. After beating Yen-hsun Lu in the first round, Brown then upset 10th seed and 2-time champion Rafael Nadal in four sets in the second round, before losing to Victor Troicki in four sets in the next round. Brown reached his first singles semifinal on the ATP World Tour at the 2016 Open Sud de France after having lost eight consecutive quarterfinal matches. There, he lost against top seed Richard Gasquet in three sets. Brown reached a career debut second round of the French Open in 2016. After winning the 2016 Aegon Manchester Trophy, Brown received a wild card for the 2016 Wimbledon Championships. There, he beat Du≈°an Lajoviƒá in the first round before losing to Nick Kyrgios in the second. Both matches were decided in five sets. Brown competed in the first round of the 2016 Summer Olympics against Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil. Brown was leading 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì4 when he went down with an ankle injury. Medical staff taped him, he returned to the match playing two points. Bellucci increased the score to 4‚Äì5 in the second set. Brown could not return play and retired in tears. Brown lost in straight sets to Andy Murray at Wimbledon in 2017 in the second round. In April 2019, Brown reclaimed an ATP Challenger singles title from three years previous at the Mouratoglou Open in Sophia Antipolis, winning the final over Filip Krajinoviƒá in straight sets. On 13 June 2019, Brown upset compatriot and world No. 5 Alexander Zverev at the 2019 Stuttgart Open in the second round. Following this victory, he lost in a third-set tiebreaker to F√©lix Auger-Aliassime in the quarterfinal.

Lake Murray in South Carolina is named after him. Biography He was born August 4, 1873 in Annapolis, Maryland. He was the fourth child of Elizabeth Murray Spencer and James Daniel Murray. Murray graduated from Lehigh University in 1895 with a degree in electrical engineering. While at Lehigh, Murray was a member of Chi Phi, Sword and Crescent (senior honorary society), and E. E. Society. Murray began his career as an apprentice at the Westinghouse Electric plant in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He rose through the positions of testing room engineer, construction engineer on the road, district engineer of New England, and sales engineer before becoming an independent electrical engineering consultant based out of Boston from 1902 to 1905. As a consulting engineer, he was the chief engineer for the electrification of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He married Ella Day Rush on May 26, 1905 in Catskill, New York, and they had three sons, Richard Murray, John Murray, and William Spencer Murray, Jr. He formed the engineering firm McHenry & Murray with E.H. McHenry in 1913 and in 1915 completed the New Haven electrification, then became involved in hydroelectric development on the Housatonic River in Connecticut. Murray entered the Housatonic Power Co. as assistant to the president, afterward becoming president himself. When the company merged into the Connecticut Light & Power Company, Murray became the new corporation's chief engineer. By 1921, he was a senior member of the engineering firm Murray & Flood with Henry Flood, Jr. Murray & Flood were retained by T.C. Williams in 1923 to develop hydroelectric power plants in South Carolina, which resulted in the Saluda Dam. The lake created by the dam was named Lake Murray after him. Murray died January 9, 1942.

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Qunta is best known as the keyboardist of the Australian rock band Icehouse from between 1982 and 1988. As a popular musician, he has been influenced by artists including the Who, Cliff Richard, Jimi Hendrix, Genesis, Manfred Mann, Yes, Todd Rundgren and Queen. Early years Anderson Qunta was born on 9 January 1951, in Warrington, England, United Kingdom. His father was South African and his mother English. Beginning at the age of six, he studied classical piano and violin, but later developed an interest in popular music and picked up guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, and drums. Music career In 1970, Andy and his brother Tony formed the band Factory in Hastings, England. Andy played 12-string guitar, Tony played lead guitar and electric violin, Laurie Cooksey played drums, Jaffa Peckham played bass guitar until 1974 being replaced with Steve Kinch. All members contributed to vocals, and the band played to consistently good critical reviews. The original members of Factory re-formed in 2014, and their debut album \\"Back in the Time Machine\\" was released in April 2016. From 1979 Qunta worked as a session musician and toured with various bands, beginning with Hazel O'Connor's Megahype. In 1981, he played on the single \\"I Can't Even Touch You\\" by Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel. In 1982, Manfred Mann's Earth Band recorded Qunta's song \\"Tribal Statistics\\" for their album Somewhere in Afrika. This recording was also released as a single, but it failed to chart. At the end of 1982, Qunta moved to Australia to join the band Icehouse. Their 1983 single \\"Hey Little Girl\\" reached the Top 10 in the UK and Europe. In 1984, Icehouse released the album Sidewalk, which featured the hit \\"Don't Believe Anymore\\", and toured Australia, New Zealand, UK, Japan and Europe to support the release. Icehouse continued with a succession of hits, including the singles \\"Great Southern Land\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"Electric Blue\\", and \\"My Obsession\\". Their best selling albums included Primitive Man (1982), and Man of Colours (1987). The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame on 16 August 2006. Along with the success of \\"Crazy\\", in 1987 Qunta co- wrote \\"You're the Voice\\" which was released by John Farnham as the first single from his album Whispering Jack. The song reached the number-one chart position. This gave Qunta the confidence to write and record his 1989 solo album Legend in a Loungeroom. Afterward he left Icehouse, and relocated to Los Angeles, California. Songwriting career In 1985, Qunta signed a worldwide publishing contract with Rondor Music to market his songs, but in 1992 he switched to PolyGram in Los Angeles, California. In 1986, Qunta and Iva Davies co-wrote the Icehouse single \\"Crazy\\", he also co-wrote ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre The Voice‚Äù for John Farnham in the same year.In 2000, he wrote the score for the movie Last Chance and in 2006 collaborated with Anthony Di Pietro on a stage musical adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Man Who Would Be King.\\" Personal life Qunta married songwriter Jane Wareing in 1997 and have a daughter named Alex. The couple divorced in 2001. He currently lives near Los Angeles, California, with his current wife, photographer Teresa Qunta, whom he married in 2005.

This allows mathematicians to study the Laplace equation and heat equation on spaces that are not manifolds: for example, fractals. The benefit on these spaces is that one can do this without needing a gradient operator, and in particular, one can even weakly define a \\"Laplacian\\" in this manner if starting with the Dirichlet form. The classical Dirichlet form on \\\\mathbb{R}^n is given by: :\\\\mathcal{E}(u,v ) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} abla u(x) \\\\cdot abla v(x) \\\\;dx where one often discusses \\\\mathcal{E}(u) := \\\\mathcal{E}(u, u) = \\\\ abla u\\\\_2^2 which is often referred to as the \\"energy\\" of the function u(x). Functions that minimize the energy given certain boundary conditions are called harmonic, and the associated Laplacian (weak or not) will be zero on the interior, as expected. As an alternative example, the standard graph Dirichlet form is given by: : \\\\mathcal{E}_G(u, v) = \\\\sum_{x\\\\sim y} ((u(x) - u(y))(v(x) - v(y)) where x \\\\sim y means they are connected by an edge. Let a subset of the vertex set be chosen, and call it the boundary of the graph. Assign a Dirichlet boundary condition (choose real numbers for each boundary vertex). One can find a function that minimizes the graph energy, and it will be harmonic. In particular, it will satisfy the averaging property, which is embodied by the graph Laplacian, that is, if u_G(x) is a graph harmonic then \\\\Delta_G u_G(x) = \\\\sum_{y \\\\sim x} (u_G(y) - u_G(x)) = 0 which can of course be rearranged to u_G(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\\\\\{ y : y \\\\sim x\\\\\\\\}}\\\\sum_{y \\\\sim x} u_G(y) showing the averaging property. Technically, a Dirichlet form is a Markovian closed symmetric form on an L2-space.Fukushima, M, Oshima, Y., & Takeda, M. (1994). Dirichlet forms and symmetric Markov processes. Walter de Gruyter & Co , Such objects are studied in abstract potential theory, based on the classical Dirichlet's principle. The theory of Dirichlet forms originated in the work of on Dirichlet spaces. A Dirichlet form on a measure space (X, \\\\mu) is a bilinear function :\\\\mathcal{E}: D\\\\times D \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} such that 1) D is a dense subset of L^2(X, \\\\mu) 2) \\\\mathcal{E} is symmetric, that is \\\\mathcal{E}(u,v)=\\\\mathcal{E}(v,u) for every u,v \\\\in D. 3) \\\\mathcal{E}(u,u) \\\\geq 0 for every u \\\\in D. 4) The set D equipped with the inner product defined by (u,v)_{\\\\mathcal{E}} := (u,v)_{L^2(X,\\\\mu)} + \\\\mathcal{E}(u,v) is a real Hilbert space. 5) For every u \\\\in D we have that u_* = \\\\min (\\\\max(u, 0) , 1) \\\\in D and \\\\mathcal{E}(u_*,u_*)\\\\leq \\\\mathcal{E}(u,u) In other words, a Dirichlet form is nothing but a non negative symmetric bilinear form defined on a dense subset of L^2(X, \\\\mu) such that 4) and 5) hold. Alternatively, the quadratic form u \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}(u,u) itself is known as the Dirichlet form and it is still denoted by \\\\mathcal{E}, so \\\\mathcal{E}(u):=\\\\mathcal{E}(u,u). The best-known Dirichlet form is the Dirichlet energy of functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^n :\\\\mathcal{E}(u) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n}  abla u^2\\\\;dx which gives rise to the Sobolev space H^1(\\\\mathbb{R}^n). Another example of a Dirichlet form is given by :\\\\mathcal{E}(u) = \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^n} (u(y)-u(x))^2 k(x,y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d} y where k:\\\\mathbb R^n\\\\times \\\\mathbb R^n\\\\to \\\\mathbb R is some non-negative symmetric integral kernel. If the kernel k satisfies the bound k(x,y) \\\\leq \\\\Lambda x-y^{-n-s}, then the quadratic form is bounded in \\\\dot H^{s/2}. If moreover, \\\\lambda x-y^{-n-s} \\\\leq k(x,y), then the form is comparable to the norm in \\\\dot H^{s/2} squared and in that case the set D \\\\subset L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) defined above is given by H^{s/2}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n). Thus Dirichlet forms are natural generalizations of the Dirichlet integrals :\\\\mathcal{E}(u) = \\\\int (A abla u, abla u)\\\\; \\\\mathrm{d} x, where A(x) is a positive symmetric matrix. The Euler-Lagrange equation of a Dirichlet form is a non-local analogue of an elliptic equations in divergence form. Equations of this type are studied using variational methods and they are expected to satisfy similar properties.

In short, the goal of digital branding is not necessarily driving the sales today, but to enhance the awareness, image and style of the brand, in turn driving long term customer loyalty. Brand establishment involves four key points: * Building a digital brand story * Creativity in digital media and marketing * Digital channels and content distributed to channels based on consumer data and habits * Creating digital relationships. The digital impact on branding * There has been a prolonged chaos for information available about companies and consumers for ages. This increased limitations as access to information, geographical separation and interaction between customers. But now the existence of internet and websites which collect data and present us with comprehensive information, has facilitated more interaction between brands and customers. * The companies now have a powerful means to showcase the brand identity and value in innovative and efficient forms. The digitalization has provided the brands to come up with novel ways of customer engagement and manage the consistency of their brand empowerment. It has heightened the connectivity between brands and customers that was lacking earlier. * Another impact on branding practices is the emergence of value co-creation as an alternative way to long term customer relationships, customer loyalty and eventual profitability. Here, the joint effort is formed between the companies and customers during the various stages of the product. It strengthens the bond and builds loyalty and customer engagement. Coca-Cola is a great example of successful value co-creation. * Alongside engaging with the customers, there is increasing and active collaboration between the companies and their business intermediaries. This leads to collaborative and healthy promotion, innovative re-designing and a sense of co-existence among competitors in the market. One example of this is how Coca-Cola collaborated with Heinz to develop more sustainable containers. * The internet contains a vast population of people who need a product or service. What Digital Branding does is correctly position a brand or business in a way that they connect to their audience. Effective Digital Branding involves quite a number of methods such as SEO, an identity that stands out and many more.  Digital branding channels  According to Mabbly CEO, Hank Ostholthoff, digital branding is facilitated by multiple channels. As an advertiser one's core objective is to find channels which result in maximum two way communication and a better overall ROI for the brand. There are multiple online marketing channels available, namely: # New media marketing # Cross-media marketing # Retail media # Affiliate marketing # Display advertising # Internet branding ## Email marketing ## Search marketingJansen, B.

Allies Amy Bendix Amy Bendix is a young girl in Marvel Comics. The character, created by Larry Hama and John Buscema, first appeared in The Punisher War Zone #24 (February 1994). Amy is a happy young girl who is mentally handicapped. She hangs around town helping out with produce. One day, she encounters Frank Castle (otherwise known as the Punisher) hiding underneath a truck. Castle asks Amy not to tell and she complies. Amy soon afterwards hides Castle in her tree house where it becomes apparent that Amy reminds Castle of his daughter. Amy accidentally tells her father Sheriff Harry Bendix who comes with two other officers to capture Castle.The Punisher War Zone #24 Against Amy's wishes, Harry beats up Castle but puts Frank in jail afterwards. When Castle's fingerprints get leaked, several men break into Sheriff Bendix's house and hold Amy at gunpoint.The Punisher War Journal #63 Amy manages to escape the house and tries to look for her father but is captured by anti-vigilante agent Taylor Blackwell.

She is on the run after several of her friends are murdered and is saved by Frank Castle when a group of assassins attempt to kill her in a bar. Although initially hostile towards Castle, Amy is later taken under his wing and the two form a strong friendship with each other. Carlos Cruz Carlos \\"CC\\" Cruz is a former SWAT/United States Navy SEALs who befriend Microchip who had a falling out with Frank Castle. Carlos' intentions where however to not kill when not needed keeping his military code. He and Microchip fought the good fight for a longer amount of time with Carlos swearing on his nephew's life that he'd protect the innocent. Punisher Volume 2 #98 Soon however, the Punisher broke out of the jail he was put in by Microchip. The Punisher confronted Microchip, but Micro was killed when an ex S.H.I.E.L.D. assassin named Stone Cold bombed the wall they were standing at. When Carlos returned from a mission and discovered the computer wiz's dead body, Carlos mistakenly blamed Castle for his friend's death. Carlos tracked Castle and found the true Punisher stalking a group of Bolivian drug dealer. Cruz attacked Castle, attracting the gun-fire of the Bolivians as well. Separated by the chaos of the battle, Cruz was executed by Microchip's true killer, Stone Cold. The real Punisher eventually avenged Carlos by killing Stone Cold himself. Punisher Volume 2 #99 =Carlos Cruz in other media= Carlos Gonzalez-vlo portrays Carlos Cruz in Punisher War Zone. In the film, Cruz was a minor criminal (of the gang \\"Latin Kings\\") until he became a friend of Microchip. He decided to change his way as he proves his sincerity to Microchip's other friend The Punisher by leading him to Maginty, an Irish criminal who knew information about Punisher's enemy Jigsaw's whereabouts. The Punisher learns to trust Cruz and later, he ensures him with the lives of Angela Donatelli and her daughter Grace Donatelli, whom Jigsaw wanted to kidnap. When Loony Bin Jim tracks down The Punisher's hideout, Carlos tries to protect the women from him, but Jigsaw's brother Looney Bin Jim proves to be superior and slaughters him with an axe. When The Punisher comes back, he finds a dying Cruz, mourning for being unable to protect Angela and Grace. As an act of pity and respect, and at Cruz's request, Punisher finishes Carlos with a mercy gunshot. Andy Lorimer Andy Lorimer is a Lance Corporal in the Parachute Regiment of the British Army who tags along with Yorkie Mitchell to New York City to track down a group of former IRA members responsible for detonating a bomb in an Irish bar in Hell's Kitchen, also destroying a diner across the street, killing 11 and injuring 30, including Frank Castle who was dining at the restaurant. Lorimer & Mitchell link up with Castle and agree to fight alongside him against the Irish- American gangs of New York. Yorkie brought him along as a favor because one of the IRA members, Peter Cooley, killed Lorimer's father during the closing days of The Troubles. Lorimer's father, SAS Sergeant Major Stephen Lorimer, saved Yorkie's life in the past, and so he sees it as a way of repaying his fallen friend by allowing his son a chance to avenge his death. While a perfectly competent soldier, Lorimer begins to have doubts on the validity of their mission given how much killing is involved. Once their mission is complete and all of the IRA members and their associates have been killed, Lorimer is given the opportunity to execute Cooley. He does so, but upon returning to Yorkie, he tells him that his death did not bring him any sense of closure or satisfaction. The two return home to England. George Howe First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #55. An African-American, George Howe served as a young man in the Vietnam War. In the summer of 1969, his UH-1 Huey helicopter crashed near the border with Laos; the Viet Cong soon arrived to take the survivors to their own base, where one by one they were killed, their hands and feet chopped off and tossed into Howe's bamboo cage. When it seemed that his time had come, a Marine Force Recon group led by Captain Castle attacked the village and rescued Howe. In 1972, Howe was awarded the Medal of Honor. Admiring the Force Recon Marines (Howe assumed his rescuers were SEALs or LURPs; many years later, Colonel Howe met Frank Castle in person and recognized him as the man that rescued him) for their proficiency, Howe joined the Green Berets for the remainder of the war and was among the first to join Delta Force. Howe is tasked by a cabal of military generals to arrest Castle, but then learns of the actual truth behind Castle's covert operation in Russia. Howe gives Castle the means of killing the generals by giving him a loaded M1911 handgun, and destroys the incriminating evidence out of the belief that if exposed, the U.S. military would lose all sense of credibility. Howe's assistant, Lieutenant Geller, reads Castle's military record and realizes that not only was Castle a Force Recon Marine, he also led the team that saved Howe's life in Vietnam; thus, Howe would spare Castle's life as repayment out of gratitude. Geller attempts to warn the generals, but it is too late. As the generals arrive at Howe's safehouse to collect the incriminating tape and view Castle's body, Howe walks away, saying he has washed his hands clean of the matter, but in reality, Howe has lured the generals to their deaths. Henry Russo Henry Russo first appeared in The Punisher vol. 7 #1 (March 2009), and has gone on to become a recurring character in that series, as well as appearing alongside the Punisher in other series, such as Anti-Venom and Deadpool: Suicide Kings. Russo is the child of Jigsaw, and as a child, Russo's father would neglect and abuse him. In a pivotal incident, Jigsaw beat Russo for letting a cat inside their house. He then pulled a gun on Russo's mother and told him that if he did not drown the cat he (Jigsaw) would shoot her. Russo did, and was left traumatised by this incident. Russo possesses no superhuman powers or abilities, although he is extremely skilled at using and hacking computers. Jen Cooke First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 5) #24. A liberal activist and social worker. She was kidnapped by a cult of tunnel dwelling homeless cannibals and was rescued by Castle, but condemned his brutal methods, pointing out that the men who kidnapped her were homeless, desperate and some with severe mental problems. While he initially shrugged off her tirade, she got to him and he gave the cultists a chance to escape while he went after their leader. Years later, she was investigating the East European sex slavery trade, and begrudgingly helped Castle go after a Romanian gang that was running a series of brothels. Jenny Cesare First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #43. Jenny was born into the Cesare Crime Family and once she was old enough was introduced to her husband Tim Buccato by her sister Annabella and other Mafia wives. Tim seemed nice at first but after they were married he became extremely abusive both physically, sexually and mentally beginning on their wedding night. He beat her, raped her, and even allowed men he barely knew to come over and abuse her sexually. Jenny's sister and her friends knew he was like this before hand, but kept her in the relationship and didn't help at all. Finally Tim was killed by the Punisher and on that same day Jenny was diagnosed with breast cancer. She told her sister that she was going to the FBI because she believed it was the evil in Tim that caused her cancer and it was Annabella's fault that she married him. Annabella's criminal partner Shauna Toomey knocked out Jenny and had two men from her husbands gang kill her but they didn't succeed in the disposal, she was thrown from a bridge after which they believed she was hit by a train but she in fact landed atop the train and survived. After coming to she realized she could start a new life and get revenge on the women who betrayed her. She underwent a double mastectomy and learned weapon handling and cop skills over the years. She finally returned to New York City to get revenge on her sister and her friends, but found out they were planning on killing the Punisher in revenge for having killed all of their husbands. Wanting to save the life of the man that saved her by killing her husband, she rescued the Punisher and then donned the Punisher's death head shirt and took out the wives, ending with beating her sister to death with a baseball bat. After that was done, Jenny had sex with Frank in a last attempt to feel something and committed suicide when they were done, still unable to feel anything from the sex and aware she was still dying of cancer, leaving Frank forced to watch her shoot herself in the head while she was still sat astride him. =Jenny Cesare in other media= * Jenny Cesare appears as a NPC in PlayStation Network's The Punisher: No Mercy. Joan Joan is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. She first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 4) #1. A tenant in the apartment building where Frank Castle lived for a time under the name of John Smith. An extremely shy, frightened and timid character, Joan was terrified of living in the city and wished to move to the countryside, but did not have the money to do so. She had a bit of a crush on Castle, baking him pies and cookies and claiming she had merely made too many. Along with her friends, Bumpo and Spacker Dave, she receives a portion of Gnucci's money which she used to buy a cottage in the countryside as she wanted.The Punisher Vol. 4 #12 Years later, Castle was wounded in a fight with the Russian mob and stumbled upon her abode. She tended to him, and, despite his request that she run for her life and leave him to fend for himself, insisted on helping him instead.The Punisher Vol. 5 #19 =Joan in other media= * Joan appears in The Punisher portrayed by Rebecca Romijn. Joan is depicted as being much prettier than her comic book counterpart. Though she is still shy, she is more willing to approach Castle along with Dave and Bumpo. She also had an ex- boyfriend who was abusive and she leaves him, but he follows her. As she prepares to defend herself with a knife, Castle arrives and gets rid of him. She witnesses Castle's fight with The Russian and nurses him back to health. Just like in the comic, Castle leaves all the money he racked up from the criminals he punished to Joan, Dave and Bumpo. * Joan appears in The Punisher video game voiced by Julie Nathanson. Kathryn O'Brien First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #1. O'Brien first appeared as a CIA agent and part of a task force to apprehend him and recruit him into the hunt for Osama bin Laden, when she expressed sexual attraction to Castle and a desire to sleep with him. The mission ultimately failed, and O'Brien's superior had her sent to prison. During her time there, she was routinely harassed by a gang of inmates, who were never able to beat her in a fight, so they framed her for the murder of a guard instead. O'Brien fled the prison and went to a fellow former CIA Agent for help, and once there, she learned of the events surrounding Nicky Cavella's desecration of the Castle family graves, and that Bill Rawlins, her ex-husband, was in town. Deciding to kill her husband before she could make good her escape, she caught him as he was about to shoot Castle with a sniper rifle, as he and Cavella were in league. O'Brien assisted Castle in interrogating her ex-husband in his role for the covert operation in Russia. She then disappeared to Afghanistan to kill ex-Taliban officers under American and British protection for playing a role in raping her. O'Brien was killed when she stepped on a land mine, being cared for by Castle during her final moments. Prior to her disappearance, O'Brien gave birth to a daughter named Sarah, the product of a one-night stand with Castle, who is in the protective custody of her sister. She revealed to Castle that the CIA recruited had her in her senior year at Princeton University. Lynn Michaels Martin Soap Max Max is an attack dog owned by the Punisher. Created by Mike Baron, he first appeared in Punisher Vol. 2 #54 (November 1991). Max was a puppy that was picked up off the street to be trained as an attack dog. One day a local gang broke into the building Max was kept in and attacked the crooks. The Punisher arrived and defeated the last one before adopting the dog as his own. Since then, Max had become a close companion to Frank Castle and even Micro to an extent. Even when Max was stolen away to be trained in dog fights, he never forgot his true master and was quick to return to him.Punisher War Journal #60 =Max in other media= Max appears in season two of Daredevil played by dog actor Bull. The Punisher rescues Max from the Kitchen Irish after gunning down the majority of them. Later, Finn Cooley kidnaps Max and threatens to torture him if Frank does not give up the location of his money. What happens to Max afterward is unknown. Mickey Fondozzi Microchip Molly von Richthofen NYPD Lieutenant Molly Elizabeth Chrysanthema Olga von RichthofenPunisher: War Zone vol. 2, #4 (February 2009) first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 4) #4. She is a talented investigator who, as punishment for refusing to sleep with the NYPD Commissioner, was assigned to take down the Gnucci crime family, which was as much a farce as Detective Martin Soap's Punisher Task Force. It was her idea to team up with Soap, knowing that either Ma Gnucci or the Punisher would kill the other, and then they could move in and arrest whoever was left. During their investigation, Soap fell in love with Molly, who rebuffed Soap, since Molly is a lesbian. When Soap later became Commissioner, Molly left on a vacation in the tropics with a stripper and was preparing for her mayoral campaign. A few years later, von Richthofen returned to New York and rejoined the NYPD. However, she was still disfavored by her male superiors & was assigned to the Punisher Task Force, since Molly previously served in that job. Ironically, Molly was later forced to fight alongside Castle against Elite's henchmen; during the ensuing battle, Molly's clothes caught fire and she was forced to strip to her bra and panties. Unfortunately for Molly, the gunfight was recorded by the local news media and she was publicly exposed as a Punisher sympathizer. Molly was subsequently suspended, pending a formal investigation.Punisher: War Zone vol. 2, #1-6 (February 2009) Staci Strobl and Nickie D. Phillips examined the character in their book Comic Book Crime: Truth, Justice, and the American Way, noting her \\"lesbian as psychopath\\" motif Punisher War Zone Vol. 2, and writing, \\"Molly's violence may be interpreted as rage against the patriarchal constraints under which she operates both at work and at home, and is always infused, at least implicitly, with her sexuality. While Molly is certainly a competent law enforcement officer, her honor and integrity are belied by her abuse of power. Violence is used as one means of negotiating her sexual orientation, which is never far removed from her objectification as a female. In her confrontation with the Mafia, she partners with Punisher and in the process undergoes numerous humiliations culminating in a \\"bra and panties\\" showdown captured by the media. There is space for the lesbian crime fighter, but only firmly in its place within masculine hegemony. As The New York Globe headlines reported the showdown, \\"Lethal Weapons! Sexy Lesbian Lieutenant in Punisher Team-Up Carnage!\\" =Molly von Richthofen in other media= Molly von Richthofen appears in The Punisher video game, voiced by Julie Nathanson. Nathaniel Bumpo Nathaniel Bumpo is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. He first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 4) #1. A tenant in the apartment building where Frank Castle lived for a time under the name of John Smith. Grossly overweight and requiring Castle's help to get through the door of his apartment, Mr. Bumpo once suffered a heart attack and the paramedics had to destroy part of the building's wall and use a crane to take him to the hospital. Shortly after he was released, the Russian attacked Castle at his home. After a vicious fight, Castle used Bumpo to smother him, doing so for thirty minutes. Castle later left him a share of Gnucci's money, and was said by Joan to be living in a clinic in Albany after \\"something important fell out of his bottom\\". =Nathaniel Bumpo in other media= Nathaniel Bumpo appears in The Punisher, portrayed by John Pinette. While still overweight, this version does not have trouble with his living quarters. He is much more comical and is always trying to humor Joan along with Spacker Dave. Just like in the comic, the Punisher leaves all the money racked up from punished criminals and leaves them to Joan, Dave and Bumpo. Oscar Clemons Det. Oscar \\"Ozzy\\" Clemons is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. He first appeared in The Punisher Vol. 8 #1 (October 2011) and was created by Greg Rucka and Marco Checchetto in the likeness of Morgan Freeman.

After Kilgrave kills the neighbor Ruben, Jessica Jones approaches Clemons with Ruben's severed head, begging to be locked up. This backfires, as Kilgrave arrives and orders Clemons and the other cops present at the time to all point guns at each other, then makes them dismiss the incident as a hilarious prank.

Paul Budiansky NYPD detective Paul Budiansky first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #44 created by Garth Ennis and Lan Medina. He was an impulsive man who felt that in order to solve a problem, you had to take matters into your own hands. Paul heroically entered a school that was being held hostage by a deranged killer against orders and shot him. Despite this, he was disciplined and forced into therapy, wondering if he was like the Punisher. Paul then began investigating a gang of supposed criminals, The Five Wives. The Wives were accused of killing one of their own which they denied. Certain of their crime he investigated deeper and the Wives sent a hitman after him. While visiting his wife Gina in the hospital, the hitman attempted to kill Paul, but accidentally shot Gina. Paul brutally killed the hitman and Gina survived, but was put on life-support. Having had enough, Paul visited the Wives in an effort to get revenge, only to discover that Jenny Cesare had killed three of the Wives and was taking the last one to be killed. Paul followed, but ran into the Punisher and demanded that he be let through causing the Punisher to ask, \\"You want to be me?\\" Following these words, Paul gave up, realizing he was not the Punisher. =Paul Budiansky in other media= * Paul Budiansky appeared in Punisher: War Zone, portrayed by Colin Salmon. This version is a former narcotics specialist for the FBI who snorted the cocaine that they collected. His partner Nicky Donatelli refused to turn his friend in and went undercover to out the local gangs. Paul overcame his addiction, but Nicky was accidentally killed by the Punisher during a bust gone bad under the Russoti Family mission. He teams up with Martin Soap and the \\"Punisher Task Force\\" to bring the Punisher to justice. Unbeknownst to Paul, however, Soap and the NYPD are sympathetic to the vigilante and are simply pretending to be hunting the Punisher.

When Paul realizes that the system does not work, the Punisher ends up getting help to take down notorious gangster and megalomaniac Jigsaw. * Paul Budiansky is mentioned in PlayStation Network's The Punisher: No Mercy. Rachel Cole- Alves Shotgun Spacker Dave First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 4) #1. A heavily pierced young tenant in the apartment building where Castle lived for a time under the alias of John Smith. He did little but hang about on the building's doorstep, but recognized \\"Smith\\" as the Punisher, something which he inadvertently divulged to mobsters who came looking for him. Despite being tortured by having his piercings pulled out and carving his name into his forehead, he did not betray Castle. He received a portion of Ma Gnucci's money after leaving the hospital, and later inspired an underground movement called the \\"Spackers\\" who had bandaged faces similar to his. He reappeared years later, now no longer wearing any piercings or bandages, and had taken up the hobby of superhero spotting, much to Castle's chagrin. Dave was ecstatic when he met Daredevil, Spider-Man and Wolverine in the flesh. He was trampled by the Hulk, rendering him quadriplegic, which does not hamper his fascination with superheroes. =Large Spacker Dave in other media= * Spacker Dave appears in The Punisher played by Ben Foster. His character remains relatively unchanged (his torture scene is even reenacted), but is also more comical than his comic book counterpart. He even tries to humor Joan on occasion along with Bumpo. Just like in the comic, Castle leaves all the money he racked up from the criminals he punished and leaves them to Joan, Dave and Bumpo. * Spacker Dave appears in The Punisher video game, voiced by Chris Edgerly. Steve Goodwin First appeared in The Punisher: Born #1. A young Marine serving under then-Captain Frank Castle at Firebase Valley Forge near the Cambodian border toward the end of Castle's third tour in Vietnam. He was one of the better natured U.S. Marines at the base, keeping away from drugs and taking the time to ease the springs in the magazines of his rifle. His tour of Vietnam was coming to an end, and he clung to Castle in a desperate attempt to stay alive, believing that Castle's prowess as a combatant would guarantee his safety. The events of The Punisher: Born are told largely from his perspective and narrated by him. On the night he was thirty-seven days from being discharged, the garrison was attacked by combined forces of NVA and Viet Cong. Of the Marines, Castle and Goodwin held out the longest, and Goodwin got to see air support arrive, only to be bayoneted seconds later. In his dying moments, he hallucinates of the bayonet missing him, being whisked away onto a passenger jet where he is tended to by attractive stewardesses as he previously wished. Nearly forty years later, his younger brother Michael Goodwin writes a book titled Valley Forge, Valley Forge: The Slaughter of a U.S. Marine Garrison and the Birth of the Punisher about the events surrounding those final hours. Yorkie Mitchell First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 5) #18. Lieutenant Colonel Yorkie Mitchell was an operative of MI6 and the SAS. Yorkie first met Castle in 1971, while they were serving in Vietnam, when they were both taking part in a cross-training exercise with the Australian SAS. On one occasion, Yorkie saved Castle from being burned alive by the Viet Cong. He once helped Castle by supplying information about a cocaine shipment that had made its way into Belfast, Northern Ireland, and later teamed up with him to take down Finn Cooley, a former Provisional IRA terrorist and current Irish gangster. He then was assigned to Afghanistan, where he provided security to ex-Taliban who had turned into informants for the coalition. As a favor to Castle, he was able to secure the release of Kathryn O'Brien after he was supposed to execute her, an act that cost him his job. He did not mind it, however, expressing that he wanted to retire anyway. He and his wife were later murdered by Barracuda, who was looking for leverage against Castle. Enemies Barracuda Cristu Bulat Cristu Bulat was a character in Marvel Comics. He first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #25.

His son Tim, the second Elite, first appeared in Punisher: War Zone (vol. 2) #1 (2009). The first Elite was a fascist and racist vigilante who killed gang members, drug dealers and other criminals who \\"lower the tone\\" in his upper- class neighborhood. He even shot a lady's dog that urinated on the sidewalk and ran off a hot dog vendor who had set up shop in Elite's neighborhood by tossing a live grenade in the vendor's cart. Nevertheless, Elite was well- spoken: he was actually polite to his victims. Elite was the manager of an art gallery and had a wife, a son named Tim and a daughter. Elite later joined up with Mr. Payback and the Holy to form the Vigilante Squad, planning to exterminate all of New York City's criminals. When the Punisher confronted the Vigilante Squad, he called Elite \\"a Nazi\\". Elite was gunned down by the Punisher seconds later: he was shot at least eight times at point-blank range by the Punisher's Uzi. Elite's widow later remarried & his daughter suffered a mental breakdown and was sent to an insane asylum, but Tim inherited his father's wealth & possessions and eventually went to Princeton. Like his father, Tim was an arrogant, racist snob who hated minorities & the less fortunate; while high on cocaine, Tim used his Porsche to run over a homeless man who got in his way, but the homeless man survived and Tim was arrested, convicted of attempted murder, sent to prison and expelled from Princeton. Six years after his father's death, Tim took up his father's alter ego and vowed to avenge his father's murder at the hands of the Punisher. Elite set up an elaborate scheme that at first, made Castle believe his old nemesis, Ma Gnucci, was still alive: Elite used several cosmetically-altered body-doubles of Ma to convince several mob families to assist him in eliminating the Punisher, but in the end Castle discovered Elite's scheme. Aided by NYPD Lieutenant Molly von Richtofen, Castle & Molly killed all of Elite's mob allies. Castle then killed Elite's henchmen & confronted Elite himself, telling him \\"What makes you think they haunt me?\\" Elite, too shocked to resist, could only say \\"Whuh...what?\\" Castle replied \\"Go\\", then executed Elite. Finn Cooley Finn Cooley is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. He first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #7. A hideously disfigured Irish terrorist, an Irish mob boss and a demolitions expert, Cooley was formerly an Active Service Unit leader with the Provisional IRA in Derry, Northern Ireland, from 1986‚Äì1993, when he was arrested, interrogated by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) at Castlereagh, convicted of murder & terrorism and sent to prison, but was released as part of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. After Cooley was freed, he tried to join the Continuity IRA, but that unit disavowed him, so Finn came to America. Cooley had to wear a facial mask as half of his face was blown off in an explosives accident, when the bomb he planted at a Belfast RUC police station prematurely detonated. He was also an expert in hand-to-hand combat.The Punisher Vol. 6 #8 In 2003, Cooley planted fifty pounds of Semtex at an Irish bar in Hell's Kitchen in order to kill several rival Irish mob bosses, but the bomb went off prematurely, killing 11 and injuring 30 innocent people, one of whom was Frank Castle; Castle's friend MI6 agent Yorkie Mitchell informed Castle who was responsible and provided MI6's intel files on Cooley and his associates; MI6 also ordered Mitchell to assassinate Cooley. Cooley was ironically killed by a bomb left behind by recently deceased Irish mob boss Pops Nesbitt, who thought Cooley and his rivals were unworthy of inheriting his fortune.The Punisher Vol. 6 #12 Cooley had a nephew, Peter Cooley, who was a Provisional IRA soldier from 1994‚Äì1998, who served as his uncle's right-hand man, and was a prime suspect in the murders of three British security forces soldiers, but was never arrested or convicted; one of the victims was Sergeant Major Stephen Lorimer, a close friend of Mitchell. Peter was captured by Castle & Mitchell, interrogated for information about Finn and the New York Irish mob leaders, then executed by Parachute Regiment trooper Lance Corporal Andy Lorimer, in revenge for his father's murder.The Punisher Vol. 6 #9-12 =Finn Cooley in other media= * Finn Cooley appears as a playable character in PlayStation Network's The Punisher: No Mercy. * Finn Cooley appears in season two of Daredevil, portrayed by Tony Curran. This version is hotheaded and impulsive, introduced stabbing an underling in the eye with an ice pick for trivializing his son Kelly Cooley's death at the hands of the Punisher who also stole several million dollars from the Kitchen Irish. Finn puts out a bounty, with his men shaking down business owners until they locate the Punisher's hideout and the vigilante's dog. Finn and his men capture the Punisher at the carousel where the Castle family was killed and haul the Punisher to a catacomb. Finn proceeds tortures Punisher by drilling through the vigilante's left foot but refuses to cooperate with him. He finally gets an answer when he threatens to give the same treatment to the vigilante's dog which had been rescued from the Irish. The stolen money turns out to be placed on top of a bomb and the money is destroyed. Punisher then breaks free, grabs a shotgun and asks Finn for answers about the Castle family's death. Finn refuses to talk, saying \\"Your family? Who cares!\\", prompting the Punisher to shoot him point-blank, blowing off the left side of his face. The Punisher is pinned down by gunfire from several of Finn's remaining henchmen until Daredevil, tipped off by Sgt. Brett Mahoney about Finn's activities, shows up to rescue. General Kreigkopf First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 5) #2. A former United States Marine Corps General who was infamous for committing war atrocities, later becoming a terrorist leader. During the Vietnam War, Lieutenant Kreigkopf allowed his Marines to pillage the town of Ap Duc and rape its women, as a reward for defending the town. In the 1980s, during the Contra War, Major Kreigkopf was directly responsible for the deaths of 426 Sandinistas, two-thirds of which were killed with nerve agents. During Operation Desert Storm, Colonel Kreigkopf ordered his Marines to use half of a company of Iraqi prisoners for bayonet practice. However, none of the war crimes were ever proven, a testament to Kreigkopf's influence with military leaders. As a General, Kreigkopf did the unthinkable: he struck a Lance Corporal in the neck with a rifle butt, rendering the young Marine permanently paralyzed from the neck down, for insubordination. Worse, the entire incident was filmed by a CNN camera team. Before Kreigkopf could face a court-martial, he was smuggled out of the United States by the CIA, as he was considered a valuable asset by them, for conducting black ops on their behalf. Nevertheless, the court- martial proceeded with Kreigkopf in absentia: he was dismissed from the Marine Corps and stripped of rank. Kreigkopf fled to Grand Nixon Island in the South Pacific, where he established a mercenary base and hired disgraced special forces & black ops operators, hitmen and sociopaths, as mercenaries and terrorists; a \\"black ops for hire\\" outfit, as Frank Castle put it. The most notable of these mercenaries was The Russian, who was recently murdered by the Punisher, and resurrected with cyborg technology stolen from S.H.I.E.L.D. As \\"payment\\" for his services, Kreigkopf allowed the Russian one more chance to kill the Punisher in revenge; the Russian failed in his mission and returned to Grand Nixon Island in time for Kreigkopf's plot to eliminate the European Union (EU) leaders in Brussels, as revenge for their plotting to wipe out Kreigkopf and his terrorist group. When the Punisher foiled Kreigkopf's plot by shooting down a Boeing 747 full of terrorists, Kreigkopf ordered the hijacking of a French military aircraft that was carrying a hydrogen bomb and have it destroy the EU leaders. As the French aircraft began to taxi down the runway, the Punisher confronted Kreigkopf on the runway and shot him in the shoulder, then Castle managed to board the aircraft and throw the Russian out with the nuclear weapon chained to him. Kreigkopf watches and he yells in anger and horror that the Punisher destroyed his plans and the Punisher kills him with the nuclear weapon. The resulting nuclear explosion destroyed Grand Nixon Island, the terrorists, the Russian and Kreigkopf. Two weeks later, the Punisher broke into the White House and directly confronted the President of the United States, who had been blackmailed by Kreigkopf; Kreigkopf had threatened to inform the media of black ops authorized by the President, the least of which was authorizing the Russian to eliminate the Punisher, and ordering the NYPD not to interfere. The Punisher gave the President a stern warning, and threw a 9mm Parabellum round on the President's desk, saying \\"Nine millimeters. I'm never further away than that.\\" \\"Kreigkopf\\" is German for \\"Warhead\\", a double entendre, referring to Kreigkopf's propensity for brutality, and the fact he confiscated a nuclear weapon. =General Kreigkopf in other media= Kreigkopf appeared in the 2005 The Punisher video game, voiced by Bob Joles. He appears as one of the game's main antagonists. Hitman Holy First appeared in The Punisher (vol. 4) #2. Father Hector Redondo, who called himself \\"The Holy\\", was an insane Catholic priest in Spanish Harlem who used a fireman's axe to kill criminals who confessed their sins to him. He believed killing \\"evil\\" people is God's will, and was later inspired by the Punisher to form the Vigilante Squad, consisting of the Holy, Elite and Mr. Payback (the trio hoped that the Punisher would join and lead them). The media called him the mystery \\"Axe-Murderer of Spanish Harlem\\". Father Redondo realized that he was a killer and showed remorse after killing his victims, praying for absolution and forgiveness for his sins. The Punisher used Detective Soap's notes to find Father Redondo, whose church was the place where all of the victims came to confess their sins. Not only did Castle find The Holy, but also Elite and Mr. Payback. By listening to their conversation, the Punisher found out Redondo was indeed the Axe-Murderer. The Punisher barged into The Holy's office to confront the Vigilante Squad, who attempted to recruit the Punisher as their leader, but Castle was unmoved by their pleas, accusing Redondo of being \\"a lunatic\\". Just after Redondo made the trio's final plea with the Punisher to reconsider, Castle gunned down all three members of the Vigilante Squad. Ink Ink was one of Nicky Cavella's bodyguards/enforcers, and was always paired with Pittsy. He first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #2. Ink received his nickname when he killed his first man by stabbing a pen through the man's eye and into his brain. Ink was slightly cross-eyed and always wore glasses. Like his partner Pittsy, Ink was just as callous and ruthless; however, Ink rarely spoke, but when he did, Cavella referred to Ink as a real \\"ballbuster\\". Ink was a skilled cook: he murdered, then butchered and cooked up the son of mob boss David Kai, who enjoyed his \\"sweet & sour pork\\" until Cavella told him what it really was. Ink's favorite word was \\"Huh\\", which he used whenever he agreed with something; it was also his last word when he was killed during a battle between Cavella's mobsters & CIA agents who were negotiating with Frank Castle; Cavella & Pittsy barely escaped with their lives, but were forced to leave Ink's body behind. =Ink in other media= Ink appears in 2008's Punisher: War Zone, portrayed by Keram Malicki-S√°nchez.

He also executed a wealthy banker who criticized Payback during a live TV news interview. Payback was highly intelligent: he made several highly articulate speeches about the exploitation of corporate laborers; shortly thereafter, Payback deduced the location of Elite's neighborhood and found Elite gunning down a marijuana dealer. Payback convinced Elite to join him, and the duo stumbled across The Holy, forming the Vigilante Squad. Just as the Vigilante Squad decided that they needed the Punisher to lead them, the topic of discussion himself stormed into the room. An awed Mr. Payback told the Punisher that he was their inspiration. After insulting The Holy and Elite, the Punisher informed Payback that he had killed four innocent people during his quest for justice, to which Payback responded that there have to be sacrifices in war. After Payback gave the wrong answer, the Punisher pulled out his trademark Uzi and prepared to gun down the trio, who pleaded with the Punisher to reconsider their offer. Mr. Payback, along with the rest of the Vigilante Squad, died seconds later. Nicky Cavella Nicolas \\"Nicky\\" Cavella first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #2.

He was one of the few criminals to have survived an encounter with the Punisher. However, when he desecrated the Castle family's graves to lure out the Punisher so he can kill him once and for all, he was kidnapped by the Punisher, marched into the woods by Castle and shot in the belly, leaving him there to languish for days, dying slowly of blood poisoning. Cavella portrayed himself as a charismatic, suave killer but is really an emotionally unstable coward. =Nicky Calvella in other media= Romano Orzari portrays Nicky Calvella in Punisher War Zone as Billy Russoti's top henchman who's revealed to be Nicky Donatelli, an FBI agent. Carmine \\"Pittsy\\" Gazzera Carmine \\"Pittsy\\" Gazzera was one of Nicky Cavella's bodyguards/enforcers, always paired with Ink. He first appeared in The Punisher (vol. 6) #2. Pittsy once worked as an enforcer for \\"Ray the Rat\\", then began serving Cavella when the latter became a soldier and scion of his family. Pittsy was extremely rude, profane and merciless, but was completely loyal to Cavella. He had an extremely high pain threshold & endurance, on a level comparable to the Punisher himself, and was a very capable hand-to-hand combatant. During a three-way firefight between the Punisher, the CIA and Cavella's men, the Punisher threw Pittsy through a warehouse window and impaled him upon a spiked fence. To Castle's disbelief, Pittsy staggered towards Castle with a section of the fence still imbedded in him; Castle finished off Pittsy with a point-blank shotgun blast to the face. Shortly after Pittsy's death, his younger sister Teresa \\"Tessie\\" replaced her brother as Cavella's bodyguard. Tessie had the same rude & cold-blooded personality as her brother, but became enamored of Cavella and tried to seduce him; Cavella rebuffed Tessie's advances. Shortly thereafter, Tessie tracked down Frank Castle, who was in bed with Kathryn O'Brien, and attacked them both, managing to stab Castle in the shoulder while screaming that Castle had killed her brother.

When the team is caught in an ambush due to Rawlins disregarding warnings that the operation is a trap, Frank Castle furiously punches Rawlins hard enough to cause an orbital blowout fracture, blinding him in his left eye, which is left a permanent milky gray. In the present day, he is made director of the CIA's covert operations unit and has built a network of security via illegal dealings and assassinations. When he and Billy Russo realize that the Punisher survived Schoonover's boat explosion, he attempts numerous times to kill Castle, but fails until Castle allows himself to be caught as part of a plan of his. As retribution for the trouble Frank caused him, Rawlins restrains and tortures Castle, taking so much joy in the endeavor that he refuses to allow Russo to put him out of his misery and instead gives Frank adrenaline to force him to remain alive so that he can remove his eye as a form of ironic revenge. But before he could, Frank eventually gets free and kills him by beating him, stabbing him repeatedly, and then gouging out his eyes. Mennonite The Mennonite is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics Universe. He first appeared in Punisher MAX #3 (March 2010), and was created by writer Jason Aaron and artist Steve Dillon. An unnamed farmer simply known as the Mennonite lived in a community of Amish farmers. His wife Mary was sick, and it did not look like Mary was getting better. Their two sons found a box full of dangerous weapons, and when the Mennonite caught them, he took the box and buried it by a tree in a field. Giving in to his faith, he prayed to God for some way to help his wife, only to get word from his sons that someone named Rigoletto was looking to hire him. Resigned, the Mennonite takes the box of weapons and heads on his way.Punisher Max #3 (March 2010) He enters the city to meet with Rigoletto, whom he refuses to divulge his \\"Christian name\\" to, and accepts the job of killing the Punisher though only with the tools that his religion allows. The Mennonite and the Punisher face off with the former using a hammer, horses, and his bare hands to take the latter on in a fight.Punisher Max #4 (April 2010) Tiring out, the Mennonite reaches for one of the Punisher's guns, only to get electrified. The Punisher drops a safe on his head, killing him. Meanwhile, his sons wait with Mary unaware that their father failed them.Punisher Max #5 (May 2010) =Mennonite in other media= A character named John Pilgrim appeared as one of the main antagonists in season two of The Punisher, played by Josh Stewart. The character is loosely inspired by the Mennonite in that both are men with violent pasts who find religion, only to revert to their previous selves due in some part to The Punisher. Pilgrim was once a former white supremacist named Robert who found himself jailed for his reckless behavior. He was \\"saved\\" by company CEOs Anderson Schultz and Eliza Schultz and converted to Christianity, became a pastor, and removed his damning tattoos. He married a woman named Rebecca, with whom he had two sons named Michael and Lemuel. His past comes back to haunt him when the Schultzes hire him to hunt down Amy Bendix, a young girl who stole incriminating photos of their senator son kissing a man. He solemnly is forced to leave his family for the job, as his wife is sick and bedridden, and along with several mercenaries he locates Amy at a small town Sheriff's office where they encounter the Punisher. Pilgrim continues to hunt for Amy and the Punisher, though after a rough encounter with his former Neo-Nazi colleagues, he gets word from Eliza that Rebecca has passed away, leaving him broken. Everything culminates in a one-on-one fight with the Punisher, but when Pilgrim is nearly defeated, he asks the Punisher to spare his children. The Punisher instead kills the Schultzes and rescues the children. After reuniting with his kids, Pilgrim parts ways with the Punisher.

Biography Early life and education Hobson was born at his parents‚Äô farm at Church End, Fleet Hargate, near Holbeach in Lincolnshire. He attended local schools at Fleet and Long Sutton, before being sent to a boarding school at Dursley, Gloucestershire, and then attended Framlingham College, Suffolk, between 1905 and 1909. He was, in his own words, \\"excellent at nothing\\". His family moved to another farm at Bungay, Suffolk, and Hobson worked there during the holidays. After leaving school he gained an apprenticeship at Mann Egerton as an electrician, but \\"learned nothing except to blow fuses\\". In 1912, aged 18, his father bought him a ticket to Canada. Hobson sailed aboard the from Liverpool to Quebec, with only ¬£5 in his pocket. He first worked on a farm in Ayr, Ontario, and later worked as painter in an agricultural implements factory. After a year he moved to Buffalo, New York, working in a store cleaning fur coats, then served as a deckhand on a lake steamer. He eventually jumped ship at Port Arthur, Ontario, and rode a freight train to Winnipeg to work on a farm, until he saved enough money to take the train to Vancouver, where he worked as a carpenter building houses in Victoria, Vancouver Island, and as a handyman at a cement works at Bamberton. When the war broke out in August 1914, Hobson returned to England, travelling via train from Seattle to New York, then to Liverpool aboard the . World War I Hobson enlisted into the Honourable Artillery Company, serving as a driver, but eventually transferred to the Royal Flying Corps on 10 May 1917, having spent \\"...a hell of a long time messing about the South and East Anglia...\\" After ground training as a cadet he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 21 June. He was posted to Salisbury Plain for flying instruction, and noted that the \\"flying instructors were a hard-hearted lot of bastards ‚Äì after 20 minutes dual instruction I was sent up solo by a Scot named Blackwood ‚Äì managed to get down all in one piece, I was lucky, but many weren't ‚Äì the number killed was terrific.\\" He was confirmed in his rank on 27 September, and posted to No. 84 Squadron in France on 22 October, where his commanding officer was Sholto Douglas. Hobson, despite \\"...not knowing how to really fly a machine much less fight it...\\" was thrown into action, and noted \\"It was cheerful to be posted to a squadron where I found the majority of recent additions writing letters \\"To be opened when I have gone\\".\\" However, \\"...more by good luck than anything I managed to get away with it and survived.\\" Hobson, flying a S.E.5a single-seat fighter, gained his first aerial victory on 13 February 1918, shooting down an Albatros D.V north-east of St. Quentin. A few days later, on 18 February, he drove down another 'out of control' over Beaurevoir. On 13 March he shot down and killed Oberleutnant zur See Konrad Mettlich, commander of Jasta 8 over Remaucourt, and on the 16th he and Lieutenant George Owen Johnson destroyed a LVG C reconnaissance aircraft over Villers-Outr√©aux. During the German Spring Offensive of March and April the Allies were pushed back, and for a time No. 84 Squadron were based at a different aerodrome every night. They were reassigned from high level fighter patrols to a ground attack role, which made them more vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, and Hobson noted that \\"...it was nothing to come home with 150 to 200 bullet holes in the machine...\\". Despite this he gained three more victories, accounting for two more Albatros's and a Fokker Dr.I between April 20 and 23. He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 22 June 1918. His citation read: :Temporary 2nd Lieutenant Percy Kyme Hobson, General List and RFC. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. Observing a large body of troops with transport, he descended to within 200 feet, and, despite very severe enemy rifle and machine gun fire from the ground, dropped four bombs, three of which were direct hits on the transport, causing severe casualties, which were increased by the accurate machine gun fire brought to bear on his target. On a later occasion, he observed a large body of troops moving across the open, and attacked these with bombs and machine gun fire, causing many casualties and scattering them in all directions. He has been responsible for the destruction of four enemy machines, and has at all times shown a complete disregard for personal danger. Hobson returned to England, flying night patrols over London, and being promoted to the acting rank of captain on 1 September 1918. He then served as a flying instructor, before eventually leaving the Royal Air Force on 26 April 1919. Post war After the war Hobson decided to seek his fortune in South Africa, arriving at Cape Town in January 1920. He made his way to Malalane in the Eastern Transvaal, where his uncle had a farm. He and another ex-RFC man managed to make a living growing vegetables, but in 1927, he moved further north, gaining a position as a store manager in Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia (now Kabwe, Zambia). He was then employed as a driver by the transportation company of E. Cort \\"Billy\\" Dunn, a former major in the Royal Engineers. On 22 December 1928 he married Colleen Islay Halliwell at St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. In 1930 he and Andrew Thatcher, another of Dunn's drivers, founded their own transportation company \\"Thatcher & Hobson\\", initially with a single Chevrolet 1¬Ω-tonner bought on hire purchase. They were soon running three vehicles, mainly between Broken Hill and Abercorn (now Mbala), and also gained contracts from Loangwa Concessions to transport their personnel, and later a mail contract. With the onset of Great Depression, much economic activity in the country ceased, and Thatcher & Hobson were threatened with bankruptcy. However, they won a contract to transport aviation fuel to Mpika, where Imperial Airways had constructed a way-point on the air route from Europe to South Africa, and managed to survive, even opening a branch at Lusaka for operations on the Great East Road to Fort Jameson (now Chipata). The company prospered, and later added a fleet of buses to its commercial freight operations. In 1948 Thatcher and Hobson supplied Piper Cubs to the Flying Club of Northern Rhodesia, which had been closed down at the outbreak of World War II, and struggled to restart afterwards. By 1954 the Thatcher, Hobson & Co. passenger and goods transport business was operating 250 trucks and buses, when it was taken over by the United Transport Company, and renamed Central African Road Services. Hobson had reportedly left the business some time before to farm in Tanganyika.

Lieutenant Holden was ordered to attack several German balloons, reported to be regulating effective artillery fire on our troops. After driving off an enemy plane, encountered before reaching the balloons, he soon came upon five balloons in ascension one kilometer apart. In attacking the first, which proved to be a decoy with a basket, his guns jammed; after clearing them he attacked the second balloon, forcing the observer to jump. His guns again jammed before he could set fire to this balloon. Moving on the third balloon at a height of only 50 meters, he set fire to it and compelled the observer to jump. He was prevented from attacking the two remaining balloons by the further jamming of his machine gun.

History This ministry was established as a result of negotiations between leaders of the Belarusian People's Republic and the Council of Lithuania in November‚ÄìDecember 1918. Lithuanians wanted to secure Belarusian support in the upcoming Paris Peace Conference over the borders of the new Lithuanian State. For the same reason, there was a Ministry for Jewish Affairs. As a result of the negotiations, six Belarusians were co-opted into the council on 27 November and the Ministry for Belarusian Affairs was established on 9 December. Jazep Varonka became the first minister without portfolio. When Vilnius was captured in December 1918 by the Red Army at the outbreak of the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War, the Ministry for Belarusian Affair evacuated to Grodno while other Lithuanian government institutions evacuated to Kaunas. The ministry moved to Kaunas in spring 1919 when Grodno was captured during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. By spring 1919, Belarusian leaders became disillusioned with Lithuanian support. Belarusian Prime Minister Anton Luckievich sent Pyotra Krecheuski to negotiate with Lithuania regarding liquidation of the Ministry for Belarusian Affairs and establishment of a diplomatic mission of the Belarusian People's Republic in Kaunas. Negotiations failed and Varonka remained minister. In late 1919, the Lithuanian government decided to reign in ministry's contacts with foreign powers, specifically the West Russian Volunteer Army and the Belarusian People's Republic. Several Belarusian couriers traveling from Berlin to Riga were arrested and Varonka resigned in protest on 3 January 1920. Government inspectors found no irregularities at the ministry and the couriers were soon released, but the ministry was essentially inactive from February to June 1920 when new minister Dominik Semashko was appointed. He did not support Belarusian autonomy and thus was largely isolated from the community. On 11 November 1920, after Lithuania lost its capital Vilnius to the ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny, the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic signed a partnership treaty with Lithuania and relocated to Kaunas. That brought two centers of Belarusians activities to Kaunas but they were not inclined to cooperate. Their competences were divided: the ministry was in charge of Belarusian affairs inside the Lithuanian borders up to the demarcation line with Poland, while the Rada was in charge in Vilnius Region (i.e. between the demarcation line and the border drawn by the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Peace Treaty). That pushed the ministry into a secondary role as the Lithuanians cared more about the support Belarusians could provide in their territorial conflict with Poland over the Vilnius Region. Semashko resigned in February 1923 when a new cabinet was sworn in. Lithuanians could not find a suitable replacement and Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas also became acting Minister for Belarusian Affairs in the 8th cabinet that was appointed in June 1923. The last employees of the ministry were dismissed on 31 December 1923. The Ministry for Belarusian Affairs was officially liquidated on 19 January 1924. Its Jewish counterpart followed suit a couple months later. Activities Belarusians envisioned Lithuania that would include territories of the former Vilna and Grodno Governorates and where Belarusians would be treated not as an ethnic minority but as an equal. To that end, they sought autonomy in Belarusian-inhabited areas. The Lithuanian government did not support such aspirations and limited activities of the Ministry for Belarusian Affairs. In January 1919, Varonka presented a plan for the ministry's functions that included education and social support. However, the government approved only seven out of 20 activities and provided funding of 28,400 German Papiermarks out of requested 197,300. Thus, the ministry carried out mostly representative functions. Varonka sent notes to German and the Entente Powers protesting Polish and Soviet military actions in Belarusian-inhabited areas, and met with American and French military attach√©s. From September 1919 to February 1920, the ministry published illustrated Belarusian-language Journal of the Ministry for Belarusian Affairs (–ß–∞—Å–æ–ø—ñ—Å—å –ú—ñ–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—ç—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫—ñ—Ö —Å–ø—Ä–∞—û) which wrote on activities of the Lithuanian government, culture and education of Belarusians, biographies of prominent activists. The ministry published weekly two-page Belarusian newsletter Pahonia (–ü–∞–≥–æ–Ω—è, name of Belarusian coat of arms) from July to October 1920. Its circulation was 2,000 copies. The newsletter reported on military actions and other news from Belarusian territories. The ministry also published several Belarusian language books, including two collections of poems by Franci≈°ak Bahu≈°eviƒç, translated fairy-tales by Hans Christian Andersen, primer by Jan Stankieviƒç, several books by Vaclau Lastouski. After the resignation of Semashko, Klawdziy Duzh-Dushewski continued cultural activities of the ministry and organized a six-week training on Lithuanian and Belarusian languages. When the ministry was closed, the publication of Belarusian books was taken over by Lastouski and Duzh-Dushewski.

It was a follow-up to his 2007 series Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain. A New Dawn Marr begins the series with the death of Queen Victoria and the Boer War. The population was \\"enjoying the bawdy pleasures of music hall\\", leading to concerns over the \\"physical and moral strength\\" of the working class. He describes the power struggles between David Lloyd George and Joseph Chamberlain, the women's suffrage movement, and the day on which Mr Rolls met Mr Royce. Road to War The suffragette campaign becomes violent and independence for Ireland is proposed, while dockers and miners go on strike for improved conditions and wages, and the popular press raise fears of a German invasion. As a result, Liberal Chancellor, David Lloyd George, faced the dilemma of pensions or battleships. Marr also describes technological advances such as aviation and cinema, with future Hollywood stars Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel touring together across Britain. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo precipitates war, and Lloyd George is now in political conflict with his former ally, Winston Churchill. The Great War Dealing with World War I and its effects, Marr focuses on Lord Kitchener and his volunteer army and German gun-boat attacks on the north-east coast of England. Meanwhile, John Fisher, First Sea Lord disappears in strange circumstances and a sex scandal threatens the British establishment. In Belgium, Marr visits trenches of Flanders and describes the terrible conditions and gallows humour that prevailed. Back in Britain people worked tirelessly for the war effort. Having a Ball Following the war, Lloyd George promises \\"Homes Fit For Heroes\\", leading to a housing boom; it is the birth of radio broadcasting and the BBC is born. Michael Collins negotiates with Lloyd George over Ireland, leading to the founding of an Irish Free State; Ireland would have her own government but would remain within the British Commonwealth, this disappointing result led to the civil war. Lloyd George is involved in a cash-for-honours scandal. The 1926 General Strike and the Wall Street Crash make the future of Britain uncertain. Little Britain The Wall Street Crash had repercussions for Britain and a national financial crisis ensued. Solutions were offered by the Greenshirts and Blackshirts, the latter led by Oswald Mosley. The rise of fascism in Europe was largely ignored while Britons enjoyed Gracie Fields's singing and the novelty of Butlins holiday camps. House building continued into \\"Metroland\\", providing mock Tudor homes for the new commuter class. Britannia at Bay Marr tells the story of Second World War, beginning with the defeat at Dunkirk that would become the model for the \\"national spirit\\"- everyone collaborating in whatever way they could in order to defeat Hitler. In 1940, only Britain, led by Churchill, stood against the German forces, and Churchill's rallying speeches typified \\"the Blitz spirit\\" while a Nazi invasion seemed unavoidable. The Home Guard was quickly formed, and the privations of wartime led to innovation and cooperation in novel ways.

Mission History World War II The first predecessor of the squadron was the 1st Photographic Lab Section, which was activated in October 1943 at Will Rogers Field, Oklahoma. After training in the United States, it served with Ninth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations until V-E Day, advancing across Northern Europe with American Forces. It remained in Germany as part of the occupation forces until inactivating in November 1945. Strategic reconnaissance The 90th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron was activated at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas in June 1952 to provide processing and interpretation of reconnaissance products for the 90th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. In the fall of that year a second reconnaissance wing became operational at Forbes, and the 90th was replaced by the 815th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, which supported the 90th and 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wings until inactivating in the summer of 1958. These two squadrons and the World War II era 1st Photographic Technical Unit were consolidated into a single unit in October 1984 and given the designation 24 Reconnaissance Technical Squadron. Intelligence support in Hawaii In 1980, Electronic Security Command organized the 6924th Electronic Security Squadron at Wheeler Air Force Base, Hawaii. In the 1990s, the Air Force eliminated units whose organization was controlled by its Major Commands (MAJCON or 4-digit units) The 6924th was converted to an Air Force controlled unit by consolidating it with the 24 Reconnaissance Technical Squadron (which had never been active with this designation) as the 324 Intelligence Squadron.

TRILL combines techniques from bridging and routing and is the application of link-state routing to the VLAN- aware customer-bridging problem. RBridges are compatible with and can incrementally replace previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges. They are also compatible with IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are invisible to current IP routers and, like routers, RBridges terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol. General overview TRILL switches run a link-state routing protocol amongst themselves. A link-state protocol is one in which connectivity is broadcast to all the RBridges, so that each RBridge knows about all the other RBridges, and the connectivity between them. This gives RBridges enough information to compute pair-wise optimal paths for unicast, and calculate distribution trees for delivery of frames either to destinations whose location is unknown or to multicast or broadcast groups. The link state routing protocol used is IS-IS because: * it runs directly over Layer 2, so it can be run without configuration (no IP addresses need to be assigned) * it is easy to extend by defining new TLV (type-length-value) data elements and sub- elements for carrying TRILL information. To mitigate temporary loop issues, RBridges forward based on a header with a hop count. RBridges also specify the next hop RBridge as the frame destination when forwarding unicast frames across a shared-media link, which avoids spawning additional copies of frames during a temporary loop. A reverse path forwarding check and other checks are performed on multi-destination frames to further control potentially looping traffic. The first RBridge that a unicast frame encounters in a campus, RB1, encapsulates the received frame with a TRILL header that specifies the last RBridge, RB2, where the frame is decapsulated. RB1 is known as the \\"ingress RBridge\\" and RB2 is known as the \\"egress RBridge\\". To save room in the TRILL header and simplify forwarding lookups, a dynamic nickname acquisition protocol is run among the RBridges to select two-octet nicknames for RBridges, unique within the campus, which are an abbreviation for the six-octet IS-IS system ID of the RBridge. The two-octet nicknames are used to specify the ingress and egress RBridges in the TRILL header. The TRILL header consists of six octets: the first two octets include a six bit decrementing hop count, plus flags; the next two octets contain the egress RBridge nickname; the final two octets contain the ingress RBridge nickname. For multi-destination frames, the \\"egress RBridge nickname\\" specifies a distribution tree for the frame, where the (nick)named RBridge is the root of the distribution tree. The ingress RBridge selects which distribution tree the frame should travel along. Even though RBridges are transparent to Layer 3 devices, and all the links interconnected by RBridges appear to Layer 3 devices to be a single link, RBridges act as link routers in the sense that, in the forwarding of a frame by a transit RBridge, the outer Layer 2 header is replaced at each hop with an appropriate Layer 2 header for the next hop, and the hop count is decreased. Despite these modifications of the outer Layer 2 header and the hop count in the TRILL Header, the original encapsulated frame is preserved, including the original frame's VLAN tag. Multipathing of multi-destination frames through alternative distribution tree roots and ECMP (Equal Cost MultiPath) of unicast frames are supported. Networks with a more mesh-like structure will benefit to a greater extent from the multipathing and optimal paths provided by TRILL than will networks with a more tree-like structure. TRILL links From the point of view of TRILL, a link can be any of a wide variety of link technologies, including IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), PPP (Point to Point Protocol)., or a Pseudo-wire. Ethernet links between RBridges can incorporate IEEE customer or provider 802.1 bridges. In other words, an arbitrary bridged LAN appears to an RBridge as a multi-access link. It is essential that only one RBridge act as the ingress RBridge for any given native frame and TRILL has an Appointed Forwarder mechanism to assure this. TRILL does allow load splitting of this duty on a link based on VLAN, so that only one RBridge on each link encapsulates and decapsulates native frames for each VLAN. RBridge ports RBridge ports can compatibly implement a wide variety of existing and proposed link level and IEEE 802.1 port level protocols including PAUSE (IEEE 802.3 Annex 31B), the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (IEEE 802.1AB), link aggregation (IEEE 802.1AX), MAC security (IEEE 802.1AE), or port based access control (IEEE 802.1X). This is because RBridges are layered above the IEEE 802.1 EISS (Extended Internal Sublayer Service) with the exception that an RBridge port handles spanning tree and VLAN registration PDUs differently.

Brocade Virtual Cluster Switching, uses the TRILL data plane but a proprietary control plane and so is not interoperable with standards conformant TRILL. VLAN support The TRILL protocol provides mandatory support for the usual 4K VLANs and can optionally support 24-bit Fine Grain Labels (FGL) in addition to VLANs.

Narrated by Chuck Sullivan, it was filmed between 1973 and 1974 but finally remastered and later released in 2002. The movie was financed by American singer and actor Elvis Presley, who began to practice karate during his duty years in the United States Army. Production In 1974, George Waite presented the idea of the film to Ed Parker, Presley's karate instructor. In the film, Presley was playing the main role, introducing Karate arts divided in narration and demonstrations. Parker presented the idea to Presley, who subsequently liked the idea. There was a meeting organized at Graceland, but no major details were arranged because Presley had to leave for travel to Las Vegas to perform on a show. The next morning Presley called Waite and sent his private plane to fly Waite and his wife to Vegas to complete the meeting. During the show, Presley extended a $50,000 check for beginning the production of the film. In 1977, after Presley's death, the movie was stored in a garage in West Hollywood inside the bed of a truck, along with other memorabilia objects. In 2001, the footage was found, restored, and later released on August 17, 2002.

Carlshaus Tower  On the summit of the Carlshaush√∂he, which rises to the west of the B 81 federal highway, stands the 50 m high Carlshaus Tower (Carlshausturm), or Karlshaus Tower, which was built a few hundred metres west of the Carlshaus on the eastern slope of the mountain. It has an open steel design and its opening was celebrated on 27 July 1998. The Carlshaus Tower acts as a radio tower for the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways (HSB), two branches of which pass by the tower a few kilometres to the south and east respectively, as well as an observation tower. It replaced the Bismarck Tower built in 1901 and demolished by the Soviet Armed Forces in 1981., The Bismarck Tower was also of open steel construction, was about 20 m high and crowned by a circular observation deck. From its observation platform, that sits above the tops of the trees at a height of about 30 metres and is accessible via a staircase with 155 steps, there is an all-round view, for example, over the highlands of the Harz. The highest peak in the Harz, the Brocken, is visible from here as well as the Kyffh√§user. The Carlshaus Tower has been included in a project by the Harz Transport Federation and the Harz Club.

He played college football at the University of Tulsa. Early years Townes was born on July 21, 1943 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and played high school football at Rowan High School. In football he played end, tackle and fullback, as a 6-3 220-pounder. He also ran track and practiced basketball (averaged 14 points per game). He accepted a football scholarship from Indiana University, but ended up transferring after his freshman year to Coffeyville Junior College. In 1964, he transferred to the University of Tulsa, where he along with Charlie Brown, Randy Phillips, Richard Tyson and Jim Brown, were the first athletes to break the school's color barrier. Townes would become one of the best defensive linemen in school's history. He was a two-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection at defensive tackle in 1964 and 1965. The 1964 team beat Mississippi 14-7 in the Bluebonnet Bowl, where he received the game‚Äôs outstanding lineman trophy. He also was an honorable- mention All-American selection. In 1965, he was an All-American candidate, but ankle and knee injuries limited him that year. He passed up his senior year in 1966 to sign with an NFL team, when he became eligible because he was a redshirt player whose class had graduated. In 1986, he was inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Townes was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (22nd overall) of the 1966 NFL Draft and also in the first round of the 1966 AFL Redshirt Draft by the Boston Patriots of the American Football League. He was selected with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over, but Townes instead elected to leave college and sign with the team. He started his professional career as a defensive tackle, but in the middle of his rookie season, he was moved to left defensive end, replacing Larry Stephens in the starting lineup after the seventh game. At the end of the year, he was considered one of the top rookies in the league and a rising star. He is perhaps best known for causing Bart Starr to fumble in the 1967 NFL Championship Game, commonly known as the Ice Bowl. The fumble was picked up and returned for a touchdown by defensive end George Andrie, scoring six of the Cowboys' 17 points in the loss. Townes played in only 5 games during the 1968 season, after suffering a serious hamstring injury and was replaced in the starting lineup by rookie Larry Cole, who would not relinquish the position back. Cole moved to tackle in 1975 following the retirement of Bob Lilly, allowing Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones, the number one overall pick in the 1974 NFL Draft, to start at left end. He missed the entire 1969 season due to the same injury. Citing health and weight problems as a major reason for their decision, the Cowboys traded him to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for a fourth round draft choice (#80-Joe Carter) on September 9, 1970. The NFL didn't start recognizing quarterback sacks as an official stat until 1982; however the Cowboys have their own records, dating back before the 1982 season. According to the Cowboys' stats, Townes is unofficially credited with a total of 9 sacks during his 1966 season, tying him with Harvey Martin for the most by a Cowboys rookie in franchise history. With 15 sacks, he is also tied with Larry Cole for the third most sacks (behind DeMarcus Ware and Harvey Martin) recorded by a Cowboys player in his first two years in the NFL. New Orleans Saints Townes was released on January 25, 1971, after appearing in just six games with the New Orleans Saints. Townes fell out of favor when coach Tom Fears was fired midway through the 1970 season and replaced by J.D. Roberts, who disdained the aging, mostly over-the-hill players stockpiled by Fears. New York Giants He finished his NFL career after he was released by the New York Giants on August 24, 1971. During his short career he played in 38 games, recorded one safety and one touchdown. Personal life In 1982, he filed a malpractice lawsuit against the Dallas Cowboys. After football he had 2 knee replacements and a shoulder replacement. He died from a heart attack on July 22, 2017 in Dallas, one day after his 74th birthday. It was later discovered that he also had pancreatic cancer.

It found that any legislation which has a privative clause purporting to exclude review of jurisdictional matters is outside the jurisdiction of a provincial legislature.[1981] 2 SCR 220 at 234 Facts The decision examined the Professional Code, a Quebec statute which governed 38 professional corporations. The law required each of the corporations to establish a discipline committee in conformity with the code that would examine allegations of professional misconduct.

The demise of this culture after European colonisation heralded a new era of art production more closely related to traditional tastes in Europe, created by itinerant artists keen to return picturesque images of the \\"new world\\" to Europe. Foremost among these were Agostino Brunias, Philip Wickstead, James Hakewill and J. B. Kidd. Perhaps the earliest artist to take a more Jamaican-centered approach to the island culture was Isaac Mendes Belisario (1795‚Äì1849). His portfolio of lithographs, Sketches of Character, In Illustration of the Habits, Occupation, and Costume of the Negro Population in the Island of Jamaica, published in collaboration with the lithographer Adolphe Duperly in 1837‚Äì38, documents activities of slaves immediately after their emancipation.Tim Barringer, Gillian Forrester, Barbaro Martinez-Ruiz (Eds.,) Art and Emancipation in Jamaica: Belisario and his Worlds, Yale Center for British Art, 2007 The modern movement The National Gallery of Jamaica dates the nationalist-oriented art movement to the beginning of the twentieth century and the arrival of Edna Manley to Jamaica in 1922. Her observations and journals on art and artists from that time have provided early documentation on the movement's development. Her work, Bead Seller (1922), has been used as the earliest work in the National Gallery of Jamaica's permanent collection of mode. Educated in the UK, she publicly criticized Jamaica's local artwork as \\"anaemic,\\" believing that it demonstrated a preoccupation with European-styled landscapes and portraiture, using traditional techniques that insufficiently reflected Jamaica's culture and people.Daily Gleaner, 20 December 1934 Her support of volunteer art classes at the Institute of Jamaica fostered the talents of artists such as Albert Huie, Ralph Campbell, Henry Daley, and Osmond Watson. The classes in 1950 became formalized into an art program offered at the Jamaica School of Art, an institution that was later named the Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts, as a tribute to her contribution.Petrine Archer- Straw, Fifty Years -Sixty Artists, 2000 During the 1950s and 1960s, many of Jamaica's artists received formal training in Britain as a result of scholarships provided by the British Council. Ralph Campbell attended classes at Goldsmiths College; Barrington Watson trained at the Royal College of Art; and Osmond Watson studied at St Martins. Each artist developed his own representational style, influenced by post-impressionism, realism, and cubism, respectively. All three artists returned to teach at the Jamaica School of Art. Since the island declared independence in 1962, Jamaican art has swung between two styles that Chief Curator, David Boxer, has defined as \\"mainstream\\" and \\"intuitive.\\"David Boxer, Jamaican Art 1922 -1982, Smithsonian Institution, exh. cat. \\"Mainstream\\" references Jamaica's trained artists, more often exposed to art trends and styles used abroad. The 'intuitive' movement consists of artists who maintain stronger links with African forms of expression, are predominantly closed to any external influences, and are usually self-taught. During the 1980s, a trend towards the fusion of these two styles was apparent in the work of artists such as Milton George, Omari Ra (aka African or Robert Cookhorne), and Khalfani Ra (aka Makandal Dada or Douglas Wallace). Smithsonian curator Vera Hyatt labelled them New Imagists, referencing the way the body in convulsive forms dominates their canvases.New Imagists in Jamaican Art. 1987. Exhib. cat., illus. Group exhibition. Included: Milton George, Khalfani Ra, Omarian Ra. WASHINGTON (DC) Recent trends In the 1990s, a greater awareness of post-modern trends and a connection with Jamaica's wider diaspora communities in Britain, Canada, and the US saw many artists such as Albert Chong, Anna Henriques, Petrona Morrison, Margaret Chen, and David Boxer reappraising their personal cultural histories. They began revisiting the sites of their ancestral origins (be they indigenous Amerindian cultures, African, or European), having a greater need to understand and visualize the Jamaican experience and their own sense of place within the Caribbean.New World Imagery: Contemporary Jamaican Art, (exh. cat.) South Bank and Touring, 1996 But events in Jamaica have overtaken these concerns, turning an even younger generation of artists' attention inwards. Many of Jamaica's contemporary artists in the 1990s were concerned with post- colonial issues of identity and place. They explored these issues through group shows, such as the Caribbean Biennales and other regional exhibitions. This allowed them to establish commonality with artists from other islands. The art of this past decade appears to be shifting in focus once again.Infinite Island (exh. cat.), Brooklyn Museum, 2008. Younger artists, such as Ebony G. Patterson, Michael Elliot, Phillip Thomas, Christopher Irons, and Peter Rickards, are engaging with issues of violence, homophobia, and social dislocation that have been a feature of Jamaica's recent past. These are events and trends that are still unfolding, but they suggest that this generation of artists is having to compete with the more glaring aspects of the country's popular culture related to dance hall, ghetto fabulous fashions, street art, and the aesthetics of bling funeralsAnnie Paul, \\"'No Grave Cannot Hold My Body Down': Rituals of Death and Burial in Postcolonial Jamaica\\", Small Axe, no. 23 (June 2007): 142‚Äì46 for a stake in the nation's visual memory.Veerle Poupeye, \\"What Times Are These?

In 1972, the reinforced concrete building was purchased by the firm and remodeled as its new headquarters. The structure was stripped to its shell and new exterior walls constructed. The north and west facades were covered with tinted glass in a specially designed framing system that is almost invisible at first glance. The edges of the panes of glass comprise the wall abut giving the appearance of one sheet with no support. Four adjacent panes are fastened at their corners by an x-shaped bracket.

Equation (1) above can be derived from kinematic assumptions and the constitutive relations for the plate. Equations (2) are the two equations for the conservation of linear momentum in two dimensions where it is assumed that the out‚Äìof‚Äìplane stresses () are zero.  Validity of the F√∂ppl‚Äìvon K√°rm√°n equations  While the F√∂ppl‚Äìvon K√°rm√°n equations are of interest from a purely mathematical point of view, the physical validity of these equations is questionable.von Karman plate equations http://imechanica.org/node/6618 Accessed Tue July 30 2013 14:20. Ciarlet states: The two-dimensional von Karman equations for plates, originally proposed by von Karman [1910], play a mythical role in applied mathematics. While they have been abundantly, and satisfactorily, studied from the mathematical standpoint, as regards notably various questions of existence, regularity, and bifurcation, of their solutions, their physical soundness has been often seriously questioned. Reasons include the facts that # the theory depends on an approximate geometry which is not clearly defined # a given variation of stress over a cross-section is assumed arbitrarily # a linear constitutive relation is used that does not correspond to a known relation between well defined measures of stress and strain # some components of strain are arbitrarily ignored # there is a confusion between reference and deformed configurations which makes the theory inapplicable to the large deformations for which it was apparently devised. Conditions under which these equations are actually applicable and will give reasonable results when solved are discussed in Ciarlet.  Equations in terms of Airy stress function  The three F√∂ppl‚Äìvon K√°rm√°n equations can be reduced to two by introducing the Airy stress function \\\\varphi where : \\\\sigma_{11} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_2^2} ~,~~ \\\\sigma_{22} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_1^2} ~,~~ \\\\sigma_{12} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} \\\\,. Then the above equations become : \\\\frac{Eh^3}{12(1- u^2)}\\\\Delta^2 w-h\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_2^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_1^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_2^2}-2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\, \\\\partial x_2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\, \\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)=P : \\\\Delta^2\\\\varphi+E\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_2^2}-\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\, \\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^2\\\\right\\\\\\\\}=0 \\\\,.  Pure bending For the pure bending of thin plates the equation of equilibrium is D\\\\Delta^2\\\\ w=P, where : D :=\\\\frac{Eh^3}{12(1- u^2)} is called flexural or cylindrical rigidity of the plate.  Kinematic assumptions (Kirchhoff hypothesis)  In the derivation of the F√∂ppl‚Äìvon K√°rm√°n equations the main kinematic assumption (also known as the Kirchhoff hypothesis) is that surface normals to the plane of the plate remain perpendicular to the plate after deformation. It is also assumed that the in-plane (membrane) displacements are small and the change in thickness of the plate is negligible. These assumptions imply that the displacement field in the plate can be expressed as : u_1(x_1,x_2,x_3) = v_1(x_1,x_2)-x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1} ~,~~ u_2(x_1,x_2,x_3) = v_2(x_1,x_2)-x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2} ~,~~ u_3(x_1, x_2, x_3) = w(x_1,x_2) in which is the in-plane (membrane) displacement. This form of the displacement field implicitly assumes that the amount of rotation of the plate is small.  Strain-displacement relations (von K√°rm√°n strains)  The components of the three-dimensional Lagrangian Green strain tensor are defined as : E_{ij} := \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_i}{\\\\partial x_j} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial u_k}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial u_k}{\\\\partial x_j}\\\\right] \\\\,.

Neglecting all other higher order terms, and enforcing the requirement that the plate does not change its thickness, the strain tensor components reduce to the von K√°rm√°n strains : \\\\begin{align} E_{11} & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_1}{\\\\partial x_1} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{22} & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial v_2}{\\\\partial x_2} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_2^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{12} & = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_1}{\\\\partial x_2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_2}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2} -x_3\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{33} & = 0 ~,~~ E_{23} = 0 ~,~~ E_{13} = 0 \\\\,. \\\\end{align} The first terms are the usual small-strains, for the mid-surface. The second terms, involving squares of displacement gradients, are non-linear, and need to be considered when the plate bending is fairly large (when the rotations are about 10 ‚Äì 15 degrees). These first two terms together are called the membrane strains. The last terms, involving second derivatives, are the flexural (bending) strains. They involve the curvatures. These zero terms are due to the assumptions of the classical plate theory, which assume elements normal to the mid-plane remain inextensible and line elements perpendicular to the mid-plane remain normal to the mid-plane after deformation.  Stress‚Äìstrain relations  If we assume that the Cauchy stress tensor components are linearly related to the von K√°rm√°n strains by Hooke's law, the plate is isotropic and homogeneous, and that the plate is under a plane stress condition,Typically, an assumption of zero out-of-plane stress is made at this point. we have = = = 0 and : \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\sigma_{11} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\cfrac{E}{(1- u^2)} \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & u & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ u & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1- u \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} E_{11} \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ E_{12} \\\\end{bmatrix} Expanding the terms, the three non-zero stresses are : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{11} &= \\\\cfrac{E}{(1- u^2)}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_1}{\\\\partial x_1} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1^2} \\\\right) + u\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_2}{\\\\partial x_2} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_2^2} \\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{22} &= \\\\cfrac{E}{(1- u^2)}\\\\left[ u\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_1}{\\\\partial x_1} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1^2} \\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_2}{\\\\partial x_2} \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2}\\\\right)^2 -x_3\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_2^2} \\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{12} &= \\\\cfrac{E}{(1+ u)}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_1}{\\\\partial x_2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_2}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial w}{\\\\partial x_2} -x_3\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 w}{\\\\partial x_1 \\\\partial x_2} \\\\right] \\\\,. \\\\end{align}  Stress resultants  The stress resultants in the plate are defined as : N_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} := \\\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\\\sigma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\, d x_3 ~,~~ M_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} := \\\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} x_3\\\\,\\\\sigma_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\, d x_3 \\\\,.

He was the founder of the archaeology school in Central Asia and a professor, doctor of historical and archaeological sciences and member of the Turkmen Academy of Sciences. Masson was the descendant of a French aristocrat who moved to Russia during the Jacobin terror. He studied at the Samarkand men's gymnasium. In 1916 Masson started studies at the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute to become an engineer and irrigator. However he was required to join the army and then returned to Samarkand in 1918. He gained an interest in the protection and restoration of historical landmarks in Samarkand and soon became curator of the Samarkand Oblast Museum. He began conducting archaeological investigations and excursions and added to the museums' collection including panels of the Samanid palace excavated in Afrasiyab. In 1924, Masson went to Tashkent and became head of the archaeological department of the Museum of Middle Asia. He was also further educated at the Turkistan Institute for the Oriental Studies and from 1929 to 1936 studied the history of mining at the Geological Committee. He led further expeditions including the Termez Archaeological Complex Expedition (1936‚Äì1938); the expedition for the archaeological supervision at the construction of the Great Fergana Channel (1936), STACE - South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition (1946‚Äì1968), and KAE - Kesh Archaeological Expedition (from 1963).

It exists in three different versions. History During the Second World War, from September 1942 to November 1943, Lucien Wercollier was a prisoner in the Nazi Hinzert concentration camp, where he witnessed other prisoners being tortured. SS officers took two of them, roped their hands together and then tied their backs together. After this, they had to stay outside for days, in winter. It was in the Hinzert concentration camp that Wercollier met Jean Daligault, a French Resistance fighter, priest and artist, who was kidnapped and brought to Hinzert after the Nacht und Nebel directive. In December 1942, Wercollier shared food out of his Christmas package with Daligault, who was not allowed to receive anything from his family. As a thank-you gift, Daligault gave Wercollier a small sculpture that he had made out of old pieces of wood. It represented two prisoners with their hands tied together and roped together back to back. Wercollier hid this sculpture under his things, to bring it home to Luxembourg in November 1943. After the war, Wercollier made his own sculpture, Le prisonnier politique, using one of Daligault's prisoners as model. Today, Daligault's original sculpture is still owned by the Wercollier Family. Versions Today, three versions of Lucien Wercollier's Le prisonnier politique exist. All three of them are made of bronze. * A first version was put up in 1956 in the Mus√©e national de la r√©sistance (National Resistance Museum) in Esch-sur-Alzette. * In 1969, a second version, made in 1954, was erected at the cemetery Cimeti√®re Notre-Dame in Limpertsberg, as a part of the Monument national de la r√©sistance et de la d√©portation (Monument of the national resistance and deportation). * After the death of Wercollier, the state of Luxembourg ordered a third version of the sculpture, cast from the artist's original gypsum model. This version is exhibited with a part of the artist's private collection in Neum√ºnster Abbey.

He was one of the first major publishers of literature in the vernacular Italian language. Early life and career Giolito was born at Trino to Giovanni the Elder and Guglielmina Borgominieri. In 1523 he established the Libreria della Fenice (Bookshop of the Phoenix), a printing press and bookstore, with his father in the Rialto district of Venice, at the time a major European center of the new art of printing. When his father moved to Turin, Gabriele operated the press initially with his brothers and then with increasing autonomy, acquiring shops in Naples, Bologna, and Ferrara. He married Lucrezia Bin in 1544 and with her had twelve children. He died at Venice in 1578. Publications Giolito's press published a mix of Renaissance classics and new authors. Giolito was dedicated to publishing works in the lingua volgare, or Italian vernacular, as opposed to Latin, Greek and other languages not familiar to the common population. Beginning in 1545, his printing house issued the influential collections of lyric poetry entitled 'Rime Diverse' and known today as the 'Giolito Anthologies.' Eight anthologies would follow, not all of them published by Giolito.Louise George Clubb and William G. Clubb, \\"Building a Lyric Canon: Gabriel Giolito and the Rival Anthologists, 1545-1590,\\" Italica 68.3 (1991): 332-44. The poems in these anthologies, especially the first two, would serve as influential models to the French poet Joachim du Bellay.JoAnn DellaNeva, \\"Variations in a Minor Key: Du Bellay's Imitations of the Giolito Anthology Poets,\\" French Forum 14.2 (1989): 133-46. He was also famous for his 1555 edition of Dante Alighieri's Commedia, edited by Lodovico Dolce and for the first time published with the title Divina Commedia. Giolito was also well known for his printer's mark, which had many variations but was most often represented by a phoenix emerging from flames atop a globe with the initials G.G.F.http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/web_iccu/imain.htm (Publisher file CNCT 33) File:Giolito.jpg File:Giolito 2.jpg File:Giolito 3.jpg Death Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari died in Venice in 1578.

APRV is an applied continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) that at a set timed interval releases the applied pressure. Depending on the ventilator manufacturer, it may be referred to as BiVent. This is just as appropriate to use, since the only difference is that the term APRV is copyrighted.  History  Static pressure-volume curve during volume- controlled mechanical ventilation. High pressure ('P high') is set below the high inflection point (HIP) and low pressure is set above the low inflection point (LIP).Corresponding pressure and flow curves during one cycle of inflationdeflation. Notice the flow curve goes back to zero at the end of inflation, indicating full lung inflation; and also goes back to zero during the release period before inflation starts, indicating complete gas exhalation with no intrinsic PEEP. Airway pressure release ventilation was described initially by Stock and Downs in 1987 as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase. APRV begins at a pressure higher than the baseline pressure and follows with a deflation to accomplish tidal ventilation. Fundamentally APRV is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.  Indications  Based on clinical and experimental data, airway pressure release ventilation is indicated in patients with acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and atelectasis after major surgery Inverse ratio ventilation This is a type of inverse ratio ventilation. The exhalation time (Tlow) is shortened to usually less than one second to maintain alveoli inflation. Fundamentally this is a continuous pressure with a brief release. APRV is currently the most efficient, conventional mode for lung protective ventilation. Settings and measurements Pressure-time curve for APRV. 'P high' is the high CPAP, 'P low' is the low CPAP, 'T high' is the duration of 'P high,' and 'T low' is the release period or the duration of 'P low.' Spontaneous breathing appears on the top of 'P high.' Settings are sometimes brand specific and the term for the individual settings may differ, however generally the settings listed here are a fundamental explanation of the purpose of the settings within the APRV mode. *Phigh ‚Äî This is the inspiratory pressure (just like in pressure control). *Thigh ‚Äî This value is the number of seconds during the inhalation phase. *Tpeep ‚Äî Also known as the Tlow, this is the time allotted for expiration. *FiO2 ‚Äî The fractional O2 percentage of the delivered air-and-oxygen mixture.  Mean airway pressure  Mean airway pressure on APRV is calculated by this formula: :::\\\\frac{(P_{high} * T_{high})\\\\, + (P_{low} * T_{low})} {T_{high} + T_{low}} Perceptions and receptions Different perceptions of this mode may exist around the globe. While 'APRV' is common to users in North America, a very similar mode, biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP), was introduced in Europe. The term APRV has also been used in American journals where, from the ventilation characteristics, BIPAP would have been the appropriate terminology. To further confusion, BiPAP is a registered trade-mark for a noninvasive ventilation mode in a specific ventilator (Respironics Inc.). Other names (BILEVEL, DUOPAP, BIVENT) have been created for legal reasons. Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported. Concern has been raised about the amount of mechanical power applied to the lung during APRV and the risk of ergotrauma, especially in pulmonary ARDS.  Other terms  APRV is used by many brands and models of mechanical ventilators under different names. Most names are copyrighted as trademarks and do not represent nomenclature of mechanical ventilation but may be referred to clinically by the brand name. Some of these names include: * BiVent - (Servo-i ventilator by Maquet) * BiLevel - (Puritan Bennett 840 ventilator by Covidien) * DuoPAP - ( C-1 ventilator by Hamilton) References Category:Mechanical ventilation Category:Pulmonology ","title":"Airway pressure release ventilation"},{"id":"25002923","text":"303rd Intelligence Squadron (303 IS) is an intelligence unit of the United States Air Force located at Osan AB, South Korea.

Today, it is a hilly grass mound located near the Bibi Khanaum Mosque. Excavations uncovered the now famous frescoes. Afrasiab Museum of Samarkand is located next to the archaeological site. Overview Afrasiyab is the oldest part and the ruined site of the ancient and medieval city of Samarkand. It was located on high ground for defensive reasons, south of a river valley and north of a large fertile area which has now become part of the city of Samarkand. The habitation of the territories of Afrasiyab began in the 7th-6th century BC, as the centre of the Sogdian culture.Darmesteter J., \\"Hang-e Afrasiab\\", √âtudes Iraniennes (1883): 225-27. The term Qal‚Äôa-ye Afrasiab (Castle of Afrasiab) appeared in written sources only towards the end of the 17th century. The name is popularly connected with the mythical King Afrasiab. Scholars consider Afrasiab to be a distortion and a corrupted form of the Tajik word Parsƒ´ƒÅb (from Sogdian Par≈°vƒÅb), meaning \\"beyond the black river\\", the river being Sƒ´ƒÅhƒÅb or Sƒ´ƒÅb, which bounds the site to the north.Yarshater, E., \\"Afrasiab\\", Encyclop√¶dia Iranica - digital library; accessed January 18, 2007. AfrƒÅ is the poetic form of the Persian word FarƒÅ (itself a poetic word), which means 'beyond, further', while Sƒ´ƒÅb comes from sƒ´ƒÅh meaning 'black' and ƒÄb meaning 'water; river; sea' (depending on the context). First archaeological excavations were carried out in Afrasiyab in the late 19th century, by Nikolay Veselovsky. In the 1920s, it was extensively excavated by the archaeologist Mikhail Evgenievich Masson who placed artifacts found at the site in the Samarkand museum. His archaeological study revealed that a Samanid palace had once been located at Afrasiyab. It was again actively excavated during the 1960-70s.  The town  The area of Afrasiyab covers about 220 hectares, and the thickness of the archaeological strata reaches 8‚Äì12 metres. The town Afrasiyab had the form of an isosceles triangle, the base angle of which was looking to the south. Afrasiyab originated on the natural hill, that was intersected by numerous hollows, and the town itself was surrounded by high walls, which now look like a massive clay-built erection 40 meters high inside. The most long part of the town was 1.5 kilometers in width. The entrance to the town located in the middle part of the eastern wall. There were towers in Afrasiyab, the maximum length of which was 3,34 kilometers, and the remains of which was found on some places of the surrounding wall.archaeological investigations in Central Asia 192=17-1937 by Henry Field and Eugene Prostov Water to the town was generated in the water channels, earthenware pipes, and wells. So, it means that a lot of place was occupied by reservoirs, the biggest of which had a capacity of about a million gallons of water and was located near the southern wall. No remains of traced streets were found, as the buildings around collapsed and ruined so narrow and crooked traces. Unbaked bricks on wooden framework, with clay molding were used to build the houses. Some of them had windows with gypsum lattices set with small pieces of glass. There were found a lot of coins. On the base of them different dates of occupation of Afrasiyab was determined, which was mostly done by Viatkin. The found coins belonged to the Sasanids, some to the Bukhar-Khudats, and some to the Umaiyad and the Abbasid caliphs. In a large quantities the Samanid coins were found, the less common were coins of the Khwarazm Shahs, and the least frequent coins were Karakhanid's and Seljuk's ones. The coins of Mongke was the latest found coins. All of these found and researched coins show that Afrasiyab was inhabited from the fourth or fifth to the thirteenth century.  Ruined buildings  Crenellated wall portion of the ruins of Afrasiyab, Samarkand. Hephthalite ambassadors, 7th century. Afrasiyab. In Afrasiyab were found five bathhouses, that were related to the 9th and 10th centuries. A bathhouse of Afrasiyab consisted of cisterns, baths, pipes supplying heat and water, dressing-rooms, massage chambers, warm and cold halls and open courtyards. Carved stucco and frescoes decorated some parts of a bathhouse. In 1924 in Afrasiyab Viatkin made his research, at the place where a Buddhist fresco and a richly molded alabaster panel were found on the wall of an ancient room. There were found a clay-built, brick-covered, cupolaed edifice with well-preserved walls. Also there were found a lot of articles on the walls. On one of them On the wall of a small building nearby an Arabic inscription was found: \\"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, say: 'He is the God alone, God the eternal.\\" The discoveries were dated by ninth- and tenth-century coins. In I929, the remains of a house, which was related to the twelfth century, and a large shallow pit containing burnt wheat were found. They were found between the valley near the Siab irrigation canal and the ruins of the mosque. The ruins of dwellings were found on the three levels, and the lowest of them refers to the first centuries of our era, while the latest belongs the Samanid period, which also can be proved by coins that were found and related to the Samanids of the tenth century. One of the wealthy medieval dwellings of Afrasiyab is the remains of a house that is referred to the tenth century. This house had a domed hall luxuriously panelled with carved gypsum stucco, which covered both inside and outside parts of the walls. In a present time this ornamentation presents an example of medieval art. During the 1930s excavations by Viatkins there was found at the ruins of a palace complex with traces of splendid frescoes related to the Karakhanid period (from eleventh to twelfth centuries A.D.), which was located in the shahristan area. But the palace was destroyed during uprising against the Khworezmi power in 1212, and was later rebuilt. To the west of Afrasiyab there were excavated a principal mosque and a minaret. The minaret was faced with bricks stamped with the Persian word Ikhshid, the title of the ancient Samarkand rulers. And the mosque was reconstructed several times as it was found. During Samanid era in the 10th century the mosque had a square form, sides of which were 78 by 78 meters. But during Karakhanid era in the eleventh-twelfth centuries it had a rectangular shape, expanding to 120 by 80 meters. In it there were found six doorways, the chains from the chandeliers which illuminated the columned hall and it was decorated with carved stucco, carved terracotta slabs and light-blue tiles.

The most used pottery in Afrasiyab was glazed pottery, which included the most common forms like plates and dishes, pitchers. But there were also found different types of pottery. The biggest part was the unglazed pottery, which was wheel-made, well fired, and simply ornamented in harmony with its purpose, which shows the master's skills. It included large vessels, several kinds of pitchers, jugs, saucers, and bowls. The less perfect and inferior pottery was also found, which is the second type. The surfaces of the handmade pitchers and pots were carefully polished and covered with markings in the form of parallel lines, diamonds, crisscrosses, and spirals. According to Vfatkin this pottery relates to the period of the Tripolje culture. There also were found the numerous terra-cotta slabs and miniature altars, which were covered inside and outside with a beautiful stamped floral ornamentation. The altars bore pictures of birds, columns, and the Arabic inscription \\"praise to God\\". Also there was produced glass, that was made into small, exquisitely fashioned flasks, phials, tumblers, mugs, wineglasses, goblets, spoons, jugs, carafes, and bottles. There were found tombstones for which there were used large river flagstones up to a meter in length. Most of them referred to the twelfth, less to the thirteenth, and much less to the fourteenth century. Each tombstone bore an inscription engraved in Arabic and showed the name of the person buried and the year of burial; some of the stones were decorated with arabesques. On one stone there was no inscription, only the engraved profile of a head wearing a castellated crown, as appears on the coins of the Bukhar- Khudats. At the other end of the stone an elephant and a bird were engraved. See also Afrasiab painting for wall paintings discovered in the archeological site.

It was released by the independent record label One Records on October 20, 2009. The album features guest performances by Aloe Blacc, Evidence, Blu, Planet Asia, Mistah Fab, Co$$, Devoya and J. Mitchell. Music videos were made for \\"Life as a Shorty\\", \\"Samsonite Man\\", \\"Our Way\\", \\"Sunny CA\\" and \\"The Ecology/The Score\\". Boy Meets World received critical acclaim from critics who praised the production and Fashawn's storytelling. The album subsequently received attention and recognition from highly respected hip-hop artists. Boy Meets World is now frequently regarded as an underground classic, and garnered much interest in producer Exile, who had previously produced rapper Blu's album Below the Heavens, which also was released to similar acclaim.  Background and development  By 2007, Fashawn had gained attention in the music industry by releasing a series of successful mixtapes. Meanwhile, Exile had joined forces with Blu to release Below the Heavens, an album that would go on to receive wide acclaim. Fashawn gravitated toward Exile's production on Below the Heavens, and both soon came into contact through their respective management teams. In an interview recalling their initial encounter, Exile said: > \\"The first time I ever heard Fashawn rap, my imagination just started going. > I started thinking about the possibilities of his voice, and what [stories > he could] spit over my beats. I could hear that there might be something > special, so I wanted to get him some more beats to see what we could come up > with.\\" The album was recorded at studio sessions in both Fashawn's hometown of Fresno, California and Exile's hometown of Los Angeles, California. Fashawn wrote lyrics for the album up until six months before its release, thus making him between 18 and 19 years old during most of the album's creative process.  Critical reception  Upon its release, Boy Meets World received universal critical acclaim, with many hip hop critics and listeners regarding the album as a hip hop \\"classic\\". Fashawn was acclaimed for his ability to articulate the inner struggles and dreams of a young kid growing up in a tough environment. XXL Magazine gave the album an XL rating, concluding that Boy Meets World \\"is a strong debut from such a young MC, and it resonates a lot more than the work of some rappers decades his senior.\\" HipHopDX described Boy Meets World as \\"one of this year‚Äôs finest albums yet, hoping to supply food for thought for the new school while staying true to the culture‚Äôs roots, balancing the lyrical and street aspects of Hip Hop with one pen.\\". In addition to positive reviews from media outlets, Boys Meets World also garnered the attention of many respected artists in the hip-hop community.

Early life Carpenter was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, where he was a member of Farfield (1958‚Äì1963),Old Greshamian Club Book (Cheverton & Son Ltd., 1999), p. 43 and then at Cambridge. Career Before being appointed as Professor of Oculomotor Physiology in the University of Cambridge, Carpenter was a Director of Studies in Medicine at Caius College. In his principal field, mechanisms of consciousness, his position can be described as a one-way Cartesian. He was the creator of EPIC (the Experimental Physiology Instrumentation Computer) and NeuroLab, a set of interactive demonstrations on the working of the human brain.EPIC at acad.cai.cam.ac.ukNeuroLab page at acad.cai.cam.ac.uk In his spare time, he ran the CUDOS project (Cambridge University Distributed Opportunity Systems), aimed at using medical students' gap year between school and university. He was previously Director of a group called the Susato Consort and Susato Baroque Ensemble.CUDOS home page at cudos.ac.uk In 2000, Carpenter was one of a group of twenty inaugural winners of a National Teaching Award of ¬£50,000 from the Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education.The Saccadic System: A Neurological Microcosm at acnr.co.uk (pdf file) Interests Carpenter focussed on mechanisms of decision in his work. Measurement of saccadic latency, the time taken to choose a visual target and initiate an eye movement, is a reliable method for obtaining reaction time data. This work has inspired a model referred to as LATER (Linear Approach to Threshold with Ergodic Rate) to explain the decision mechanism. Technological advances enabled oculomotor measurements to be made both quickly and non-invasively, using micro-devices which have many clinical applications.Professor Roger Carpenter at neuroscience.cam.ac.uk He also had professional interests in vision in general, motor systems, and physiological mechanisms of consciousness.

The present church structure was built in 1872 to the designs of Sir George Gilbert Scott, who combined neo-Gothic and early-English styles. This edifice remains noted for having the tallest spire in London and is the latest in a series on the site since the beginning of the 12th century. The church, and its railings, are listed at Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England. History Foundation Sir Aubrey de Vere was a Norman knight who was rewarded with the manor of Kensington, among other estates, after the successful Norman Conquest. Around 1100, his eldest son, Godfrey (great-uncle of Aubrey, 1st Earl of Oxford),British History Online: Kensington british-history.ac.uk, Accessed 29 July 2019 was taken seriously ill and cared for by Faritius, abbot of the Benedictine Abbey of St Mary at Abingdon. After a period of remission, Godfrey de Vere died in 1106 aged about 19. The de Vere family's gratitude to the abbey for their son's care was recognised by its bequest of land . In 1262 the abbey founded a church and parish in Kensington, dedicated to St Mary. The epithet of Abbots is deemed to derive from its link with the ancient Abingdon Abbey rather than that subsequently with the diocese of the Bishop of London. However, this led to a dispute with the bishop and legal action followed in the diocesan consistory court. This resulted in the patronage of the church passing to the bishop in perpetuity but rights over the surrounding land remaining with the abbey. The succession of vicars is recorded in a direct line back to this foundation in 1262. Rebuilds Old St Mary Abbots Church, in 1869, shortly before its demolition In 1370 the Norman church was rebuilt. When William III relocated the Royal Court to Kensington Palace the area became fashionable rendering the medieval church too small, thus it was demolished at the end of the 17th century and replaced by a Late Renaissance- style building. This in turn proved too small as London urbanised in the 19th century. Around 1860 the vicar, Archdeacon William Sinclair, launched a campaign for the building of a striking new church. The architect George Gilbert Scott was engaged and recommended the demolition of the existing church to take advantage of the site at the road junction. St Mary Abbot's design is almost certainly influenced by Scott's earlier work on Dunblane Cathedral - its west front's tall window and carved tympanum are similar to those in the Cathedral. The high spire is clearly influenced by that of St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. The present church retains many fittings from the earlier churches, especially funeral monuments from the mid-17th century onwards. In June 2015, the church launched a major fundraising appeal, looking to raise around ¬£7.2m,http://stmaryabbotsappeal.com/ to be spent on restoring the church and improving it as a community hub. Bells The tower holds a ring of ten bells hung for change ringing. Five of these bells, the fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth of the current ring date from 1772 and were cast by Thomas Janaway. The other five, the treble, second, third, seventh and tenor were cast in 1879 by John Warner & Sons. Primary school The church has an associated primary school in its churchyard, which was founded in 1707 as a charity school.British History Online: The village centres around St. Mary Abbots church and Notting Hill Gate british-history.ac.uk, Accessed 29 July 2019 The school buildings were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor in 1711, but demolished in the 1870s to make way for a town hall.

He was a renowned musher in the 1920s and 30's, with much of his fame derived from racing Leonard Seppala and his victory in the demonstration race at the 1932 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York. In 1956 he became the only dogsled racer to be entered into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. Racing career Following his family's move from Fisher Branch to The Pas in 1916, St. Godard's brother began training a dog team however the family felt he was too young to race. In 1924 he won his first race, around the streets of his home town. St. Godard's first major win was The Pas Dog Derby in 1925, which was one of the world's premier dogsled races during this period. He would continue to win this race five times in a row until 1929. He would lose the 1930 race to Earl Brydges by twelve and a half minutes after coming in with three tired dogs on his sled. Following his victory in the dog derby at Ottawa's first Winter Carnival in February 1930, he was presented with a gold challenge cup and a cheque for one thousand dollars by the Mayor Frank H. Plant at a lavish reception in the Ch√¢teau Laurier. He dominated the field for so long that fans often referred to the races at the time as \\"St. Godard against the field\\". He received a citation from the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies for his kindness and concern for his dogs. His lead dog, Toby, was a husky-greyhound cross and was such an integral part of St. Goddard's crew that when Toby could no longer race, St. Goddard retired also. Posthumously in 1956 he was inducted posthumously into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, and in 2007 into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame. He remains the only dog sled racer to be recognised by either the national or provincial awards. Rivalry with Leonard Seppala Seppala and St. Godard faced each other annually at the Eastern International Dog Derby in Quebec. Over six years, St. Godard would win the race four times, and Seppala twice. The duo also faced off in a variety of different races over the years, during which St. Godard won the majority of the races. Olympic games Dogsledding was included as an exhibition sport for the only time at the 1932 Winter Olympics. There were twelve competitors from both the United States and Canada. St. Godard and Seppala would place first and second overall, with St. Godard taking the victory after winning both of the 50 mile races involved. Following his rivals victory, Seppala acknowledged his rival's superiority and didn't compete with him afterwards.

A scion of an important dynasty of printmakers active in Antwerp, he created many prints after the works of leading painters and was a close collaborator of Anthony van Dyck for whom he engraved many portraits.Christine van Mulders. \\"Jode, de.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 24 October 2016 Life Pieter de Jode II was born in Antwerp in 1606, where he was baptized on 24 November of that year.Pieter de Jode II at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco He learned drawing and engraving from his father, Pieter de Jode I (1570‚Äì1634), a leading printmaker in Antwerp who had travelled to Italy and whose engravings were a source for the Flemish painter and artist biographer Karel van Mander.* Text from Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck, p.195: Noch eenen Ventura Salimbeni van Siena isser te Siena, die seer aerdighe dingen ghehetst laet van zijn handt en vindinghen uytgaen, van datum 1590. en 94. Een ander Sienees noch te Siena, laet van hem uytgaen een historie van S. Catherina van Siena, seer versierlijck geinventeert, en gesneden door Pieter de Iode van Antwerpen. His grandfather was the famous cartographer and printmaker Gerard de Jode. He was admitted as a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in the Guild year 1628‚Äì1629. He travelled to Paris with his father in 1631‚Äì1632 to work on some print projects mainly of portraits. On his return in 1635 de Jode married Elizabeth Loemans, the daughter of the Antwerp engraver Aernout Loemans. Their son Arnold (1638‚Äì1667) was baptized on 10 March 1638. He would later visit England where his son Arnold who had studied with him was working as a printmaker. Mattheus Borrekens was also a pupil of Pieter de Jode II in 1634‚Äì35. When his first wife died in 1642, the inventory made showed they were relatively prosperous. De Jode remarried in 1648 to Clara van den Enden, the sister or daughter of the publisher Martinus van den Enden. His second wife died around 1653. It is not clear when and where he died. Possibly he died in England in or after 1674, the date of his last known print.Pieter de Jode II at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Work Landscape with the Holy Family after Simon Vouet It has been difficult to distinguish the works of Pieter de Jode the elder and Pieter the younger, since the latter likely only signed his prints with junior before his father's death in 1634. His earliest prints reflect the dry style and technique of his father but he later developed a looser, more painterly style. He and his father were among the engravers selected by Anthony van Dyck for his Iconography, a series that was published over several decades and was a compendium of portraits of famous people. After the death of van Dyck, he continued to work on the Iconography series, in collaboration with other engravers employed by the publisher Gillis Hendricx in Antwerp. He would also worked on portrait series for other publishers as well as have an extensive practice as a reproductive artist.

The village has got a population of approximately 1000 citizens and is located on the former B 188 (now K 112). It is about 2 kilometres west of the centre of Burgdorf and 3 kilometres east of Beinhorn.  Geography  From now on, Hee√üel is located on the former K 112, since the circuitous route of Burgdorf (new B 188) has been finished in October 2009. The stretch of the road that transits Hee√üel is part of the Nieders√§chsische Spargelstra√üe (\\"Lower Saxon Asparagus Road\\"), that also crosses Burgdorf. The village is located approximately 1 kilometre along the road, that is called Dorfstra√üe and merges eastward into the Marktstra√üe of Burgdorf, and between 200 and 500 metres broad. It is surrounded by a lot of fields. In the east there is the town of Burgdorf and in the south there are some forested areas.  Subdivision  The village of Hee√üel can be subdivided into three commensurate sections, that are all connected by the Dorfstra√üe: * The westward located Kleinhee√üel (\\"Little Hee√üel\\") is located a few hundred metres away from the remaining part of Hee√üel. It involves the sports ground of the Hee√üeler SV, a cemetery and a few residential houses. In the centre there is the bus stop \\"Hee√üel/Kolshorner Weg\\". * The largest part of the village (Westhee√üel/\\"West Hee√üel\\") involves apart from some residential houses also some farms. In the village centre is a turn-off from the Dorfstra√üe to the Burgweg, which leads to the area of the former Burg Hee√üel (\\"Castle of Hee√üel\\"). At the turn-off there are also a restaurant and the bus stop \\"Hee√üel/Mitte\\" (\\"Hee√üel/Centre\\"). * In Osthee√üel (\\"East Hee√üel\\"), the part which borders on the west part of Burgdorf, is the building of the volunteer fire brigade of Hee√üel. More eastward are 150 metres away from each other two gas stations. Here are also located some residential houses and farms. The administrative area of Hee√üel also concludes big farms, that got many times over the size of the village itself.  History  Wall of the Burg Hee√üel, wooded now According to Thietmar von Merseburg, in 983 the greats of the Saxons met with Heinrich dem Z√§nker at the Burg Hee√üel after they have had a fight. Once again in 990 here met important personalities of the Saxons to determine the borders of the Bishoprics Minden (Enger) and Hildesheim (Eastphalia). As of today the first documented mention of the village is 1360 in the L√ºneburger Lehnsregister of the dukes Otto II. of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and Wilhelm of L√ºneburg. Around the year 1800 Hee√üel contained about 150 inhabitants. The village's population soared after the end of World War II in 1945, when the number of inhabitants doubled by the immigration of displaced persons. 1974 Hee√üel was integrated in the town of Burgdorf and lost its sovereignty this way .The history of Hee√üel on the website of Burgdorf (german) (www.burgdorf.de )  Politics  Municipal administrator of Hee√üel is Hans-J√ºrgen Staringer. Political eliminations are generally conducted in the fire station in the village's centre.  Transport connection  Hee√üel is connected to Burgdorf in the east and the Bundesautobahn 37 in the west via the old Bundesstra√üe 188 (now K 112). Through the village there run two bus lines from the station of Burgdorf to Schillerslage respectively Altwarmb√ºchen, where is a connection with the line 3 of the Hanover Stadtbahn.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Hee√üel shows a golden lion in front of a silver battlement on a green background. In front of it there are three green conifers.

Background  The recession that greatly affected the American economy starting in late 2008 caused a budget shortfall in Oregon that the state legislature had to make up for. A critical factor in this process was that the 2008 general election gave Democrats a three-fifths majority in both chambers of the legislature, which is the supermajority needed to pass any bills calling for revenue increases. Among other actions, the legislature passed House Bills 2649 and 3405, raising taxes on corporations and on wealthy individuals and households, respectively.

This collection was originally published in 1977 by Random House. Bambara writes about strong female girls in this particular collection because \\"in her vision, in her politics, little girls matter\\".Holmes, Janet Linda and Cheryl A. Wall (2007).\\"Savoring the Salt: The Legacy of Toni Cade Bambara,‚Äù Philadelphia: Temple University Press. The story centers on a young, African American girl named Rae Ann who is experiencing menstruation for the first time. Plot summary In \\"A Girl's Story\\", Rae Ann, the main character, thinks she is bleeding to death. She does not know that it is the start of her menstrual cycle, something no one had told her about. She lives with her brother Horace and her grandmother, M'Dear. In this environment, they do not speak of such things. Rae Ann is terrified of the blood that keeps coming out of her and uses towels, tissues, and other methods to try to stop it. At the beginning she is hoisting her hips up toward a wall, thinking it would go back in. She becomes so frightened that she thinks of going to the Center, where Dada Bibi is, and asking her for help. She becomes too afraid to, thinking she would only bleed to death on the way. Rae Ann starts to think of her situation as a punishment and of her dead mother who bled to death. When Horace came home and wanted to use the bathroom, he yells at her to come out. After she refuses him, he calls on M'Dear who then jumps to the conclusion that Rae Ann had attempted an abortion like her Mother. Rae Ann is confused, not knowing what an abortion is, let alone to tell her grandmother otherwise. When M'Dear finally sees her and understands that it was only her period, she sits her down on newspaper in her room, leaving her with a package. The story ends with this scene and Rae Ann thinks she has done something horrible. M'Dear does not explain anything to her, just leaves a package of products and instructions for Rae Ann to figure out on her own. Characters *Rae Ann - main character, young, African American girl *Horace - Rae Ann's brother *M'Dear - Rae Ann's grandmother *Dada Bibi - works at the Center, African woman, Rae Ann's sister Themes :*African American Culture & Socio-Economic Status: :: African American girls are known to hit puberty and menstruation a lot earlier than other races in American and thus are more likely to have some sort of maladjustment. Similarly Socio-Economic status also affects this adjustment, ‚Äú‚Ä¶with the knowledge that poverty affects many aspects of adolescent development, it is not unreasonable to expect a link between socioeconomic status and a girl‚Äôs emotional and psychological reactions to her first period,‚Äù White, L.(2008). ‚ÄúNewly postmenarcheal adolescents‚Äô understanding of menarche and menstruation across race and income level as defined by qualification status for free or reduced lunches,‚Äù Diss. University of Pittsburgh: Dissertations & Theses: Full Text, ProQuest. With this connection of poverty to a girl‚Äôs reaction and her race, Rae Ann had many factors against her understanding and acceptance of her womanhood. :*Female Shame & Worth: ::Rae Ann comes to a moment in her life, unknown to her, that transitions her body from a girl to a woman. She instinctively knew that this change, the nonstop bleeding, was some sort of punishment, to be hidden and disguised. She associated \\"becoming a woman\\" with the nagging, one way conversations of M'Dear that cautioned her from engaging with boys who would take advantage of her. The reaction M'Dear gives her when she finds out is dismissive and cold; she gives Rae Ann a package and leaves her without a word. These examples give basis for Rae Ann's shame of her own body and reinforces her to keep quiet about her transformation. This reflects the reactions that are experienced by women and girls who do not have access to information about their bodies. A study of 120 African American women found that two-thirds of them were not prepared or knowledgeable about menstruation, this is twice the percentage compared to a similar study of white females. The study also showed that those who experience menstruation for the first time have \\"overall feelings of shame, embarrassment, surprise, offensiveness, fear, anxiety, sadness, and even naughtiness...\\"Cooper, Spring Chenoa, and Patricia Barthalow Koch (2007).\\"Nobody told me nothin'\\":Communication about menstruation among low-income African-American women,\\"Women & Health 46.1: 57-78. PsycINFO. EBSCO. :*Strong \\"Girl\\" image: ::Toni Cade Bambara references the power of young girls in reversing the oppressions that the African American and International communities face. She puts the most vulnerable and disenfranchised at the center of her stories where they take active roles, rather than the typical passivity that is expected of them. Rae Ann is active in her search for answers to life questions, particularly from Dada Bibi's stories and advice. She thinks and acts through her situation, rather than becoming paralyzed by fear. Symbols :*Dada Bibi's Story: ::Dada Bibi would tell stories to the girls at The Center, about the African Queens. Rae Ann loved the story about one woman who continued to refuse a man's proposal of marriage, saying she had to become a soldier instead. Her country was not at peace and there was a lot of suffering with the Europeans there, so the man bought her armor. The African Queen only accepted the man once the war was over and there was peace and prosperity in their land. Rae Ann thought of current times where women were treated by men; men would yell for their women and if they did not come, they left them. The story tells of a strong woman with free-will and power, where in current times, Rae Ann sees women as weak and inferior to men. The Story symbolizes Rae Ann's own transformation into a strong, powerful woman through the onset of her first menstruation. :*Blood: ::Blood in the story is a direct representation of the inevitability of Rae Ann's transformation into a woman and adult. No matter what she does, she cannot get rid of it, or determine its origin. Blood does not easily wash out or disappear; Rae Ann hides her ruined clothing and does not what to do with the blood-stained towels of M'Dear's. She knows that blood means death, illness, and more personally, her mother's death. Her mother dies from a harmful, illegal abortion, to which she literally bleeds to death. :*Abortion: Rae Ann‚Äôs condition is mistaken for an abortion by her grandmother, who saw her mother die from one. This symbolizes the disconnection between Rae Ann and her grandmother, in that both do not communicate honestly with each other. Neither explains their situation, or helps each other to understand their dilemmas. This represents the shame involved with sex and illness, and one's reproductive organs. This shame connects Rae Ann's ideas of menstruation and death together, causing an even worse attitude towards life and sex as she gets older. Illness narrative :*View of Death and Illness: A Girl‚Äôs Story as healing narrative: ::The narration of the story centers on one young girl‚Äôs experience with what she conceived as a near-death experience. Rae Ann \\"equates menstruation with illness and death, associating it with foul smells and dark bloodstains\\".Butler-Evans, Elliott (1989).\\"Race, Gender, and Desire: Narrative Strategies in the Fiction of Toni Cade Bambara, Toni Morrison, and Alice Walker,\\" Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Rae Ann deals with her situation by fighting the blood that keeps coming out of her. She does not accept her situation and refuses to be defeated by death. She thinks of the people Dada Bibi references from Africa and other countries that sacrifice themselves for their countries' upheavals. Rae Ann does not want to die, even for a good cause. She sees herself as selfless, but she sees more power in continuing to live and make changes in the world. The bleeding becomes healing for her in that she becomes aware of her potential as a person and as a woman. :*Body Disconnection: ::‚ÄúFor many girl participants, menarche had no special meaning beyond bleeding or passing blood from the vagina,‚ÄùHawthorne, Dorothy Jean (1999). \\"Living through private times: African American females at Menarche,\\" Diss. University of Florida. Dissertations & Theses: Full Text, ProQuest. this illustrates the disconnection between one‚Äôs body functions that are a representation of life, with just blood ‚Äì no other function. While Rae Ann had no conception whatsoever with reproduction in correlation with her bleeding, other girls just choose to observe this bleeding as only being about annoyance and inconvenience. While Rae Ann's experience was that of illness, death, and terror. :* Betrayal, Terror, Loss, Loneliness ::Rae Ann sees her bleeding as a death or illness, connecting it with the loss of her mother. She goes through the four stages of illness that Michael Stein analyzes in his book, The Lonely Patient: How We Experience Illness - Betrayal, terror, loss, and loneliness.Stein, Michael (2007). ‚ÄúThe Lonely Patient: How We Experience Illness, ‚ÄúNew York: Harpers Collins Publishers. This betrayal of her body is foremost in her mind, for she keeps trying to make herself normal by stopping herself up with tissue and towels. She is trying to recreate the condition she was in before; she is mad at her body that makes her feel scared and confused. As for terror, she starts to panic that she may be dying like her mother had, since she seems to be losing a lot of blood. She thinks of telling her brother, so he can take her to the Center where Dada Bibi is, but becomes terrified that she would die before she gets there. Literally and figuratively, she feels the loss of her mother; she feels the loss of herself and all that she could have achieved if only she could live longer. Finally, at the end of the story, she feels alone because of M‚ÄôDear‚Äôs answers none of her confusion or terror. She is literally put in her room alone, creating a last image of her on her bed with newspapers beneath her. She finds herself more alone in the world than she ever was before. :*Women & Illness: ::\\"The power of medical discourses has also been emphasized, in that the menstrual cycle is depicted as medical and even pathological; it leads to discomfort, illness and emotional instability,\\"Burrows, Anne, and Sally Johnson (2005).\\"Girls' experiences of menarche and menstruation: Implications for disconnection within girls and between women,\\"Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology 23.3, 235-249. PsycINFO. EBSCO. This idea that menstruation is a pathological act and is considered an illness demonstrates the shame associated with a young girls‚Äô experience with it. When one is bleeding, like Rae Ann, without reason, an automatic assumption of illness is logical and makes the person feel even more ashamed.

He is the brother of professional poker players Humberto Brenes and Alex Brenes. Brenes began playing poker with family and friends in Costa Rica, especially learning a lot about the game from his brothers. He often traveled to the United States to watch Humberto and Alex play in tournaments, but rarely played in them himself. At this time Brenes was mostly focused on the family businesses and his farm in Costa Rica. In the late 1990s, Eric began to play in tournaments, after being encouraged to play in them by his brothers. He won some tournaments in Costa Rica and the United States including the Linda Johnson No Limit Holdem Challenge in 2001. He also began playing in the World Poker Tour, where both his brothers have made final tables and Alex has won a title. Brenes won his World Poker Tour title in 2004 during the third season of the WPT at the Ultimate Poker Classic in Aruba. He defeated a final table that included top professional poker players Mike Matusow, John Juanda, and Layne Flack whom he defeated in heads-up play to win the title and the $1,000,000 cash prize. This win propelled him up to 3rd place on the all time Costa Rican poker players tournament cash list, behind only his brothers Humberto (1st) and Alex (2nd). In recent years, Eric does not travel much to play poker, preferring to manage his businesses and farm in Costa Rica and plays an occasional tournament. But by winning a WPT title, he has proven to his brothers and everyone else in the poker world that he is also a player to be taken seriously at the poker table, just like his more well-known brothers.

Formed in mid-1940 from personnel recruited from Tasmania, the battalion was assigned to the 23rd Brigade, which formed part of the 8th Division. After completing basic training, the 2/40th was sent to Darwin to form part of the defensive garrison there as tensions with the Japanese grew throughout 1941. Following Japan's entry into the war, the battalion was deployed to Timor as part of Sparrow Force and in early 1942 they took part in the fighting on the island against the Japanese. Outnumbered and lacking supplies, the majority of the 2/40th's personnel were captured and spent the rest of the war as prisoners of war, although some were able to wage a guerrilla campaign across the island before being withdrawn by the end of year. History Formation and garrison duty in Australia Raised for service during the Second World War as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), the 2/40th Battalion formed part of the 23rd Brigade attached to the 8th Division; the majority of its personnel were drawn from the state of Tasmania. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 40th Battalion, a unit which had served during the First World War before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were white over red, in an oval shape, although a border of gray was added to the border of the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; the oval shape designated the battalion as being part of the 8th Division.Long 1952, pp. 321-323. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons.Long 1952, p. 52. The battalion's first commanding officer was a Tasmanian, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Youl, a Militia officer who had previously commanded the 12th/50th Battalion and who, according to author Garth Pratten, was appointed largely as a result of political pressure from the Tasmania government.Pratten 2009, pp. 133 & 315. In July 1940, the 2/40th began training at Brighton, Tasmania, before moving to Bonegilla, Victoria, to join the rest of the 23rd Brigade in January 1941.Henning 1995, p. 19. While the 8th Division's other two brigades‚Äîthe 22nd and 27th‚Äîwould both subsequently be sent to Malaya, the 23rd was held back in Australia as the government decided to use it to defend the islands to Australia's north‚ÄîTimor, Ambon and Rabaul‚Äîin the event of Japan's entry into the war; as part of this plan, the 2/40th was allocated to the defence of Timor.Morgan 2013, pp. 4‚Äì6. In late March, the 2/40th moved north to the Katherine region, in the Northern Territory, with the last elements of the battalion arriving on 25 April 1941.Henning 1995, p. 25. There they undertook further training as the battalion received further drafts of men, before moving to Darwin over the course of a month between June and July.Henning 1995, p. 33. In Darwin they undertook defensive duties as part of the town's military garrison, with companies detached to defend various locations around Noonamah and Adelaide River.Henning 1995, p. 34. Fighting in Timor and fate Throughout October 1941 plans were put in place for the battalion's deployment to Timor, with a reconnaissance party being dispatched to the island between 6‚Äì12 October.Henning 1995, p. 35. Upon return, the battalion's commanding officer, Youl, was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel William Leggatt in \\"controversial circumstances\\" on 5 November 1941.Henning 1995, p. 37.Browne 2000, pp. 77‚Äì79. The following month, shortly after the Japanese entered the war in the Pacific, the 2/40th Battalion embarked upon the transports Zealandia and Westralia on 8 December, and were deployed to Timor.Henning 1995, pp. 38‚Äì39. Arriving there on 12 December 1941,Wigmore 1957, p. 467. they formed part of Sparrow Force which was tasked with defending the island against invasion by the Japanese. After Japanese air strikes began in January 1942, the invasion came the following month on 20 February 1942, with Japanese soldiers carrying out airborne and amphibious landings around the island. Outnumbered and with limited supplies, after the initial contact the battalion destroyed the airfield and moved inland, reducing a number of Japanese positions as they went, including an attack upon ridge where the Japanese 228th Infantry Regiment suffered at least 123 casualties on 22 February.Henning 1995, p. 104. By the morning of 23 February the situation was desperate and the battalion all but surrounded around Champlong. Lacking air cover and faced with an ultimatum to capitulate or be subjected to an intense aerial bombardment that would likely have wiped out the battalion, Leggatt was forced to surrender his command and as a result most of the 2/40th was captured. Some managed to escape, however, while others who had been detached elsewhere evaded capture and took part in the guerrilla campaign that followed before being evacuated back to Australia in December 1942. These personnel were dispersed to other units, with some being transferred eventually to the 2/12th Battalion,Graeme-Evans 1991, p. 391. and the 2/40th Battalion was never reformed.Wigmore 1957, p. 490. The men who were taken as prisoners spent the rest of the war in captivity in camps throughout Southeast Asia including Java, Burma, Thailand, Japan, Singapore and Sumatra and did not return to Australia until September 1945. The battalion had 271 men killed in action or died while prisoners of war, while a further 79 were wounded. For their involvement in the fighting on Timor members of the battalion received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, one Military Medal and seven Mentions in Despatches. Battle honours The battalion was awarded two battle honours for its service: \\"South-West Pacific 1942\\" and \\"Koepang\\". Koepang is unique to the 2/40th, with no other unit in the Australian Army holding this battle honour.Maitland 1999, p. 141. In 1961‚Äì62, these honours were entrusted to the Royal Tasmania Regiment, and they are maintained by the 12th/40th Battalion, Royal Tasmania Regiment.Festberg 1972, pp. 33 & 98.

Robbie Flynn Robert \\"Robbie\\" Flynn was a cheeky student who was also stubborn, hot- headed and set in his ways. Robbie preferred to have his own space and found the prospect of sharing a room in his halls of residence distinctly unappetising after a mistake by the admin, had him sharing a room with Joe Spencer. The two battled with each other hoping to get the other one to move out, this lasted a while as the two kept on winding each other up and getting back at one another, but they eventually decided to give up the war and become friends. Robbie found some love interest after he managed to sleep with Student President Chloe Bruce. According to Joe, Robbie moved to Ibiza to become a Holiday rep. Chris O'Brien Chris O'Brien is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Neil Hardy. He first appeared in the village when he was sent there by his parents to attend Hollyoaks community college. He was meant to live with his cousin Sam \\"O.B.\\" O'Brien but often spent his time sleeping rough or staying up all night partying. Chris only attended college for a few weeks, although enrolled full- time under the strict instructions of his parents, he decided he wouldn't return after causing a small fire in the art department. He continued to lie to his parents though by telling them his studies were going well, and he was settling in well to full-time education. With no money he took a part-time job at a local builder's merchant, but quit after only 4 hours. Instead, he found stealing easier but was caught shoplifting bread at the Drive ‚Äòn‚Äô Buy which resulted in a night in the police cells. This arrest caused his parent to be informed, and after learning he had quit college months ago, they travelled to Chester to take him home where they could keep an eye on him. Chris returned to the village for a short time in January 2007. Dale Jackson Dale Jackson is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, played by Laila Rouass. She appeared throughout 2003. Upon Rouass's casting the Liverpool Echo said \\"if tv bosses are looking for a replacement for Cilla - Hollyoaks newest recruit may be the answer\\" and described her as a \\"new soap siren\\". She was also described as \\"feisty\\" and her entrances was said to \\"ruffle a few feathers\\". Dale has also been described as having a \\"no-nonsense attitude\\". Rouass commented on the casting saying \\"Dale is a real go-getter, very independent and career-minded she doesn't take any nonsense. I've really settled into the \`family' now. It's certainly been a change from my past experience, but Dale is a really strong character and the role has certainly given me something to get my teeth into\\". Rouass started filming in December 2002. The character has also been described as \\"mysterious\\". Rouass beat seventy other auditionees for the part which she said \\"was unbelievable\\" and added that she didn't \\"know how I got it\\". Rouass also added that she was \\"loving every minute of it\\". Dale Jackson arrives in Hollyoaks village to investigate series of murders. Colleague Will Davies allows Dale to move in with him and his son, Ben and daughter Abby. Abby begins to see Dale as a mother figure but Ben is dubious about him living together. She sleeps with Ben and is caught by Will. Ben tries to apologise; however, Will insists that it really never bothered him and makes it clear to Ben that he is free to do anything he wanted. Dale tells Will she has feelings for him and the pair begin to date, despite Ben's warnings. Ben was furious at his father's actions and accuses Dale of using him, leading Will to throw Ben out of his own house. Eventually, Will and Ben make up, but Dale leaves after being sacked by the commissioner. The Daily Mirror commented positively on Rouass's performance saying it was \\"sizzling\\" and had \\"set the screen alight\\". The Liverpool Echo commented positively on her \\"will they, won't they\\" storyline with Will labelling it a \\"far more pressing puzzle to be solved\\" than the serial killer storyline. Liz Burton Elizabeth Burton (also Taylor) is played by Andr√©e Bernard and first appeared on 10 October 2003. She single mother of three teenagers Mel, Sophie, and Justin, Liz spent most of her life trying to maintain the peace between her offspring, after their father committed suicide. She had a difficult relationship with her stepdaughter Darlene, made worse when Darlene found out that her brother Ali had (accidentally) stabbed school bully Stephen \\"Macki\\" Mackintosh to death, but told the police that she suspected Liz's son Justin of being the killer. Darlene changed her testimony in court, which contributed towards Justin being acquitted of killing Macki and Liz was grateful to Darlene for this. After Justin returned home, Liz chucked Richard out for having an affair with a colleague but said Darlene could stay with them. Liz had decided that her family should move away from Hollyoaks to Colchester, to start afresh. However, all of her children were unwilling to move with her and she left Hollyoaks, without Mel, Sophie and Justin.

Most notably, TeX4ht serves for converting (La)TeX documents to formats used by word processors. It was developed by Eitan M. Gurari. (*1947, ‚Ä†2009) The program is published under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).  History  TeX4ht was developed in the 1990s to convert (La)TeX to HTML, helping to publish scientific documents that were written in (La)TeX on the world wide web for display in a web browser. Particularly, hypertext features were supported, so it became possible to include hyperlinks in the web version of documents. More XML-based formats were supported gradually. As of 2019, HTML5, XHTML, MathML, OpenDocument, DocBook, and TEI are supported. JavaHelp can also be generated. TeX4ht is now included preconfigured with all TeX distributions. Since Eitan M. Gurari's death the program has been maintained by Radhakrishnan CV (no longer active), Karl Berry, and Michal Hoftich, with contributions from many others. Karl Berry, posting in mailing list texhax, 17 July 2009; ibid. posting in der mailinglist texhax, 7 November 2009.  Function  TeX4ht does not directly transform TeX or LaTeX markup into the output markup language (HTML etc.) Instead, an ordinary (La)TeX run compiles a DVI file from the source first. TeX4ht subsequently processes the DVI file. Cf. The LaTeX Web Companion, pp. 169f. Other converters, most notably LaTeX2HTML or TtH operate in a single pass. TeX4ht essentially can deal with any successfully compiling (La)TeX document source. TeX4ht can also incorporate support publicly available macro packages or user-made (perhaps document-specific) commands to process features that transcend standard TeX formats, such as for managing bibliography with BibTeX, because these extensions do not need corresponding implementations in the converter. Mathematical formulae and other characters or symbols that cannot be displayed as text are converted into graphics. Mathematics can also be converted into MathML or form suitable for processing with MathJax. TeX4ht can convert LaTeX documents into Microsoft Word's doc format via the OpenDocument format, ODT.

History A village called Hoegaarden, near Tienen in Flanders, is the modern birthplace of Belgian white beer. Records of brewing in the village date back to 1445, when the local monks were enthusiastic brewers, but the tradition died out in the 1950s. Early and recent history The village of Hoegaarden had been known for its witbieren (white beers) since the Middle Ages. In the nineteenth century, the village had thirteen breweries and 9 distilleries; however, in 1957, the last local witbier brewery, Tomsin, closed its doors. Pierre Celis, a milkman who had grown up next to the brewery and sometimes helped with brewing, decided some ten years later to try to revive the style. He started a new brewery, called de Kluis, in his hay loft. Tim Webb, Good Beer Guide to Belgium and Holland , page 143 Celis used the traditional ingredients of water, yeast, wheat, hops, coriander, and dried Cura√ßao orange peel known as Laraha. In the 1980s, with demand for the product continuing to grow, Celis bought Hougardia, a former lemonade factory, to expand his brewing operations. After a fire in 1985, several brewers offered their help ‚Äî as is traditional in Belgium. One of these was the largest brewer in the country, called Interbrew (after a merger with AmBev, renamed InBev). Interbrew lent money for the purchase of other buildings to rebuild the brewery. Over time, Celis felt very strongly that the company used the loan to pressure him to change the recipe to make the beer more \\"mass market\\". Celis goes to Texas and Michigan Celis decided instead to sell them the brewery, and with the proceeds, he moved to the United States, where he set up the Celis Brewery in Austin, Texas, to continue making witbier to what he described as the original Hoegaarden recipe. It was later acquired by Miller Brewing. Celis never fully relocated to Texas, but his daughter and son-in-law, who operated the brewery, did. Miller ultimately closed the brewery and sold the equipment and brand names to Michigan Brewing Company. The witbier Celis brewed in Texas, which he described as the original Hoegaarden recipe, was at the same time brewed in Belgium, first by Brouwerij De Smedt and then later by Brouwerij van Steenberge. This beer, Celis White, is still being brewed in Belgium by Brouwerij van Steenberge, and was brewed in the U.S. by Michigan Brewing Company, which went bankrupt and sold the name. Hoegaarden since InBev takeover In November 2005, InBev announced the forthcoming closure of the brewery in Hoegaarden, among other changes in Belgium. The brewery was to close in late 2006 with production moving to InBev's larger brewery in Jupille. The beer Julius was said to have been an immediate casualty, and sparked worries that all beers that were bottle conditioned would be changed. The closure sparked protests from Hoegaarden locals, upset at the loss of the town's most famous symbol and largest employer. The move was never completed. The brewers in Jupille remained unsatisfied with local production of the witbier, so on September 10, 2007, Inbev decided to keep the production in Hoegaarden. Inbev also decided to invest part of a 60 million Euro budget in the Hoegaarden site to upgrade the facilities.

(Some Australian state herbaria continue to use the name Callistemon teretifolius). It is a medium-sized shrub with sharp- pointed, needle-like leaves and bright red bottlebrush flower spikes. Description Melaleuca orophila is a shrub growing to tall with hard, fissured bark and rigid branches. Its leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, linear in shape and circular or almost so in cross section. The flowers are bright red or orange-green and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and also on the sides of the branches. The spikes are in diameter with 12 to 55 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower ages and there are 25‚Äì42 stamens in each flower. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca orophila was first named in 2006 by Lyndley Craven in Novon when he transferred the species from Callistemon. The specific epithet (orophila) is derived from the Greek words √≥ros (·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"mountain\\" and ph√≠los (œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ) meaning \\"loving\\", hence \\"mountain-loving\\", in reference to the preferred habitat of this species. Callistemon teretifolius was first formally described in 1853 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the journal Linnaea. Callistemon teretifolius is regarded as a synonym of Melaleuca orophila by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca orophila occurs mainly in the Flinders Ranges, especially between Williamstown and Mount Crawford. It grows in mallee and woodland in rocky situations. Conservation Melaleuca orophila is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" by the Government of South Australia Department for Environment and Heritage.

Its name is short for \\"Eternal League of Nefia\\". Noa began developing Elona in 2006, and based it on roguelikes such as Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM) and Angband. Noa has also two other role-playing games in development, Shade and Etherwind. A reviewer at Insert Credit praised Elona as \\"very well-made\\" and compared its character development system to that of ADOM. The game is set in a fantasy world called Irva. The player creates a character, with one each of eleven races and ten classes, to battle monsters, practice magic, perform music, or take on various other roles. It is possible to change a value in the configuration and play as special \\"debug\\" races, such as a god. The player first takes control of their character, who survives a disaster at sea, in the north of Irva's northwestern continent, Tyris. (The picture is a map that shows Tyris in the northwest region of Irva.) North Tyris contains many towns and dungeons, with randomly generated elements, that the player can explore as they deal with or avoid creatures, townsfolk, other adventurers, and the corrupting effects of a seasonal phenomenon called Etherwind. The player can take quests and make their character believe in one of several gods to enhance their skills and earn various bonuses. Elona is programmed in the Hot Soup Processor (HSP) procedural language. Noa promoted the game with an Adobe Flash shooter game, Elona Shooter, released in October 2009 on Kongregate. There are various Elona Variants after Noa has abandoned the game's development, such as the Elonaplus (Elona+) by Ano Inu and Omake_Overhaul_modify. Gameplay Those experienced with roguelikes (Angband, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Nethack) will expect Elona to revolve around a main dungeon and quest, but Elona instead leaves much of the action up to the player. There are few references to the main dungeon in the Elona world. Instead, gameplay often revolves around completing randomly-generated quests and pilfering dungeons for higher- level loot. Aside from the open-world nature of the game, Elona plays very similarly to other roguelikes with its heavily randomized gameplay elements. Of note is that players often say that pure wizards are extremely difficult to play due to the relative rarity of spellbooks and the way that the casting system in Elona works. However, Elona+, an improved version of Elona, makes several substantial changes to spellcasting. These changes are regarded as extremely beneficial for players who wish to play as wizards. Character creation The playable races in Elona are the Yerles, Eulderna, Fairy, Dwarf, Juere, Elea, Snail, Lich, Goblin, Golem, and Mutant. Online content Elona allows players to create custom maps and content and upload them to the server. These maps can be accessed via randomly spawning moongates in town. Caution should be taken when entering moon gates, there may be no way back except via dying, and many moongates contain a wide variety of bizarre ways to kill the player, ranging from cats that kill in a single hit to kamikaze monsters that set off a massive chain reaction explosion when killed. With the online setting chosen, players can also see other player's death messages (but not encounter them in-game) and the manner in which they die, such as starving to death in a dungeon or being killed by a rock thrown by an old man.

It refers to the characteristic of food commonly referred to as spiciness, hotness or heat, found in foods such as chili peppers. Highly pungent tastes may be experienced as unpleasant. The term piquancy () is sometimes applied to foods with a lower degree of pungency that are \\"agreeably stimulating to the palate\\". Examples of piquant food include mustard and curry. Terminology The terms \\"pungent\\" () and \\"pungency\\" are rarely used in colloquial speech but are preferred by scientists as they eliminate the potential ambiguity arising from use of the words \\"hot\\" and \\"spicy\\", which can also refer to temperature and the presence of spices, respectively. For instance, a pumpkin pie can be both hot (out of the oven) and spicy (due to the common inclusion of spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, mace, and cloves), but it is not pungent. (A food critic may nevertheless use the word \\"piquant\\" to describe such a pie, especially if it is exceptionally well-seasoned.) Conversely, pure capsaicin is pungent, yet it is not naturally accompanied by a hot temperature or spices. As the Oxford, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries explain, the term \\"piquancy\\" refers to mild pungency and flavors and spices that are much less strong than chilli peppers, including, for example, the strong flavor of some tomatoes. In other words, pungency always refers to a very strong taste whereas piquancy refers to any spices and foods that are \\"agreeably stimulating to the palate\\", in other words to food that is spicy in the general sense of \\"well-spiced\\". Applications Pungent substances have been used as analgesics and for flavoring foods. In foods A display of spices in Guadeloupe: some pungent, some not Pungency is often quantified in scales that range from mild to hot. The Scoville scale measures the pungency of chili peppers, as defined by the amount of capsaicin they contain. Pungency is not considered a taste in the technical sense because it is carried to the brain by a different set of nerves. While taste nerves are activated when consuming foods like chili peppers, the sensation commonly interpreted as \\"hot\\" results from the stimulation of somatosensory fibers in the mouth. Many parts of the body with exposed membranes that lack taste receptors (such as the nasal cavity, genitals, or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to pungent agents. The pungent sensation provided by chili peppers, black pepper and other spices like ginger and horseradish plays an important role in a diverse range of cuisines across the world, such as Korean, Persian, Turkish, Tunisian, Ethiopian, Hungarian, Indian, Burmese, Filipino (particularly Bicolano), Indonesian, Laotian, Singaporean, Malaysian, Bangladeshi, Mexican, Peruvian, Caribbean, Pakistani, Somali, Southwest Chinese (including Sichuan cuisine), Sri Lankan, Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines. Mechanism Pungency is sensed via chemesthesis, the sensitivity of the skin and mucous membranes to chemical substances. Substances such as piperine and capsaicin can cause a burning sensation by inducing a trigeminal nerve stimulation together with normal taste reception. The pungent feeling caused by allyl isothiocyanate, capsaicin, piperine, and allicin is caused by activation of the heat thermo- and chemosensitive TRP ion channels including TRPV1 and TRPA1 nociceptors. The pungency of chilies may be an adaptive response to microbial pathogens.

Discounting a second time Rediscount is the act of discounting a short- term negotiable debt instrument for a second time. Banks may rediscount these short-term debt securities to assist the movement of a market that has a high demand for loans. When there is low liquidity in the market, banks can generate cash by rediscounting short-term securities. Rediscount lines can also be subsidized and this is usually attributed to the following reasons: # an incentive must be offered to financial intermediaries to induce them to lend for purposes that they would otherwise not lend for; # the target sector or group is often judged to need subsidized funding in order to develop. Financing for a bank Rediscount is a way of providing financing to a bank or other financial institution. Especially in the 19th century and early 20th century banks made loans to their customers by \\"discounting\\" the customer's note. The note is a paper document, in a specified form, where the borrower promises to repay a certain amount at a specified date. Let's say the customer wants to borrow $1000. The bank may ask him to sign a note promising to repay $1100 in one year. The bank is \\"discounting\\" the note by paying less than the $1100 face amount. The extra $100 is of course the bank's compensation for paying before the note matures. The Federal Reserve System could provide financing by \\"rediscounting\\" this note. Maybe the Fed would give the bank $1050 for the note. Rediscounting was once the primary means by which banks obtain loans from the Federal Reserve bank but, at present, most banks turn to this process by discounting their own notes, which - in turn - are secured by the government securities or other eligible paper. Central bank rediscount procedures can affect demand for public instruments because the case of rediscounting government paper lowers the cost of public debt service on account of the fact that investors - in this condition - are more willing to accept lower level yield. A central bank's rediscount to commercial banks can be classified into the following: * adjustment rediscount: assists banks in addressing the issues of temporary insufficient liquidity and short positions (very short term) * seasonal rediscount: used to ease liquidity pressures on banks due to seasonal changes * extended rediscount: used to assist banks experiencing drastically decreased deposits or in case of a severe liquidity crunch (long-term) References Category:Corporate finance ","title":"Rediscount"},{"id":"25004062","text":"Patos Marinza is an Albanian oil field that was discovered in 1928.

The building is significant for its role in the early urbanization of Murray, Utah. The Warenski-Duvall building represents a building-type common during the early-twentieth century development of Murray's commercial business district and it is also part of the Murray Downtown Historic District. The building's owner was Edward J. Warenski, an early resident of Murray who owned a saloon and grocery store on State Street. Warenski and his family lived just north of the store. In 1923, the Duvall family purchased the building and divided the upper floor into apartments where family members and other workers in downtown Murray lived. The Warenski- Duvall Commercial Building and Apartments is a transitional building in the context of Murray City's development. This building represents the changes brought to the economic and social structure of the community in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Between 1902 and the 1930s, commercial buildings lined State Street from 4700 South to 5000 South. Most of these businesses were owned by second-generation Mormons who had left their farms for more lucrative employment, but a few were owned by immigrant families originally brought to Murray by the smelter industry.Carter, Thomas and Peter Goss. Utah's Historic Architecture, 1847-1940. Salt Lake City, UT: University of Utah Graduate School of Architecture and Utah State Historical Society, 1991. Edward Charles and Susannah Aldian Warenski were immigrants from Poland and England, respectively, who settled in Salt Lake City in the 1860s. By the start of the 20th century, Edward, Susannah and their children had moved to Murray. The Warenski family owned most of the block between 4800 South and Vine Street, west of State Street. The older store that existed on this site was demolished and the two-story brick Warenski building was constructed in 1915. Among the first retail tenants of the building after the Warenski grocery store were Frank Metcalfs Automotive Repair & Accessories Company at 4865 South State, Granite Furniture Company at 4867 South State, and Carlisle Motor Company at 4877 South State.McCormick, John S. ed. Murray Historic Showcase: A Representation of Architecturally and Historically Significant Buildings Built Before 1920. Murray, Utah: Murray City and Murray Arts Advisory Board, 1994. On June 6, 1923, the Warenskis sold the commercial building to John W. Johnson in 1923. John Johnson and his brother-in-law, Tony Duvall, remodeled the upper floor into apartments. Tony Duvall also built and managed the Gem Theatre (see Iris Theater) just to the north of the Warenski building. At their new location, the Johnsons and Duvalls followed the practice of living in apartments above the theater. By 1925, Tony and his wife, Marguerite Morris Duvall, were managing the Gem Theatre and living in what were called the Duvall Apartments in the former Warenski building. Minnie Torrance Duvall, who helped finance her family's involvement in the theaters, also moved to the Duvall Apartments in Murray. In 1926, Tony Duvall was given \\"control of attorney\\" to take over the Duvall Building, as the building was by then known. The anchor tenant was the Thomas Martin & Company general merchandise store that occupied the largest retail space. The Murray Post Office took over the space on February 1, 1926. The tenancy of all three retail spaces remained constant for the next two decades with the J.P. O'Brien Jewelry Store at 4869, the Leader Clothing Store at 4873, and the post office at 4879 South State. The Duvall Apartments were occupied throughout this period by members of the Duvall family and others, most of whom worked in Murray's central business district.

Revolutionary government After the success of the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, he was appointed minister of agriculture, under prime minister Jos√© Mir√≥ Cardona and president Manuel Urrutia Lle√≥. Sor√≠ Mar√≠n was the chief judge in the 1959 war crimes trials of Havana. On 23 January 1959, alongside two other judges, he presided over the televised trial of Major Jes√∫s Sosa Blanco.

Huber Matos, head of the rebel army in Camaguey Province, resigned in October 1959, and was soon arrested. Within days, Sor√≠ Mar√≠n, Aldo Vera Serafin and many of their fellow anti-communists left Cuba to re-group in the United States. Sor√≠ Mar√≠n, with much support from CIA officer E.

George The Air War Plans Division (AWPD) was an American military organization established to make long-term plans for war. Headed by Harold L. George, the unit was tasked in July 1941 to provide President Franklin D. Roosevelt with \\"overall production requirements required to defeat our potential enemies.\\"Futrell, 1989, p. 109 The plans that were made at the AWPD eventually proved significant in the defeat of Nazi Germany. The AWPD went beyond offering basic production requirements and provided instead of a comprehensive air plan which was designed to defeat the Axis powers. The plan, AWPD-1, was completed in nine days.Air & Space Journal staff, 2003. The plan emphasized using heavy bombers to carry out precision bombing attacks as the primary method of defeating Germany and her allies. A year later, after the United States became directly involved in World War II, AWPD delivered a second plan‚ÄîAWPD-42‚Äîwhich slightly changed the earlier plan to incorporate lessons learned from eight months of the war. Neither AWPD-1 nor AWPD-42 were approved as combat battle plans or war operations; they were simply accepted as guidelines for the production of materielHansell, 1980, p. 155. and the creation of necessary air squadrons. Finally, in 1943, an operational aerial warfare plan was hammered out in meetings between American and British war planners, based on a combination of British plans and those from the AWPD, to create the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO).Hansell, 1980, pp. 157‚Äì194.Rizer, Kenneth R. \\"Bombing Dual-Use Targets: Legal, Ethical, and Doctrinal Perspectives.\\" Air & Space Power Journal, 1 May 2001. Retrieved on 6 November 2009. Founding On 20 June 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) were established as a way to combine and streamline two conflicting air commands: GHQ Air Force and the Army Air Corps. Major General Henry H. Arnold commanded the USAAF and formed an Air Staff to lead it; within the Air Staff, the Air War Plans Division was established with Lieutenant Colonel Harold L. George at its head. George was to coordinate his planning efforts with War Plans Division (WPD). Up to this point, the WPD of the War Department was responsible for planning all aspects of Army, and Army Air Corps expansion in the U.S.Cline, 1951, Chapter IV pp. 50‚Äì74. George was challenged by WPD which contested AWPD's and Air Staff's authority to make strategic plans. WPD recommended that AWPD is limited to tactical planning, and that the Air Staff, in a subordinate role, should advise the WPD rather than make its own operational or strategic plans. George pushed for greater autonomy‚Äîhe wished to prepare all plans for all air operations. On 9 July 1941, President Roosevelt asked Frank Knox, the Secretary of the Navy, and Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War, for an exploration of the total war production required for the United States to prevail in case of war. The WPD, in order to project long-term numbers, realized that Rainbow 5 would now be used as a basis for production quantities, but it lacked detailed air power figures. Stimson requested of Robert A. Lovett, Assistant Secretary of War for Air,Time magazine, 25 August 1941. \\"Army: Secretary of War,\\" page 3. Retrieved on 7 November 2009. that the USAAF be tapped for their ideas about production numbers. After some bureaucratic delay, the AWPD received the request. AWPD-1 RAF Air Vice-Marshal John Slessor proposed a combined Anglo- American strategic bombing campaign. In early 1941, American, Canadian and British war planners convened in Washington D.C. for a series of secret planning sessions called American‚ÄìBritish Conference, or ABC-1, to determine a course of action should the United States become a belligerent in the war. An overarching strategy of Europe first was agreed to, where American energies would primarily be directed against Germany, Italy and their European conquests, during which a secondary defensive posture was to be held against Japan. Royal Air Force Air Vice-Marshal John SlessorCrowder, Ed. \\"Pointblank: A Study in Strategic and National Security Decision Making.\\" Airpower Journal, Spring 1992. Retrieved on 9 November 2009. and other airmen present at the conference agreed on the general concept of using strategic bombing by both British and American air units based in the United Kingdom to reduce Axis military power in Europe.Griffith, 1999, pp. 67‚Äì69. Incorporating this work in April 1941, the joint U.S. Army-Navy Board developed Rainbow 5, the final version of general military guidelines the U.S. would follow in case of war.Zabecki, David T. World War II in Europe: Section 5. Strategy, tactics, and operational techniques. Volume 2 of World War II in Europe: An Encyclopedia. Taylor & Francis, 1999, p. 1679. Kenneth Walker At the beginning of August 1941, the AWPD consisted of only four officers: Harold L. George, Orvil Anderson, Kenneth Walker (each one a lieutenant colonel), and Major Haywood S. Hansell. To help answer the urgent need for planning, George could have sent a couple of his air officers to WPD to assist them, following the standard Army policy since air warfare first arose in World War I. An air plan would have been made emphasizing tactical air coordination with ground forces,Arnold, 2002, pp. 244‚Äì246. one which targeted Axis military formations and supplies in preparation and support of an invasion. George wished to implement the strategic bombing theories that had been debated and refined at the Air Corps Tactical School (ACTS) during the preceding decade, but was faced with the sure knowledge that the Army and the War Department would not accept a strategy that assumed air attack would prevail alone. Instead, George intended to implement a middle path which began with strategic air attack but contained allowances for the eventual support of a ground invasion. In requesting autonomy to make his own plans, George gained approval from General Arnold and from General Leonard T. Gerow, head of the overworked WPD, who approved as long as AWPD held to the guidelines of ABC-1 and Rainbow 5. Laurence S. Kuter Haywood S. Hansell George sought out men he knew were bombing advocates. He obtained temporary help from five more air officers: Lieutenant Colonels Max F. Schneider and Arthur W. Vanaman, and Majors Hoyt S. Vandenberg, Laurence S. Kuter, and Samuel E. Anderson. All but Samuel E. Anderson had passed through ACTS where precision bombing theories were ascendant.Finney, Robert T. (1998) Air Force History and Museums Program. History of the Air Corps Tactical School 1920‚Äì1940. Third imprint. Retrieved on 3 November 2009. Orvil Anderson was assigned to continue with ongoing projects while the rest of the men concentrated on the new request. On 4 August 1941, the augmented AWPD set to work. George, Walker, Kuter, and Hansell provided the key concepts for the AWPD task force. George's vision was that the plan should not be a simple list of quantities of men and materiel‚Äîit should be a clear expression of the strategic direction required to win the war by use of air power.Overy, 2005, p. 62. The main feature of the plan was the proposal to use massive fleets of heavy bombers to attack economic targets, the choke points of Axis industry. Hansell, fresh from a fact-finding mission to England in which he was briefed on British appreciations of German industrial and military targets, immediately became immersed in the job of target selection. Munitions Requirements of the Army Air Forces to Defeat Our Potential Enemies, or AWPD-1, standing for \\"Air War Plans Division, plan number one\\",Nalty, 2003, pp. 187, 233. was the first concrete result of AWPD; delivered on 12 August after nine days of preparation. The plan used industrial web theory to describe how air power could be used to attack vulnerable nodes in Germany's economy, including electrical power systems, transportation networks, and oil and petroleum resources.Futrell, 1989, p. 109 The civil population of Berlin could be targeted as a final step to achieving enemy capitulation, but such an attack was optional: \\"No special bombardment unit [would be] set up for this purpose.\\"Griffith, 1999, pp. 73‚Äì74. The plan also described, in less detail, how to use air power to draw a defensive perimeter around the Western Hemisphere and around America's interests in Alaska, Hawaii, Dutch East Indies and the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean. In the Atlantic, AWPD indicated bases be developed in Iceland, Newfoundland, and Greenland to augment bases in the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, bases were to be established in India and staging areas arranged in Siberia. Finally, the plan detailed large tactical air formations to assist in an invasion of Europe and to fight in the land campaigns to follow, to be ready by Spring 1944‚Äîthe same time that invasion forces would be ready. Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall approved AWPD-1 in September, as did Secretary of War Stimson. Army planners were worried that both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom would be defeated, and that an invasion of Europe would become remote. The strategy of weakening Germany by bombing, long before an invasion could be prepared, gave hope that America would not lose any allies in the interim. AWPD-2 On 9 September 1941, the president asked for more detail regarding allocation of aircraft based on estimates of peacetime production for the next nine months. In AWPD-2, Arnold and George designated two-thirds of the aircraft to be pooled for anti-Axis purposes such as Lend-Lease and one-third to be sent to the USAAF. Public knowledge Senator Burton K. Wheeler compromised the secret plans in his wish to keep America out of the war. Roosevelt incorporated the Army's, Navy's and Air Staff's detailed plans into an executive policy he called his \\"Victory Program\\". Roosevelt hoped to engage public opinion in favor of the Victory Program because the increase in production it promised meant more jobs and a healthier economy. Opponents of the policy included a powerful supporter of the isolationist America First Committee, Senator Burton K. Wheeler. Wheeler obtained a copy of the Victory Program, classified Secret, from a source within the Air Corps, and leaked the plan to two isolationist newspapers on 4 December 1941, the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Times-Herald. Vocal public opposition to the plan ceased three days later on 7 December 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Congress soon passed the Victory Program with few changes. German agents monitoring American newspapers wired the compromised secret program to Berlin where Franz Halder, Chief of the German General Staff, realized its critical importance. On 12 December, Adolf Hitler issued Directive 39 which countered the American strategic bombing and invasion plans by massing air defenses around key industries and by greatly increasing Atlantic Ocean attacks so that an Allied invasion fleet could not be formed. Hitler directed his forces opposing the Soviet Union to go on the defensive so that they could hold their ground at least cost. Four days later, after visiting the Eastern Front and seeing the extent of his strategic failures there, Hitler \\"angrily and irrationally rescinded Directive 39\\" and focused his armies once again on the attack. AWPD-4 After 7 December, all of America's former plans required revision‚Äînone had projected such early involvement in direct combat. Orvil Anderson was asked to rewrite the air plans. On 15 December, Anderson submitted AWPD-4, mostly a restatement of the goals of AWPD-1, but with augmented quantities to meet the greater needs of a two-front war. The number of combat aircraft was increased by 65%, and total aircraft production was more than doubled. AWPD-42 On 24 August 1942, in light of the grim global situation, President Roosevelt called for a major reassessment of U.S. air power requirements, \\"in order to have complete air ascendancy over the enemy.\\" The Japanese had expanded quickly in the Pacific Theater, and North Africa was being rolled up by Rommel with Egypt threatened, Soviet forces were falling back against the German advances toward Stalingrad and the oilfields of the Caucasus, and German U-boats in the Atlantic sank 589 ships in early 1942. On 25 August, Arnold received word of the president's request from Army Chief of Staff George Marshall.Arnold, 2002, pp. 375‚Äì376. The individual AWPD-1 team members had been reassigned to a wide variety of posts and duties, so to perform the reassessment Arnold recommended Hansell, recently made brigadier general. Marshall cabled Hansell in the UK where he had been working under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Air Planner, and under General Carl Andrew Spaatz as Deputy Theater Air Officer.Hansell, 1980, p. 100.Boyne, 2002, p. 59. Marshall ordered Hansell to hurry back to AWPD and that \\"the results of the work of this group are of such far-reaching importance that it will probably determine whether or not we control the air.\\"Griffith, 1999, pp. 94‚Äì96. Hansell brought with him VIII Bomber Command Chief of Intelligence Colonel Harris Hull and RAF Group Captain Bobby Sharp, as well as the little data compiled from five UK-based raids which had been flown by U.S. bombers. Hansell was assisted on a consultative basis by George, Kuter and Walker, old AWPD-1 hands, and by Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Moss who was a sharp businessman in civil life. The team had just 11 days to finish the work. Arnold was more closely involved than before in leading the group and formulating the new plan. Like AWPD-1, the new framework was based largely on untried bombing theory. The report, entitled Requirements for Air Ascendancy, 1942, or AWPD-42, was submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) on 6 September 1942. Harry Hopkins had obtained his copy at 1 am the day it was to be released, and Hopkins read it in time to tell Roosevelt over breakfast that the plan was sound. Roosevelt called Stimson to say he approved it, but Stimson hadn't seen it, nor had Marshall when Stimson called him. Hansell left hurriedly for England so that he would not have to face Marshall's anger at being caught unprepared. AWPD-42 was written under the assumption that the Soviet Union would be knocked out of the war, and that German forces in the East would then be brought to bear against the West. The plan thus assumed that German ground forces defending Europe would be numerically superior to Allied invasion forces, making invasion extremely costly and perhaps impossible. As well, two-front tension in the German economy would lessen, and Allied damage to Axis industry would be more easily absorbed. An increase in American air power was projected as the best way to reduce Axis industrial might. An air campaign against two major European objectives was encompassed: first to paralyze Axis industrial power, and second to defeat Axis air power. Axis aircraft factories and aircraft engine plants were to be targeted during 1943‚Äì1944 so that, in the Spring of 1944, an invasion of Europe could be undertaken. U.S. Navy patrol bomber in 1943: the PB4Y-1 Liberator. Under AWPB-42, the aircraft would have been flown by Army Air Forces, not the Navy. In the president's request, he had not asked for the combined numbers of U.S. Army and U.S. Navy aircraft; he asked for the \\"number of combat aircraft by types which should be produced in this country for the Army and our Allies in 1943...\\"Hansell, 1980, p. 104. This meant that the Navy's aircraft needs, which were significant, were not requested, but that the aircraft needs for America's allies would be included, allies that were to receive a certain amount of Navy-type aircraft. Hansell decided to make his plan wholly inclusive of all American aircraft requirements‚ÄîArmy, Navy, and Allied‚Äîso that there would be no misunderstanding about how aircraft-producing resources would be allocated. Hansell accepted the aircraft production plans that the Navy submitted, but with one vital change: the four-engined bombers the Navy wanted would be built as Air Corps bombers, flown by USAAF units. The Navy was not at all satisfied with AWPD-42. The Navy's intention to divert 1250 land-based heavy bombers from AAF requirements to use for long-range patrol and for attacking enemy vessels was dismissed in favor of USAAF flights to achieve the same goals. The Navy expected that command and control differences between the services, as well as differing targeting preferences, would create impossible barriers to successful employment of the notional USAAF patrol bombers against enemy naval forces. The Navy flatly rejected AWPD-42, which barred acceptance by the JCS, but by 15 October 1942 the president had established it as the U.S.'s aircraft manufacturing plan, saying that the lofty aircraft production proposal \\"will be given the highest priority and whatever preference is needed to insure its accomplishment.\\" Quantities AWPD-1 called for the production of 61,800 aircraft of which 37,000 would be trainers and 11,800 would be for combat. The remaining 13,000 would be military transport aircraft and other types. Of the combat aircraft, 5000 were to be heavy and very heavy bombers. AWPD-4 upped the combat aircraft to 19,520 and the total to 146,000. Numbers increased again in AWPD-42 which proposed that combat aircraft should top 63,000 in 1943. Total U.S. aircraft production, including for the Navy, was set at 139,000 until it was realized that the goal could not be reached by American industry. 107,000 was instead proposed. AWPD-1 projected a force of 2.1 million airmen. AWPD-42 increased this to 2.7 million.Hansell, 1980, p. 109. In drawing up AWPD-1, George had predicted that two very heavy bombers that were on the drawing board, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress and the Consolidated-Vultee B-36, would be ready in time to take part in the attack on Germany. Delays in both programs kept them from consideration in Europe. In AWPD-42, the B-29 was shifted to attacks on Japan, and the B-36 development at Consolidated-Vultee was slowed in favor of manufacturing more B-24 Liberators. The extra long range of the B-36 would not be needed now that the United Kingdom appeared secure from attack. Targets The interior of a submarine pen hit by an Allied Grand Slam bomb AWPD-1 identified 154 targets in four areas of concern: Electric power, transportation, petroleum and the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force. An arbitrary time frame was given, suggesting that six months after the strategic bombing forces were ready for large-scale attacks, the enemy targets would be destroyed. AWPD-42 called for 177 targets to be hit, covering seven strategic areas, with the highest priority being enemy aircraft production. Other priorities were submarine pens and building yards, transportation systems, electric power generation and distribution, the petroleum industry, aluminum refining and manufacture, and the synthetic rubber industry. Hansell considered it a mistake to remove electricity from the top priority, and worse still to place submarine pens there.Griffith, 1999, pp. 97‚Äì99. Political expediency dictated the shift in target priorities, not pure strategic considerations. Subsequent groups Targeting proved a difficult task for AWPD‚Äîattaining the proper selection required a wide range of intelligence input as well as operational considerations. In December 1942, Arnold set up the Committee of Operations Analysts (COA) to better study the problem. The COA performed target selection for the USAAF.Berg, Paul D. \\"Slow Airpower Assessment: A Cause for Concern?\\" Air & Space Power Journal, Fall 2004. Retrieved on 9 November 2009. In January 1943 at the Casablanca Conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed to begin the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) in June and set targeting priorities. Based on these priorities but with some changes, the British Air Ministry issued the Casablanca directive on 4 February, targeting the German military, German industrial and economic systems, and German morale.Harris, Sir Arthur (1995) Despatch on war operations, 23rd February, 1942, to 8th May, 1945 Volume 3 of Cass series‚Äîstudies in air power. Routledge, p. 196. More methodically, USAAF General Ira C. Eaker assembled an Anglo-American planning team to take the COA's list of targets and schedule them for combined bomber operations. This unnamed group, sometimes called the CBO Planning Team, was led by Hansell and included among others USAAF Brigadier General Franklin Anderson and RAF Air Commodore Sidney Osborne Bufton. Finished in April 1943, the plan recommended 18 operations during each three-month phase against a total of 76 specific targets. The Combined Bomber Offensive began on 10 June 1943. In late 1944, the COA was superseded by the Joint Target Group, a combined service unit organized by the JCS.

Common steamed rice is usually cooked in water, but nasi liwet is rice cooked in coconut milk, chicken broth, salam leaves and lemongrass, thus giving the rice a rich, aromatic and succulent taste. Nasi liwet is a traditional Javanese way of cooking rice in coconut milk. There is one variant of liwet rice, the style of Nasi Liwet Sunda from West Java with its unique Sundanese cuisine a different taste and presentation from Sundanese eating tradition called ngeliwet or botram (a dish made with banana leaves and eaten together). Serving Nasi liwet is topped with a slice of omelette, shredded chicken that had also been cooked in coconut milk and a spoonful of a thick aromatic coconut cream called kumut. Served alongside nasi liwet is opor ayam (a delicate chicken in a mild white coconut milk based sauce scented with galangal and lime leaves), telur pindang (eggs boiled slowly with spices), tempeh and labu siam (chayote) as the vegetable. Traditionally, the pan used for cooking was made of clay. The taste and aroma is generally better if it is cooked on a wood fire, but different regions have different ways of preparing it. Traditionally, it is served on a banana leaf or teak leaf. Frequently, people prefer teak leaves to plates, because of the natural fragrance of the leaf. Nasi liwet complements (side dishes) always consist of coconut milk. Popularity and variants In Solo, nasi liwet is usually eaten for breakfast, but also a popular choice for lunch or supper. In Keprabon subdistrict, Surakarta, nasi liwet is only served for supper at the nighttime.

Tseng was recognized by his peers to be one of the leading optimization researchers of his generation. On August 13, 2009, Paul Tseng went missing while kayaking in the Yangtze River in the Yunnan province of China and is presumed dead.  Biography  Paul Tseng was born September 21, 1959 in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In December 1970, Tseng's family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. Tseng received his B.Sc. from Queen's University in 1981 and his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986. In 1990 Tseng moved to the University of Washington's Department of Mathematics. Tseng has conducted research primarily in continuous optimization and secondarily in discrete optimization and distributed computation.Homepage of Tseng  Research  Tseng made many contributions to mathematical optimization, publishing many articles and helping to develop quality software that has been widely used. He published over 120 papers in optimization and had close collaborations with several colleagues, including Dimitri Bertsekas and Tom Luo. Tseng's research subjects include: * Efficient algorithms for structured convex programs and network flow problems, * Complexity analysis of interior point methods for linear programming, * Parallel and distributed computing, * Error bounds and convergence analysis of iterative algorithms for optimization problems and variational inequalities, * Interior point methods and semidefinite relaxations for hard quadratic and matrix optimization problems, and * Applications of large scale optimization techniques in signal processing and machine learning.Recent papers of Paul Tseng In his research, Tseng gave a new proof for the sharpest complexity result for path-following interior-point methods for linear programming. Furthermore, together with Tom Luo, he resolved a long-standing open question on the convergence of matrix splitting algorithms for linear complementarity problems and affine variational inequalities. Tseng was the first to establish the convergence of the affine scaling algorithm for linear programming in the presence of degeneracy. Tseng has coauthored (with his Ph.D. advisor, Dimitri Bertsekas) a publicly available network optimization program, called RELAX,RELAX4 from NEOS which has been widely used in industry and academia for research purposes. This software has been used by statisticians like Paul R. Rosenbaum and Donald Rubin in their work on propensity score matching. Tseng's software for matching has similarly been used in nonparametric statistics to implement exact tests. Tseng has also developed a program called ERELAXG,ERELAXG for network optimization problems with gains. In 2010 conferences in his honor were held at the University of Washington and at Fudan University in Shanghai. Tseng's personal web page can be accessed in the exact state it was at the time of his disappearance, and contains many of his writings. Travels and disappearance Paul Tseng was an ardent bicyclist, kayaker and backpacker. He took many adventurous trips, including kayak tours along the Mekong, the Danube, the Nile and the Amazon. On August 13, 2009, Paul Tseng went missing while kayaking in the Yantze river near Lijiang, in Yunnan province of China and is now presumed dead.

Upon proclamation as a State Highway in 1925, the Princes Highway passed through Moe township along what is now Lloyd St and Narracan Dr (C103). From the end of Narracan Drive, the highway descended into the La Trobe Valley through the Haunted Hills, along what is now Haunted Hills Road. From Hernes Oak, the highway passed almost due west through what is now the Yallourn Open Cut Mine to join today‚Äôs Morwell Bridge Road at the Morwell River. From there, the Princes Highway used Morwell Bridge Road and what is now Princes Drive (C104) to pass through Morwell. \\"The first improvements to the route came in the late 1950s when the expansion of the Yallourn open cut necessitated the relocation of the highway. The CRB took this opportunity to provide a high standard access-controlled alignment as well as a bypass of Moe. The first section of the new highway opened in 1959/60 as a single carriageway super-2 expressway between Hernes Oak and the Morwell River. Following in December 1964 was a westerly extension of the super-2 highway from Hernes Oak to Gunns Gully (Newborough) and the Moe Bypass completed the new route - opening in early 1967. The section between Gunns Gully and Hernes Oak inherited the \\"Haunted Hills\\" nickname that applied to the original highway between Newborough and Hernes Oak.

She captured two privateers before she wrecked in 1813. Career She was commissioned under Commander Samuel Colquitt and spent her first year cruising in Channel. On 26 December 1809 she recaptured Thames. The next year, on 24 March, she sailed for the West Indies. Then on 1 October, she was in company with , when Owen Glendower captured Indomptable and recaptured Roden. Colquitt received promotion to post captain on 21 October, the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. Her next captain was Commander Charles Bertram, who was appointed on 21 October. On 5 April 1811, at 2pm, the signal station at Beachy Head signaled to Persian that a smuggling vessel was discharging her cargo nearby. Persian set out and after almost eight hours she saw a lugger heading for France. Persian fired two or three broadsides as she chased the lugger and an hour later the lugger struck. She was the privateer Ambuscade under the command of Nicholas Augustine Briganda and had been out from Dieppe for some 40 hours. She was armed with 14 guns and carried a crew of 36, though she normally carried 63 men.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, p.427. Persian sent Ambuscade into Portsmouth.Lloyd's List (LL), ‚Ññ4552.

After recapturing Hannah, Persian then set out to try to find the privateer, but without success. The French privateer cutter had taken Hannah on 1 March, and Hannah arrived at Plymouth on 3 March, the same day that Persian had recaptured her.LL, ‚Ññ4645. On 27 March, Persian, based out of Jersey, sighted a lugger sailing west of her. Persian chased the lugger and fired several broadsides as she did so. After three hours the lugger struck and proved to be the French privateer Petit Jean. She had had to throw eight of her 16 guns overboard during a gale that also washed away eight of her crew of 56. She was under the command of Fran√ßois Clemence and had left her home port of Dieppe eight days before but had not captured any prizes. Persian sent Petit Jean into Guernsey, where she arrived the next day.LL, ‚Ññ4652. On 4 October captured the Danish sloop Speculation and shared the prize money with Persian, , , and by agreement. Then on 17 October Persian and Erebus were again in company with Podargus when Podargus captured the Danish vessels Anna Maria, Twende Brodre, and two market-boats. Next month, on 11 November Podargus captured Syerstadt, with Persian and Erebus in company. On 16 December Persian captured the Danish galliot Ebenetzer, with in company. Erebus shared in the prize money by agreement with Persian. Loss The Wreck of His Majesty's Sloop \\"Persian\\", Philip John Ouless, Jersey Heritage Trust On 3 April 1813, Persian sailed for the West Indies, still under Bertram's command. On 16 June she was wrecked on the Silver Cays (or Keys) Bank, just north of the island of Hispaniola, after having set out from Port-au-Prince earlier that day. The Persian ran aground while pursuing the American privateer schooner , captained by John P. Chazal out of Charleston, SC. Bertram tried to lighten Persian by throwing some guns and stores overboard with the result that she floated off, only to hit another reef. Eventually, despite the crew's exertions, she broke her back and foundered. On 27 June the crew crowded into her four boats (a makeshift raft broke apart) and on 28 June they came ashore between Cabo Frances (formerly called Cap Fran√ßais) and Cabo Cabron in San Domingo. None of her crew of 126 men was lost. However, 11 seamen took advantage of the opportunity to desert the Navy. Bertram and part of his crew arrived at Saint Thomas's on 23 July aboard the sloop Governor Hodgson, Darrell, master, which had been sailing from Porto Plate.LL, ‚Ññ4803. The court martial, under Captain Frederick Lewis Maitland, convened in at the Saints in October determined that the loss was the result of either a strong southerly current setting at a rate of 4 knots or that the Admiralty charts showed the shoals 20 miles too far to the south. The court praised the conduct of Bertram, his officers and his crew. Bertram received a promotion to post captain on 7 June 1814, but never served again.

Caproni Ca.335 / 355 in Ali e uomini. The fuselage was reduced in diameter and the second cockpit was eliminated as being unnecessary, leaving only a single enclosed cockpit with a rearward sliding canopy. Air brakes were added to the wing and, as with the Stuka, a tubular trapeze was included to hold the bomb and ensure it cleared the propeller when dropped during a vertical dive. The Isotta Fraschini Delta engine developed by another company in the Caproni group was chosen to power it. The prototype, serial MM.470 and now designated Ca.355 Tuffo, was flown by test pilot Ettore Wengi on 14 January 1941 from the company airfield at Ponte San Pietro. After initial trials in which no major problems were found, it was delivered to the Regia Aeronautica. While satisfying the original requirements, the military were not satisfied with its performance and it only carried out a few test flights. The Regia Aeronautica chose to continue operating the Junkers Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\", in addition to converting obsolete fighters such as the Fiat CR.42, Fiat G.50 and the Macchi MC.200 to the dive bombing role.

A MyLife public page can list a wide variety of personal information, including an individual's age, past and current home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employers, education, photographs, relatives, political affiliations, a mini biography, and a personal review section which encourages other MyLife members to rate each other. MyLife claims to provide public background data on over 325 million identities. Public pages can be edited or removed by email/phone request without paying. The site also allows people to search for any person in the United States, read their auto-generated public page, and review them. History In 2007, MyLife.com received $25 million in venture funding from Oak Investment Partners. The company changed its name from Reunion.com to MyLife.com after merging with the search engine company, Wink, in the fall of 2008. According to Tinsley, the company's 2008 revenue was estimated at 52 million dollars with 90% of the firm's revenue coming from paid subscriptions. As of 2009, the company had acquired several smaller companies including: Planet Alumni, GoodContacts, HighSchoolAlumni, and MyAddressBook.com. That year, Ancestry.com reported it had begun a data sharing partnership with MyLife. In August 2007, MyLife described its website as the sixth most popular social networking site with 28 million users, while a 2008 article in the Los Angeles Times criticized the company's \\"aggressive marketing approach.\\" In February 2009 ComScore reported the company's website as having 18.2 million unique visitors that month, and Tech Crunch characterized it as the fourth largest social networking website for January 2009.  Legal issues  In 2011, a lawsuit against MyLife stated that the company was engaging in false advertising practices, similar to what was alleged in a 2008 classmates.com class-action lawsuit. The suit also accused the MyLife of false solicitation by offering monthly memberships and then charging member's credit cards at the annual rate. The class action also accused MyLife of spamming contacts improperly gathered from the address books of those visiting the site. U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken ruled to consolidate the 2011 class-action lawsuit with two other fraud class actions against MyLife. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed. The Washington State Attorney General's Office also began an investigation in 2011 stemming from concerns that the company's TV advertisements may have violated the state's Consumer Protection Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive practice. According to State officials the company resolved the issue by making an \\"assurance of discontinuance\\" and paid $28,000 in attorneys' costs and fees. In 2015, after a joint investigation by the Santa Monica City Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, the company was again sued, this time for allegedly violating California Anti-Spam law. Investigators found that MyLife was tricking consumers into giving the company their personal identifying information, and later their money, through false and misleading ads. MyLife agreed to a court judgment under which it would pay $800,000 in penalties, plus $250,000 in refunds to customers, a ruling referred to as \\"the first major prosecution of an online business for violations of California's automatic renewal law\\". The company also is subject to a permanent injunction that prohibits false advertising and unauthorized credit card charges. Ratings and reviews The Better Business Bureau (BBB) rates MyLife as a 'B' with no accreditation.

Yuki Takumiya joined them as the band's drummer. The trio began recording at Berry Records soon after, and in October 1998, they released their first cassette tape, a collection of four songs titled Guitar Vader Vol. 1.[2] More than 1,000 copies were sold at an independent record store in Tokyo called High-Line. The tape was followed by another release, which sold another 1000 units. Empowered by their success, the two volumes were compiled along with new material and one remix onto the two tape set, Die Happy!. The album gained distribution in Tower Records and HMV stores, but was never released officially on CD. This gave the band, who only performed live shows irregularly, their first real exposure to a larger audience. Later that year, they released one more tape, containing three new songs, including the exclusive rarity \\"Generation Revolution\\".

It is scored for chorus and orchestra, with a baritone solo also featured in the last of its seven movements. It is based on the play of the same name by Thomas Nashe, written around 1592. Lambert considered the work his magnum opus,Lisa Hardy, The British Piano Sonata 1870‚Äì1945 and it is his largest work in any genre.David Mason Greene, Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers However, it attracted little attention at its 1936 premiere and had only one or two other performances in Lambert's lifetime (he died in 1951). It has received only one complete commercial recording to date, released in 1992. This, along with a general resurgence of interest in Constant Lambert's music, has led to the work being reexamined, and performances are starting to take place. The Guardian critic said the 1992 recording had made available to the public \\"a masterpiece buried for far too long\\". In 1949, Lambert said to Sir Frederick Ashton: \\"I like Summer's Last Will and Testament the best of all my work\\". Malcolm Arnold called it \\"one of the undiscovered treasures of the English choral repertoire\\". Background and premiere Summer's Last Will and Testament was written between 1932 and 1935, a period in which Lambert was busy with his conducting and orchestration duties with Sadler's Wells, conducting the London premiere of Kurt Weill's The Seven Deadly Sins (under the title Anna-Anna), and completing his book Music Ho!.Mike Ashman, Lost in music, The Guardian, 7 May 2005 Lambert's friend, the conductor and composer Hyam Greenbaum provided support, ostensibly with the choral parts, but also with advice on the composition. Lambert inscribed the vocal score he gave to Greenbaum: \\"To Hyam Greenbaum (who as far as I remember wrote most of this work) from Constant Lambert\\".Lloyd, Stephen. Constant Lambert, Beyond the Rio Grande (2015) p 221 The work was premiered at the Queen's Hall in London on 29 January 1936. The Philharmonic Choir, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the baritone soloist Roy Henderson were conducted by the composer. The concert was sparsely attended. King George V had died just over a week before, and the sombre mood of the country was undoubtedly inimical to a work replete with references to plague, disease and death, and to the persistent aura of fatalism which affected much of Lambert's music. Although this tepid response could well have been anticipated under the circumstances, Lambert considered he had failed as a composer, and completed only two major works in the remaining sixteen years of his life. The piece lasts about 55 minutes. It was dedicated to his then wife Florence Chuter (aka Florence Kaye), whom he had married in 1931. Movements The sections of Summer's Last Will and Testament are: * Intrata (orchestra alone) * Madrigal con ritornelli: Fair Summer droops (orchestra and chorus) * Corante: Spring, the sweet Spring (orchestra and chorus) * Brawles: Trip and go, heave and ho! (orchestra and chorus) * Madrigal con ritornelli: Autumn hath all the Summer's fruitful treasure (orchestra and chorus) * Rondo burlesca: King Pest (orchestra alone) * Saraband: Adieu, farewell earth's bliss! (orchestra, baritone solo and chorus) King Pest is also an allusion to Edgar Allan Poe's story of the same name. Orchestration Summer's Last Will and Testament is scored for the following forces: * baritone solo * chorus SATB * 3 flutes * 3 oboes * 3 clarinets * 3 bassoons * 4 horns * 3 trumpets * 3 cornets * 3 trombones * tuba * timpani * percussion * 2 harps * stringsOxford University Press A version also exists with the orchestral parts arranged for piano four-hands. Recording Summer's Last Will and Testament has had only one complete commercial recording. This was released in 1992 by Hyperion Records, with David Lloyd-Jones conducting the English Northern Philharmonia, the Leeds Festival Chorus, and baritone soloist William Shimell. The recording took place in the Leeds Town Hall, and was produced by Christopher Palmer. Palmer's liner notes compare the plague to AIDS, from which Palmer himself would die just three years later.The Independent, 27 January 1995 Tapes of a 1965 broadcast conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent also exist,Music Web International and there were two notable revivals broadcast during the 1980s and 1990s by the BBC Concert Orchestra and Brighton Festival Chorus conducted by Norman Del Mar (10 May 1986),Brighton Festival Arcihve and by the City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, conducted by Sakari Oramo (5 October, 1999).BBC Genome Project The penultimate movement, the Rondo burlesca subtitled King Pest, written for orchestra alone, has sometimes been performed separatelyGrove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Eric Blom, ed. and has been recorded separately (by Norman Del Mar and the English Chamber Orchestra, released in 2007).

Growing from its roots of the North Carolina Contest Festival at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, it now meets annually at its Professional Development Conference in Winston-Salem, a city known for its rich cultural history and ongoing commitment to the arts, every November. The Association's office (as of July 2013) is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Mission The North Carolina Music Educators Association's mission is to advance music education by promoting the understanding and making of music by all. History The history of the NCMEA can be divided into four segments: * The evolution of the Contest-Festival, which began under the leadership of Wade R. Brown at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1920 * The North Carolina State Music Teachers Association, an organization of African-American music educators established at North Carolina Central University and Hillside High School by the late Samuel Hill in 1931 * The North Carolina Music Educators Conference, which was established in 1947 under the presidency of Ezra Weiss, a faculty member at Guilford College * The present-day North Carolina Music Educators Association, which was formed in 1970 from the NCSMTA and the NCMEC From 1931 to 1970, African-American music educators were members of the North Carolina State Music Teacher's Association. This organization only had three presidents throughout its history, the last one being Hortense Reid Kerr. The organization's activities centered around North Carolina Central University. Under Kerr's leadership the organization merged with the historically white North Carolina Music Educators Conference. James R. Hall, who had served with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, was president of the NCMEC at the time of the 1970 merger. Following the second year of his term, 1970-1971, Hortense Reid Kerr, who had served as the last president of the NCSMTA, served as president of the integrated NCMEA, 1971-193. William G. Spencer of Appalachian State University had initially been designated to serve as president 1971-1973; however, with the merger, he served from 1973 to 1975. The period of the organization's history between 1947 and 1970 was traced in the thesis, From Contest to Merger: a History of the North Carolina Music Educators Association/Conference, written by John Brian Heath at Appalachian State University under the mentorship of Dr. Victor Mansure, with additional support from B.G. McCloud. William G. Spencer, Charles Isley, James R. Hall, Richard Southwick, Herbert Hazelman, and others were interviewed for the study. Additional insightful historical resources include Dr. Jane McKinney's dissertation on three leaders in music education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Dr. McKinney's dissertation was recognized by the Council on Research in Music Education as the best in the nation (Peggy Longmire, Making Music Happen, Greensboro News and Record, August 2009). Harold Jeffrey's 1988 dissertation on Herbert Hazelman, who was for many years director of bands at Greensboro's Grimsley High School, contains a great deal of information on the organization's roots with regard to his discussions about Hazelman's career. A master's level paper was completed on the history of the music program at UNCG, and there is also a dissertation on the life of Captain James Harper of Lenoir High School. Publication The official publication of the organization is the North Carolina Music Educator, which has been published since 1952. Former editors of the publication include Herbert R. Hazelman (now deceased, formerly of Grimsley High School, Dr. John R. Locke of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and Dr. George W. Knight (now retired from East Carolina University). Leadership To ensure diverse representation among its leadership, the conference's constitution is set up so that each third elected leader is to come from a minority background. In other words, if elections for state office were to take place in 2010, 2012, and 2014, the officer elected in 2014 must be from a minority background. These guidelines for diversity were established at the merger of the NCMEC and the NCSMTA in 1970. The presidential leadership consists of a \\"president elect\\" who serves for two years, a \\"president\\" who serves for two years, and a \\"past president\\" who serves for two years. Thus, the commitment of the president is a six-year commitment. The state board of officers typically meets quarterly. When it does not meet in Winston-Salem in November, it often meets in Burlington or another centrally located city in the state. Well-known past presidents include Dr. John R. Locke, Director of Bands at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Dr. Ralph Shumaker, retired professor of music education at East Carolina University; Dr. Mary Beth Yoder- White, former professor of music education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Appalachian State University; Barbara Bair, late professor of music education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; and Dr. Charles Gilchrist, professor of music education at North Carolina Central University. Conventions From the early 1920s into the 1960s, the annual in-service conference was held on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. With the merger with the North Carolina State Music Teachers Association in 1970, in-service conferences were held in Raleigh, Durham, and Wilmington. Beginning in 1974, the annual in-service conference has been held each November in Winston-Salem, primarily at the Benton Convention Center, adjoining hotels, and at the Stevens Center for the Arts, a downtown facility of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. The event traditionally begins with a weekend of rehearsals for all-state orchestra and honors chorus, culminating with the opening of the exhibit hall at noon on Sunday, which opened one year to the sounds of the Canadian Brass. That afternoon, workshops and concerts take place. For many years the finale of the opening day of the conference was the Sunday night general session, which for many years consisted of a grand showcase-like concert from one of the major universities in the state. Two of the most memorable of such concerts were those featuring ensembles from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1990 and 1991. The day's activities conclude with a variety of informal networking opportunities held in the two host hotels. Sunday is typically the busiest and most festive day of the conference, as many return to their local areas on Monday. Monday is made up of meetings and concerts, with elections for regional officers taking place that afternoon. Monday afternoon and evening includes alumni receptions for area universities, followed by an evening general session. The Monday evening general session typically consists of a guest speaker, the presentation of awards, officer installations, and a featured concert. While this concert may be a university showcase type concert like the traditional Sunday night concert of years past, from time to time it may be a professional ensemble or military band. As is the case on Sunday evenings, Monday's activities are also rounded out by informal networking activities. Organizations such as the Percussion Arts Society, the American Choral Directors Association, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, Sigma Alpha Iota, and other groups sharing a common interest with the organization often offer alumni and networking events during the conference. Tuesday's half-day schedule consists of several additional workshops, and a luncheon for incoming and outgoing state officers. No general sessions are held on Tuesday. Throughout the convention, the exhibit hall is abuzz with vendors sharing cookie and fruit samples, major universities sharing information about the music degrees offered on their campus, instrument vendors demonstrating their products, etc. The exhibit hall provides a wealth of networking opportunities, as participants range from beginning collegiate members, to active music educators at both the K-12 and university level, to those in retirement. Past guest speakers at the conference have included Tim Lautzenheizer. Collegiate Membership For many music education majors, participation in CMENC and the annual inservice conference is par for the course. Collegiate involvement grew under the charismatic leadership of the late Bill McCloud, professor of music education and former acting dean of what is now the Hayes School of Music at Appalachian State University, who served as advisor to the collegiate section of NCMEA until shortly before his death in 2002. In addition to his extensive service to the collegiate membership, McCloud had served as president of the Kentucky Music Educators Association, as the president of the Southern Division of the Music Educators National Conference, and was nominated for national president of the Music Educators National Conference in 1994. Though approached about serving as president of the NCMEA several times, he always declined, citing the fact that he wanted to give others the opportunity to serve (McCloud, personal communication, 1993). His lasting influence is still felt to this day. Dr. Jane Grant McKinney has served as state advisor since McCloud's retirement. The first known collegiate state president served during the 1970-1971 school year. Below are listed all known collegiate presidents of the North Carolina Music Educators Association.

This type of subdermal implant usually contains a unique ID number that can be linked to information contained in an external database, such as personal identification, law enforcement, medical history, medications, allergies, and contact information. History * 1998 - The first experiments with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) implant were carried out in 1998 by the British scientist Kevin Warwick. His implant was used to open doors, switch on lights, and cause verbal output within a building. After nine days the implant was removed and has since been held in the Science Museum in London. * 2004 - March 18, 2004 - Nokia, Philips (now under NXP Semiconductors) and Sony established the NFC Forum, a non-profit industry formed to advance the use of NFC wireless interaction in consumer electronics, mobile devices and PCs. Standards include the four distinct tag types that provide different communication speeds and capabilities covering flexibility, memory, security, data retention and write endurance. NFC Forum promotes implementation and standardization of NFC technology to ensure interoperability between devices and services. * 2005 - In early March 2005 hobbyist Amal Graafstra implanted a 125khz EM4102 bioglass-encased RFID transponder into his left hand. It was used with an access control system to gain entry to his office. Soon after in June 2005 he implanted a more advanced HITAG S 2048 low frequency transponder. In 2006 he authored the book RFID Toys, Graafstra uses his implants to access his home, open car doors, and to log on to his computer. With public interest growing, in 2013 he launched biohacking company Dangerous Things and crowdfunded the world's first implantable NFC transponder in 2014. He has also spoken at various events and promotional gigs including TEDx, and built a smartgun that only fires after reading his implant. * 2009 - On 16 March 2009 British scientist Mark Gasson had a glass capsule RFID device surgically implanted into his left hand. In April 2010 Gasson's team demonstrated how a computer virus could wirelessly infect his implant and then be transmitted on to other systems. Gasson reasoned that with implanted technology the separation between man and machine can become theoretical because the technology can be perceived by the human as being a part of their body. Because of this development in our understanding of what constitutes our body and its boundaries he became credited as being the first human infected by a computer virus. He has no plans to remove his implant. * 2014 - In June 2014, during the From Now Conference in Vancouver, Canada, event organizer and futurist Nikolas Badminton had an xNT chip implanted into his left hand on stage by noted biohacker Amal Graafstra. * 2018 - VivoKey Technologies developed the first cryptographically-secure human implantable NFC transponders in 2018. The Spark is an AES128 bit capable ISO/IEC 15693 2mm by 12mm bioglass encased injectable device. The Flex One is an implantable contactless secure element, capable of running Java Card applets (software programs) including Bitcoin wallets, PGP, OATH OTP, U2F, WebAuthn, etc. It is encapsulated in a flat, flexible 7mm x 34mm x 0.4mm flat biopolymer shell. Applets can be deployed to the Flex One before or after implantation. * 2020 - On 28th August 2020, Neuralink CEO Elon Musk, revealed a company directed live video podcast showcasing a pig called Gertrude with a coin-sized computer chip in her brain to demonstrate his ambitious plans to create a working brain-to- machine interface Notable persons An RFID tag visible under the skin soon after being implanted. Several hobbyists, through to scientists and business personalities have placed RFID microchip implants into their hands or had them inserted by others. * Mikey Sklar had a chip implanted into his left hand and filmed the procedure. * Jonathan Oxer self-implanted an RFID chip in his arm using a veterinary implantation tool. * Martijn Wismeijer, Dutch marketing manager for Bitcoin ATM manufacturer General Bytes, placed RFID chips in both of his hands to store his Bitcoin private keys and business card. * Patric Lanhed sent a ‚Äúbio-payment‚Äù of one euro worth of Bitcoin using a chip embedded in his hand. * Marcel Varallo had an NXP chip coated in Bioglass 8625 inserted into his hand between his forefinger and thumb allowing him to open secure elevators and doors at work, print from secure printers, unlock his mobile phone and home, and store his digital business card for transfer to mobile phones enabled for NFC. * Biohacker Hannes Sj√∂blad has been experimenting with near field communication (NFC) chip implants since 2015. During his talk at Echapp√©e Vol√©√© 2016 in Paris, Sj√∂blad disclosed that he has also implanted himself with a chip between his forefinger and thumb and uses it to unlock doors, make payments, unlock his phone, and essentially replacing anything that is put in one‚Äôs pockets. Additionally, Sj√∂blad has hosted several \\"implant parties,\\" where interested individuals can also be implanted with the chip. * Amal Graafstra CEO of Vivokey and Dangerous Things has gained prominency for being an inventor and business commercial distributor of subdermal RFID/NFC Implants on the world stage. Implanted in both hands with his companies implants, he aims to bring awareness to the growing implantation movement. Popular usage A list of popular uses for microchip implants are as follows; * Magnetic Implants * Contraceptive Implants * Access cards * Crypto currency wallets * Travel cards * Bank cards Other uses either cosmetic or medical may also include; Digital identity RFID Implants of various NFC iso standards have been used as access cards ranging for car door entry to building access building access. Secure identity has also been used to encapsulate or impersonate a users identity via secure element or related technologies. Medical records Researchers have examined microchip implants in humans in the medical field and they indicate that there are potential benefits and risks to incorporating the device in the medical field. For example, it could be beneficial for noncompliant patients but still poses great risks for potential misuse of the device. Destron Fearing, a subsidiary of Digital Angel, initially developed the technology for the VeriChip.Smith, Richard M. ‚ÄúTough Sell Ahead for the VeriChip Implant ID System.‚Äù, Computer Bytes Man. 27 Dec. 2001. 16 Oct. 2007 In 2004, the VeriChip implanted device and reader were classified as Class II: General controls with special controls by the FDA; that year the FDA also published a draft guidance describing the special controls required to market such devices. About the size of a grain of rice, the device was typically implanted between the shoulder and elbow area of an individual‚Äôs right arm. Once scanned at the proper frequency, the chip responded with a unique 16-digit number which could be then linked with information about the user held on a database for identity verification, medical records access and other uses. The insertion procedure was performed under local anesthetic in a physician's office. Privacy advocates raised concerns regarding potential abuse of the chip, with some warning that adoption by governments as a compulsory identification program could lead to erosion of civil liberties, as well as identity theft if the device should be hacked. Another ethical dilemma posed by the technology, is that people with dementia could possibly benefit the most from an implanted device that contained their medical records, but issues of informed consent are the most difficult in precisely such people. In June 2007, the American Medical Association declared that \\"implantable radio frequency identification (RFID) devices may help to identify patients, thereby improving the safety and efficiency of patient care, and may be used to enable secure access to patient clinical information\\", but in the same year, news reports linking similar devices to cancer caused in laboratory animals had a devastating impact on the company's stock price and sales. In 2010, the company, by then called PositiveID, withdrew the product from the market due to poor sales.Edwards, Jim. \\"Down With the Chip: PositiveID Axes Its Scary Medical Records\\". bNET. July 15, 2010. Retrieved March 2, 2017 In January 2012, PositiveID sold the chip assets to a company called VeriTeQ that was owned by Scott Silverman, the former CEO of Positive ID. In 2016, JAMM Technologies acquired the chip assets from VeriTeQ; JAMM's business plan was to partner with companies selling implanted medical devices and use the RfID tags to monitor and identify the devices. JAMM Technologies is co-located in the same Plymouth, Minnesota building as Geissler Corporation with Randolph K. Geissler and Donald R. Brattain listed as its principals. The website also claims that Geissler was CEO of PositiveID Corporation, Destron Fearing Corporation, and Digital Angel Corporation. In 2018, A Danish firm called BiChip released a new generation of microchip implant that is intended to be readable from distance and connected to Internet. The company released an update for its microchip implant to associate it with the Ripple cryptocurrency to allow payments to be made using the implanted microchip. Building access and security In February 2006, CityWatcher, Inc. of Cincinnati, OH became the first company in the world to implant microchips into their employees as part of their building access control and security system. The workers needed the implants to access the company's secure video tape room, as documented in USA Today.Lewan, Todd. USA Today. July 2007. \\"Microchips in humans spark privacy debate.\\". The project was initiated and implemented by Six Sigma Security, Inc. The VeriChip Corporation had originally marketed the implant as a way to restrict access to secure facilities such as power plants. A major drawback for such systems is the relative ease with which the 16-digit ID number contained in a chip implant can be obtained and cloned using a hand-held device, a problem that has been demonstrated publicly by security researcher Jonathan WesthuesWesthues, Jonathan. \\"Demo: Cloning a VeriChip.\\" Demo: Cloning a VeriChip. and documented in the May 2006 issue of Wired magazine, among other places. * The Baja Beach Club, a nightclub in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, once used VeriChip implants for identifying VIP guests.http://www.baja.nl/vipform.aspx * The Epicenter in Stockholm, Sweden is using RFID implants for employees to operate security doors, copiers, and pay for lunch.  Purpose and appeal  Patients that undergo NFC implants do so for a variety of reasons ranging from, Biomedical diagnostics, health reasons to gaining new senses, gain biological enhancement, to be part of existing growing movements, for workplace purposes, security, hobbyists and for scientific endeavour. Microchipped individuals can either voluntarily or involuntarily choose to be chipped based on medical or cosmetic reasons.  Safety   Infection  Infection has also been cited as a source of failure within RFID and related microchip implanted individuals.Schiffmann, Alain & Clauss, Martin & Honigmann, Philipp. (2020). Biohackers and Self-Made Problems: Infection of an Implanted RFID/NFC Chip: A Case Report. JBJS Case Connector. 10. e0399-e0399. 10.2106/JBJS.CC.19.00399. Either due to improper implantation techniques, implant rejections of corrosion of implant elements.  MRI's  Concern has been raised and investigated independently by various journalists and bodies on the nature of safety of being implanted and their proximity to MRI machines. So far no common conclusive investigation has been done in the matter of each individual type of implant and it's risks involved near MRI's other than anecdotal reports ranging from no problems occurring with MRI machines, to requiring hand shielding before proximity, to outright denial of proximity due to danger. Corrosion Implants often contain a substantial amount of metallic elements by volume, and iron a common implant element is easily corroded by common elements such as oxygen and water. Implant corrosion occurs when these elements become trapped inside during the encapsulation process, which can cause slow corrosive effect, or the encapsulation fails and allows corrosive elements to come into contact with the magnet. Catastrophic encapsulation failures are usually obvious, resulting in tenderness, discoloration of the skin, and a slight inflammatory response. Small failures however can take much longer to become obvious, resulting in a slow degradation of field strength without many external signs that something is slowly going wrong with the magnet. Criticisms and concerns Cancer risks In a self-published report,http://www.antichips.com/cancer/ Microchip-Induced Tumors in Laboratory Rodents and Dogs: A Review of the Literature 1990‚Äì2006 anti-RFID advocate Katherine Albrecht, who refers to RFID devices as \\"spy chips\\", cites veterinary and toxicological studies carried out from 1996 to 2006 which found lab rodents injected with microchips as an incidental part of unrelated experiments and dogs implanted with identification microchips sometimes developed cancerous tumors at the injection site (subcutaneous sarcomas) as evidence of a human implantation risk. However, the link between foreign-body tumorigenesis in lab animals and implantation in humans has been publicly refuted as erroneous and misleading and the report's author has been criticized over the use of \\"provocative\\" language \\"not based in scientific fact\\". Notably, none of the studies cited specifically set out to investigate the cancer risk of implanted microchips and so none of the studies had a control group of animals that did not get implanted. While the issue is considered worthy of further investigation, one of the studies cited cautioned \\"Blind leaps from the detection of tumors to the prediction of human health risk should be avoided\\". Stolen identity, privacy security risks The Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) of the American Medical Association published a report in 2007 alleging that RFID implanted chips may compromise privacy because even though no information can be stored in an RFID transponder, they allege that there is no assurance that the information contained in the chip can be properly protected.CEJA of the American Medical Association, CEJA Report 5-A-07, Radio Frequency ID Devices in Humans, presented by Robert M. Sade, MD, Chair. 2007 Stolen identity and privacy has been a major concern with Microchip implants being cloned for various nefarious reasons in a process known as Wireless identity theft. Incidents of forced removal of animal implants have been documented, the concern lies in whether this same practice will be used to attack implanted microchipped patients also. Due to low adoption of microchip implants incidents of these physical attacks are rare. Nefarious RFID reprogramming of unprotected or unencrypted microchip tags are also a major security risk consideration. Risk to human freedom and autonomy Some have expressed concerns that technology could be abused.The Guardian, , Remote-controlled contraceptive microchip could launch. 2014 Invasive technology has the potential to be used by governments to create an 'Orwellian' dystopia. In such a world, self- determination, the ability to think freely, and all personal autonomy would be completely lost; human beings would be essentially digital slaves to governments, corporations, or networks that owned the microchipping technology.HuffPost, , Towards The Orwellian Era of a Microchipped Workforce. 2017The Times, , Microchipping workers takes us back to 1984. 2018IOT News, , Could microchip implants presage George Orwell's chilling novel '1984'?. 2014 Examples of privacy concerns in involuntary patients would be involuntarily tagging sex offenders with RFID implants to track their location to provide updates on their whereabouts to authorities, these privacy concerns have been subject of ongoing debate in forced implantation.  Legislation   United States  Following Wisconsin and North Dakota, California issued Senate Bill 362 in 2007, which makes it illegal to force a person to have a microchip implanted, and provide for an assessment of civil penalties against violators of the bill.California Bans Forced RFID Tagging of Humans, Government Technology website, October 17, 2007 In 2008, Oklahoma passed 63 OK Stat ¬ß 63-1-1430 (2008 S.B. 47), that bans involuntary microchip implants in humans. Tim Talley. \\"Bill bans involuntary microchip implants\\". 2008\\\\. \\"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Privacy Laws\\". 2015\\\\. On April 5, 2010, the Georgia Senate passed Senate Bill 235 that prohibits forced microchip implants in humans and that would make it a misdemeanor for anyone to require them, including employers. The bill would allow voluntary microchip implants, as long as they are performed by a physician and regulated by the Georgia Composite Medical Board. The state's House of Representatives did not take up the measure. On February 10, 2010, Virginia's House of Delegates also passed a bill that forbids companies from forcing their employees to be implanted with tracking devices.Virginia delegates pass bill banning chip implants as ‚Äòmark of the beast‚Äô, The Raw Story, By Daniel Tencer, Wednesday, February 10, 2010 retrieved April 23, 2010 Washington State House Bill 1142-2009-10 orders a study using implanted radio frequency identification or other similar technology to electronically monitor sex offenders and other felons.HB 1142-2009-10 to study requiring the use of implanted RFID in certain felons. Potential future applications In 2017 Mike Miller, chief executive of the World Olympians Association, was widely reported as suggesting the use of such implants in athletes in an attempt to reduce problems in sports due to recreational drug use. Theoretically, a GPS-enabled chip could one day make it possible for individuals to be physically located by latitude, longitude, altitude, and velocity. Such implantable GPS devices are not technically feasible at this time. However, if widely deployed at some future point, implantable GPS devices could conceivably allow authorities to locate missing persons and/or fugitives and those who fled from a crime scene. Critics contend, however, that the technology could lead to political repression as governments could use implants to track and persecute human rights activists, labor activists, civil dissidents, and political opponents; criminals and domestic abusers could use them to stalk and harass their victims; and child abusers could use them to locate and abduct children. Another suggested application for a tracking implant, discussed in 2008 by the legislature of Indonesia's Irian Jaya would be to monitor the activities of persons infected with HIV, aimed at reducing their chances of infecting other people.\\"Indonesia's Papua plans to tag AIDS sufferers\\", Mon Nov 24, 2008. The microchipping section was not, however, included in the final version of the provincial HIV/AIDS Handling bylaw passed by the legislature in December 2008.Government Of Indonesian Province Rejects Plan To Implant Microchips In Some HIV-Positive People , 2008-12-08 With current technology, this would not be workable anyway, since there is no implantable device on the market with GPS tracking capability. Since modern payment methods rely upon RFID/NFC, it is thought that implantable microchips, if they were to ever become popular in use, would form a part of the cashless society.\\"Cashless Society\\" This is a dead link. Verichip implants have already been used in nightclubs such as the Baja club for such a purpose, allowing patrons to purchase drinks with their implantable microchip. Market share of implanted individuals may possibly move on to more safer applications of wearable electronics and hardware such as Wearable computer. In popular culture The general public are most familiar with microchips in the context of tracking their pets. In the U.S., some Christians make a link between the PositiveID and the Biblical Mark of the Beast, prophesied to be a future requirement for buying and selling, and a key element of the Book of Revelation. Gary Wohlscheid, president of These Last Days Ministries, has argued that \\"Out of all the technologies with potential to be the mark of the beast, VeriChip has got the best possibility right now\\". \\"Arkangel\\", an episode of the fictional drama series Black Mirror, considered the potential for helicopter parenting of an imagined more advanced microchip. Transhumanism is a movement related the implants and their relation to trans human qualities of which microchipped/sub-dermal implanted individuals are commonly grouped together with.

Diran (born November 3, 1949) is an American adventurer and gemologist who has also been a painter, trader in gemstones, restaurateur, and art dealer. He is best known as the author and photographer of the book The Vanishing Tribes of Burma, which was published in 1997. Biography Diran is the son of Edward K. and Dorothy Diran of San Mateo, California. He graduated from San Mateo High School in 1968. Diran was in the first graduating class of the California Institute of the Arts in 1972. He moved to Japan where he earned a Black Belt in karate in 1974, after which he returned to California, where he graduated from the Gemological Institute of America in 1978 Later Diran and his Japanese wife, Junko, owned the Fuki-ya Japanese Restaurant in the Japan Center (San Francisco) (1978‚Äì1989). An article in The Goldsmith magazine claimed that it was the first Robatayaki restaurant in the United States. Jerry Hopkins and Andy McCoy have mentioned Diran in their published books. Both remember him as part of the business and social scene in Bangkok in the early 1980s. Diran, who first visited Burma in 1980 as a buyer of gemstones, traveled throughout Myanmar and Cambodia for more than two decades, exploring the art, the then still rarely-visited temples, and visiting still remote tribal peoples as he took photographs and acquired antiquities and gems. Antiquities repatriation In 1994 Diran relinquished his claim to an 11th-century Buddha statue from Pagan that he purchased in Thailand for $18,000 and brought to the United States in 1990; no criminal action was pursued against him. Diran had scheduled the statue to be auctioned by Sotheby's in October 1991, expecting to begin bids between $15,000 and $25,000. In 1994, The United States initiated an interpleader proceeding, a civil proceeding, joining Diran and Myanmar as parties to determine the rightful owner of the statue. The sandstone Buddha, which had been stolen from a pagoda near Bagan in 1989 along with three other artifacts, \\"is widely regarded by scholars as an integral part of Myanmar's Buddhist heritage\\", and according to Jack Daulton, the attorney representing Myanmar, \\"was of the utmost rarity, a national treasure\\". After being confiscated by the FBI, the statue was secured at Northern Illinois University (NIU) during the times of unrest in Burma, until 2012 at which point it was moved to Paris for a few weeks en route to being repatriated and stored in the National Museum of Myanmar by November of that year. Diran's attorney has insisted that Diran had been forthcoming throughout the process, having \\"declared it through U.S. Customs\\" when transporting it to the United States, and relinquishing his claim to the statue at a substantial financial loss when its ownership was challenged by the FBI and the government of Myanmar. Daulton counters that there are many clear indications that the statue was not obtained legitimately, including the fact that \\"It's an extremely rare piece of sculpture, and an object like this has not appeared on the market for years.\\" A publication from NIU on the repatriation of historical artifacts stated that the case \\"set a legal precedent in the United States for litigation related to the international transport of antiquities.\\" Photography:The Vanishing Tribes of Burma Diran's photographs of the tribal peoples of Myanmay have been published as a book and also displayed as a traveling exhibition. Diran took the photos in the book over a period of 17 years. Asiaweek described the book as, \\"the most comprehensive visual record of Myanmar's many ethnic groups\\". Diran's book explores Burma's \\"cultural diversity,\\" portraying not only the better-described tribal groups, such as the Jinghpaw, the Karen and the Shan, but also lesser-known peoples including the Thet people, (a Rakhine people), the Bre, the Laytoo Chin and the Lahta. Sarah Dudley of the University of Leicester understands Diran's work as salvage ethnography, capturing images of a physical culture on the brink of disappearing. According to essay reviews inAsiaweek and The Japan Times, Diran, entering Myanmar via a series of 7-day tourist visas issued in Bangkok, entered areas of the country barred to foreigners by the military regime either by evading or with the connivance of provincial officials and thereby obtained a unique series of images of societies on the brink of replacing traditional dress and locally woven cloth with modern fabrics and styles. Journalist Bertil Lintner took similar risks to enter Myanmar in this period. The exhibition features 70 photographs which, according to Diran, include people from \\"at least 40 distinct ethnic groups, documented over more than 25 years and constituting 'the most comprehensive study of Burmese ethnography since [Sir George] Scott more than 100 years ago.'\\" Diran has explained that he intended the exhibition to help humanize the many disparate ethnic groups, many of whom have very little knowledge of one another, some of whom have been \\"linked by the military government to insurgent terrorists\\". All photos in the exhibition were donated to the National Museum of Myanmar. In 2014 a human rights group in Sweden sponsored an exhibition of Diran's photos to draw attention to ethnic conflict in Myanmar. In Security Council resolution number A-SC-01-01 the United Nations, \\"Strongly suggests that the importance and heritage of various tribe groups of Myanmar are promoted through measures such as ... inviting visitors to the exhibition \\"The Vanishing Tribes of Burma\\", on permanent display at Yangon's National Museum showcasing over 70 photographs by Richard K.

Owned by Seven Mountains Media, it broadcasts a contemporary hit radio format simulcast from sister station WPQP. History The roots of WQQP can be traced back to the early 1980s, when the 95.9 MHz channel was first assigned to Brookville, Pennsylvania; operating then as WMKX, a mostly automated station that played adult contemporary music. In the mid-90s, Renda Broadcasting Corporation, which owned competitors WECZ and WPXZ in Punxsutawney, applied to put a new 25,000 watt station on the air in Brookville at 103.3 MHz. For that station, WKQL, to go on the air, several FM channel shuffles would have to take place. This affected the operation of WMKX, which under the plan, would move to 105.5 MHz from 95.9. Not long after the changes took place in 2000, the FCC opened a window for a series of low- power FM license applications by non-profit groups or organizations. A local church applied for the 95.9 frequency while it was still fairly fresh in local listeners' minds, and began to broadcast a Contemporary Christian music format under the call letters WWJL and the moniker \\"Where Jesus Lives\\". WWJL continued to operate until May 31, 2007, after it was learned that an FCC license renewal application had not been completed correctly. First Media, which owned stations WOWQ, WCED, and WQYX, immediately filed an application to move the channel from Brookville to Sykesville and increase its power back to its original Class A status it had originally during the early years of WMKX. The station as it is today, WQQP, signed on the air May 5, 2009 as WZDB. To help extend its signal in the east, First Media put a second FM station, WZDD, on the air in Strattanville to be used as a simulcast outlet of WZDB. In October 2016, First Media reached a deal to sell WZDB, WCPA, WOWQ, WQYX, and WZDD to Seven Mountains Media for $4.5 million. The company had also previously bought First Media's State College, Pennsylvania stations. On May 30, 2017, WZDB rebranded as \\"Clear Rock 95.9\\", while former simulcaster WZDD (now WKFT) 101.3 changed formats to country, simulcasting WOWQ (now WIFT) 102.1 in Du Bois. On March 19, 2018, the station switched to becoming a simulcast of WPQP Pop 93.1. The station changed its call sign to WQQP on March 23, 2018.

Activities After the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, at the age of nearly 40, he went there to fight as an Islamic jihad volunteer, along with many other men from the Mideast, who became known as the \\"Afghan Arabs.\\" During the 1980s, the United States provided some support to the mujahideen resistance to the Soviet Union, primarily through the CIA. Hamid became known by his kunya as Abu Walid al-Masri. At the beginning of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, he met Jalaluddin Haqqani in 1979 and later worked with him from 1980 until 1992. In 1986 he met Ayman al-Zawahiri in Peshawar. In 1988 he met Osama bin Laden and remained friends with him until his 2011 death. In 1993, he went to Khost where he lived and training mujahideen fighters. During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, al Masri also worked as a journalist for the Arabic-language Al Ettihad news. He reportedly taught as a senior advisor at the Al Farouq training camp for a time in the mid 1990s.Farrall, Leah (7 December 2009). \\"Hotline to the jihad\\", The Australian. This was during the period when ethnic groups and warlords competed for power in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. By 1996, the Taliban emerged in control of much of the country. Al-Masri has been described as a leader or advisor to al-Qaeda, based in Afghanistan by then and associated with the Farouq camp, although he has disclaimed this. In 1996, he traveled to Khartoum, Sudan and lived there with bin Laden for a few months before they returned to Jalalabad in Afghanistan. In 1997, he was among the first to pledge allegiance to Mullah Omar as Amir al-Mu'minin. From 1998-2001, during the latter years of the Taliban's rule in Afghanistan, al Masri served as the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Kandahar, Afghanistan. After the attacks of September 11 in the United States, Afghanistan was attacked by American-led forces, including the Afghan Northern Alliance, during Operation Enduring Freedom beginning in the fall of 2001. Hamid left the Afghan city of Herat and crossed over into Iran. He was taken into custody by police, and sentenced to house arrest. He spent much of the next decade in this detention. On December 31, 2010, Hamid posted a series of letters online, introducing them as \\"five articles, full of frankness and ardor, sent to me by one of the brothers in jihad, an old comrade in arms from Afghanistan.\\" These are thought to have been written by the al Qaeda commander Saif al-Adel. The letters discuss the current jihad in Afghanistan, contain constructive criticisms of the Mujahideen and Islamic Scholars and argue that the Jihadist movement needs to acknowledge and learn from its mistakes.

Other common names include Galilaea tilapia, Galilean comb, Galilee St. Peter's fish, and St. Peter's fish.Sarotherodon galilaeus galilaeus at Israquarium (To differentiate from other Israeli species of \\"St. Peter's fish\\" see below). This is a relatively large cichlid at up to in total length and about in weight. It is very important to local fisheries and the species is also aquacultured. In addition to the nominate subspecies, four subspecies were recognized in the past, but today the species is considered monotypic. It is a bi-parental mouthbrooder. The mating strategies can vary. Both uni-parent and bi-parent mouthbrooding is used, and monogamous or polygamous behaviour.Mate choice in the galilee St. Peter's fish, Sarotherodon galilaeus - inist.fr Distribution and habitat This widespread species is found in lakes, rivers and other fresh or brackish habitats in northern and central Africa (including Saharan oases), ranging as far south as the Guinea region, the Congo River Basin, Lake Albert and Lake Turkana. Outside Africa it is found in Syria, Jordan and Israel. It is one of the very few cichlids that is found in Africa north of the Sahara and in Asia. The typical temperature range is , but it has been recorded from waters as cold as . Behavior Mating  Mating is usually monogamous for the mango tilapia. The male and female will create a depression in the substrate, in which the female will lay her eggs. Afterwards, the male will glide over the depression and fertilize the eggs. Mouth brooding is a tactic which, either male or female or both male and female, protects and carries the eggs in their mouth for a time period of about two weeks. However, pair bonding ends after mouth brooding begins.Davies, N. B., J. R. Krebs, and Stuart A. West. \\"Parental Care and Family Conflicts.\\" An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. 4th ed. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. 223-53. Print. =Male mate choice= An experiment studying mate choice in the mango tilapia shows results of the correlation between operational sex ratio, characteristics of the body and pairing. In this study, the fish were exposed to different OSR's (more males, more females, or an equal ratio). Pair bonding was formed quicker between larger fish, and there was a long delay in pairing for the most abundant sex in the OSR. In addition, this study showed that mango tilapia that mate within a similar size group have greater reproductive success.Ros, Albert F.H., Ilja Zeilstra, and Rui F. Oliveira. Behaviour 140.8/9 (2003): 1173-188. Web. =Male mating style flexibility and parental care= There is flexibility for male mango tilapia in their mating styles. During spawning, males can adapt the mating style of territoriality or non territoriality. Also, males can adapt other mating styles, like brooding participating or non participating in egg brooding and pairing or not pair bonding with the selected female. In addition to the multiple mating styles, the males show that they are able to select alternate reproductive styles (ARS), which are combinations of the mating styles that are mentioned above. Territoriality males were the most dominant group (which deserted the female after mating), but male reproductive behavior changes between different reproductive cycles. These mating styles are also important factors in parental care. There are many levels of parental care in mango tilapia: uniparental and biparental parental care (male, female or both parents can all exist in one population).Fishelson, Lev, and Francesco Hilzerman. \\"Flexibility in Reproductive Styles of Male St. Peter‚Äôs Tilapia, Sarotherodon Galilaeus (Cichlidae).\\" Environmental Biology of Fishes 63 (2002): 173-82. Print. For the mango tilapia, parental care is important for the survival of the offspring. Parents who shared the job of incubation had double the reproductive success of other parents who did the job alone. Rather, for uniparental parental care, the parent's reproductive success for each brood was 20% higher. In terms of the relationship between caring strategies and clutch size, either parent is equally capable of caring for its offspring (both capable of taking care of the same number of eggs and fry). Levels of parental care in mango tilapia depend on the costs and benefits of staying versus departing. Some costs of both males and females were the growth and prolonged time until the next time they reproduce. In addition, parental care decreased a female's future ability to reproduce (fecundity). This is plausible since a body weight increase increases fecundity. Female mango tilapia have high parental care costs, which can be thought to be separated in two parts: egg production cost and parental care cost. In experiments studying parents deserting their children, deserting was more frequent in males and females when there were higher parental care costs and males deserting was more frequent when there was a reduced benefits from parental care.Balshine- Earn, Sigal. \\"The Benefits of Uniparental versus Biparental Mouth Brooding in Galilee St. Peter‚Äôs Fish.\\" Journal of Fish Biology 50 (1997): 371-81.

The organisation was founded in Wiesbaden on 18 April 2009, when the first board of directors was elected.http://wiki.junge- piraten.de/index.php/Gr%C3%BCndung Then-15-year-old Carmelito Bauer was the first elected chairperson. Since then the board is elected yearly by the present members on their federal meeting. At the first federal meeting of members in 2009 the construction of the board of directors was changed. Since then it has included seven board members, the chairperson and its deputy, the secretary general, the treasurer as well as three assessors. The structure of the board has again been significantly altered at the regular general assembly in March 2014. It is now divided into the administrative council, consisting of the treasurer and secretary general, and two or more spokespersons. The spokespersons' explicit purpose is to represent the organisation politically. At the same general assembly, a 50% quota of females in the spokespersons' council has been decided upon. The decision remains controversial within the Young Pirates. Regional organisations exist in Lower Saxony, North Rhine- Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Thuringia, Saxony and Berlin. No membership to the mother party is necessary. There exists no minimum age for a membership, but an age limit of 28 years (membership ends with the 28th birthday). This limit does not apply to honorary members.
