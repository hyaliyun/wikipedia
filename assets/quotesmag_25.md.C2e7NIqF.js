The SSCP, a student- run, donation-funded organization, has been building and racing solar-powered vehicles since 1986. It has competed and placed at The World Solar Challenge, the Global Green Challenge, and American Solar Challenge. The Stanford Solar Car Project has historically prided itself on being a completely student-run project. There is no faculty involvement at a managerial or technical level; faculty involvement is limited to advocacy and fundraising. The project is open to Stanford students in all fields of study and seeks to educate groups on and off campus about applied engineering and renewable energy. The project works at the Volkswagen Automotive Innovation Lab, a building shared with the Stanford DARPA Grand Challenge team, the Dynamic Design Lab, and other automotive research groups. However, work on the car continues at all times during the week, especially in the weeks and months leading up to a race. Past cars The Stanford Solar Car Project has a long history of designing and racing innovative solar-powered race cars. Past cars include SUnSUrfer, SUnBurner, AfterBurner, AfterBurner II, Third Degree Burner, BackBurner (an alumni project), Back 2 Back Burner, Solstice, Equinox, Apogee, Xenith, Luminos, and Arctan. Apogee The team's ninth car, Apogee, placed 4th in its class and 10th overall at the 2009 Global Green Challenge in Australia, 4th overall in the 2010 American Solar Challenge, and 10th in its class at the World Solar Challenge 2009. Xenith Xenith during a test drive in the San Joaquin Valley Xenith, the team's tenth car, was unveiled on August 11, 2011 and placed 11th at the World Solar Challenge 2011. Xenith is a 375-pound vehicle that is powered entirely by the sun. Xenith features a three-wheel steering system, glass encapsulated solar panels, and a high-efficiency electric motor. It has a 4-inch thin chassis made of carbon fiber composites, titanium, and aluminum. The vehicle's two front wheels are controlled by a normal rack and pinion steering wheel, and the rear wheel is controlled by a linear actuator.http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/august/xenith-solar- car-081011.html The vehicle can travel at 55-60 mph under sun power alone, and it can reach higher speeds when using the reserve battery pack. The vehicle is the first solar-powered car to use flexible glass for panel encapsulation. The ultra-high-efficiency silicon panels use prototype glass from Corning and cells from SunPower. The team used a custom 98% efficient motor for the vehicle. An in house developed software program allows the team to model sunlight and shadows during the race in order to plan race strategies. Luminos Luminos placed 4th at the 2013 World Solar Challenge. Luminos, the team's eleventh car, was unveiled in the summer of 2013. It placed 4th in the Challenger class of the World Solar Challenge 2013, the best finish by an undergraduate team. Luminos was the team's most successful vehicle to date, proving sturdy and reliable with 10,000 safe miles successfully logged. Arctan Arctan, the team's twelfth car, was unveiled in July 2015. It placed 6th in the Challenger class at the 2015 World Solar Challenge. Arctan was built with the intention of being a slightly more aggressive improvement on the 2013 car, with a more aerodynamically efficient design without compromising on robustness. Arctan logged even more safe test drive miles than Luminos before it and finished the race 50% closer to the top team than in 2013. Sundae Sundae, the team's thirteenth car, was unveiled in July 2017. It placed 9th in the Challenger class at the 2017 World Solar Challenge out of 12 teams. The car was significantly smaller, being built in accordance with the new rules for the 2017 World Solar Challenge, which only allowed for four square meters of silicon solar cells. There were more aggressive aerobody optimizations applied compared to what had been done in the past.

It was built in 1856 by hardware manufacturer Enoch Robinson, and is considered an offshoot of the octagon house-style popularized by phrenologist Orson Fowler. The exterior of the Round House features two flush stories, with a third stepped back behind a series of battlements and embrasures. Inside, the three-story structure contains a central rotunda topped with a glass skylight, with interconnected rooms branching off on each level. There are four rooms on the first floor, six rooms on the second floor and another four rooms on the third floor. History In the early 2000s, the privately owned house was unoccupied, its windows removed to the interior of the house, and the openings were covered with plywood. Its ornamentation was largely removed, and all of the ceilings were severely damaged from water. In a 1986 restoration program, students from Boston's North Bennet Street School did a small amount of work renovating the exterior, but the project fell apart and the house remained in a state of decay. Historic Massachusetts (now Preservation MASS) placed the building on its list of Endangered Historic Resources for 1997. The Round House in 2008 as renovation begins The Round House in 2015 seen facing east towards Boston Postcard from 1913 showing Robinson Round House By April, 2007, the Round House had been purchased by a local man who is also president of a general contracting firm.

Background Area of the fertile crescent, circa 7500 BC, with main sites. 'Ain Ghazal is one of the important sites of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period. The area of Mesopotamia proper was not yet settled by humans. The settlement at 'Ain Ghazal (\\"Spring of the Gazelle\\") first appeared in the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (MPPNB ) and is split into two phases. Phase I starts circa 10,300 BP and ends c. 9,950 BP, while phase II ends c. 9,550 BP. The 9th millennium MPPNB period in the Levant represented a major transformation in prehistoric lifeways from small bands of mobile hunter‚Äìgatherers to large settled farming and herding villages in the Mediterranean zone, the process having been initiated some 2‚Äì3 millennia earlier. In its prime era circa 7000 BC, the site extended over 10‚Äì15 hectares (25‚Äì37 ac) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). After 6500 BC, however, the population dropped sharply to about one sixth within only a few generations, probably due to environmental degradation, the 8.2 kilo-year event (K√∂hler-Rollefson 1992). Location and physical dimensions It is situated in a relatively rich environmental setting immediately adjacent to the Zarqa River (Wadi Zarqa), the longest drainage system in highland Jordan. It is located at an elevation of about 720m within the ecotone between the oak-park woodland to the west and the open steppe-desert to the east. \`Ain Ghazal started as a typical aceramic, Neolithic village of modest size. It was set on terraced ground in a valley- side, and was built with rectangular mud-brick houses that accommodated a square main room and a smaller anteroom. Walls were plastered with mud on the outside, and with lime plaster inside that was renewed every few years. Evidence recovered from the excavations suggests that much of the surrounding countryside was forested and offered the inhabitants a wide variety of economic resources. Arable land is plentiful within the site's immediate environs. These variables are atypical of many major Neolithic sites in the Near East, several of which are located in marginal environments. Yet despite its apparent richness, the area of 'Ain Ghazal is climatically and environmentally sensitive because of its proximity throughout the Holocene to the fluctuating steppe-forest border. In 'Ain Ghazal, the early Pottery Neolithic period starts c. 6,400 BC, and continues to 5,000 BC.The Neolithic Period 10.200-5000 BC (Jordan) doa.gov.jo - Jordan Department Of Antiquities Economy 'Ain Ghazal Statues: closeup of one of the bicephalous statues, c.7000 BC. As an early farming community, the \`Ain Ghazal people cultivated cereals (barley and ancient species of wheat), legumes (peas, beans and lentils) and chickpeas in fields above the village, and herded domesticated goats. In addition they hunted wild animals ‚Äì deer, gazelle, equids, pigs and smaller mammals such as fox or hare. The estimated population of the MPPNB site from ‚ÄòAin Ghazal is of 259-1349 individuals with an area of 3.01-4.7 ha. It is argued that at its founding at the commencement of the MPPNB ‚ÄòAin Ghazal was likely about 2 ha in size and grew to 5 ha by the end of the MPPNB. At this point in time their estimated population was 600-750 people or 125-150 people per hectare. The diet of the occupants of PPNB 'Ain Ghazal was remarkably varied. Domesticated plants included wheat and barley species, but legumes (primarily lentils and peas) appear to have been preferred cultigens. A wide suite of wild plants also were consumed. The determination of domesticated animals, sensu stricto, is a topic of much debate. At PPNB 'Ain Ghazal goats were a major species, and they were used in a domestic sense, although they may not have been morphologically domestic. Many of the phalanges recovered exhibit pathologies that are suggestive of tethering. An impressive range of wild animal species also were consumed at the site. Over 50 taxa have been identified, including gazelle, Bos, Sus sp., Lepus, and Vulpes. ‚ÄòAin Ghazal was in an area that was suitable for agriculture and then grew as a result of the same dynamic. Archaeologists think that throughout the mid east much of the land was exhausted after some 700 years of planting and so became unsuitable for agriculture. The people from those small villages abandoned their unproductive fields and migrated, with their domestic animals, to places with better ecological conditions, like ‚ÄòAin Ghazal that could support larger populations. As opposed to other sites as new people migrated to ‚ÄòAin Ghazal, probably with few possessions and possibly starving, class distinctions began to develop. The influx of new people placed stresses on the social fabric ‚Äì new diseases, more people to feed from what was planted and more animals that needed grazing. A profile picture of the physical site at 'Ain Ghazal There are evidences of mining activities as part of a production sequence conducted by craftspersons at the site of ‚ÄòAin Ghazal, these potential part-time specialists in some way controlled access to such raw materials. Genetics One of the \`Ain Ghazal Statues. Y-DNA haplogroup E1b1b1b2 has been found in 75% of the 'Ain Ghazal population, along with 60% of PPNB populations (and is present in all three stages of PPNB) and in most Natufians. T1a (T-M70) is found among the later Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (MPPNB) inhabitants from 'Ain Ghazal, but was not found among the early and middle MPPNB populations. . It is thought, therefore, that the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B population is mostly composed of two different populations: members of early Natufian civilisation and a population resulting from immigration from the north, i.e. north-eastern Anatolia.  Culture  Statues In the earlier levels at ‚ÄòAin Ghazal there are small ceramic figures that seem to have been used as personal or familial ritual figures. There are figurines of both animals and people. The animal figures are of horned animals and the front part of the animal is the most clearly modeled. They all give the impression of dynamic force. Some of the animal figures have been stabbed in their vital parts; these figures have then been buried in the houses. Other figurines were burned and then discarded with the rest of the fire. They built ritual buildings and used large figurines or statues. The actual building of them is also a way for an elite group to demonstrate and underline its authority over those who owe the community or the elite labor as service and to bond laborers together as part of a new community. In addition to the monumental statues, small clay and stone tokens, some incised with geometric or naturalistic shapes, were found at ‚ÄòAin Ghazal. The 195 figurines (40 human and 155 animal) recovered were from MPPNB contexts; 81% of the figurines have been found to belong to the MPPNB while only 19% belonging to the LPPNB and PPNC. The vast majority of figurines are of cattle, a species that makes up only 8% of the overall number of identified specimens (NISP) count. The importance of hunted cattle to the domestic ritual sphere of ‚ÄòAin Ghazal is telling. It was seemingly of importance for individual households to have members who participated both the hunting of cattle ‚Äì likely a group activity ‚Äì and the subsequent feasting on the remains. \`Ain Ghazal is renowned for a set of anthropomorphic statues found buried in pits in the vicinity of some special buildings that may have had ritual functions. These statues are half-size human figures modeled in white plaster around a core of bundled twigs. The figures have painted clothes, hair, and in some cases, ornamental tattoos or body paint. The eyes are created using cowrie shells with a bitumen pupil and dioptase highlighting. In all, 32 of those plaster figures were found in two caches, 15 of them full figures, 15 busts, and 2 fragmentary heads. Three of the busts were two-headed. Burial practices Considerable evidence for mortuary practices during the PPNB period have been described in recent years. Post-mortem skull removal, commonly restricted to the cranium, but on occasion including the mandible, and apparently following preliminary primary interments of the complete corpse. Such treatment has commonly been interpreted as representing rituals connected with veneration of the dead or some form of \\"ancestor worship\\". There is evidence of class in the way the dead are treated. Some people are buried in the floors of their houses as they would be at other Neolithic sites. After the flesh had wasted away some of the skulls were disinterred and decorated. This was either a form of respect or so that they could impart their power to the house and the people in it. However, unlike other Neolithic sites, some people were thrown on trash heaps and their bodies remain intact. Scholars have estimated that a third of adult burials were found in trash pits with their heads intact. They may have seen the newcomers as a lower class. \`Ain Ghazal people buried some of their dead beneath the floors of their houses, others outside in the surrounding terrain. Of those buried inside, often the head was later retrieved and the skull buried in a separate shallow pit beneath the house floor. Also, many human remains have been found in what appear to be garbage pits where domestic waste was disposed, indicating that not every deceased was ceremoniously put to rest. Why only a small, selected portion of the inhabitants were properly buried and the majority simply disposed of remains unresolved. Burials seem to have taken place approximately every 15‚Äì20 years, indicating a rate of one burial per generation, though gender and age were not constant in this practice. Excavation and conservation The site is located at the boundary between Amman's Tariq and Basman districts, next to, and named for, the Ayn Ghazal Interchange connecting Al-Shahid Street and Army Street (Ayn Ghazal is the name of a minor village just north of the road, now within Tariq district). The site was discovered in 1974 by developers who were building Army St, the road connecting Amman and Zarqa. Excavation began in 1982, however by this time, around 600 meters (1,970 ft) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage urban expansion brought, what remained of \`Ain Ghazal provided a wealth of information and continued to do so until 1989. One of the more notable archaeological finds during these first excavations came to light in 1983. While examining a cross section of earth in a path carved out by a bulldozer, archaeologists came across the edge of a large pit 2.5 meters (8 ft) under the surface containing plaster statues. Another set of excavations, under the direction of Gary O. Rollefson and Zeidan Kafafi took place in the early 1990s. The site was included in the 2004 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund to call attention to the threat of encroaching urban development.

It is made up of members from the global business community and works with governments to raise awareness about the travel and tourism industry. It is known for being the only forum to represent the private sector in all parts of the industry worldwide. Its activities include research on the economic and social impact of the industry and its organisation of global and regional summits focused on issues and developments relevant to the industry. History The WTTC began in the 1980s with a group of business executives led by former American Express CEO James D. Robinson III. The group was formed to discuss the travel and tourism industry and the need for more data relating to the importance of what some believed was a non-essential industry. Discussions led to the first meeting of the WTTC in Paris, France in 1989. The first meeting included a speech by former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who suggested that the travel and tourism industry was not widely recognized due to its not having any organisation or structure. The WTTC was officially established in 1990. The first annual general meeting took place in Washington, DC, in 1991, at which time the council was composed of 32 members. These initial members agreed on the need for a common effort to promote awareness of the economic contribution made by the travel and tourism industry. The founding members provided investment and support to produce economic data that could demonstrate the importance of the industry. They shared an interest in ensuring greater interest from governments and policy- makers in order to ensure the success of travel and tourism. Robert H Burns took over as chairman of the WTTC in 1993, at which time there were 68 members. It began releasing tourism impact information around the same time, working with Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates to develop the data. The WTTC formed a group known as the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) to compile and release the data. The TSA was recognized by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 1999. During the 1990s, the WTTC expanded the activities of the council to include education and training, air transport liberalisation, taxation, and sustainable development. The new activities led to the creation of the World Travel & Tourism Human Resources Centre in Vancouver and the World Travel & Tourism Taxation Policy Centre in the United States. In 1997, the WTTC organised the first Global Travel and Tourism Summit in Vilamoura, Portugal. Membership in the organisation reached 100 the same year. Two more summits were held in Vilamoura in 2000 and 2003, which were followed with annual meetings held in various locations. In 2013, the WTTC created the Hotel Carbon Measurement Initiative in partnership with the International Tourism Partnership.  Organisation and membership  The WTTC is headquartered in London. The staff are led by the president and CEO of WTTC. Seven directors head the different sections of the organisation. The WTTC members are the chief executives, presidents, or chairs of companies from different sectors and regions within the travel and tourism industry. The WTTC has two membership types: global members and regional members. It also has a category for companies that provide services to the industry, referred to as Industry Partnership.WTTC.

Research  The WTTC performs and publishes research in conjunction with Oxford Economics on the economic and social impact of the travel and tourism industry. The foundation of the WTTC's research activity is a set of annually produced Travel & Tourism Economic Impact Reports. These include a global report as well as 24 regional and 184 country reports. The reports calculate the economic impact of the industry including the direct and total GDP impacts, direct and indirect employment, investment, and exports. Using models based on Tourism Satellite Accounting, the council reports one year and ten year forecasts for these impacts.WTTC. 'Economic Impact Research'. http://wttc.org/research/economic-impact-research/ (Accessed 21.02.2014) This research is used by major publications including Forbes and Bloomberg News. It also supplies country indicators for the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, a report published by the World Economic Forum that ranks selected nations according to the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index.  Summits  David Scowsill speaking at the 2013 Global Summit, Abu Dhabi The WTTC organises a global summit each year, usually held in April, with a regional summit held sometime in the third quarter, with up to 1,000 individuals attending each year. Summit attendance is by invitation only.  Awards  International jury of experts mainly from WTTC found in 1993, the annual World Travel Awards. In 2004 the WTTC took over the Tourism for Tomorrow Awards. These awards were initially created by the Federation of Tour Operators in 1989 and taken over by British Airways in 1992. The Tourism for Tomorrow Awards are awarded in several categories to encourage and acknowledge developments in sustainable tourism.

Junta oppression remembered . Reuters. The protests began as a student movement and were organised largely by university students at the Rangoon Arts and Sciences University and the Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT). Since 1962, the Burma Socialist Programme Party had ruled the country as a totalitarian one-party state, headed by General Ne Win. Under the government agenda, called the Burmese Way to Socialism, which involved economic isolation and strengthening the military, Burma became one of the world's most impoverished countries.Burma Watcher (1989)*Tallentire, Mark (28 September 2007). The Burma road to ruin . The Guardian.Woodsome, Kate. (7 October 2007). 'Burmese Way to Socialism' Drives Country into Poverty. Voice of America. Many firms in the formal sector of the economy were nationalised, and the government combined Soviet-style central planning with Buddhist and traditional beliefs. The 8888 uprising was started by students in Yangon (Rangoon) on 8 August 1988. Student protests spread throughout the country.Ferrara (2003), pp. 313 Hundreds of thousands of monks, children, university students, housewives, doctors and common people protested against the government.Aung-Thwin, Maureen. (1989). Burmese Days . Foreign Affairs. The uprising ended on 18 September after a bloody military coup by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Thousands of deaths have been attributed to the military during this uprising,Fogarty, Phillipa (7 August 2008). Was Burma's 1988 uprising worth it? . BBC News.Wintle (2007) while authorities in Myanmar put the figure at around 350 people killed.Ottawa Citizen. 24 September 1988. pg. A.16Associated Press. Chicago Tribune. 26 September 1988. During the crisis, Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a national icon. When the military junta arranged an election in 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy, won 81% of the seats in the government (392 out of 492).Wintle, p. 338. However, the military junta refused to recognise the results and continued ruling the country as the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Aung San Suu Kyi was also put under house arrest. The State Law and Order Restoration Council would be a cosmetic change from the Burma Socialist Programme Party.Steinberg (2002) Suu Kyi's house arrest was lifted in 2010, when worldwide attention for her peaked again during the making of the biographical film The Lady. Background Economic problems Before the crisis, Burma had been ruled by the repressive and isolated regime of General Ne Win since 1962. The country had a national debt of $3.5 billion and currency reserves of between $20 million and $35 million, with debt service ratios standing at half of the national budget.Lintner (1989), pp. 94‚Äì95. In November 1985, students gathered and boycotted the government's decision to withdraw Burmese local currency notes. Economic problems coupled with counter-insurgency required continuous involvement in the international market.Boudreau (2004), pp. 192 On 5 September 1987, Ne Win announced the withdrawal of the newly replaced currency notes, 100, 75, 35 and 25 kyats, leaving only 45 and 90 kyat notes, apparently because only the latter two are numbers divisible by 9, considered lucky by Ne Win.Tucker (2001), pp. 228 Students were particularly angry at the government's decision as savings for tuition fees were wiped out instantly.Fong (2008), pp. 146 Students from the Rangoon Institute of Technology (RIT) ran riot through Rangoon, smashing windows and traffic lights down Insein Road.Lwin (1992) Universities in Rangoon closed and sent students home. Meanwhile, larger protests in Mandalay involved monks and workers, with some burning government buildings and state businesses.Boudreau (2004), pp. 193 Burmese state media reported little on the protests, but information quickly spread through the students. With the re-opening of schools in late October 1987, underground groups in Rangoon and Mandalay produced dissident leaflets which culminated in bombs exploding in November. Police later received threatening letters from underground groups, who organised small protests around the university campus.Lintner (1989), pp. 95‚Äì97. After securing Least Developed Country status from the United Nations Economic and Social Council in December 1987, government policy requiring farmers to sell produce below market rates to create greater revenue for the government sparked several, violent rural protests.Yitri (1989) The protests were fanned by public letters to Ne Win by former second in command General Brigadier Aung Gyi from July 1987, reminding him of the 1967 rice riots and condemning lack of economic reform, describing Burma as \\"almost a joke\\" compared to other Southeast Asian nations. He was later arrested.Yawnghwe (1995), pp. 171 Early democracy protests On 12 March 1988, students from the RIT were arguing with out-of-school youths inside the Sanda Win tea shop about music playing on a sound system. A drunken youth would not return a tape that the RIT students favoured.Fong (2008), pp. 147 A brawl followed in which one youth, who was the son of a BSPP official, was arrested and later released for injuring a student. Students protested at a local police department where 500 riot police were mobilised and in the ensuing clash, one student, Phone Maw, was shot and killed. The incident angered pro-democracy groups and the next day more students rallied at the RIT and spread to other campuses.Smith (1999), pp. 1‚Äì14 The students, who had never protested before, increasingly saw themselves as activists. There was growing resentment towards military rule and there were no channels to address grievances, further exacerbated by police brutality, economic mismanagement and corruption within the government. By mid-March, several protests had occurred and there was open dissent in the army. Various demonstrations were broken up by using tear gas canisters to disperse crowds. On 16 March, students demanding an end to one party rule marched towards soldiers at Inya Lake when riot police stormed from the rear, clubbing several students to death and raping others.Fong (2008) pp. 147‚Äì148. Several students recalled the police shouting, \\"Don't let them escape\\" and \\"Kill them!\\".Fink (2001), pp. 51 Ne Win resigns Following the latest protests, authorities announced the closure of universities for several months.Fong (2008), pp. 148 By June 1988, large demonstrations of students and sympathisers were a daily sight. Many students, sympathisers and riot police died throughout the month as the protests spread throughout Burma from Rangoon. Large scale protests were reported in Pegu, Mandalay, Tavoy, Toungoo, Sittwe, Pakokku, Mergui, Minbu and Myitkyina.Smith (1999) Demonstrators in larger numbers demanded multi-party democracy, which marked Ne Win's resignation on 23 July 1988. In a valedictory address given that day, Win affirmed that \\"When the army shoots, it shoots to kill.\\" He also promised a multi-party system, but he had appointed the largely disliked Sein Lwin, known as the \\"Butcher of Rangoon\\"Fong (2008). In 1962, Lwin had ordered troops to fire on student protestors, killing dozens, and ordered the Union Building at Rangoon University to be blown up. to head a new government. Main protests 1‚Äì7 August Flag of the Burma Socialist Programme Party, the sole legal political party that ruled the country from 1962 to 1988. Protests reached their peak in August 1988. Students planned for a nationwide demonstration on 8 August 1988, an auspicious date based on numerological significance.Fong (2008), pp. 149 News of the protest reached rural areas and four days prior to the national protest, students across the country were denouncing Sein Lwin's regime and Tatmadaw troops were being mobilised. Pamphlets and posters appeared on the streets of Rangoon bearing the fighting peacock insignia of the All-Burma Students Union.Boudreau (2004), pp. 202 Neighbourhood and strike committees were openly formed on the advice of underground activists, many of which were influenced by similar underground movements by workers and monks in the 1980s. Between 2 and 10 August, co- ordinated protests were occurring in most Burmese towns.Lintner (1989), pp. 126 The flag depicting a fighting peacock became a symbol of the protests on the streets of Burma. In the first few days of the Rangoon protests, activists contacted lawyers and monksBoudreau (2004) Two groups considered to have large underground and internal support networks in Mandalay to encourage them to take part in the protests.Boudreau (2004), pp. 203 The students were quickly joined by Burmese citizens from all walks of life, including government workers, Buddhist monks, air force and navy personnel, customs officers, teachers and hospital staff. The demonstrations in the streets of Rangoon became a focal point for other demonstrations, which spread to other states' capitals.Ghosh (2001) 10,000 protesters alone demonstrated outside the Sule Pagoda in Rangoon, where demonstrators burned and buried effigies of Ne Win and Sein Lwin in coffins decorated with demonetised bank notes. Further protests took place around the country at stadiums and hospitals.Mydans, Seth. (12 August 1988). Uprising in Burma: The Old Regime Under Siege. The New York Times. Monks at the Sule Pagoda reported that the Buddha's image had changed shape, with an image in the sky standing on its head. On 3 August, the authorities imposed martial law from 8 pm to 4 am and a ban on gatherings of more than five people. 8‚Äì12 August A general strike, as planned, began on 8 August 1988. Mass demonstrations were held across Burma as ethnic minorities, Buddhists, Muslims, students, workers and the young and old all demonstrated. The first procession circled Rangoon, stopping for people to speak. A stage was also erected. Demonstrators from the Rangoon neighbourhoods converged in downtown Rangoon. Only one casualty was reported at this point as a frightened traffic policeman fired into the crowd and fled. (Such marches would occur daily until 19 September.) Protesters kissed the shoes of soldiers, in an attempt to persuade them to join the civilian protest, whilst some encircled military officers to protect them from the crowd and earlier violenceWilliams Jr., Nick. (10 August 1988). \\"36 Killed in Burma Protests of Military Rule.\\" Los Angeles Times.Boudreau (2004), pp. 205 Over the next four days these demonstrations continued; the government was surprised by the scale of the protests and stated that it promised to heed the demands of the protesters \\"insofar as possible\\". Lwin had brought in more soldiers from insurgent areas to deal with the protesters.Callahan (2001) In Mandalay Division, a more organised strike committee was headed by lawyers and discussion focused on multi-party democracy and human rights. Many participants in the protests arrived from nearby towns and villages.Boudreau (2004), pp. 204 Farmers who were particularly angry with the government's economic policies joined the protests in Rangoon. In one village, 2,000 of the 5,000 people also went on strike. A short while later, the authorities opened fire on the protesters. Ne Win ordered that \\"guns were not to shoot upwards,\\" meaning that he was ordering the military to shoot directly at the demonstrators. Protesters responded by throwing Molotov cocktails, swords, knives, rocks, poisoned darts and bicycle spokes. In one incident, protesters burned a police station and tore apart four fleeing officers. On 10 August, soldiers fired into Rangoon General Hospital, killing nurses and doctors tending to the wounded.Burma Watcher (1989), pp. 179. State-run Radio Rangoon reported that 1,451 \\"looters and disturbance makers\\" had been arrested. Estimates of the number of casualties surrounding the 8-8-88 demonstrations range from hundreds to 10,000; military authorities put the figures at about 95 people killed and 240 wounded.The Vancouver Sun 17 August 1988. pg. A.5 13‚Äì31 August Lwin's sudden and unexplained resignation on 12 August left many protestors confused and jubilant. Security forces exercised greater caution with demonstrators, particularly in neighbourhoods that were entirely controlled by demonstrators and committees. On 19 August, under pressure to form a civilian government, Ne Win's biographer, Dr. Maung Maung was appointed as head of government.Fink (2001) Maung was a legal scholar and the only non- military individual to serve in the Burma Socialist Programme Party. The appointment of Maung briefly resulted in a subsidence of the shooting and protests. Burmese Navy personnel demonstrating Nationwide demonstrations resumed on 22 August 1988. In Mandalay, 100,000 people protested, including Buddhist monks and 50,000 demonstrated in Sittwe. Large marches took places from Taunggyi and Moulmein to distant ethnic states (particularly where military campaigns had previously taken place),Fink (2001), pp. 58 where red, the symbolic colour for democracy was displayed on banners. Two days later, doctors, monks, musicians, actors, lawyers, army veterans and government office workers joined the protests.Fong (2008), pp. 150 It became difficult for committees to control the protests. During this time, demonstrators became increasingly wary of \\"suspicious looking\\" people and police and army officers. On one occasion, a local committee mistakenly beheaded a couple thought to have been carrying a bomb.Boudreau (2004), pp. 208 Incidents like these were not as common in Mandalay, where protests were more peaceful as they were organised by monks and lawyers. On 26 August, Aung San Suu Kyi, who had watched the demonstrations from her mother's bedside,Clements (1992) entered the political arena by addressing half a million people at Shwedagon Pagoda. It was at this point that she became a symbol for the struggle in Burma, particularly in the eyes of the Western world.Smith (1999), pp. 9 Kyi, as the daughter of Aung San, who led the independence movement, appeared ready to lead the movement for democracy.Silverstein (1996) Kyi urged the crowd not to turn on the army but find peace through non-violent means.Fink (2001), pp. 60 At this point in time for many in Burma, the uprising was seen as similar to that of the People Power Revolution in the Philippines in 1986. Around this time, former Prime Minister U Nu and retired Brigadier General Aung Gyi also re-emerged onto the political scene in what was described as a \\"democracy summer\\" when many former democracy leaders returned. Despite the gains made by the democracy movement, Ne Win remained in the background. September During the September congress of 1988, 90% of party delegates (968 out of 1080) voted for a multi-party system of government. The BSPP announced they would be organising an election, but the opposition parties called for their immediate resignation from government, allowing an interim government to organise elections. After the BSPP rejected both demands, protesters again took to the streets on 12 September 1988. Nu promised elections within a month, proclaiming a provisional government. Meanwhile, the police and army began fraternising with the protesters.Tucker (2001), pp. 229. The movement had reached an impasse relying on three hopes: daily demonstrations to force the regime to respond to their demands, encouraging soldiers to defect and appealing to an international audience in the hope that United Nations or United States troops would arrive.Boudreau (2004), pp. 212. Some Tatmadaw did defect, but only in limited numbers, mostly from the Navy.Callahan (1999), pp. 1. Stephen Solarz who had experienced the recent democracy protests in the Philippines and South Korea arrived in Burma in September encouraging the regime to reform, which echoed the policy of the United States government towards Burma.United States State Department, 1988 By mid-September, the protests grew more violent and lawless, with soldiers deliberately leading protesters into skirmishes that the army easily won.Boudreau (2004), pp. 210. Protesters demanded more immediate change, and distrusted steps for incremental reform.Maung (1999) SLORC \\"coup\\" and crackdown On 18 September 1988, the military retook power in the country. General Saw Maung repealed the 1974 constitution and established the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), \\"imposing more Draconian measures than Ne Win had imposed.\\"Delang (2000) After Maung had imposed martial law, the protests were violently broken up. The government announced on the state-run radio that the military had assumed power in the people's interest, \\"in order to bring a timely halt to the deteriorating conditions on all sides all over the country.\\"Ferrara (2003), pp. 313‚Äì4. Tatmadaw troops went through cities throughout Burma, indiscriminately firing on protestors. Although an exact body count has not been determined as bodies were often cremated, it is estimated that within the first week of securing power, 1,000 students, monks, and schoolchildren were killed, and another 500 were killed whilst protesting outside the United States embassy ‚Äì footage caught by a cameraman nearby who distributed the footage to the world's media.Fong (2008), pp. 151 Maung described the dead as \\"looters\\". Protestors were also pursued into the jungle and some students took up training on the country's borders with Thailand. By the end of September, there were around 3,000 estimated deaths and unknown number of injured, with 1,000 deaths in Rangoon alone.Ferrara (2003), pp. 314. At this point in time, Aung San Suu Kyi appealed for help. On 21 September, the government had regained control of the country, with the movement effectively collapsing in October. By the end of 1988, it was that 10,000 people ‚Äì including protesters and soldiers, had been killed. Many others were missing. Aftermath Continuous anniversary observances of the 1988 uprising take place around the world. Many in Burma believed that the regime would have collapsed had the United Nations and neighbouring countries refused recognition to the coup.Yawnghwe (1995), pp. 172. Western governments and Japan cut aid to the country. Among Burma's neighbours, India was most critical; condemning the suppression, closing borders and setting up refugee camps along its border with Burma.Europa Publications Staff (2002), pp. 872 By 1989, 6,000 NLD supporters were detained in custody and those who fled to the ethnic border areas, such as Kawthoolei, formed groups with those who wished for greater self-determination.Fong (2008), pp.152. It was estimated 10,000 had fled to mountains controlled by ethnic insurgents such as the Karen National Liberation Army, and many later trained to become soldiers.Smith (1999), pp. 371.Smith (1999), pp. 17. After the uprising, the SLORC embarked on \\"clumsy propaganda\\" towards those who organised the protests.Boudreau (2004), pp. 190 Intelligence Chief Khin Nyunt, gave English-language press conferences aimed at providing an account favourable to the SLORC towards foreign diplomats and media.Lintner (1990), pp. 52 The Burmese media underwent further restriction during this period, after reporting relatively freely at the peak of the protests. In the conferences, he detailed a conspiracy of the right acting with \\"subversive foreigners\\" of plotting to overthrow the regime and a conspiracy of the left acting to overthrow the State. Despite the conferences, few believed the government's theory. While these conferences were ongoing, the SLORC was secretly negotiating with mutineers. Between 1988 and 2000, the Burmese government established 20 museums detailing the military's central role throughout Burma's history and increased its numbers from 180,000 to 400,000. Schools and universities remained closed to prevent any further uprisings. Aung San Suu Kyi, U Tin Oo and Aung Gyi initially publicly rejected the SLORC's offer to hold elections the following year, claiming that they could not be held freely under military rule.Mydans, Seth. (23 September 1988). Burma Crackdown: Army in Charge. The New York Times. Significance Today, the uprising is remembered and honoured by Burmese expatriates and citizens alike. There is also support for the movement amongst students in Thailand, which is commemorated every 8 August since.The Nation. (9 August 1997). Burmese exiles mark protest. The Nation (Thailand). On the 20th anniversary of the uprising, 48 activists in Burma were arrested for commemorating the event.*Tun, Aung Hla. (8 August 2008). Myanmar arrests \\"8-8-88\\" anniversary marchers . International Herald Tribune. The event garnered much support for the Burmese people internationally. Poems were written by students who participated in the protests. The 1995 film Beyond Rangoon is based on a true story that took place during the uprising. The uprising led to the death and imprisonment of thousands of individuals. Many of the deaths were inside the prisons, where prisoners of conscience were subjected to inhumane torture and deprived of basic provisions, such as food, water, medicine, and sanitation. From 1988 up until 2012, the military and police illegally detained and imprisoned tens of thousands of democracy leaders, as well as intellectuals, artists, students, and human rights activists. Pyone Cho, one of the leaders of the uprising, spent 20 years of his adult life in prison. Ko Ko Gyi, another leader of the uprising, spent 18 years of his life in prison. Min Ko Naing was placed in solitary confinement for nine years for his role as a leader of the uprising. Because the uprising began as a student movement, many of the individuals targeted, tortured, and killed by the police and military were high school and university students. Many of the student leaders of the uprising became lifelong activists and human rights leaders. Many of the same activists played a role 19 years later during the 2007 Saffron Revolution. The 88 Generation Students Group, named for the events of 8 August 1988, organised one of the first protests that eventually culminated in the Saffron Revolution. They were arrested, however, prior to large-scale demonstrations and given lengthy prison sentences of up to 65 years. Included in these arrests are prominent figures such as Min Ko Naing, Mya Aye, Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho, Min Zeyar, Ant Bwe Kyaw, and Nilar Thein. Though not an 88 Generation Students Group member, a solo protester Ohn Than also joined the demonstration. All of them were released in a general amnesty in 2012. They continue to work as politicians and human rights activists in Myanmar. They also campaigned for the National League for Democracy in the 2015 Elections. Pyone Cho, one of the main leaders of the 88 Generation, was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2015 Election.

Technical details  The SMPTE 292 standard is a nominally 1.5 Gbit/s interface. Two exact bitrates are defined; 1.485 Gbit/s, and 1.485/1.001 Gbit/s. The factor of 1/1.001 is provided to allow SMPTE 292 to support video formats with frame rates of 59.94 Hz, 29.97 Hz, and 23.98 Hz, in order to be upwards compatible with existing NTSC systems. The 1.485 Gbit/s version of the standard supports other frame rates in widespread use, including 60 Hz, 50 Hz, 30 Hz, 25 Hz, and 24 Hz. The standard also defines nominal bitrates of 3 Gbit/s, for 50/60 frame per second 1080P applications. This version of the interface is not used (and has not been commercially implemented); instead, either a dual-link extension of SMPTE 292M known as SMPTE 372 or a version running twice as fast known as SMPTE 424 is used for e.g. 1080p60 applications.  Electrical interface  Originally, both electrical and optical interfaces were defined by SMPTE, over concerns that an electrical interface at that bitrate would be expensive or unreliable, and that an optical interface would be necessary. Such fears have not been realized, and the optical interfaces are seldom if ever used, and are likely to be deprecated in future revisions of the standard. The cabling used for the SMPTE 292 electrical interface is coaxial cable with a nominal impedance of 75 Œ©. Data is encoded in NRZ format, and a linear feedback shift register is used to scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or ones will be present on the interface. The interface is self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of twenty ones followed by forty zeroes; this bit pattern is not legal anywhere else within the data payload. The SMPTE 292 digital interface is known to be reliable (without use of repeaters) at cable lengths of 100 m or greater.  Data format  The corresponding parallel data formats, defined by SMPTE 274, SMPTE 296, and several other standards, are 20-bit standards; thus SMPTE 292M uses a 20-bit word size. Each 20-bit word consists of two 10-bit datums, coming from two logical (and parallel) data channels, one (\\"Y\\") which encodes luminance video samples, the other (\\"C\\") which encodes chrominance information. The C channel is further time-multiplexed into two half-bandwidth channels, known as Cr (the \\"red color difference\\" channel), and Cb (the \\"blue color difference\\" channel). The nominal datarate of the Y channel is 75 Mwords/sec (1.5 Gbit/s divided by 20), and the nominal datarate of each of the two chroma channels is 37.5 Mwords/sec. Video payload (as well as ancillary data payload) may use any 10-bit word in the range 4 to 1019 (004 to 3FB in hexadecimal) inclusive; the values 0-3 and 1020-1023 (3FC - 3FF) are reserved and may not appear anywhere in the payload. These reserved words have two purposes, for synchronization packets, and for ancillary data headers. = Synchronization packets = A synchronization packet occurs immediately before the first active sample on every line, and immediately after the last active sample (and before the start of the horizontal blanking region). The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words. The first three words are always the same‚Äî0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code. As a result, there are 8 different synchronization packets possible. Synchronization packets must occur simultaneously in both the Y and C datastreams. The flags bits found in the fourth word are known as H, F, and V. The H bit indicates the start of horizontal blank; and synchronization bits immediately preceding the horizontal blanking region must have H set to one. Such packets are commonly referred to as End of Active Video, or EAV packets. Likewise, the packet appearing immediately before the start of the active video has H set to 0; this is the Start of Active Video or SAV packet. Likewise, The V bit is used to indicate the start of the vertical blanking region; an EAV packet with V=1 indicates the following line (lines are deemed to start EAV) is part of the vertical interval, an EAV packet with V=0 indicates the following line is part of the active picture. The F bit is used in interlaced and progressive segmented frame formats to indicate whether the line comes from the first or second field (or segment). In progressive scan formats, the F bit is always set to zero. Other than the fact that synchronization packets occur in parallel in two datastreams (Y and C), their behavior is virtually identical to the packet types defined in CCIR 601 and SMPTE 259, the digital interface commonly used for SDTV. = Line counter and CRC = To provide additional robustness, the four samples immediately following the EAV packets (but not the SAV packets) contain a cyclic redundancy check field, and a line count indicator. The CRC field provides a CRC of the preceding line (CRCs are computed independently for the Y and C streams), and can be used to detect bit errors in the interface. The line count field indicates the line number of the current line. = Ancillary data = Like SMPTE 259, SMPTE 292 supports the SMPTE 291 standard for ancillary data. Ancillary data is provided as a standardized transport for non-video payload within a serial digital signal; it is used for things such as embedded audio, closed captions, timecode, and other sorts of metadata. Ancillary data is indicated by a 3-word packet consisting of 0, 3FF, 3FF (the opposite of the synchronization packet header), followed by a two-word identification code, a data count word (indicating 0 - 255 words of payload), the actual payload, and a one-word checksum. Other than in their use in the header, the codes prohibited to video payload are also prohibited to ancillary data payload. = Video payload = Within the active portion of the video, the data words correspond to signal levels of the respective video components. The luminance (Y) channel is defined such that a signal level of 0 mV is assigned the codeword 64 (40 hex), and 700 millivolts (full scale) is assigned the codeword 940 (3AC) . For the chroma channels, 0 mV is assigned the code word 512 (200 hex), -350mV is assigned a code word of 64 (0x40), and +350mV is assigned a code word of 960 (3C0). Note that the scaling of the luma and chroma channels is not identical. The minimum and maximum of these ranges represent the preferred signal limits, though the video payload may venture outside these ranges (providing that the reserved code words of 0 - 3 and 1020 - 1023 are never used for video payload). For portions of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, it is recommended that the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0 mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended‚Äîand neither is necessary in the digital interface. = Emmy award= On July 31, 2013 it was announced that SMPTE won a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for 2013 by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The honor recognized the society‚Äôs work on development, standardization, and productization of SMPTE 292.

Life Sima Yuanxian was the son of Sima Daozi the Prince of Kuaiji, the younger brother of Emperor Xiaowu and son of Emperor Jianwen, and he was born during the reign of his uncle Emperor Xiaowu. When Emperor Xiaowu was murdered by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang in 396, he was succeeded by Emperor An, and Sima Daozi, as the emperor's uncle, became regent. Sima Daozi's trusted associates Wang Guobao () and Wang Xu (), because of their corrupt ways, quickly drew the ires of provincial officials Wang Gong () and Yin Zhongkan (), and in 397, Wang Gong and Yin started a rebellion, demanding that Wang Guobao and Wang Xu be killed. Sima Daozi, apprehensive of Wang Gong and Yin's power, executed Wang Guobao and Wang Xu, and Wang Gong and Yin withdrew. It was at this juncture that Sima Yuanxian, Sima Daozi's heir apparent, who was 15 but considered intelligent and capable, warned Sima Daozi that Wang Gong and Yin would one day again rebel. Sima Daozi, trusting his son, entrusted Sima Yuanxian with his personal guards. In 398, the provincial official Yu Kai (), unhappy that part of his domain was given to Wang Yu (), an official trusted by Sima Daozi, managed to persuade Wang Gong and Yin that the move was actually against them, and so Wang Gong and Yin started another rebellion. Sima Daozi, in fear, panicked and spent his days drinking, entrusting all important matters to Sima Yuanxian, who at the time appeared intelligent and resolute, reminding his followers of Emperor Ming. Soon, Sima Daozi persuaded Wang Gong's general Liu Laozhi () to betray him, and Wang Gong was captured and killed. Sima Daozi, under the suggestion of Huan Xiu (), then managed to cause dissension between Yin and his generals Huan Xuan and Yang Quanqi () by offering Huan and Yang key posts; although Huan and Yang nominally remained Yin's allies, Yin was forced to withdraw his troops, and from that point on no longer posed a major threat, as his domain had now been divided into three, with Huan and Yang each given a third. Sima Daozi, believing that his son had made the right predictions, trusted him even greater after this point. In late 398, the magician Sun Tai (), a friend of Sima Yuanxian's, who had gathered great following due to his magic, was exposed as planning a plot to take over the central government, and Sima Daozi ordered Sima Yuanxian to trap Sun Tai and execute him. Sun Tai's nephew Sun En fled to Zhoushan Island and planned revenge. In 399, Sima Daozi was afflicted with illnesses and alcoholism, and one day, while Sima Daozi was drunk, Sima Yuanxian had Emperor An issue an edict removing Sima Daozi from his post as prime minister and transferring the authority to Sima Yuanxian. After he came to, Sima Daozi became furious at his son, but could do nothing. From this point on, while Sima Daozi was titular regent, Sima Yuanxian was the actual regent. He greatly trusted the strategist Zhang Fashun (), and also introduced many trusted associates into the administration. While he appeared to have some abilities, he also was, according to traditional historians, wasting the government's money in luxury and not paying attention to the burdens of the people. Late in 399, Sun En, seeing how the only province remaining under Jin imperial government's actual control‚ÄîYang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) -- had been mismanaged by Sima Yuanxian, launched a major attack from Zhoushan Island, briefly taking over nearly all of Yang Province and advancing on the capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). Sun's rebellion was soon put down by Liu Laozhi, and Sun fled back to Zhoushan (but would remain a menace for several years), but Yang Province had been laid to waste. Despite this, Sima Yuanxian grew increasingly extravagant and arrogant. In 400, Sima Yuanxian had his son Sima Yanzhang () named the Prince of Donghai. In early 401, the general Che Yin (), as he saw that government officials were all offended by but fearful of Sima Yuanxian's arrogance, met with Sima Daozi to request Sima Daozi to try to rein in his son. In response, Sima Yuanxian threatened Che, and Che committed suicide. In late 401, apprehensive of the growing power of Huan Xuan (who had in late 399 defeated and killed Yin Zhongkan and Yang Quanqi, seizing their domains and now controlled more than two thirds of Jin territory), Sima Yuanxian declared Huan a renegade and ordered an attack against Huan. However, he was largely dependent on Liu Laozhi's army, and Liu distrusted Sima Yuanxian. Meanwhile, Huan advanced east toward the capital and, after he made overtures to Liu, Liu turned against Sima Yuanxian. Jiankang fell to Huan, and Sima Yuanxian was captured and executed, along with all of his major associates and six sons.

The game, based on Nerf, was touted as a \\"family-friendly version of multiplayer combat games like Quake III: Arena and Unreal Tournament\\", and was supported by Hasbro Interactive until that company gave its rights and properties over to Infogrames. The cutscenes were animated by Mondo Media alongside them doing the in-game art. Gameplay Single player The player starts on a team called the \\"Twisters\\", an amateur team competing for the \\"Nerf Champion of the World\\" title against 6 professional teams. The player must compete in each team's 3 arenas, totaling 21 playable maps (including the amateur and championship maps), plus a handful of \\"Bonus Round\\" maps. In order to compete against the next team the user has to place in the top three in each event (PointBlast, SpeedBlast, and BallBlast). =Game types= *PointBlast: PointBlast is based on the Unreal Deathmatch game type; instead of gaining kills, or Frags, the player gains points by either hitting an opponent, knocking or tagging an opponent out, hitting targets in the arenas, or by picking up \\"Bonus Points\\" tokens left by \\"tagged out\\" players. *SpeedBlast: SpeedBlast is a race between players where both have to pass through seven colored flags in sequence. Players are allowed to tag each other out of the race using their Nerf guns, with the tagged players returning to the last flag they touched. *BallBlast: BallBlast is a Scavenger-hunt game type, where players fight for colored balls, in order to shoot them into targets. Doing this gives you a certain number of points, depending on which ball you shoot in. Once a player gets the first six balls into the target, a seventh ball (called the \\"gold ball\\") is added to the game. The game is ended by any player shooting all balls including the golden ball into the target. The winner of the match is whoever has the most points when the game ends, rather than who shoots the gold ball into the target. Multiplayer Due to the similarities between Unreal Tournament and Nerf Arena Blast, it is possible to play Pointblast in team mode, because Pointblast is essentially a Deathmatch game type in most aspects, except for the scoring system. Other than that, the game types in single player mode apply to multiplayer mode. The community has released a Capture the Flag mod, this has given rise to a large number of new maps for NAB. Expandability Nerf Arena Blast used Unreal Engine therefore supports user-made maps and add-ons to the game. However, due to some parts of the engine being altered, the ability to create add-ons like in Unreal Tournament is somewhat limited. However, hundreds of maps and modifications of Unreal maps have been published, and multiple modified weapons and game modes (such as Capture the Flag) have been created.

Specifically, it has the first proposition universal and affirmative, but the second and third particular and negative, and the middle term the attribute in the two first. For example, :Every virtue is attended with discretion. :Some kinds of zeal are not attended with discretion. :Therefore, some kinds of zeal are not virtues. In the terminology of Aristotelian logic, a Baroco is one of the four syllogisms of the second figure of the twenty-four modes. It includes a major of type A; a minor of type C; and a conclusion of type O; that is to say a universal major affirmative, a particular minor negative, and a particular negative conclusion. A modern example of a Baroco syllogism is: #All saucers can be used as frisbees: #Some metal objects cannot be used as frisbees: #Therefore, some metal objects are not saucers. Baroco and Baroque In the 16th century the term Baroco moved beyond philosophy and began to be used to describe anything that was overly and absurdly complex. The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne associated the term 'baroco' with \\"Bizarre and uselessly complicated.\\"Other early sources associated the term with magic, complexity, confusion, and excess. Robert Hudson Vincent, Modern Language Quarterly, Volume 80, Issue 3 (September 2019) In the 18th century, the term was sometimes also used to describe music, and was not flattering. In an anonymous satirical review of the premi√®re of Jean-Philippe Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie in October 1733, which was printed in the Mercure de France in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was \\"du barocque\\", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.Claude V. Palisca, \\"Baroque\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). In 1762, Le Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise wrote that the term could be used figuratively to describe something \\"irregular, bizarre or unequal.\\"\\"se dit aussi au figur√©, pour irr√©gulier, bizarre, in√©gale.\\" Le Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise (1762) Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher, wrote in 1768 in the Encyclop√©die: \\"Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited.

Life White was born in San Antonio Texas in 1938. He grew up in and around Boston, Massachusetts, and obtained his B.A. in Biology from Harvard University in 1959. Originally planning to become a fisheries biologist, White changed his mind and decided to travel to places like New York City, San Francisco, London, and the Middle East during the 1960s. While living in San Francisco, he worked as an electrician at Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard, and developed a fascination for electrical switching systems. In London England, 1965-1967, he began to experiment with electronics. He then moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he began creating a series of kinetic, digital logic driven light machines. His first artwork utilizing \\"RTL\\" integrated circuits was shown in the E.A.T. sponsored group exhibition entitled \\"Some More Beginnings\\", in 1969, at the Brooklyn Museum. From 1978 to 2003. White taught classes such as \\"Mechanics for Real Time Sculpture\\" as part of the Integrated Media Program of the Ontario College of Art & Design A retrospective of his work and influence, called Norm‚Äôs Robots and Machine Life, with works by both White and several Canadian artists he has influenced, was shown at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Kingston, Ontario in 2004. From 1992 to 2003, White was an essential force behind the OCAD Sumo Robot Challenge, an annual competition akin to an automaton Olympics. From 2003 to 2016 , White taught in the Radio Television Arts Department of Ryerson University, Toronto, Ontario. He retired from teaching in 2016. Work Early light works White's early electronic art consisted mostly of gridded installations of light bulbs controlled by contemporary-vintage digital logic circuits. Like most of his art, these displays were concerned more with communicating internal rules and behaviours than simple visual appeal. For example, White's first major electronic work, \\"First Tighten Up on the Drums\\" (1969), generated shimmering light patterns through the unpredictable interaction of many interconnected circuits computing simple logical questions independently. The work illustrated how complex behaviours - for example, patterns akin to swirling clouds or rain on a window pane - can emerge from simple principles. In retrospect, White recognizes this first project as an early cellular automata experiment. He constructed approximately a dozen similar light machines during the early 1970s, culminating in \\"Splish Splash 2\\" (1975), a large light mural commissioned for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Vancouver offices. Computer-based and robotic works Following the purchase of his first computer, a Motorola D-1, in 1976, White refocused his attention on the emerging field of robotics, and during the mid- to late-1970s began making interactive machines whose internal logic expressed itself primarily through motion. \\"Menage\\" (1974) was White's first robotic work, and again demonstrated his interest in exploring complex behaviours generated from simple principles. Four robots mounted upon ceiling tracks were fitted with photo-sensitive scanners and programmed to recognize and react to light sources mounted on the other robots. The machines competed for one another's attention as they moved automatically along the overhead tracks. The Helpless Robot Subsequent robotic projects have included: \\"Facing Out Laying Low\\" (1977), a stationary interactive robot designed to react to interesting behaviour in the gallery space surrounding it, and \\"Funny Weather\\" (1983), a robotic artificial weather system with interacting wind generators and sensors. His early networked art piece \\"Telephonic Arm Wrestling\\" (1986, with Doug Back) used telephone data links to enable patrons to arm wrestle each other at a great distance. The work was performed in real time between the Canadian Cultural Centre in Paris, France and the Artculture Resource Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Some critics consider this piece to be a pioneering work in networked and long distance kinesthetic art. A later work, \\"Them Fuckin' Robots\\" (1988), a collaboration with Laura Kikauka, investigated simulated sex. In \\"The Helpless Robot\\" (1987‚Äì96), an electronically synthesized voice asks for the physical assistance of passers-by with a persuasive tone. Over time, the voice slowly changes to a more forceful, commanding tone, complaining when the interaction is not being completed properly. Collections White's work is included in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Awards Norm White was awarded for a lifetime of innovation in art with the 2018 Digifest Media Pioneer Award. He was the prize winner of the d.velop digital art award [ddaa] in 2008. . He won the 1995 Petro Canada Award. In 1990 White received an award of distinction at the Prix Ars Electronica for The Helpless Robot.

Together with dichloramine (NHCl2) and nitrogen trichloride (NCl3), it is one of the three chloramines of ammonia. It is a colorless liquid at its melting point of , but it is usually handled as a dilute aqueous solution, in which form it is sometimes used as a disinfectant. Chloramine is too unstable to have its boiling point measured. Water treatment Chloramine is used as a disinfectant for water. It is less aggressive than chlorine and more stable against light than hypochlorites. Drinking water disinfection Chloramine is commonly used in low concentrations as a secondary disinfectant in municipal water distribution systems as an alternative to chlorination. This application is increasing. Chlorine (referred to in water treatment as free chlorine) is being displaced by chloramine‚Äîto be specific monochloramine‚Äîwhich is much more stable and does not dissipate as rapidly as free chlorine. Chloramine also has a much lower, but still active, tendency than free chlorine to convert organic materials into chlorocarbons such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Such compounds have been identified as carcinogens and in 1979 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began regulating their levels in US drinking water.http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA- WATER/2006/January/Day-04/w03.pdf Some of the unregulated byproducts may possibly pose greater health risks than the regulated chemicals. Due to its acidic nature, adding chloramine to the water supply may increase exposure to lead in drinking water, especially in areas with older housing; this exposure can result in increased lead levels in the bloodstream, which may pose a significant health risk. Fortunately, water treatment plants can add caustic chemicals at the plant which have the dual purpose of reducing the corrosivity of the water, and stabilizing the disinfectant. Swimming pool disinfection In swimming pools, chloramines are formed by the reaction of free chlorine with amine groups present in organic substances, mainly bio- derived (E.g urea). Chloramines, compared to free chlorine, are both less effective as a sanitizer and, if not managed correctly, more irritating to the eyes of swimmers. Chloramines are responsible for the distinctive \\"chlorine\\" smell of swimming pools. Some pool test kits designed for use by homeowners do not distinguish free chlorine and chloramines, which can be misleading and lead to non-optimal levels of chloramines in the pool water. There is also evidence that exposure to chloramine can contribute to respiratory problems, including asthma, among swimmers. Respiratory problems related to chloramine exposure are common and prevalent among competitive swimmers. Safety US EPA drinking water quality standards limit chloramine concentration for public water systems to 4 parts per million (ppm) based on a running annual average of all samples in the distribution system. In order to meet EPA-regulated limits on halogenated disinfection by-products, many utilities are switching from chlorination to chloramination. While chloramination produces fewer regulated total halogenated disinfection by-products, it can produce greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated disinfection byproducts and N-nitrosodimethylamine. Both iodinated disinfection by-products and N-nitrosodimethylamine have been shown to be genotoxic, causing damage to the genetic information within a cell resulting in mutations which may lead to cancer. Synthesis and chemical reactions Chloramine is a highly unstable compound in concentrated form. Pure chloramine decomposes violently above .Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . Gaseous chloramine at low pressures and low concentrations of chloramine in aqueous solution are thermally slightly more stable. Chloramine is readily soluble in water and ether, but less soluble in chloroform and carbon tetrachloride.  Production  In dilute aqueous solution, chloramine is prepared by the reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite: : NH3 \\\\+ NaOCl ‚Üí NH2Cl + NaOH This reaction is also the first step of the Olin Raschig process for hydrazine synthesis. The reaction has to be carried out in a slightly alkaline medium (pH 8.5‚Äì11). The acting chlorinating agent in this reaction is hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which has to be generated by protonation of hypochlorite, and then reacts in a nucleophilic substitution of the hydroxyl against the amino group. The reaction occurs quickest at around pH 8\\\\. At higher pH values the concentration of hypochlorous acid is lower, at lower pH values ammonia is protonated to form ammonium ions (), which do not react further. The chloramine solution can be concentrated by vacuum distillation and by passing the vapor through potassium carbonate which absorbs the water. Chloramine can be extracted with ether. Gaseous chloramine can be obtained from the reaction of gaseous ammonia with chlorine gas (diluted with nitrogen gas): : 2 NH3 \\\\+ Cl2 NH2Cl + NH4Cl Pure chloramine can be prepared by passing fluoroamine through calcium chloride: : 2 NH2F + CaCl2 ‚Üí 2 NH2Cl + CaF2  Decomposition  The covalent N‚àíCl bonds of chloramines are readily hydrolyzed with release of hypochlorous acid: : RR‚Ä≤NCl + H2O RR‚Ä≤NH + HOCl The quantitative hydrolysis constant (K value) is used to express the bactericidal power of chloramines, which depends on their generating hypochlorous acid in water. It is expressed by the equation below, and is generally in the range 10‚àí4 to 10‚àí10 ( for monochloramine): : K = \\\\frac{ c_{\\\\text{RR}'\\\\text{NH}} \\\\cdot c_\\\\text{HOCl} }{ c_{\\\\text{RR}'\\\\text{NCl}} } In aqueous solution, chloramine slowly decomposes to dinitrogen and ammonium chloride in a neutral or mildly alkaline (pH ‚â§ 11) medium: : 3 NH2Cl ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ NH4Cl + 2 HCl However, only a few percent of a 0.1 M chloramine solution in water decomposes according to the formula in several weeks. At pH values above 11, the following reaction with hydroxide ions slowly occurs: : 3 NH2Cl + 3 OH‚àí ‚Üí NH3 \\\\+ N2 \\\\+ 3 Cl‚àí \\\\+ 3 H2O In an acidic medium at pH values of around 4, chloramine disproportionates to form dichloramine, which in turn disproportionates again at pH values below 3 to form nitrogen trichloride: : 2 NH2Cl + H+ NHCl2 \\\\+ : 3 NHCl2 \\\\+ H+ 2 NCl3 \\\\+ At low pH values, nitrogen trichloride dominates and at pH 3‚Äì5 dichloramine dominates. These equilibria are disturbed by the irreversible decomposition of both compounds: : NHCl2 \\\\+ NCl3 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ 3 HCl + 2 HOCl  Reactions  In water, chloramine is pH-neutral. It is an oxidizing agent (acidic solution: , in basic solution ): : NH2Cl + 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚Üí + Cl‚àí Reactions of chloramine include radical, nucleophilic, and electrophilic substitution of chlorine, electrophilic substitution of hydrogen, and oxidative additions. Chloramine can, like hypochlorous acid, donate positively charged chlorine in reactions with nucleophiles (Nu‚àí): : Nu‚àí \\\\+ NH3Cl+ ‚Üí NuCl + NH3 Examples of chlorination reactions include transformations to dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride in acidic medium, as described in the decomposition section. Chloramine may also aminate nucleophiles (electrophilic amination): : Nu‚àí \\\\+ NH2Cl ‚Üí NuNH2 \\\\+ Cl‚àí The amination of ammonia with chloramine to form hydrazine is an example of this mechanism seen in the Olin Raschig process: : NH2Cl + NH3 \\\\+ NaOH ‚Üí N2H4 \\\\+ NaCl + H2O Chloramine electrophilically aminates itself in neutral and alkaline media to start its decomposition: : 2 NH2Cl ‚Üí N2H3Cl + HCl The chlorohydrazine (N2H3Cl) formed during self-decomposition is unstable and decomposes itself, which leads to the net decomposition reaction: : 3 NH2Cl ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ NH4Cl + 2 HCl Monochloramine oxidizes sulfhydryls and disulfides in the same manner as hypochlorous acid, but only possesses 0.4% of the biocidal effect of HClO.

It was formed in March 1973 and disbanded in July of that year after the ferry flights were completed. History The RAAF Washington Flying Unit was formed at McClellan Air Force Base, California on 31 March 1973 under the command of Group Captain John Newham. The unit was tasked with ferrying the RAAF's first twelve (out of a total order of 24) F-111Cs to Australia. The unit comprised twelve F-111 crews, each consisting of a pilot and a navigator.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 150 Newham was also the commanding officer of No. 82 Wing, which was to operate the F-111Cs once they arrived in Australia.Wilson and Pittaway (2010), p. 47 Following their arrival in the United States, the Australian airmen were provided with training on the F-111 by General Dynamics. Once this was completed, they ferried F-111s from the company's facilities at Fort Worth to McClellan Air Force Base. The first ferry flight of six F-111Cs departed McClellan Air Force Base in May 1973. The aircraft first flew to Hickam Air Force Base where they refueled. On 30 May they flew to Pago Pago International Airport. The next day they departed for RAAF Base Amberley, and arrived there on 1 June (Australian time). The remaining six F-111Cs began their ferry flight on 23 July, and used the same route as the first. Once this flight was completed and all twelve F-111Cs had arrived in Australia, the Washington Flying Unit was disbanded on 26 July 1973.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 151 The RAAF's other twelve F-111Cs were ferried to Australia in two flights later that year, which arrived at Amberley on 28 September and 4 December. Despite the unit's name, the Washington Flying Unit was not the RAAF unit which was responsible for operating two Washington B.1 (B-29 Superfortress) heavy bombers in the early 1950s. These aircraft were operated by the RAAF's Aeronautical Research and Development Unit.

Retreading is applied to casings of spent tires that have been inspected and repaired. It preserves about 90% of the material in spent tires and the material cost is about 20% compared to manufacturing a new one. Applications United States Some applications for retreaded tires are airplanes, racing cars, buses and delivery trucks. Use of retreaded tires was common historically, but as of 2008, it was seldom used for passenger vehicles, mainly due to discomfort on the road, safety issues and cheaper tire brands surfacing on the market. About 17.6 million retreaded tires were sold in North America in 2006. Process There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearography to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading. Material cost for a retreaded tire is about 20% that of making a new tire. About 90% of the original tires by weight is retained in retreaded tires. A 1997 study estimates that then current generation of commercial vehicles tires to last up to 600,000 miles if they're retreaded two to three times. Pre cure Previously prepared tread strip is applied to tire casing with cement. This method allows more flexibility in tire sizes and it is the most commonly used method, but results in a seam where the ends of the strip meet. Mold cure Raw rubber is applied to the tire casing and it is then placed in a mold where tread is formed. A dedicated mold is required for each tire size and tread design. =Bead to Bead molding= In this subtype, retreading is also applied to the side walls. These tires are given entirely new branding and stamps. Regulations Some jurisdictions have regulations concerning tire retreading. Europe In Europe all retreads, by law, must be manufactured according to EC Regulation 108 (car tires) or 109 (commercial vehicle tires). As part of this regulation all tires must be tested according to the same load and speed criteria as those undergone by new tires. The Land Fill Directive of 1999 banned tires in landfills in 2003, and banned shredded tires in 2006. United States The Department of Transportation requires marking of a \\"DOTR number\\" which shows the name of the retreader and when it was retreaded. Safety The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recognizes the public perception that retread tires frequently used by heavy vehicles are less safe than new tires as evidenced by tire debris frequently found on highways. The NHTSA is continuing research to determine the proportion of tire debris from retreads in comparison to new tires. Additionally, the NHTSA is researching the cause of tire failure and the crash safety problem posed by tire failures. Federal Executive Order 13149, signed by President Bill Clinton supports the use of retread tires for economic and environmental efficiency by requiring federal vehicles to use retread tires after original factory equipped tires become non serviceable, but only when \\"such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards\\". Environmental impact Retread tires in service lower the volume of raw materials required for the manufacturing of a new tire. This includes a pronounced reduction in the use of oil. In fact, the US EPA estimated a greater than 70% savings in oil used for a retread as compared to a new tire. This also means significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. A car tire has 40% natural rubber and 60% oil based rubber, a retreading of tires will reduce the need for natural rubber significantly. In addition to reducing the amount of raw materials extracted, retread tires also minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The latest figures by the US EPA indicate that over 11.2 M waste tires were dumped into the U.S. municipal solid waste stream. To understand this figure, it is equivalent to lining up passenger tires tread to tread from roughly Los Angeles to San Diego or Philadelphia to Washington DC. Because a retread tire prevents the need for manufacturing a new tire, significant environmental benefits are achieved.

Attractive aspects of ballooning include the exceptional quiet (except when the propane burners are firing), the lack of a feeling of movement, and the bird's-eye view. Since the balloon moves with the direction of the winds, the passengers feel absolutely no wind, except for brief periods during the flight when the balloon climbs or descends into air currents of different direction or speed. Hot air ballooning has been recognized by F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) as the safest air sport in aviation, and fatalities in hot air balloon accidents are rare, according to statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). History First manned flight A model of the Montgolfier brothers balloon at the London Science Museum The first clearly recorded instance of a balloon carrying passengers used hot air to generate buoyancy and was built by the brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier in Annonay, France. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first tethered balloon flight with humans on board took place on October 19, 1783 with the scientist Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier, the manufacture manager, Jean-Baptiste R√©veillon and Giroud de Villette, at the Folie Titon in Paris. The first free flight with human passengers was on November 21, 1783. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Francois d'Arlandes, successfully petitioned for the honor. Modern revival Modern hot air ballooning was born in 1960, when Ed Yost launched a balloon with a new nylon envelope and propane burner system of his own invention. Yost's first balloon was basketless, with nothing but a seat for him to ride on, but in a few years he and other balloon enthusiasts would develop balloons much like the ones used today. Today, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation. According to the FAA's General Aviation Survey data, in 2012, there were about 2,300 personally owned and flown balloons, and about 495 commercial \\"sight-seeing\\" ride operators in the United States. Since piloting a balloon requires some effort (licensing and purchase of equipment), many people opt to purchase a balloon flight from a company offering balloon rides. Balloon rides are available in many locations around the world and are especially popular in tourist areas. Balloon festivals are a great way to see hot air balloons close up, and are an enjoyable family outing. Balloon festivals usually include other activities like live entertainment, amusement rides, etc. Hot air balloons in flight Hot air balloons are able to fly to extremely high altitudes. On November 26, 2005, Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching 21,290 meters (69,852 feet). He took off from downtown Mumbai, India and landed south in Panchale. The previous record of 19,811 meters (64,980 feet) had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988 in Plano, Texas. However, as with all unpressurised aircraft, oxygen is needed for all crew and passengers on any balloon flight that reaches and exceeds an altitude of 3,810 meters (12,500 feet). On January 15, 1991, a balloon called the Pacific Flyer carrying Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew from Japan to Northern Canada, completing 7,671.91 km. With a volume of 74,000 m¬≥ (2,600,000 ft¬≥), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jetstreams the Pacific Flyer recorded the highest ground speed for a manned balloon of 245 mph (394 km/h). The distance record was broken on March 21, 1999 when the Breitling Orbiter 3 carrying Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones touched down in Egypt, having circumnavigated the globe and set records for duration (19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes) and distance (46,759 km). Flight techniques Early morning departures Most hot air balloon launches are made during the cooler hours of the day, at dawn or two to three hours before sunset. At these times of day, the winds are typically light making for easier launch and landing of the balloon. Flying at these times also avoids thermals, which are vertical air currents caused by ground heating that make it more difficult to control the balloon. In the extreme, the downdrafts associated with strong thermals can exceed the ability of a balloon to climb and can thus force a balloon into the ground. Sequence =Preflight preparation= Before a safe hot air balloon flight can begin, the pilot must check the weather and select a suitable take-off point. The current and forecast weather must have sufficient visibility for the pilot to see and avoid obstructions (little or no fog or low clouds) and sufficiently slow winds to allow take off and landing (less than 5 or 10 mph depending on skill and experience of pilot, passengers, and ground crew). The take-off point must be large enough to lay out and inflate the envelope and clear of obstructions such as power lines and poles, trees, and buildings to allow lift-off under the predicted wind conditions. Finally, the take-off point must be situated such that the predicted winds will move the balloon in the direction of suitable landing sites. Taking off from a location that is directly up wind of a hazard, such as a large body of water, a large metropolitan area, or a large uninterrupted forest, without sufficient fuel to pass over the hazard is not safe. =Set up= Hot air balloon, set up and launch, Stockholm 1988. Hot air balloon being inflated by its propane burners prior to a dawn launch. The next step in a hot air balloon flight is unpacking the balloon from its carrying bag, laying it out on the ground, and connecting it to the basket and burner. A fan, often gasoline-powered, is used to blow cold (outside) air into the envelope. The cold air partially inflates the balloon to establish its basic shape before the burner flame is aimed into the mouth heating the air inside. A crew member stationed opposite the mouth, holds a rope (crown line) tied to the apex (crown) of the envelope. Some balloons, AX7 and larger, may have two (or more) crown lines. The \\"crown-man\\" role is twofold: one is to prevent the envelope from excessive sway, and two is to prevent the envelope from rising before it is sufficiently buoyant. Once the balloon is upright, pilot and passengers climb into the basket. When the pilot is ready for launch, more heat is directed into the envelope and the balloon lifts off. The crew then pack up inflation equipment and follow the balloon with the retrieve vehicle (also called a chase vehicle). =Flight= During the flight, the pilot's only ability to steer the balloon is the ability to climb or descend into winds going different directions. Thus, it is important for the pilot to determine what direction the wind is blowing at altitudes other than the balloon's altitude. To do this, the pilot uses a variety of techniques. For example, to determine wind directions beneath the balloon a pilot might simply spit or release a squirt of shaving cream and watch this indicator as it falls to determine where possible turns are (and their speed). Pilots are also looking for other visual clues such as flags on flagpoles, smoke coming from chimneys, etc. To determine wind directions above the balloon, the pilot will obtain a weather forecast prior to the flight which includes upper level wind forecasts. The pilot will also send up a helium pilot balloon, known as a met-balloon in the UK and pibal in the USA, prior to launch to get information about what the wind is actually doing. Another way to determine actual wind directions is to watch other hot air balloons, which are the equivalent of a large met-balloon. Control The inside of a hot air balloon's envelope, seen from the gondola. The direction of flight depends on the wind, but the altitude of the balloon can be controlled by changing the temperature of the air inside the envelope. The pilot may open one or more burner blast valves to increase the temperature inside the envelope, thereby increasing lift, and thus ascend or slow or stop a descent. The pilot may also open a vent, if the envelope is so equipped, to let hot air escape, decreasing the temperature inside the envelope, thereby decreasing lift, and thus descend or slow or stop an ascent. Unless the pilot intervenes, the air inside the envelope will slowly cool, by seepage or by contact with cooler outside air, and slowly provide less lift. Delayed response One of the tricks involved in flying a balloon is learning to deal with the delayed response. To slow or stop a descent requires the pilot to open a burner blast valve. This sends hot combustion exhaust through the mouth into the envelope where it expands and forces some cooler air out of the mouth. This lightens the total weight of the system and increases its buoyancy, but not immediately. From the time that the burner is lit until the balloon slows or stops its descent can take 30 seconds or more, depending on its rate of descent, how cold it has become, and how powerful the burner. This delay requires a great deal of anticipation on the part of the pilot. Steerage The ability to change direction with altitude is called steerage. In the ideal case, in the northern hemisphere, wind direction turns to the right with an increase in altitude. This is due to the Coriolis effect. Winds spiral clockwise, when seen from above, out of a high pressure system and counter clockwise into a low pressure system. However, air travelling close to the ground will tend to move in more of a straight line from high to low pressure due to drag with the ground. Thus, a pilot may hope to find a turn to the left during the descent to landing. In the southern hemisphere, the direction of the spirals is reversed. In reality, interaction with an uneven terrain may lessen or completely eliminate this phenomenon. Level flight A Balloon Works Firefly 7 balloon in level flight. The burner is designed to create enough heat to warm up the balloon quickly. It is most efficient only when wide open. There is no good way to maintain the exact temperature required to maintain equilibrium. Add to that the fact that when a hot air balloon is not actively being heated, it is cooling off. This means that it is in perfect equilibrium only momentarily. The rest of the time it is either too warm or too cool and so either climbing or descending. These two facts together mean that under most conditions level flight is anything but. The goal of the pilot is to light the burner at the right interval and for the right duration (a few seconds) to keep the balloon slowly drifting up and down about the desired altitude. An exception is made when flying close to the ground, as in an approach to a landing. Then the burner may be lit for very short bursts at a much higher frequency, thus sacrificing efficiency for accuracy. =Chase= A typical chase vehicle with room for the equipment, chase crew, pilot, and all passengers. While it is certainly possible to enjoy the sport of hot air ballooning without a chase vehicle, returning from the landing site by foot, bicycle, or hitch hiking, many balloonists opt to be followed by their ground crew in some sort of chase vehicle. Crew at the landing site can aid with the landing itself, by catching a drop line and guiding the balloon into a tight space; with extracting the balloon system from a remote location, such as deep in a farmer's field; and with packing up all the equipment. Sometimes, a chase vehicle may be equipped with a trailer, which can provide a lot more room at the cost of being more difficult to maneuver. A pickup truck or van by itself can be a lot more maneuverable but at the cost of squeezing all the equipment, crew, pilot, and passengers into a single vehicle. Many chase vehicles are fitted with a cargo liftgate to aid in loading heavy equipment into the cargo space (the envelope itself can weigh 250 lbs or more). Communication between the balloon and chase vehicle can be accomplished by two-way radio, or even shouting, when they are close enough together. The use of cell phones for this purpose, while the balloon is flying, may violate local telecommunication laws and should therefore be avoided except in an emergency situation. =Landing= Holding the crown line while the balloon deflates after landing. Most pilots try to perform as smooth a landing as possible. This becomes difficult if the air at ground level is moving at more than or so. If the balloon is moving at this speed or more when it contacts the ground, the basket (which usually does not have wheels of any kind on the bottom) may drag for a bit or even tip over. Even the presence of ground crew may not help much. The combined weight (for an average passenger-carrying system as calculated above) can easily exceed the weight of a large automobile. (It is best not to be on the downwind side of a landing balloon to avoid being pinned between it and a hard place.) Pilots can improve the situation by landing in a spot protected from the wind, such as behind a line of trees or in a small valley. Once the balloon has landed, the envelope is deflated and detached from the basket. The envelope is then packed into its carrying bag. The burner and the basket may be separated and all components are packed into the retrieve vehicle. Competition In competition, the pilots need to be able to read different wind directions at different altitudes. Balloon competitions are often called \\"races\\" but they're most often a test of accuracy, not speed. For most competitive balloon flights, the goal is to fly as close as possible to one or more exact points called \\"targets\\". Once a pilot has directed the balloon as close as possible to a target, a weighted marker with an identifying number written on it is dropped. The distance between a pilot's marker and that target determines his or her score. During some competitive flights, pilots will be required to fly to 5 or more targets before landing. To assist with navigation, topographic maps and GPS units are used. Another common form of competition is the \\"Hare and Hound\\" race. The Hare balloon takes off a set amount of time before the Hound balloons and typically flies with multiple altitude changes to make it more difficult for the chasing balloons to match its flight path. After a set amount of flight time, the Hare will land and typically lay out a target cross for the Hounds to drop their weighted markers near. As above, the distance between a pilot's marker and the target determines his or her score. A balloonist prepares to drop a marker on a competition target, in this case the centre of a road intersection. Some experienced pilots are able to take a flight in one direction then rise to a different altitude to catch wind in a returning direction. With experience, luck, and the right conditions, some pilots are able to control a precision landing at the destination. On rare occasions, they may be able to return to the launch site at the end of the flight. This is sometimes called a box effect, when winds at altitude flow in the opposite direction of surface winds. Hazards The dangers of the sport include excessive (vertical or horizontal) speed during landing, mid-air collisions that may collapse the balloon, and colliding with high voltage power lines. It is the last of these, contact with power lines, that poses the greatest danger. One of the most common causes of serious ballooning accidents in the US is power line strikes. One reason for the high frequency of such incidents is the fact that pilots often attempt to land their balloons on or near roads in order to reduce the amount of off-road driving necessary to recover the balloon. However, in most rural areas where balloons fly, roads usually have power lines running along with them. Of the 11 accidents involving fatalities recorded by the NTSB between 1997 and 2007, 4 involved contact with power lines, 3 involved falling after hanging onto the outside of a rising balloon, 3 involved striking an object on landing (boulder, wall, or tree), and 1 involved an equipment failure (an eyebolt). Winter flight Seattle Ballooning Flying A Hot Air Balloon In The Mountains Near Seattle The ability to fly hot air balloons in the winter is limited mostly by the ability of the participants to withstand the cold. The balloons themselves fly well in cold air. Because the temperature difference between inside and outside the balloon, not the absolute inside temperature, determines the lift it develops, a much lower internal temperature is sufficient to fly in cold weather. However, if the liquid propane in the fuel tanks is too cold (0 ¬∞C/32 ¬∞F or less) it does not generate sufficient vapor pressure to adequately feed the burner(s). This can be overcome by charging the fuel tanks with inert gas such as nitrogen or by warming them, with electric heat tapes for example, and insulating them against the cold. Tethering Sometimes, especially at balloon festivals or other special events, balloons are flown while tied to the ground with ropes (tethers). This enables quick rides to many passengers, instead of long rides drifting with the wind away from the event with one load of passengers. Tethering techniques depend on the balloon manufacturer's instructions and wind conditions. Tethers can be attached to the basket, burner support, or the top of the envelope. A \\"night glow\\" is a tethered flight in darkness to enhance visual effects. While typical day flights use the main valve, using an efficient blue flame, at night tethered pilots use the liquid valve \\"whisper burner\\" (\\"cow burner\\", as it does not startle livestock), creating a spectacular bright orange flame. Though tethered, a balloon is considered a registered flying aircraft when it leaves the ground. Events There are many regular gatherings of balloons and balloonists around the world. Most of these events are held on an annual basis. The festivities provide both a place for balloonists to interact as well as a venue for entertaining spectators. Events range in size from a few balloons and no spectators to hundreds of balloons with hundreds of thousands of spectators. The largest such event in the world is the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, held every October in Albuquerque, New Mexico, followed by the Grand Est Mondial Air in France. The Bristol International Balloon Fiesta is another notable European event of this nature. Traditions Over the long history of ballooning, several traditions have developed. Champagne A common tradition among balloonists is to have a champagne toast upon landing. Legend has it that early French aeronauts carried champagne to appease angry or frightened spectators at the landing site. A champagne toast is now often included in commercial sight-seeing flights.  Balloonists Prayer  Another tradition involves reciting \\"The Balloonists Prayer\\" before a hot air balloon flight. There is also a slightly modified version that is intended as part of the post-flight ceremony. While the exact origin and author are unknown, it is believed to have been adapted from an old Irish sailors' blessing from long ago. = Recited BEFORE Flight = > May the winds welcome you with softness. > May the sun bless you with its warm hands. > May you fly so high and so well > that God joins you in laughter > and sets you gently back again > into the loving arms of Mother Earth. = Recited AFTER Flight = > The Winds have Welcomed you with softness. > The Sun has blessed you with its warm hands. > You have flown so high and so well > that God has joined you in your laughter > and set you gently back again > into the loving arms of Mother Earth.  Balloon Naming  Balloons are almost always given unique names by their aeronaut owners. Pilots often get creative with a variety of names reflecting the very beauty and romance of the sport of ballooning. Some even believe that it is bad luck to change a balloon's name.

The exposition was held in Balboa Park, San Diego's large central urban park, which had also been the site of the earlier Panama-California Exposition in 1915. The Exposition was held to promote San Diego and support its economy, which had slowed with the country's Great Depression. The first year was such a financial and attendance success that it was held over for a second year. The exposition had hundreds of exhibits on history, the arts, horticulture, ethnic cultures, science, and industry. Some concessions and exhibits were unusual, such as the Gold Gulch, Lost Continent of Mu, Zoro Garden Nudist Colony, and the \\"One Ton Mechanical Man.\\" History The idea for an exposition came from Frank Drugan, a newcomer to San Diego, California, who arrived in 1933. He recognized the potential of the buildings in Balboa Park left over from the 1915-16 exposition; the buildings had been designed to be temporary, but had been refurbished and upgraded several times and were available for use. In addition, Chicago's \\"Century of Progress\\" fair was just ending, and many of its exhibits could be transported for use in another fair. That exposition had paid for itself, and he was sure a San Diego exposition could do so as well. He promoted the idea of a new exposition, using the existing buildings and adding new ones, as a way of boosting San Diego's economy. He convinced local business people to support the idea. The Exposition incorporated in August 1934. Construction of new buildings began in January 1935. The project was rushed through for a May opening. The foundations of some structures, such as the Electric Building and the Ford Building, were laid even before the final plans for the buildings had been drawn up. During March and April, 2,700 people worked around the clock on the Exposition. Approximately 65% of them were relief workers whose wages were paid by the federal government; the remainder were employees of private contractors. Architecture The buildings from the 1915 fair were in Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style, designed by Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow. Architect Richard Requa designed the new permanent buildings to be added for the 1935 fair. He wrote that his goal was to relate pre-Columbian Indian buildings and temples, like those found in the Southwest and Mexico, to the modern era; his model was the 1915 New Mexico Building, which he remodeled into a Palace of Education. Many of the new large buildings were in this style, including the California State Building (now the San Diego Automotive Museum), Palace of Electricity (now a gymnasium), and Palace of Water and Transportation (no longer existent). Other new buildings included: * The Old Globe Theatre, a copy of a theatre built for the Chicago fair, which in turn was a copy of the original Globe Theatre in London. During the Exposition it showed 50-minute adaptations of plays by William Shakespeare. After the fair it was remodeled and roofed over, and continued to show theatrical productions. The building burned down in 1978 but was rebuilt and is now the focus of a three-theater complex. * The circular Ford Building, generally regarded as the architectural wonder of the Exposition, now the home of the San Diego Air and Space Museum. * The Ford Bowl, now called the Starlight Bowl, an amphitheater used for concerts and theatrical productions. * The House of Pacific Relations, a collection of fifteen small tan red-tiled cottages which were dedicated to different foreign countries; these \\"International Cottages\\" are still in use by a consortium of groups from 32 countries as a focus of educational activities, outreach, and international festivals. * Spanish Village, a group of six buildings used for shops, restaurants, and a children's theater; it is now an Art Center featuring 37 working art studios and galleries. While some of the extensive gardens from the 1915 Panama California Exposition remained, they were redesigned from formal gardens to gardens overflowing with lush abundance of exotic plants. Many were reimagined by renowned architect Richard Requa who was influenced by the gardens he had seen traveling in Spain. Today's Alcazar garden, Zoro Garden, and the garden at Cafe del Rey Moro are all Requa designs. Commemorative coins and stamps Obverse of the 1935-36 commemorative California Pacific International Exposition half dollar In honor of the California Pacific International Exposition, the federal government released a commemorative silver half dollar. A three-cent postage stamp (Scott catalog 773) was also issued. It presents a view of the Exposition grounds, and has the same wording as the reverse of the half dollar, plus the dates \\"1535 1935\\". Over 100 million were printed, making this a very common issue. Statistics The Exposition took ten months to build. It attracted 7,220,000 visitors during its 377 days of operation. Visitors brought US$37.7 million to San Diego. The cost was US$20 million. Admission was 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children 2-11\\\\. Four restaurants provided meals: Cafe of the World, Palisades Cafe, Spanish Kitchens, and the Pioneer Days Restaurant. Twenty-one nations participated: Argentina, British Empire, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Germany, Honduras, Irish Free State, Italy, Japan, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Sweden, Uruguay, United States and Yugoslavia. Legacy Park improvements amounted to US$6 million. The exposition was so popular that some buildings were rebuilt to be made more permanent. Many buildings or reconstructed versions remain in use today, and are used by several museums and theatres in Balboa Park. In the early 1960s destruction of a few of the buildings and their replacement by aesthetically clashing modern architecture style of the new buildings \\"created an uproar\\" in San Diego's community. A 'Committee of One Hundred' was formed by citizens to protect the park buildings. The Committee convinced the City Council to enact resolutions that now require any new buildings to be designed and constructed in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style. The Committee also worked with various government agencies for the remaining original buildings to be declared a National Historic Landmark, which was awarded in 1978. In the latter 1990s the buildings most deteriorated or that had burned were carefully rebuilt to restore the original style and scale of the park's public spaces. In October 2010, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled Designing Tomorrow: America's World's Fairs of the 1930s. This exhibition, which was available for view until September 2011, prominently featured the California Pacific International Exposition. References Further reading *Richard W.

Its origins as such can be traced back to over a century ago, when T.U. Taylor, the first engineering faculty member and first dean of the College, began drawing the elaborate checkmark on students' work. A mark reserved for perfect papers, Taylor overheard a student remark he had received a \\"ramshorn\\" in 1905, from which the symbol took on its current interpretation and significance. Alexander Frederick Claire Alec's beginnings as the patron saint of the College came as the byproduct of the efforts of a group of sophomore engineers back in 1908. Joe H. Gill and his engineering friends thoughtfully considered how to make a holiday of April Fool's Day. After an unsuccessful attempt involving tying cans around dogs' tails and releasing them to disrupt class, the group of students saw a wooden statue about five feet high while getting refreshments, which they requested to borrow. The next day, Gill presented the statue as their patron saint and traced his ancestry back to ancient times between classes. The presentation successfully broke up classes, and led to his christening as Alexander Frederick Claire, patron saint of UT engineers, exactly one year later. Alec was at the center of a friendly rivalry between law and engineering students for many years, and was subject to numerous escapades such as kidnappings and amputations. Today, what is left of the original wooden statue is safely preserved in the engineering library. Every year, engineering groups on campus build new Alecs which are then voted on by the students. The winner is announced on April 1 during Alec's birthday party. Notable faculty * John B.

Originally built by Clyde Engineering in the 1960s as Queensland Rail 1460 and 1502 class locomotives, they were purchased by Tranz Rail in 1995 to be rebuilt, as a cheaper alternative to buying new locomotives. Introduction Between March and September 1995, Tranz Rail purchased twenty-one 1460 and four 1502 class locomotives with the intention of rebuilding them for service in New Zealand. Seven 1460 and one 1502 class arrived in Auckland on 12 September 1995, and were later hauled to Hutt Workshops in Wellington. The second batch followed on the inter-island rail ferry , which was returning from Brisbane after a heavy engineering inspection, consisting of twelve 1460 and three 1502 class locomotives. This batch arrived in Wellington on 23 May 1997. The last batch arrived on 25 June 1997, which consisted of two locomotives that were decided to be left behind on the second batch due to mechanical reasons. This batched arrived on the MV Lauriegracht. Tranz Rail split them into two classes. The DQ class were rebuilt with a new cab and low nose and painted in the Cato Blue livery, with dynamic brakes, a computerized control system and rebuilt engine. The QR class were overhauled with auto-transition couplings and were also repainted in the Cato Blue livery, and were only used as trailing locomotives as they were not fitted with the safety equipment required to lead trains. The 1460s were originally planned to be reclassified as the DQC class, while the 1502s were planned to be reclassified as the DQF class. The classifications were later dropped. The first locomotive, DQ 15215 (ex-1521), underwent mainline testing from September to October 1996 15215 was a temporary number that combined the Queensland number with a TMS check digit. It was soon renumbered as DQ 6007, and released into revenue service in October 1996. The locomotive was unofficially named \\"The Platypus\\". Those rebuilt from 1502 class locomotives received 60XX numbers and those from 1460 class received 63XX numbers. This was done to differentiate the different power output of class members. 6007 had a horizontal mounted headlight and numbers below the headlight assembly on the front wall of the cab, while the rest had vertical mounted headlights and numbers on either side of the headlight assembly. The first of the QR class entered service in October 1997. Three (1499-1501) were not rebuilt but used as sources of spare parts at Hutt Workshops. 1460 class locomotive NO 1499 was due to be rebuilt as the prototype of the DQT class, a turbocharged version of the DQ class. But the programme was cancelled just less than a year later leaving 1499 as just an underframe, which was scrapped in 2001. 1500 and 1501 were also planned to be rebuilt as DQTs as well, but after the programme was dropped. Tranz Rail later approved to rebuild them as DQs, but this never commenced and were kept in storage at Hutt. Service Following the introduction of DQ 6007, the loco was used between Wellington and Palmerston North for shakedown purposes for two weeks, and also to sort out teething issues. It was later assigned to freight services throughout the lower North Island. A further six DQs and seven QRs followed. Initially they were not preferred by locomotive crews due to excessive cab noise levels and emissions into the cab. Tranz Rail made modifications to DQ 6324 that reduced the noise level to that acceptable to the Rail & Maritime Transport Union, and also diesel fumes from entering the cab. The QRs were modified and repainted for uses as slave units. The class were largely assigned to freight trains. However, they made several appearances on the Capital Connection and Wairarapa Connection long-distance suburban services, and occasionally on the Overlander as far as Palmerston North. It was soon discovered that the DQ class were not particularly reliable. Generator failures were particularly common, and so they were removed from long-distance operations to less-demanding short-haul runs, such as between Middleton Yard in Christchurch and the port of Lyttelton on the final leg of coal trains from the West Coast, and on the Ohai Branch line to and from Invercargill, hauling containerized coal trains. Several were also used as bankers to help trains up the gradients from Dunedin, and later up the 1 in 37 (2.7%) gradient out of Picton. 1460 class loco NO 1500 was used occasionally as a shunter at Hutt Workshops. Then unrebuilt 1460 class locomotive NO 1465 was used on a Mechanical Test Train in August 1997. Exports to Tasmania Port of Burnie. Due to a locomotive shortage because of the planned replacement of AN Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet, twelve DQs and three QRs were sold to the company. DQs 6007, 6330, 6353 and QR 3032, along with eight 1460 class locomotives, were sold to Tasrail. The three DQs were modified for service in Tasmania, while QR 3032 had its short-hood lowered as a DQ. The eight 1460s were fully rebuilt as DQs, with some being undergoing rebuilding when they were sold. Originally the three QRs were on a one-year lease, but were later sold. The modifications made to the units were changing the drawgear back to the originally Queensland Railways standard height, increasing the fuel tank capacity, relocate the battery boxes, installation of a sludge tank and engine room sump pan, fitting of the \\"Kaitiaki\\" vigilance, fitting of ZTR electronic anti-wheelslip technology and upgrading dynamic brakes. The locos were also were renumbered in the 2000 series, and tested between Wellington and Palmerston North. The ex-1460s were fitted with EMD 567C prime movers, that were originally fitted into the ex-1502 class locomotives. The first two DQs, 2001 and 2002, were loaded on the MV Polar Queen on 28 August 1998, and arrived in Bell Bay on 2 September 1998. The two locos were repainted in the \\"ATN Red\\" livery, which consisted of green \\"Tasrail\\" lettering, bright tomato red all over the locomotives and yellow bar-code stripes on the short-hood. The next batch consisted of DQs 2003, 2004 and 2005, which were repainted in the \\"Wisconsin Central Maroon\\" livery, and QRs 2056, 2062 and 2102, which were still repainted in the Cato Blue livery. The new livery for Tasrail consisted of maroon, with a wide buff yellow stripe and red \\"Tasrail\\" lettering, with the Tasmanian flag next to the letters. The reason in the change of livery is due to the Australian Transport Network not being impressed of the cost of it. This batched left the Port of Wellington on 8 December 1998 on the Arktis Dream, and arrived in Tasmania on 15 December 1998. The third batch left on 23 February 1999 on the Edisongracht, compromising of DQs 2006, 2007 and 2008, and arrived in Tasmania on 3 March 1999. The last batch, which consisted of DQs 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, left Wellington on the Melanesian Chief on 28 September 1999, and arrived in Tasmania on 5 October 1999. The DQs have not been overly reliable in Tasmania either. The locomotives have had a high number of main generator failures, since their arrivals. Reductions in rated haulage capacity in recent years have reduced the number of in service failures and train operating problems. With Pacific National selling the Tasmanian railway system to TasRail, six locomotives have been repainted into the new grey and yellow livery. DQ 2001, which had just been reassembled, became the first loco to be repainted in the new livery in August 2010. Two DQs are carrying special advertising panels, in-place of TasRails logo. 2006 carries a level crossing safety advertisement, while 2012 carries logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Rosebery Mine. The three QRs were again used as trail units in Tasmania due to the lack of radios and other equipment, as what are fitted to other lead locomotives. They were also occasionally used for yard shunts. The three locos never saw much service in the first few years, with 2062 and 2102 being placed into storage within the first year, with 2056 following not long after. The three later returned to service. QR 2102 withdrawn again after a major engine failure in July 2002. 2056 was again withdrawnin August 2005. By 2008, only 2062 remained in service. The loco was generally on the Melba Line, but was occasionally used on the South Line. This loco was withdrawn in November 2009. The locomotives were stored at East Tamar Workshops after withdrawal. They were transported to One Steels scrap yard in Bell Bay in June 2012, where they were scrapped. The DQs and QRs were sold to AN Tasrail in 2001. By late 2015, DQs 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008 were placed into storage, requiring heavy overhauls and other work before being available for use. Although since then, DQ 2008 has since returned to service due to an locomotive shortage. In 2017, it was confirmed that DQ 2007 would be converted into a driving trailer for the Railton to Devonport cement trains, to replace DV 1. As of , it was still ongoing Withdrawal in New Zealand Following the sale of twelve DQs and three QRs locomotives to AN Tasrail, Tranz Rail retained DQs 6324, 6347, 6376 and 6382 and QRs 2027, 2079 and 2085. The trio of QRs were seen used as slave units on freight trains in both islands, and occasionally on the Coastal Pacific. In March/April 2000, DQs 6347 and 6376 were transferred to the South Island for the coal shuttles between Middleton and Lyttelton. In mid-November that year, DQs 6324 and 6382 were also allocated to the South Island for banking services between Oamaru and Dunedin. The locomotives were later used for banking services between Picton and Wharanui as well. The three QRs were withdrawn in mid-July 1999 and were placed into storage at Hutt Workshops. In 2003, the trio of QRs and the two un-rebuilt 1460 class locomotives were sold to the National Railway Equipment Company. In November 2005, the five locomotives were shipped to Mount Vernon, Illinois in the United States. The two 1460 class locomotives were overhauled are in use in the Southern Hemisphere. 1460 class locomotive NO 1500 is owned and operated by the Magadi Soda Company in Kenya, and renumbered as their NO 5001. 1501 is now owned and operated by CMP in Chile, and renumbered as their NO 9, and entered service for its new owner circa 2008. The other three are where they remain minus a number of components. DQs 6324 and 6382 were both withdrawn in 2002. 6382 was stored at Hillside Workshops and stripped of its six traction motors and other parts, while 6324 was placed on stand-by in Middleton Yard for the remaining two, which back then were used only on the coal dumps between Middleton and Lyttelton. 6324 was later placed into storage at Linwood Depot, and also used for spare parts. DQ 6376 was later withdrawn due to a defective main generator. These three locos were later returned to service after being overhauled at Hutt Workshops. On 20 June 2011, DQ 6376 was damaged when it, and leading unit DFT 7117, collided with a slip at Claverley, south of Kaikoura. It was then withdrawn and taken to Hutt Workshops and not returned to service, and became a source of spare parts. DQ 6324 was withdrawn in mid to late 2012 had worn its wheelsets down to the minimum code, and was also placed into storage at Hutt Workshops. In March 2013, DQs 6347 and 6382 were withdrawn from service and placed into storage in Middleton Yard. In February 2013, KiwiRail placed 6324 and 6376 up for sale overseas, with 6347 and 6382 in the following month. DQs 6347 and 6382 were sold via APEX International, while the other two were sold to the National Railway Equipment Company. 6347 and 6382 were towed from Middleton Yard to Auckland in April 2013, and were shipped from the Port of Auckland on 13 May in the same year. While the remaining two were towed north from Hutt Workshops in July 2013, and shipped on 4 August 2013. They were rebuilt in South Africa by RRL Grindrod for use in Mozambique. 6347 and 6382 have been reclassified as RRL22-02 and RRL22-01, while 6324 and 6376 were reclassified as BG15-01 and BG15-02. RRL22-01, RRL22-02 and BG15-01 are operated at the Nacala Corridor for a cement site, while BG15-02 was operated by the Harmony Mining Company in Welkom OFS. In October 2017, RRL22-01 and RRL22-02 were put up for sale by Grindrod. BG15-01 and BG15-02 were moved north crossed Beitbridge, and had Tazara painted on them.

It became the most successful educational textbook published in 17th century colonial United States and it became the foundation of most schooling before the 1790s. In the 17th century, the schoolbooks in use had been Bibles brought over from England. By 1690, Boston publishers were reprinting the English Protestant Tutor under the title of The New England Primer. The Primer included additional material that made it widely popular with colonial schools until it was supplanted by Noah Webster's Blue Back Speller after 1790. History The New England Primer was first published between 1687 and 1690 by printer Benjamin Harris, who had come to Boston in 1686 to escape the brief Catholic ascendancy under James II. It was based largely upon The Protestant Tutor, which he had published in England,A Famous Book -- \\"The New England Primer\\", The New York Times, November 14, 1897 and was the first reading primer designed for the American Colonies. The selections in the New England Primer varied somewhat over time, although there was standard content for beginning reading instruction. Included were the alphabet, vowels, consonants, double letters, and syllabaries of two letters to six letter syllables. The 90-page work contained religious maxims, woodcuts, alphabetical assistants, acronyms, catechism answers, and moral lessons. It was made with a thin sheet of horn or paper shellacked to a wooden board. The primer remained in print well into the 19th century and was even used until the 20th century. A reported 2 million copies were sold in the 18th century. No copies of editions before 1727 are known to survive; earlier editions are known only from publishers' and booksellers' advertisements. Theology Many of its selections were drawn from the King James Bible and others were original. It embodied the dominant Puritan attitude and worldview of the day. Among the topics discussed are respect to parental figures, sin, and salvation. Some versions contained the Westminster Shorter Catechism; others contained John Cotton's shorter catechism, known as Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes; and some contained both. David H. Watters argues that the Primer was built on rote memorization, the Puritans' distrust of uncontrolled speech, and their preoccupation with childhood depravity. By simplifying Calvinist theology the Primer enabled the Puritan child to define the \\"self\\" by relating his life to the authority of God and his parents.David H. Watters, \\"'I Spake as a Child': Authority, Metaphor and the New England Primer,\\" Early American Literature, Dec 1985, Vol. 20 Issue 3, pp 193-213 Emory Elliott argues that the Primer was part of the transformation that turned Puritans away from an angry and wrathful God the Father to the embrace of the gentle and loving Jesus Christ. Both of these notions, of course, reflect modern worldviews and perspectives, and cannot be assumed to speak accurately on behalf of the seventeenth century Puritans. Contents of the Primer Two of the most famous example verses are as follows :Now I lay me down to sleep, :I pray thee, Lord, my soul to keep; :If I should die before I wake, :I pray thee, Lord, my soul to take. ‚Äî1784 ed. :In Adam's Fall, :we sinned all. 750px 750px The text for L is alluded to in Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow: . . . \\"like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold\\" ...

In the books, Pandora is the love of Adrian's life. Pandora is beautiful (Adrian especially loves her 'treacle- coloured' hair) and intelligent, and in the first books, she and Adrian Mole are happy together. In the later books, Pandora resists Adrian's advances in favour of physically and intellectually powerful men, although Adrian remains attached to her. Character As a youth she is precocious and outspoken with firmly feminist and hard-left views. As she ages, she becomes successful but also manipulative and devious. Pandora's portrayal throughout the novel could be likened to that of a 'champagne socialist'. Pandora was a very important character in the series  Life  Pandora's parents were called Ivan and Tania. She came to Leicester at the age of 13 and sat with Adrian during Geography classes, and soon became the most popular girl in their class. She started dating Nigel, but they soon broke up. A few weeks later, on Wednesday (June 10, 1981), Adrian and Pandora started dating together. They had many short break-ups, until they finally ended their relationship in True Confessions. She attended the University of Oxford, studying Mandarin, Russian and Croatian. She graduated and married her first husband, Julian Twyselton- Fife, who was openly gay. This was a \\"favour\\" carried out by Julian. They cemented their love at London's Astoria G-A-Y nightclub after he drove for hours to pick her up. Her aversion to germs meant that she was unable to take a train. She had several liaisons and drifted apart from Adrian. Eventually she cohabited with Jack Cavendish, an old Professor of Linguistics. After many years they split up, with Jack revealing many of her secrets. Later, she entered politics in the New Labour era under Tony Blair and became a Labour MP for Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. She referred to herself as Pan National and The Shiniest Star in Blair's Sky, nicknames that the media picked up and subsequently used. However, she vocally opposed the Iraq War and was seen to be one of the Labour Party's most left-wing MPs. As an MP she is criticised for her expensive French wardrobe and shows little concern for her constituents; declaring that 'democracy is wasted on them'.

A person with gastroesophageal reflux disease(it may be caused by failure of cardiac or gastroesophageal sphincter or if cardiac sphincter remains relaxed) may have an acidic esophagus, particularly at the inferior (lower) end. Also, a person with a Meckel's diverticulum may have cells that produce acid within the diverticulum and therefore may be prone to peptic ulcers and perforation. A person with an unusual anatomy, such as one who has had a gastrectomy or an esophagectomy with transplantation of the ileum to replace the esophagus, may experience acidity in parts of the body that would not normally be acidic. In all normal humans and in almost all humans, only the gastrointestinal tract is peptic. Peptic diseases A common problem with the peptic areas of the body is peptic ulcer. These ulcers are most commonly caused by bacteria, and not by the acidic environment.

A small section remains in military use by the United States Air Force as a housing and administrative annex of Los Angeles Air Force Base. The fort is named after Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur. His son, Douglas MacArthur, would later command American forces in the Pacific during World War II. History In 1888, President Grover Cleveland designated an area overlooking San Pedro Bay as an unnamed military reservation intended to improve the defenses of the expanding Los Angeles harbor area. Additional land was purchased in 1897 and 1910, and Fort MacArthur was formally created on October 31, 1914. The fort was a training center during World War I, and the first large gun batteries for harbor defense were installed in 1917. The effectiveness of these fixed gun emplacements was debated for many years, and test firings were extremely unpopular with nearby residents, the concussion shattering windows in buildings and houses for miles around. In World War II, Fort MacArthur had a Harbor Entrance Command Post and a Harbor Defense Command Post for US seacoast defense of shipbuilding factories (e.g., CalShip, Todd Pacific), \\"giant aircraft factories\\" (Douglas, Hughes, Martin, Northrop), the Huntington Beach Oil Field, and the San Pedro Bay harbor (Port of Los Angeles & Port of Long Beach) which made the Los Angeles metropolitan area a target for attack. By the end of World War II the large guns were already being removed, with the last decommissioned in 1948. Battery Osgood-Farley is probably the best preserved example of a United States coastal defense gun emplacement, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. A second site, Battery John Barlow and Saxton, was added to the Register in 1982. Air defense During the early years of the Cold War, Fort MacArthur became a key part of the West Coast's anti-aircraft defenses, becoming the home base of the 47th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Brigade. A Nike surface-to-air missile battery was activated at the fort in 1954, remaining in service until the early 1970s. The Fort MacArthur Direction Center (DC) was the U.S. Army Air Defense Command Post (AADCP) for the Project Nike batteries of the Los Angeles Defense Area. It was located at Fort MacArthur from 1960. Purpose The Direction Center provided radar coverage for integrating the area's Integrated Fire Control (IFC) sites (16 sites for MIM-14 Nike-Hercules missiles until 1968). The DC had High Frequency Crosstell communication with the 1959‚Äì1966 Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Master Direction Center at Norton Air Force Base (DC-17) for coordinating Army intercepts of targets penetrating through the larger USAF Los Angeles Air Defense Sector defended by fighter aircraft. History During the Korean War, the fort's L-43 Lashup Radar Network site provided radar surveillance for the area from 1950 to 1952. The 669th Radar Squadron was assigned to the fort on January 1, 1951.compiled by On February 16, 1960, Lt Col James L McCallister was the Missile Director for the defense area. The Fort MacArthur Direction Center began in 1960 with an AN/FSG-1 computer that was the last of 10 installed and which replaced an Interim Battery Data Link (IBDL). The Army dedicated the DC's Missile Master bunker with an Antiaircraft Operations Center (\\"Blue Room\\") on December 14, 1960, prior to the USAF/FAA ARSR-1C radar opening in 1961 at San Pedro Hill Air Force Station. Fort MacArthur's 47th Artillery Brigade operated the DC, and the vacuum tube AN/FSG-1 was replaced on January 31, 1967, with a solid-state Hughes AN/TSQ-51 Air Defense Command and Coordination System. On November 15, 1968, the 19th Artillery Group (Air Defense) replaced the 47th Artillery Brigade in command of the DC and its batteries. The 19th Group deactivated July 1, 1974, after Project Concise ended Nike operations. The tennis courts next to the bunker remain at the former site of the AADCP's building 554, map published in Berhow/Gustafson 2002, p. 55. and the Missile Master nuclear bunker (building 550) was razed . Rundown of the fort In 1975 Fort MacArthur became a sub-post of Fort Ord, and the Army transferred ownership of the fort's Upper and Lower Reservations to the City of Los Angeles two years later. The Lower Reservation was cleared off and dredged and is now the city's Cabrillo Marina. Fort MacArthur's remaining Middle Reservation was transferred to the United States Air Force in 1982 for use by Los Angeles Air Force Base for administration and housing. In 1989, Madonna filmed some parts for her Like a Prayer video. Angels Gate Park The Upper Reservation is now a city park: San Pedro's Angels Gate Park, home of the Korean Bell of Friendship. It is also frequently used by television and motion picture companies. The artillery emplacements have been seen in the television series 24 and in films including Dragnet, Midway and Tora! Tora!

The Basilica Ulpia separates the temple from the main courtyard in the Forum of Trajan with the Trajan's Column to the northwest.Tomlinson, R. A. From Mycenae to Constantinople: the Evolution of the Ancient City. London: Routledge, 1992. Print. It was named after Roman emperor Trajan whose full name was Marcus Ulpius Traianus. It became perhaps the most important basilica after two ancient ones, the Basilicas Aemilia and Julia. With its construction, much of the political life moved from the Roman Forum to the Forum of Trajan. It remained so until the construction of the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. Unlike later Christian basilicas, it had no known religious function; it was dedicated to the administration of justice,https://www.britannica.com/art/Western- architecture/Roman-and-early-Christian#ref488547 commerce and the presence of the emperor. It was the largest in Rome measuring 117 by 55 meters (385 x 182 ft). Design and construction The Basilica Ulpia was composed of a great central nave with four side aisles, two on each side of the nave. The short sides of the structure formed apses, while the main entrance was via three doorways on the long east front overlooking the Forum of Trajan, which was one meter below the level of the Basilica. The columns and the walls were of precious marbles; the 50 meter (164 ft) high roof was covered by gilded bronze tiles. The east fa√ßade featured a portico with three projecting porches. The center porch framed the main entrance and was the grandest, with 10 columns of yellow marble supporting it. Atop the center porch over an elaborate attic and entablature was a gilt bronze quadriga (four-horse chariot) escorted by Victories, with the two flanking porches topped by bigae (two-horse chariots). Between the chariots were colossal statues of Trajan. The many rows of columns separating the side aisles are a traditional means of structure for basilicas. This method of structure can be traced back to Egyptian hypostyle Halls.The Forum of Trajan in Rome: A Study of the Monuments in Brief (2001) by James E. Packer; Roman Imperial Architecture (1981) by J. B. Ward-Perkins; Aulus Gellius: Attic Nights (1927) translated by John C. Rolfe (Loeb Classical Library). The Basilica Ulpia is very similar to one of the most famous hypostyle halls, Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak. The apse at the northeast end of the Basilica is labelled Libertatis on a fragment of the Marble Plan of Rome, which suggests that it assumed the functions of the Atrium Libertatis, previously located in the Forum Romanum, the place where slaves were legally manumitted. As such there was likely a shrine to Libertas placed in the apse. Many of the columns still exist on site, although a large number have fallen. The whole of the construction was decorated with war spoils and trophies from the Dacian Wars conducted under the command of Trajan. The frieze above the entrance was inscribed with the names of the victorious legions involved in the Dacian campaign. Later, it was used as the architectural prototype by Constantine as the basis for the layout of the new Christian churches. The Basilica Ulpia was used as to model for Constantine completion of the Basilica of Maxentius.Giavarini, Carlo., The Basilica of Maxentius: the Monument, its Materials , Construction, and Stability, Roma: L'Erma di Bretschneider, 2005. Excavations Remains of the Basilica Ulpia in Rome, a part of Trajan's Forum The Basilica Ulpia was first excavated by the occupying French government of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1813, after two convents on the site were demolished (Santo Spirito and di Santa Eufemia). In 1814 Pope Pius VII returned from exile and resumed the excavations: it was under Pius that the grey granite columns were reassembled on their bases and walls built to delineate the excavation area. The excavations also uncovered the remains of the pavement made from rare marbles, which gradually disappeared over the course of the 19th century due to rapacious tourists. Clement VII removed several of the yellow giallo antico marble columns which once flanked the doorways of the structure to Saint Peter's Basilica, where they were erected in the transept, while one went to the Lateran Palace. Part of the foundation of the basilica continues today under the modern Via dei Fori Imperiali, a trunk road constructed during the rule of Benito Mussolini.

Life Smith was born in Lindfield in the English county of Sussex, the eldest son of London merchant Francis Smith and Marie Josephine Villeneuve. Smith would acknowledge his mother's ancestry from French naval admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve by adopting her surname in 1861. The Smith family emigrated to the Australian colony of Van Diemen's Land (later called Tasmania) in 1826, settling in Campania near Richmond. Smith, however, returned to England to further his education, studying law at Middle Temple and arts at University College London. He was admitted to the Bar on 27 May 1842.J. M. Bennett, F. C. Green, 'Smith, Sir Francis Villeneuve (1819 - 1909)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp 144-145. In 1851 he became a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council and soon after became Solicitor-General until 1854. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1856. He was Attorney-General in William Champ's first ministry from 1 November 1856 until 26 February 1857. When William Weston's ministry (1857) collapsed he proceeded to form his own with himself as Premier and Attorney-General, he held office for three years until 1860 becoming the first Premier of Tasmania to hold office for more than one year.

Part of the Diocese of Wakefield, it is located along the top of a ridge above the town of Halifax. The A58 road into Lancashire divides here, with one fork, the A646, branching off towards Burnley via Hebden Bridge and the other going to Littleborough via Sowerby Bridge. During the English Civil War, when Halifax was a Royalist stronghold, King Cross was a key outpost, with the Parliamentarians holding parts of the Calder Valley. History During the First English Civil War (1642‚Äì1646) Halifax was a Royalist stronghold, with King Cross as a key outpost, on the roads between Lancashire and West Yorkshire, with the Parliamentarians holding parts of the Calder Valley. Before 1850, the area consisted of small hamlets and agricultural fields, in the parish of Halifax. With the onset of the industrial revolution, through the 18th and 19th centuries, the population steadily grew and King Cross was made a separate parish in 1845. A Commissioners' church, St. Paul's, designed by Robert Chantrell in 1845, Calderdale Council Website - St. Pauls Church, King Cross was built in 1847, with seating for 450 people. By the end of the 19th century, with a population of some 17,000, the older church of St. Paul's, built in 1847, had run out of space for burials. A decision was made in 1909 to build a new church designed by Sir Charles Nicholson, with seating for 1,000, nearby. Except for the tower, it was completed in 1912. Following a fire in the old St. Pauls in 1930, during which the roof was destroyed, the building was demolished in 1931, leaving only the tower and spire standing. With the increased space burials continued in the graveyard until 1969.St. Pauls church, Calderdale.gov.uk With 1,737 graves in the graveyard, the church asked the local council to take over the maintenance of the grounds. The area was designated as a \\"rest garden\\" in 1973, though with some considerable controversy. archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com - Halifax Courier article The current church of St. Paul's is notable for its acoustics and an unusual and highly colourful west window, dedicated in 1937 in memory of Canon Hugh Bright and designed by Hugh Ray Easton of Cambridge, who had also designed windows for Canterbury Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral and Durham Cathedral. The window depicts an apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax. The church was built from locally sourced stone, the inside walls being made of ashlar from the quarries at Sowerby, and the external walls of stone from the quarries of Northowram and Hipperholme. The first vicar of the old St. Paul's church, Reverend Samuel Danby, from 1847-1859, married Mary Dorothy Wainhouse, the daughter of Edward Wainhouse, the local dye works owner, who partly funded the building of the church.Malcolm Bull's Calderdale Companion The stained glass east window, designed by H.W. Bryans, in the new St. Pauls is dedicated in Edward Wainhouse's memory. In 1905, the Reverend H.S.

King Cross Prize Band At some point in the late 1800s, a brass band, conducted by Arthur Peace, Malcolm Bull Calderdale Companion - Arthur O peace was formed in the parish and although little is known of its history it was known to have taken part in local band competitions, with some memorable instances. It appeared at a command performance for Queen Victoria. On 8 August 1902, it played before Edward VII at Buckingham Palace and on 21 June 1911 the band returned there to play before King George V and Queen Mary. Malcolm Bulls Calderdale companion - King Cross Band King Cross police sub- station The area's first police station stood at the junction of Warley Road and Burnley Road on the site of a former Methodist chapel. The foundation stone was laid on 15 September 1910 and the station opened in May 1911. It had the Latin motto: \\"Ignorantia legis excusat neminem\\" (\\"Ignorance of the law excuses no-one\\") over the entrance. Following redevelopment in 1973, the building was demolished. Wainhouse tower Wainhouse Tower Wainhouse Tower, designed by the architect Isaac Booth, was originally designed as a chimney to serve the local dye works owned by John Edward Wainhouse, to satisfy the Smoke Abatement Act of 1870. Wainhouse was a keen advocate of smoke prevention and decided that a high chimney on the top of the hill would be beneficial for the townspeople. A much simpler chimney would have satisfied the requirements of the law, but with an interest in architecture Wainhouse insisted that it should be an object of beauty. It was erected in four years and completed on 9 September 1875, at a total cost of ¬£14,000. It is the tallest structure in Calderdale and the tallest folly in the world. Internally, it is high and externally , being built on sloping ground. It has an internal spiral staircase with 403 steps. The tower is maintained by Calderdale Borough Council and open to visitors at certain times of the year.Calderdale Borough Council Website An urban myth has arisen due to Wainhouse's long-standing conflict with his neighbour, Sir Henry Edwards, over water rights. Some people think that Wainhouse had built the tower solely in order to overlook Edwards' land after he had been made High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1871.

It was first hybridized by pioneer American agronomist and land developer William Wolfskill in the mid-19th century on his farm in Santa Ana, southern California, United States, North America.  History  Valencia oranges for sale. William Wolfskill (1798‚Äì1866) was an American born in Kentucky and reared in Missouri. He became a Mexican citizen in the 1820s, when in his 20s, while working in Santa Fe, New Mexico as a fur trapper, and then migrating to California, which was still Mexican at the time. He was given a land grant as a naturalized Mexican citizen under Mexican government rules. He cultivated numerous vineyards and grape varietals, and was the largest wine producer in the region. He continued to buy land, and later had sheep ranches, as well as developing extensive citrus orchards. He hybridized the Valencia orange, a sweet orange, naming it for Valencia, Spain, which had a reputation for its sweet orange trees. These had originally been imported from India. Before his death in 1866, Wolfskill sold his patented Valencia hybrid to the Irvine Ranch owners, who planted nearly half their lands to its cultivation. The success of this crop in Southern California led to the naming of Valencia, California. It became the most popular juice orange in the United States. In the mid 20th century, Florida botanist Lena B. Smithers Hughes introduced major improvements to the Valencia orange, developing virus-free strains for budwood production. These were so successful that, by 1983, the Hughes Valencia bud line made up some 60 percent of all Valencia oranges propagated for cultivation in Florida.Jean, Charlie (1987-12-21). \\"Lena Hughes, Orange Tree Researcher, Dies\\".

In 1988, Merleen Smith, a woman in Ventura County, California, contacted her local farm advisor on the suspicion that her neighbor was poisoning her tree. Investigators found that it was a pigmented bud sport of a conventional Valencia orange tree. The orange cultivar 'Smith Red Valencia' (with red insides) now bears her name.  Description  Primarily grown for processing and orange juice production, Valencia oranges have seeds, varying in number from zero to nine per fruit. Its excellent taste and internal color make it desirable for the fresh fruit markets, too. The fruit has an average diameter of , and a piece of this fruit which weighs has 45 calories and 9 grams of sugar. After bloom, it usually carries two crops on the tree, the old and the new. The commercial harvest season in Florida runs from March to June. Worldwide, Valencia oranges are prized as the only variety of orange in season during summer. Furthermore, Valencia oranges bring benefits because of the vitamin C and flavonoids contained. In 2012, the genome of the orange was sequenced, and was found to have with 29,445 protein-coding genes. It was also found that the sweet orange originated from a backcross hybrid between pummelo and mandarin orange.

The band's initial line up featured members of Samhain, Danzig, and AFI. Much like its members' other work, Son of Sam plays in the horror punk style, and also infuses metal and deathrock elements into their music. The name of the band was inspired by the iconic serial killer David Berkowitz, known as the notorious \\"Son of Sam\\".  History  In 1999, Youth was invited by Glenn Danzig to fill in the guitar position for the Samhain reunion tour, replacing Samhain's original guitarist, Pete \\"Damien\\" Marshall, who had opted out in order to tour with Iggy Pop. Playing guitar for the Samhain reunion inspired Youth to write an album worth of Samhain influenced music. Youth then contacted Steve Zing and London May (both ex-Samhain members), who were impressed with what Todd had written, and agreed to help him record an album. The project was dubbed \\"Son of Sam,\\" a nod to the fact that the band was spawned out of the Samhain reunion. Davey Havok, whose band, AFI, had opened for the Samhain reunion tour, was invited to write lyrics and record vocals for the album, since it was well known that Havok was a Samhain fan. In a short amount of time, they recorded an album of 10 tracks called Songs from the Earth and released it on Nitro Records in 2001 . \\"To me, doing this record was sort of a tribute to Samhain. Playing guitar for Samhain on the reunion tour was such an honor. I had forgotten how much I love and respect the band,\\" Youth stated. The album featured guest guitar and keyboard from Glenn Danzig on the tracks Stray and Songs From The Earth. In December 2007, messages on the Horror High website indicated that a follow up record was being made. Davey Havok did not return on vocals as although he has said numerous times that he would love to make a new Son of Sam album, he is unable to as he is constantly busy with commitments to AFI's record label, Interscope. Todd Youth released a statement saying while Havok would not be doing vocals, he gave the rest of the band his full blessing in seeking a replacement vocalist. Youth enlisted the talents of Chelsea Smiles bandmate Sky Vaughan-Jayne (real name Jonathan Ian Skye Jayne, and in this incarnation, Ian Thorne) to take up Havok's former mantle, and the band signed to Horror High records. The second album \\"Into The Night\\" was recorded and released in 2008. With the release of the second LP they embarked on a small American tour. On March 24th 2020 they announced a reunion on their Facebook page.https://www.facebook.com/TheOnlySonOfSam Discography  Albums  * Songs from the Earth (2001) * Into The Night (2008)  Other  * Son of Sam (2001) - Promotional CD intended for radio play featuring \\"Songs from the Earth\\" and \\"Satiate\\" * Punkzilla: The Compilation (2002) - Nitro Records compilation featuring \\"Michael\\"  Band members   Current members  * Ian Thorne - Vocals (2007‚Äì2008, 2020-present) * Steve Zing - Bass (2000‚Äì2001, 2007‚Äì2008, 2020-present) * Jack Cash - Guitar (2020-present) * Mike Christie - Guitar (2020-Present) * Mel McFail - Drums (2020-present) Former members * Davey Havok - Vocals (2000‚Äì2001) * Todd Youth - Guitars (2001-2001, 2007-2008; died 2018) * London May - Drums (2000‚Äì2001) * Karl Rosqvist - Drums (2007‚Äì2008)  References   External links  *Unofficial biography *Interview with Todd Youth on Trilogy Rock (Spain) Category:David Berkowitz Category:Heavy metal supergroups Category:Horror punk groups Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2001 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2007 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2008 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2020 ","title":"Son of Sam (band)"},{"id":"4283267","text":"Humppa-Akatemia is a 2000 compilation album by the Finnish group El√§kel√§iset.

It was founded in 1926 by the late Sir Tashi Namgyal, KCSI, KCIE, the 11th consecrated Ruler of Sikkim. It is an autonomous English- medium, co-educational and residential-cum-day school. The Founder Sir Tashi Namgyal Dudjom Rinpoche with Prince Paljor Namgyal and Maharani Kunzang Dechen Tshomo Namgyal. Sir Tashi Namgyal (Sikkimese: ‡Ωñ‡ΩÄ‡æ≤‡ºã‡Ω§‡Ω≤‡Ω¶‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω£‡ºã; Wylie: Bkra-shis Rnam-rgyal) (26 October 1893 ‚Äì 2 December 1963) was the ruling Chogyal (King) of Sikkim from 1914 to 1963. He was the son of Thutob Namgyal. Namgyal was the 11th ruler of the Namgyal dynasty of Sikkim, succeeding his half brother Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal, who had ruled from February to December in 1914, till his death from heart failure. Born in Tibet and crowned by the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, he was a strong advocate for closer links with India. He was married in October 1918 to Kunzang Dechen, and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters. The eldest son, Prince Paljor Namgyal, died in 1941 in a plane crash during World War II.Sack, John (1959). Report from Practically Nowhere. New York: Curtis Publishing Company. p. 221. On his death he was succeeded as Chogyal by his second son Palden Thondup Namgyal. During his reign, he is known for land reform and free elections.Sack, John (1959). Report from Practically Nowhere. New York: Curtis Publishing Company. pp. 221‚Äì222. He also favoured closer links between Sikkim, India and Tibet. Many people attribute his death to Indian agents. About a decade after his death, his son Palden Thondup Namgyal, the incumbent hereditary Chogyal was formally deposed. Prime Minister Lhendup Dorji appealed to India to change the status of Sikkim from protectorate to statehood. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim was officially made the 22nd state of Indian. Beginnings Tashi Namgyal Academy was founded in 1926 by the late Sir Tashi Namgyal, K.C.S.I. & K.C.I.E., the eleventh consecrated Ruler of Sikkim. The present Academy was shaped out of Sir Tashi Namgyal High School which was affiliated with Calcutta University. As a High School it was headed by three headmasters at various times, Mr. C.E. Dudley was the first headmaster. He established the school in the military barracks used by troops of Sir Francis Younghusband in 1903. Mr. A.K. Sarkar took over from Mr. Dudley and Mr. K.L. Kapoor was the last headmaster in the line. In 1956, Sir Tashi Namgyal took a decision to establish a public school in Sikkim. In April 1956, Mr. V.N. Langer, M.A (English), M.A. (Economics), LL.B. L.T., a Housemaster from Daly College, Indore was offered a post of Principal. He was entrusted with the task of organizing a new school and reorganizing the old one on modern lines, Mr. N.K. Rustumji, ICS, the then Dewan of Sikkim, was driving force in drawing out plans for a school which was to run on public school lines. Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal, second son of the Founder, along with Dewan N.K. Rustumji and Mr. V.N. Langer formed an excellent team to reorganize the school on public school lines, and they were the people who were the main architects of Tashi Namgyal Academy. A Governing Body for the administration, management and control of Sir Tashi Namgyal High School, Gangtok was constituted under the Chairmanship of Maharaja Kumar Saheb. Plans were drawn up first for the additional buildings for the public school and work started on some of these in 1957. The school was blessed by the August visit of Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru on 1 October 1958 who left behind his impressive remarks as: \\"It is a pleasure to visit this school so delightfully situated, young as it is, it has already developed well and the boys are bright and attractive looking. All best wishes for its progress.\\" In addition to this the then Political Officer of Sikkim and Bhutan, Shri Apa B. Pant, too, visited this school on 25 October 1958 and left behind the following comments; \\"Whenever I visit this school, I see each time change-change for the better. I am sure that under able guidance of Shri Langer this school will develop into an institution where not only future citizens of Sikkim will learn to serve their country, but where sectarianism, communalism, bigotry, small mindedness, pursuit of power will have no place. Let us hope that this institution will guide the youth of Sikkim to become humane, compassionate and full of spirit of humanity and service and in short to follow Dharma.\\" The year 1959 was a landmark in the annals of the institution. On the auspicious occasion of the opening of the Annexe of Tashi Namgyal Academy, the main school building on 14 April 1959, His Highness Sir Tashi Namgyal outlined the reason for which the school was renamed as Tashi Namgyal Academy. He said, \\"In the past it has been difficult for children of poor parents to enjoy the advantage of the best possible schooling as they could not afford admission to the more highly organized institution in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and elsewhere. It has been decided, therefore, to build up an institution in Sikkim itself which would stand comparison with the best institution of its kind outside the country. This institution would not be a substitute for, but in addition to the normal type of High Schools that has been established in other parts of Sikkim. As, however, the standard of teaching would be of a higher level of a special nature, the institution being designated as an \\"Academy\\". In course of time, when we also have been able to establish, in addition to the Academy the usual pattern of High School in Gangtok, the fees for admission to the Academy will be proportionately raised. But the Darbar will ensure that there will be ample scope for meritorious children of poor parents to gain admission to the Academy on the result of Competitive Scholarship Examinations. Apart from the purpose, this academy will provide a higher quality of schooling within Sikkim itself, an equally important objective will be to impart a pattern of education particularly suited to special needs of Sikkim. Our patterns of education should, therefore, be so designed that students will be inspired with love of country and that from this love of country should arise also this view that we have chosen the new motto ‚Äì for the Academy ‚Äì \\"Service Through Knowledge\\". For it is their hope that the knowledge that will be imparted here will be directed, above all, to service, and such service must comprise, above all, service to country. The new school crest has been designed on the pattern of traditional Sikkimese Art. It portrays the sword that cuts away ignorance, symbolizing knowledge, while the Mountains that form the background are the mountains of the motherland, the sacred peak of Khangchendzonga. And so its crest too, symbolizes the spirit of the Academy, which is the seeking of knowledge not for its own sake, but for service to country and in the spirit of Sikkim‚Äôs culture and religious heritage. \\"In opening this new Annexe, I express my confident hope that Academy will in due course, rear citizens of whom Sikkim will have reason to be proud, that it will grow in stature and gain in luster as the cradle of Sikkim‚Äôs future generations and so the moulder of her destiny.\\" Maharaja Kumar Palden Thondup Namgyal, the Chairman of the Governing Body, on the occasion of the opening of the Annexe said, \\"The Principal objective of the Darbar has been to provide education that will be consistent both with the culture, heritage and economic conditions of Sikkim. So that youths of Sikkim may grow into people with love for one‚Äôs country and heritage and useful citizens of Sikkim\\". On 26 May 1959, the Rules concerning Departmental procedures of the Academy and on 24 December 1959 Financial and Administrative Powers of the Principal were defined. With the additional buildings and a defined campus, the Junior Section was started with classes from Kindergarten to class III. Increase in students roll necessitated another hostel in the two-storied building then known as Northern Block, half for Nepali boarders and half for Bhutia-Lepcha boarders with a dining hall at the site now occupied by Science Block with separate kitchens for Nepali and Bhutia-Lepcha boys. The old junior school block where Lower Kindergarten classes were held then served as the Hall with a capacity of approximately 300 people with a low stage. In October 1961, the Auditorium was opened with a seating capacity of 600 built at a cost of Rs. 3 Lakhs. The same year the school was upgraded to the Higher Secondary Level (Class XI) and the first batch passed out in 1964. In May 1964, another New Hostel was added across the Football field (the present Boys‚Äô Hostel), the campus was demarcated with two main gates, the upper Gate and the Main Lower Gate, and both built in traditional Sikkimese architecture. In 1964 the idea of reorganizing Tashi Namgyal Academy on public school lines as coeducational institution was implemented. It was decided to have in the beginning only seven classes starting from Kindergarten to VI as the highest class and then to go on adding one higher class every year till it reached class XI, the Final School Certificate Stage. This policy, it was hoped, would enable to build up an institution in which even through medium of instruction and the first language English it would remain Sikkimese in its tradition and culture. It was decided to follow the outline approved for the Anglo-Indian schools. A school uniform had been designed and selection of textbooks done. The first prospectus was published in 1965 and admissions to various classes of the public school were declared open simultaneously. Posts of teachers were advertised in the leading newspapers and tenders for uniforms were invited from local dealers. In March 1966, Tashi Namgyal Academy was reorganized along Public School lines with English as the medium of instruction and the first language. This idea led to the shifting of Sir Tashi Namgyal Higher Secondary School to the Development Area in Gangtok, along with approximately 14 members of teaching staff and majority of students especially from classes VII and above. Facilities for all round development of the faculties through large variety of cultural activities were provided. There were hobbies such as painting, woodcraft, leather work, dance, drama, music, sewing, and knitting. The major games played were football, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, basketball, hockey, netball, baseball, and cricket. It is the only school in Gangtok to have a swimming pool at this altitude. New artificial turf at TNA 2019 The school is also the only one to have an artificial turf after Paljor Stadium in Gangtok. The annual Inter House 3-day Track and Field sports meet is called the Mini Olympics and has the ceremonial lighting of fire too. Some of the elder staff of Higher Secondary School who had been retained, gallantly rose to meet the pressing demands of the situation. Mrs. Langer, wife of the Principal, Mr. V.N. Langer, took over the responsibility of organizing the hostel and its routine so that it may be ready to receive the boarders when they come a day before the start of the session in March 1966. Altogether 130 students were on roll (both boys and girls), more than what was expected in the first year and more than what could be managed by the available staff. As days rolled by the staffing problem was solved to some extent. A new matron took over charge of the Hostel leaving Mrs. Langer free to devote herself to teaching work, two more teachers were appointed, one for additional section of K.G. class and the other to teach English to senior classes. A programme for weekly terminal tests also was drawn out and monthly and terminal reports made their appearance.Deja Vu : The TNA Alumni Magazine Aims and objectives The institution aims to provide sufficient academic knowledge for a child to be able to meet the standards required to complete his college course without much strain. The child must possess a healthy disposition to life, a reasoning mind and an attitude of service. He must not be divorced from the social order and show good sportsmanship, be creative, unselfish and courageous. He should not be afraid of truth and justice and have sufficient pride for his country's culture and heritage. He should not be afraid to face unpopularity or to maintain an independent opinion. He should show friendliness, good manners and temper his emotions, showing discipline and responsibility. Campus The school has a rectangular-shaped compound, measuring about bound by the National Highway (NH-10) to Nathula in the southwest and the road leading to Raj Bhavan in the northeast. Starting from the Upper Main Gate down to the Lower Main Gate there is an open air-theatre, football ground, swimming pool, principal‚Äôs bungalow, three multi-storey buildings, 27 single and double unit staff quarters spread all over the school campus, two hostels for boys, one hostel for girls including hostel staff quarters, one kitchen and a hostel dining hall, a large auditorium with a capacity of 600 including a gallery, seven double/three-storey buildings for classrooms, Science Block (previously consisting of laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Home Science, now shifted to the new Annexe Block since 2006), Common Rooms, Workshops and an Administrative Block. There is one greenhouse for cultivation of orchids and rare species of plants and facing it is a children‚Äôs park. The school has a library with over 25,000 books. There are three athletic fields, one each for Football, Volleyball, Basketball and well laid out flower beds, sprawling lawns and green slopes spread all over the campus. It is adorned with pine and eucalyptus trees. The month of December sees the whole of campus turning pink with cherry blossoms. House System The House system at Tashi Namgyal Academy was introduced at the very inception to promote healthy competition amongst students. The House flags with their respective emblems were designed at a later date. The four Houses are Yuksam House, Zongri House, Phensong House and Karponang House. Yuksam House Yuksam House is named after the historical site in West Sikkim where in 1642 AD. three Lamas from Tibet; Lhatsun Namkha Jigme Namgyal, Kathoke Sampa Chenpo and Ngadak Rinzing Chenpo met and crowned the first Chogyal (Dharma Raj) Phuntsok Namgyal, in accordance with the prophecy by Guru Rinpoche. Zongri House Zongri House is named after a mountain top just on the way to the Khangchendzonga base camp from where the entire Khangchendzonga massif is visible. It also lies in West Sikkim. The meaning of the word is derived from the words -'Zong' meaning fort and 'Ri' -meaning Hill. Phensong House Phensong House is named after a place on the way to Mangan, the District Headquarters of North Sikkim. The word is derived from the words phen ‚àí meaning benefit and song meaning excellence. The Monastery at Phensong attracts many visitors. Karponang House Karponang House is named after a place in East Sikkim on the way to the Nathula Pass. The original place name, according to its local history, is derived from a distortion of Nang Karpo. During the Younghusband Expedition to Tibet of 1903‚Äì1904, on seeing a white-coloured house a British officer exclaimed \\"Karpo Nang!\\" Karpo means white, and Nang means house, so this can be literally translated as white house. Affiliation The school is affiliated with the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, New Delhi, established by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, UK, and prepares students for the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (Class X) and the Indian School Certificate (Class XII) Examinations.

The Act, which was passed in 1967 empowers the Government of Singapore in incriminating and punishing both individuals and corporates that are involved in the sale, supply, exhibition, or distribution of obscene and objectionable publications. Overview The UPA looks after matters relating to the importation, distribution or reproduction of undesirable publications. Together with the Penal Code, Films Act and the Children and Young Persons Act, the UPA law also seeks to protect all persons, including children, from being exploited for pornography especially child pornography. Under the UPA, it may be a punishable offence to make, sell or distribute objectionable publications, including calendars. Other than pornography, objectionable publication that may also fall under the jurisdiction of the UPA include those that offend racial and religious harmony on the island, e.g. hate speech. If a work concerns any race or religion in a certain manner such that feelings of enmity, hatred, or hostility were to be aroused, this very publication may be deemed objectionable as well. Anti-colonial and Communist material were once banned by the UPA, but the ban has since been lifted after a review by the Media Development Authority (MDA). Review of gazetted publications are conducted in consultation with the Publications Consultative Panel, whereas 17 publications, mostly pornographic that still remain officially prohibited in Singapore may include: # All publications by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society # All publications by International Bible Students Association # Playboy # Swank # Girls of Penthouse # Gallery # Elite # Penthouse # Men Only # Genesis # Playgirl # Velvet # Mayfair # Fiesta # Hustler # Knave # Cheri A grey area of this law may be that of taking and keeping photos of oneself having sex. Taking photographs or videos of oneself having sex or of others without taking payment is not against the law, however, dissemination of such materials is an infringement of the UPA. Uses of the Act Janet Jackson's 2001 album All for You was banned under the UPA over sexually explicit lyrics in one of the songs \\"Would You Mind\\". Taking part in an outdoor nude photo shoot may trigger the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act instead of the UPA, as in the case of two tourists taking nude photographs at Sentosa in 2016. In 2004, Steve Chia of the National Solidarity Party was let off with a warning after being found in possession of an obscene film. In 2008, Ong Kian Cheong and Dorothy Chan Hien Leng were charged under both the Sedition Act and Undesirable Publications Act for allegedly distributing evangelistic publication titled The Little Bride that cast Prophet Muhammad in negative light.

Since it opened in 1914 as the first museum in New Jersey that granted access to the public and the first dedicated solely to art, it has been privately funded. Its collection of more than 12,000 items and its exhibit programs are dedicated to American art and Native American art forms, as well as contemporary art in both those disciplines. The museum sponsors a wide variety of programs in partnership with local organizations and maintains an extensive educational program for all age groups. For decades, MAM's Yard School of Art has provided opportunities for formal instruction to students at both amateur and professional levels. Collection The Montclair Art Museum (MAM) is one of the few museums in the United States devoted to American art and Native American art forms. The collection consists of more than 12,000 works. The American collection comprises paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, and sculpture dating from the 18th century to the present. The museum's holdings of traditional and contemporary American Indian art and artifacts represent the cultural achievements in weaving, pottery, wood carving, jewelry, and textiles of indigenous Americans from seven major regions‚ÄîNorthwest Coast, California, Southwest, Plains, Woodlands, Southeast, and the Arctic; the work of contemporary American Indian artists is also represented. The museum has the only gallery in the world dedicated solely to the work of the 19th-century American painter George Inness, who lived in Montclair from 1885 to 1894 and painted in the area. MAM's Inness paintings are, according to one critic, \\"the crown of the Montclair Art Museum's collection\\". The intimate George Inness Gallery displays selected works from the museum's 21 Inness paintings, two of his watercolors, and an etching by the artist.Web page titled \\"George Inness Gallery\\" at the Montclair Art Museum website, retrieved December 18, 2012 It also features the work of sculptor William Couper, who lived in Montclair for fifteen years while sculpting and for another thirty in retirement. Artists represented in the collection include Tony Abeyta, Josef Albers, Milton Avery, Will Barnet, Romare Bearden, Thomas Hart Benton, Carl Borg, Margaret Bourke- White, Alexander Calder, Ching Ho Cheng, Thomas Cole, Willie Cole, Stuart Davis, Willem de Kooning, Richard Diebenkorn, Elsie Driggs, Asher B.

History The arrival of the railroad in Montclair in the 1830s transformed a rural agricultural village into a prosperous suburban community, with a rail link to New York that was too expensive for the working class that traveled by street cars and trolleys. Montclair's arts community centered on landscape painter George Inness, who visited for several seasons beginning in 1878 and made it his home from 1885 until he died in 1894, when the New York Times described Montclair as \\"the home of more prominent artists and wealthy art connoisseurs, probably, than any other place in New-Jersey.\\" Others had preceded him as early as the 1860s, when illustrators Harry Fenn and Charles Parsons commuted by rail to their New York City studios, just as Inness and others did in the decades that followed. They were year-round resident-commuters and varied in their stylistic approaches, unlike the impressionists that abandoned city life to gather for the summer in the \\"art colonies\\" at the end of the 19th century in Cos Cob and Old Lyme, Connecticut, and New Hope, Pennsylvania. Charles Eaton painted in a style much like that of Inness and Frederick Judd Waugh devoted himself to seascapes, while painter Henry Rankin Poore preferred a \\"workaday realism \\" in subject and texture of brushwork and his colleague Frederick Ballard Williams adopted a \\"more rough-hewn and turbulent form\\". Walter and Emilie Greenough worked as stained-glass designers in the studio of John LaFarge, who lived in Montclair for a time as well. Sculptors included Jonathan Scott Hartley, Inness's son- in-law, and William Couper. The town created a Village Improvement Society in 1878, superseded by a Municipal Art Commission in 1908, to beautify Montclair and preserve the charm of a country town. The Commission's head was William T. Evans, an Irish immigrant dry-goods magnate who had acquired the Inness estate in 1900. Between the early 1880s and 1913, Evans amassed a collection of more than 800 American paintings, by far the largest collection of American art before World War I. In 1907, he donated several dozen works to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and grew that number to 160 by the time of his death in 1918. In 1909, Evans offered to donate 26 oil paintings to the town of Montclair on condition that it provide a fireproof gallery space to house and display them. The proposal was defeated in a referendum in 1910. In response to that rejection, on December 8, 1910, the Municipal Art Commission transformed itself into the Montclair Art Association and proposed to create and manage an art gallery without government support. Raising funds still proved difficult until another Montclair resident, Florence Rand Lang (1861-1943), agreed to bear most of the expense and her gift of $50,000, much of it for the purchase of the site, transformed the project from a gallery into a museum. She had arrived in Montclair from Massachusetts as a teenager in 1873. Her initial donation was the first of many that totaled more than $250,000 over the next thirty years, plus $200,000 in her will and more from her estate. She was heir to much of the Rand family fortune, amassed by her father Jasper Rand (1837-1909) and bachelor uncle Addison C. Rand (1841-1900), who together had founded Rand Drill Company in 1871. Needing a dedicated structure to house the collections, museum trustee Michel Le Brun hired Albert R. Ross to design a neoclassical building. Ross had worked on several Carnegie libraries and the Pueblo County Courthouse (1908-12) in Colorado. When the museum opened on January 15, 1914, it was the first museum in New Jersey that granted access to the public and the first dedicated solely to art. On the circular lawn in front of the museum's entrance, the founders placed a bronze sculpture by Hermon Atkins MacNeil, The Sun Vow, another gift from Evans. It remains there as a signature piece for the museum, blending Native American and American themes. At its opening the museum had two collections gifted by its principal organizer, Evans, and its principal funder, Lang. Evans' donation of American art included 2 sculptures and 54 paintings, among them works by George Inness, Ralph Albert Blakelock, and Childe Hassam. Lang donated a collection of Native American art amassed by her mother, Annie Valentine Rand. The Rand Collection's several hundred objects included baskets, clothing, jewelry, and household items. The museum's holdings have expanded by means of acquisitions and donations. In 1922, the museum invited Montclair residents to vote for their favorite among 25 works for acquisition. The museum's art committee overrode the winning work by the impressionist Daniel Garber and instead purchased a work by the comparatively avant-garde Arthur Bowen Davies, Meeting in the Forest (1900), a depiction of nudes in a landscape in the Symbolist style.Charlotte Moser, \\"Davies, Arthur B.\\" in Joan M. Marter, ed., The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1, 25-6 In the 1930s the museum was less open to modernists, and in the 1940s it tried to counter that reputation by having works for its annual exhibit of local artists' work selected by two juries, traditional and modern, a procedure abandoned when artists objected to having to characterize themselves in such a fashion. The building has since expanded along with the collection. The museum grew with additional gifts from Lang that allowed the front portico and mezzanine to be completed in 1924 and a new East Wing added in 1931 to house the Rand Collection. In the 1950s the high-ceilinged North Gallery was divided horizontally. The most recent renovation by architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle in 2000-2001 added a new wing that doubled the museum's square footage. To mark its 75th anniversary, MAM published Three Hundred Years of American Painting: The Montclair Art Museum Collection. It provided detailed entries for 538 paintings, detailed discussion of 32 of them, and a set of thematic essays.Marilyn S. Kushner, ed., Three Hundred Years of American Painting: The Montclair Art Museum Collection (The University of Chicago Press), reviewed by Elinor Nacheman in Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America, vol. 9, no. 2 (Summer 1990), p. 112; available online In 1999, MAM collaborated on American Tonalism: Selections from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Montclair Art Museum.Kevin J. Avery and Diane P. Fischer, eds., American Tonalism: Selections from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Montclair Art Museum (Montclair Art Museum, 1999), reviewed by Martin Hopkinson in The Burlington Magazine, vol. 142, no. 1168 (July 2000), p. 453; available online In January 2009, the museum announced it had transferred most of its LeBrun Library to the Harry A. Sprague Library at Montclair State University, a public institution that accepts library cards from public libraries in Essex and Passaic counties. On occasion, MAM has mounted exhibits that bridge its interest in contemporary and Native American art. A 2001-2 exhibit explored Albert Bierstadt's depiction of encounters between European settlers and Native Americans, using its collection of Indian art to create conversations with two monumental Bierstadt oils. In 2005, it presented \\"Roy Lichtenstein: American Indian Encounters\\" to explore a 20th-century American artist's fascination with and use of motifs from Native American art to critique their clich√©d use by earlier artists. It included a Lichtenstein parody of Bierstadt, a variation on the Indian head nickel, and attempts to incorporate Indian symbolism into cubist and sureralist imagery. MAM also features exhibits that highlight its region. It participates with other institutions and the New Jersey State Council on the Arts in New Jersey Arts Annual: Fine Arts, which develops juried exhibitions of works by local artists. For example, as part of that program, in 2012 MAM presented 13 works that explored technology and \\"sampling, appropriating and remaking older artworks\\" in an exhibit called \\"New Media: New Forms\\". In 2014, \\"Robert Smithson's New Jersey\\" explored how the artist's early exploration of the landscape and excavations near Paterson and Rutherford, New Jersey, inform Robert Smithson's later collages and land art projects. One critic wrote in The New Yorker: \\"This might seem like just more hopeful boosterism by a Garden State that exists in the shadow of a Big Apple, except that it‚Äôs true.\\" In 2009, the museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art organized the exhibition \\"C√©zanne and American Modernism,\\" with 131 items, including 18 works by C√©zanne. In a news release, MAM called the show \\"the largest, most ambitious exhibition in the 95-year history of the museum.\\" After appearing in Montclair, the exhibition traveled to the Baltimore and to the Phoenix Art Museum. Published in conjunction with the exhibit: Gail Stavitsky and Katherine Rothkopf, eds., C√©zanne and American Modernism (Yale University Press, 2009) As its centennial year approached, MAM undertook a fundraising campaign to double its endowment to $20 million. It also mounted an exhibition of contemporary sculpture based on the gifts of New Jersey resident Patricia A. Bell over the last 20 years to underscore its commitment to the contemporary arts scene. To mark its centenary in 2014, on the anniversary date, it lit a new installation by Spencer Finch, Yellow, that filled the windows on the first level of the museum's facade with a soft glow that suggests someone is home, countering in some measure the formality of the architecture. Other programs The museum's educational programs serve a wide public, from toddlers to senior citizens. Collaborations with numerous cultural and community partners bring artists, performers, and scholars to the museum on a regular basis. MAM's Yard School of Art is a regional art school offering an array of classes for children, youth, adults, seniors, and professional artists. In the summer of 2014, MAM launched a new community outreach program called the Art Truck, using an ice cream truck refurbished with funds from a grant from the Partners for Health Foundation. A pilot program in its first year, the Art Truck brought art instructors and supplies to conduct open studio art classes at sites in several New Jersey counties, including town pools, senior centers and assisted living facilities, local festivals, and farmers markets.

Those who espouse phonocentric views maintain that spoken language is the primary and most fundamental method of communication whereas writing is merely a derived method of capturing speech. Many also believe that spoken language is inherently richer and more intuitive than written language. These views also impact perceptions of sign languages ‚Äì especially in the United States. Oralism is the belief that deaf students should use sounds, speech reading, and primarily English instead of signs in their education. Alexander Graham Bell is a well known proponent for oralism of the deaf ‚Äì such phonocentristic views are rejected by the Deaf community. Phonocentrism in the context of deafness is referred to as audism. Some writers have argued that philosophers such as Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Ferdinand de Saussure have promoted phonocentric views. Walter Ong, who has also expressed support for the idea of phonocentrism, has argued that the culture of the United States is particularly non-phonocentric. Some philosophers and linguists, notably including the philosopher Jacques Derrida, have used the term \\"phonocentrism\\" to criticize what they see as a disdain for written language. Derrida has argued that phonocentrism developed because the immediacy of speech has been regarded as closer to the presence of subjects than writing. He believed that the binary opposition between speech and writing is a form of logocentrism. Advocates of phonocentrism The philosopher John Searle has argued that Plato expressed some skepticism about the value of writing relative to speech. The rhetorician and philosopher Walter Ong also believes that Plato was phonocentric. He argues that Plato had a clear preference for \\"orality over writing.\\" However, he notes that Plato's belief in phonocentrism was both contrived and defended textually, and is therefore paradoxical. Rousseau also held views that have since been characterized as phonocentric. He discussed the topic in Essay on the Origin of Languages. He believed that speech was a more natural form of communication than writing, which he viewed as a somewhat parasitic and unhealthy derivation of speech. The linguist Leonard Bloomfield has also expressed the belief that spoken languages are the primary form of language, and that written languages should be viewed as derived from them. He argued that \\"writing is not language, but merely a way of recording language.\\" Saussure believed that speech should be treated as the primary topic of linguistics. He believed that writing was given too much attention in the field of linguistics. In Course in General Linguistics, Saussure argued that \\"language and writing are two distinct systems of signs.\\" He believed that both systems influenced each other, but that writing could obscure language. He argued that writing obscures how pronunciation forms because of its influence on pronunciation. Saussure drew a distinction between phonetic languages and languages such as Chinese in which a single character represents a word. He believed that only phonetic languages cause problems for linguists. Ong has argued that American society is particularly opposed to phonocentrism. He believes that one cause of this is the fact that written documents, such as the United States Constitution, form a key part of American national identity. He also notes that many Americans view the reality of words as defined by dictionaries rather than by vocal speech. He has stated, \\"We are so literate in ideology that we think writing comes naturally. We have to remind ourselves from time to time that writing is completely and irremediably artificial.\\" Ong believes that writing is necessary for transmitting knowledge in a technological culture. He maintains that speech should be viewed as primary because it is drawn from the unconscious while writing requires conscious attention: \\"Speech is structured through the entire fabric of the human person. Writing depends on consciously contrived rules.\\" He also states that writing and speech are each privileged in specific ways, and that they depend upon each other for identification and clarity. Derrida Derrida believed that the fields of philosophy, literature, anthropology, and linguistics had become highly phonocentric. He argued that phonocentrism was an important example of what he saw as Western philosophy's logocentrism. He maintained that phonocentrism developed due to the human desire to determine a central means of authentic self-expression. He argued that speech is no better than writing, but is assigned that role by societies that seek to find a transcendental form of expression. This form of expression is said to allow one to better express transcendental truths and to allow one to understand key metaphysical ideas. Derrida believed that phonocentric cultures associate speech with a time before meaning was corrupted by writing. He saw phonocentrism as part of the influence of Romanticism, specifically its belief in a time in which people lived in harmony and unity with nature. Derrida did not believe that there was any ideal state of unity with nature. He also argued that speech suffers from many of the same inherent flaws as writing. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has characterized Derrida's opposition to phonocentrism as part of his campaign against \\"human egocentricity.\\" Derrida points out that the expression of human views is often dominated by the voices of humans. He also noted that writing frees expression from the human voice and is more exterior and stable than speech. He believed that this makes it a more effective carrier of meaning. Randal Holme has argued that Derrida preferred writing because he associated it with \\"the construction of meaning and the creation of category.\\" Derrida identified the often perceived difference between the value of speaking versus writing as one of the key binary oppositions of logocentrism. He attempted to deconstruct this opposition by arguing that speech can be seen as derived from writing as easily as writing is seen as derived from speech. He wrote that societies often make determinations that unfairly casts writing as an inferior method of communication and self-expression. Derrida insisted that the written word has its own value, and is likely not \\"the simple 'supplement to the spoken word.'\\" In Of Grammatology he uses this method of analysis to critique the views that Rousseau expressed in Essay on the Origin of Languages. Derrida argued that Rousseau's views were contradictory and often undermined his arguments. Criticism Searle has criticized Derrida's claims of historical opposition to phonocentrism. Searle believes that many philosophers, including Aristotle, Gottfried Leibniz, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell, have \\"tended to emphasize written language as the more perspicuous vehicle of logical relations.\\" He argues that support for ordinary speech over written language only emerged in the 1950s with the advent of Ordinary language philosophy. He also contends that Derrida makes sweeping misinformed claims about the history of writing. Geoffrey Hartman has also criticized Derrida's accounts of phonocentrism.

He had earned money for land in a decade as a fur trapper near Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he had become a Mexican citizen. This allowed him to own land in California. Wolfskill was highly influential in the development of California's agricultural industry in the 19th century, establishing an expanded viticulture and becoming the largest wine producer in the region. One of the wealthiest men for his time, he expanded his holdings, running sheep and cultivating oranges, lemons and other crops. He is credited with establishing the state's citrus industry and developing the Valencia orange. It became the most popular juice orange in the United States and was the origin of the name of Valencia, California. With his brother John Reid Wolfskill, in 1842 William bought a large parcel in the Sacramento Valley; they called this Rancho Rio de los Putos, later known as the Wolfskill Ranch. The brothers later divided this land, near what is now Winters, California, where John Wolfskill established orchards and vineyards. Three other Wolfskill brothers migrated to California, working first with John in the north. History Wolfskill moved to New Mexico in 1821, while the region was a province of Mexico called Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. He spent ten years fur trapping in the New Mexico area, as the fur trade was highly lucrative. In 1828 he became a naturalized Mexican citizen. Wolfskill left Taos, New Mexico, in September 1830 with a party of mountain men that included George C. Yount. When they arrived in Southern California in early 1831 (using the trail Smith had mapped across the Mojave desert), Wolfskill and Yount went to the coast to hunt sea otter. Wolfskill eventually returned to Southern California while Yount decided to go north, and the two parted company. Yount settled in the Napa Valley. As a naturalized citizen of Mexico, Wolfskill was allowed to own land and acquired a parcel where downtown Los Angeles now stands. He began to cultivate grapevines for wine. He eventually planted 32,000 vines on a 48-acre vineyard. Initially, he planted mission vines, which had been introduced by the Spanish missionaries. He expanded his plantings to include other varietals later. With his brother John Reid Wolfskill, who came to California later, he bought a large parcel in the Sacramento Valley, which John called Ranch del Rio de los Putos after a nearby creek. It was later known as the Wolfskill Ranch. The brothers later divided this land, near what is now Winters, California in the Sacramento Valley, where John Wolfskill established orchards and vineyards. Three younger Wolfskill brothers, Milton, Mathus, and Satchal, also migrated to that region, settling and working with John. By his death in 1866, William Wolfskill was producing 50,000 gallons of wine a year. He was, by far, the greatest producer of table grapes in California during the Mexican era. He has been ranked by historians as one of the three most important men in the history of California viticulture. Wolfskill's neighbor, friend and business rival in the tiny pueblo of Los Angeles, was the French immigrant Jean-Louis Vignes. For his time, Wolfskill was one of the wealthiest men in Southern California. He owned large tracts of land throughout the region, which he used for everything from sheep grazing to orange groves. He developed the Valencia orange, which became the most popular juice orange in the United States and was widely cultivated in southern California. It was the origin of the name of Valencia, California. Wolfskill is also credited with developing and building the first schooner in California. John Bidwell, another early American pioneer in California, notes Wolfskill in his memoir as among European Americans he knew in early Mexican Los Angeles: > Los Angeles I first saw in March, 1845. It then had probably two hundred and > fifty people [referring to non-Native Americans only], of whom I recall Don > Abel Stearns, John Temple, Captain Alexander Bell, William Wolfskill, Lemuel > Carpenter, David W.

Biography First incarnation Following the split of his former band Mouth in 1994, Tasmanian musician Tim Evans began jamming with U.F.O. (Unlimited Friendly Objective) frontman Zach von Bamburger. Fusing the elements of thick, rough analogue guitar noise and hidden melodies, also aided by a drum machine, the duo recorded the $100,000 Dollar Mamal (sic) EP. Vocal and instrumental duties were shared by the duo on the polycarbonate-only pressing, as they were in live shows. Live shows were often chaotic affairs marked by loud feedback, repetitive rhythms and heavily distorted bass riffs. Shortly after the release of the EP, Monika Fikerle became the band's drummer. Idiosyncratic, but contumelious with the band's minimal yet full sound, Fikerle played her kit with a complete absence of snare drum. Following a short tour of the mainland, Fikerle left the band and the band folded six months later. Second incarnation A year after parting company with von Bamburger, Evans restarted the band with bassist Alex Pope, reinterpreting old and composing new material with a drum machine. After several months of gigging, ex-U.F.O bassist Andy Hazel joined on drums, introducing snare and hi-hat to the previously more stripped-back sound. Later in 1996, Sara May Libero replaced Hazel on drums, continuing the band's use of (Moe Tucker style) stand-up drummers. This lineup recorded the band's first full length album Pattern Recognition, on four track cassette recorder and released via Chapter Music in 1997, on vinyl only. In 1997, the band toured Melbourne and Sydney, supporting Pavement and, in 1998, Archers of Loaf before Libero was replaced by Fikerle, who re-joined the group to jam a newer set of songs. Later that year the band recorded their second album, Beacon of Hope, released on the Unstable Ape label In the same sessions, the band re-recorded an intentionally cleaner, \\"less scabby\\" version of the Pattern Recognition album for CD release. In 1999 a re-recording of two songs from the band's first incarnation were recorded, and the Word as a Weapon\\"/\\"Destroy Your Local McDonalds 7\\" was released on the Californian label Zum. Further recordings were also made of a combination of old and new songs, which to this date have never been released. Touring and breakup In 1999 Sea Scouts embarked on a tour of North America and Europe, joining Ninetynine for shows in Eastern Europe. Returning home later in 1999, it was decided that the band would play its final shows in Hobart, before a \\"grand-final\\" show at Melbourne's Corner Hotel on 18 February 2000. Legacy * Evans, who made a number of cameos with Ninetynine, recorded with that band whilst on the 1999 tour. Shortly after Sea Scouts disbanded, he formed Bird Blobs in Melbourne. The Bird Blobs were active between 1999 and 2005, releasing an EP and two albums on Unstable Ape Records. After the Bird Blobs disbanded, Evans moved to New York City where he formed the bands Degreaser and Bogan Dust. Upon returning to Australia he formed Coconuts and filled in on vocals for Venom P. Stinger for a time. In 2016 he released the album Wretched Wings under his own name on the New York label Ever/Never. * Zach von Bamburger founded Mongoose, Monster Monster Monster and Ditchboss, and now plays in Go Genre Everything. * Monica Fikerle now plays drums with Love of Diagrams and bass with Baseball, both bands being based in Melbourne. * Alex Pope plays in Hobart black metal band Ruins.

He departed the SECV in 1989 and began operating an ice cream van. In 1992 Mangione was arrested and detained, but he was later released due to there being no evidence to support charges over a missing six- year-old girl found in his ice cream van.Icecream man goes free. Herald Sun, 6 June 1992, article+photo. (State Library of Victoria). Article summary: Police search for a six-year-old girl reported missing. The girl found in Mangione's ice cream van when he was arrested was not distressed. Mangione spent Easter in custody. He believed he had the approval of her parents. He should never have been charged with any offense said the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Bernard Bongiorno QC. Charges were withdrawn and police ordered to pay costs. In 1993 an incident occurred between his family and that of Giunta, also an icecream van operator, escalating a turf war which included a violent fight between Mangione and Giunta. Criminal history On 5 February 2002 Giunta returned home from work. After showering he stepped naked into the bedroom where his wife lay sleeping and Mangione lay in wait. Mangione then attacked Giunta slashing, stabbing, and hacking at him with a homemade sword. Giunta's wife, Laura, awakened by her husband's screams, escaped via the bedroom's balcony leading to the outside garage roof where she leaped to the ground, breaking her leg, requiring further hospitalization for 21 days and in need of a wheelchair and crutches upon her release. Giunta died at the scene from massive injuries. Mangione fled the scene dropping the weapon as he did. His DNA was later found on the handle of the sword and tools were found in his home which were forensically linked to the making of the weapon.. Trial The trial lasted for ten days. On 13 February 2004 Mangione was found guilty by a jury. He was sentenced by Harper J to 22 years imprisonment, with a non- parole period of 18 years. On 21 February 2006 the Supreme Court of Victoria Court of Appeal dismissed Mangione's appeal against the severity of his sentence. Mangione continues to maintain his innocence. In 2010 it was reported that Mangione was imprisoned in Barwon Prison.

Hence, by the old law of evidence, the one party was excluded from giving evidence for or against the other in civil questions, and a relic of this is still preserved in criminal law. Heraldry In heraldry, baron and femme are terms denoting the two-halves of an heraldic escutcheon used when the coat of arms of a man and the paternal arms of his wife are impaled (or anciently dimidiated), that is borne per pale within the same escutcheon. The position of the husband's arms, on the dexter side (to viewer's left), the position of honour, is referred to as baron whilst the paternal arms of the wife are shown in sinister, referred to as femme. The resultant shield is used by the husband, as in general females are not entitled to display heraldry, unless suo jure peeresses. This is the normal way of displaying the arms of a married man. Impalement is not used when the wife is an heraldic heiress, in which case her paternal arms are displayed on an inescutcheon of pretence within her husbands' arms, denoting that the husband is a pretender to the paternal arms of his wife, and that they will be quartered by the couple's issue and later descendants. Where arms are impaled for reasons other than conjugal marriage, for example the spiritual marriage of a bishop to his see or the mystical marriage of King Richard II to Saint Edward the Confessor, the halves of the shield are referred to as simply dexter and sinister. Etymology In Late Latin bar≈ç, bar≈çnis, meant man (a borrowing from Frankish *bar≈ç). Later, in Western Europe, the word was used to refer to a ruler's leading henchmen (e.g. a baron was the King's Man). Later, it came to have a specific, legal definition as the tenant-in-chief of the early Norman kings, which class developed into feudal barons who held their lands from the king by the feudal tenure and were entitled to attend parliament. The Norman-French word feme/femme simply denotes \\"woman\\" or \\"wife\\".

Discovery and naming In 1987, construction work was done on the College Boulevard near Carlsbad at the Californian coast. In the Letterbox Canyon between El Camino Real and Palomar Airport Road, northwest of McClellan‚ÄìPalomar Airport, the road was widened. While paleontologically surveying the work, Bradford Riney noted that a skeleton had been uncovered by a ditch dug for a sewage pipe. Within days, it was secured by the San Diego Natural History Museum. In 1988, the find was reported by Thomas Dem√©r√©. The discovery drew much attention because it was the first important ankylosaurian fossil known from the area. It was dubbed the \\"Carlsbad Ankylosaur\\". In 1996, the fossil was described but not named by Dem√©r√© and Walter Preston Coombs.W.P. Coombs, Jr. and T.A. Dem√©r√©, 1996, \\"A Late Cretaceous nodosaurid ankylosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) from marine sediments of coastal California\\", Journal of Paleontology 70(2): 311-326 In 2001, the type species Aletopelta coombsi was named by Tracy Lee Ford and James Kirkland. Etymologically, the generic name is composed of the Greek terms ·ºÄŒªŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ, aletes, and œÄŒ≠ŒªœÑŒ∑, pelte, meaning respectively \\"wanderer\\" and \\"small shield\\". This genus name was suggested by Ben Creisler because the fossil location, at the time the dinosaur died, being located on the tectonic plate containing the Peninsular Ranges Terrane, was somewhere opposite the middle of Mexico. This plate had thus been wandering northward since, carrying the specimen with it. The specific epithet honors the vertebrate paleontologist Walter Preston Coombs, Jr., \\"for his ground-breaking work on ankylosaurs and his years of research, which have inspired many an enthusiast as well as professional paleontologist\\".T.L. Ford and J.I. Kirkland, 2001, \\"Carlsbad ankylosaur (Ornithischia, Ankylosauria): an ankylosaurid and not a nodosaurid\\", In: The Armored Dinosaurs. Indiana University Press, Bloomington pp 239-260 Fossils Life restoration in its environment Aletopelta is known from a single partial skeleton lacking the skull, holotype SDNHM 33909, part of the collection of the San Diego Natural History Museum, San Diego, California. The skeleton including femora (the thighbones), tibiae (shinbones), fibulae (calf bones) and incomplete parts of a scapula (shoulder blade), humerus, ulna, left and right ischium, vertebrae, ribs, partial armor over the pelvic girdle, a cervical halfring plus at least sixty detached armor plates and eight teeth was found in a layer of the Late Cretaceous (Upper Campanian) marine Point Loma Formation, dating from the late Campanian, in 2001 estimated at 75.5 million years old. Apparently, the animal's bloated carcass floated out to sea, and formed a miniature reef environment after it sank to the bottom, landing on its back, as testified by Pelecypoda attaching to the bones. The remains were possibly scavenged by sharks. Most long bones have lost their joint surfaces and were hollowed out. As a result, the condition of the skeletal elements is poor. Description Aletopelta is a medium-sized ankylosaurid, originally estimated to be around long. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at five metres, its weight at two tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 233 Due to the damaged state of the holotype bones, it is difficult to determine distinguishing traits. In 2004, Matthew Vickaryous e.a. therefore considered Aletopelta to be a nomen dubium. Phylogeny Aletopelta is diagnosed as an ankylosaurid mainly based on the shape and arrangement of its osteoderm armor, which is closer in form to ankylosaurids than to nodosaurids.

In Ottoman tax records, it is shown that the village had a population of 61 inhabitants in 1596.

Eight have each three loculi under arcosolia, and in three cases the rolling stones which closed the doors lie beside them. One of these stones was 3 feet diameter, and 1 foot thick, weighing probably about 6 cwt. Five of the tombs are single loculi, open in front, cut in the face of the cliff under arcosolia; two of the tombs have only two loculi each, and one is blocked up.

Most fled in early May towards al-Tira and when al-Tira was depopulated they left for Jenin. Some returned and remained in al-Sarafand until Israeli forces ‚Äî composed of the Carmeli and Alexandroni Brigades ‚Äî assaulted the village on July 16, 1948. At the time, Arab Liberation Army volunteers and local militia were defending al- Sarafand.Morris, 2004, p. ? Most of the inhabitants fled to the southeast line of Wadi Ara, where the Iraqi Army was stationed. Later, they crossed the Jordan River, and since then the majority of al-Sarafand‚Äôs refugees have been living in Jordan. Only one former resident of al-Sarafand remained in Israel. The village houses were not immediately demolished by the Israelis and remained empty for many years. When they were eventually destroyed, the mosque was the only building spared. Petersen inspected the village mosque and adjacent vaults in 1994, and described the mosque as \\"a tall rectangular box- like building standing on a terrace near the top of the ridge on which it was built. The mosque is entered through a doorway in the middle of the north wall. The interior is divided into two long cross-vaulted bays resting on six large piers. There are four windows in west wall facing the sea. The mihrab is placed in the centre of the south wall and can be seen on the exterior as a rectangular projection. To the west of the mihrab are the remains of a minbar (now destroyed). The lower sections of the wall are approximately 1 m. thick, whilst the upper part of the south and north walls are considerably thinner (0.3 m.). Although the present building does not appear to be very old (late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries) it does appear to in incorporate an earlier structure which is visible in the exterior walls. To the south of the mosque is a rectangular area of ruins (approximately 30m x 40m) containing several barrel-vaulted chambers. Three of these are still accessible; one on the north side nearest the mosque, and two on the south side next to the quarry cliff. Each vault is about 7m long; one is 2.52m wide and the other is 3.52m wide. More intensive investigation could reveal a basic plan of this structure.\\"Petersen, 2001, pp. 272-273 Mosque restoration In 1999, the 'Aqsa Society for the Preservation of Islamic Holy Sites decided to restore al-Sarafand‚Äôs mosque. In May 2000, while restoration was on the verge of completion, the mosque was destroyed overnight by a bulldozer. The perpetrator was never identified. The activists covered the ruins by a large tent and maintained a vigil at the site. Removal of the tent was negotiated with the Israeli authorities. It was agreed that the site would be fenced to protect it, but that did not happen and the activists built a more permanent structure. The latter was demolished by the police in March 2002, but the ruined mosque continues to be used for Friday prayers. According to the Or Commission report, Israeli authorities did not grant a license for rebuilding the mosque after the demolition; a decision that contributed to the souring of relations between local Muslim residents and the authorities. The Or Commission report also claims that activities by Islamic organizations such as the aforementioned society may be using religious pretenses to further political aims. The commission describes such actions as a factor in 'inflaming' the Muslim population in Israel against the authorities, and cites the Sarafand mosque episode, with Muslims' attempts to restore the mosque and Jewish attempts to stop them, as an example of the 'shifting of dynamics' of the relationship between Muslims and the Israeli authorities.

Atikaki Provincial Wilderness Park was designated a provincial park by the Government of Manitoba in 1985. The park is considered to be a Class II protected area under the IUCN protected area management categories. It became part of the Pimachiowin Aki UNESCO World Heritage site in 2018. Geography Most of the water of the park flows west to Lake Winnipeg. Although the vast majority of the park's land is located east of 95¬∞ 46' W, there are three very long thin corridors of parkland along streams that flow westward toward Lake Winnipeg. These streams are the Pigeon River, the Leyond River, and the Bloodvein River. The lakes and rivers are warmer than most rivers that are fed by cold mountain streams. The majority of the population north and east of the park are First Nations and the closest town is Bloodvein at the mouth of the Bloodvein River. Atikaki is home to wildlife such as moose, elk, black bears, loons, bald eagles, woodland caribou, and other creatures of the boreal forest. It is known mostly for its beautiful waterways, and is a popular destination for more adventurous canoe trippers. Most popular are the Bloodvein River, Gammon River, and the Sasaginnigak River. There are several fly in fishing lodges in the area. Atikaki Park was initially to become a National Park but ended up as a Provincial Park. The park was partially mapped out by Marc Wermager.

Ahead of the 1996 season, a new main grandstand with seating for 2,900 people was opened, costing 15 million Norwegian krone (NOK). It increased the seating at the stadium with 1,400 seats from the old grandstand. The municipality installed flood lights ahead of the 2005 season. Stab√¶k moved to Telenor Arena for the 2009 Tippeligaen season, but returned to Nadderud for the 2012 season due to financial issues. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away- team captains, Nadderud was ranked twelfth amongst league stadiums, with a score of 2.73 on a scale from one to five. From 2009 the stadium is the home pitch of Stab√¶k's women's team Stab√¶k Fotball Kvinner (SFK), who play in Toppserien, the women's top division. Before the start of the 2012 season, Stab√¶k Fotball has moved back to Nadderud and the team's Eliteserien matches will be played at the stadium. This follows a decline in fortune of the top tier team, who were not able to pay for their rent for Telenor Arena past the end of 2011. Athletics The stadium hosted the European Cup in Athletics, First League for Men, in 2000. Domestically it has hosted the Norwegian Championships in 1966 (arranged by (IL Tyrving) and 1985 (arranged by (Fossum IF). It annually hosts the country's largest track and field meet, Tyrvinglekene. Bandy The Norwegian bandy final was held here on 22 February 1970 when Str√∏msgodset IF under a heavy snowfall beat Stab√¶k IF 3‚Äì1.

He is best known for his conspiracy theories regarding the 1994 death of Kurt Cobain which he states that he believes was a homicide. Lee was the first to make this claim. Lee is also known for his attempts at various political offices and using related events to question political figures about the investigation into Kurt Cobain's death.  Background  Born in New York in 1963, Lee grew up in Chicago and at a young age began writing for the Chicago Reader. In 1982, he wrote the article \\"Playing for Change.\\" Some time after the story was published, the city council overturned the law and legalized street performances. Lee also wrote for the University of Washington student newspaper, The Daily.  Life in Seattle  Lee moved to Seattle in the early 1990s in search of an underdeveloped political climate. He began a short-lived career with the Seattle Weekly, a local alternative paper. After leaving the Weekly, Lee began a weekly public affairs show on Public-access television cable TV, Now See It Person to Person, a homage to See It Now, the historic investigative reporting show of Edward R. Murrow. Lee's cable television show was removed from SCAN permanently in April 2008.  Investigations into Kurt Cobain  After the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994, Lee's coverage of the death led him to raise questions regarding the circumstances of Cobain's demise. The official police investigation, under police chief Norm Stamper, concluded that Cobain had died of an apparent suicide. Lee is one of a number of individuals who promote the belief that Cobain likely did not commit suicide, but must have been killed by someone else. Lee changed the name of his show to Now See It Person to Person: Was Kurt Cobain Murdered?, then to the more definitive Now See It Person To Person: Kurt Cobain Was Murdered. Since then Lee has referred to his show and his related journalism and political activities by the abbreviation KCWM. Since 1994, with occasional involuntary hiatuses, the show has aired weekly and continues to investigate the Cobain case as well as somewhat related and prominent matters of Seattle public affairs. Lee has appeared in some documentaries about Cobain, such as the BBC's Rock Shrines and Conspiracies TV shows. Lee's confrontational style has led to frequent encounters with police officers and other local figures. Lee is protective of his film, and if confiscated, he often fights in court to have the original copy returned to him.  Politics  Lee has run for a number of political offices in Seattle. He ran for Seattle City Council in 1999, but a judge ruled him ineligible because he reused old petition signatures to get on the ballot.  Mayoral run  In 2001, Lee ran for mayor of the city of Seattle against incumbent mayor Paul Schell, but lost to Greg Nickels. Lee was critical of the way Schell's office responded to the WTO protests in 1999. He was the only candidate that year to gather enough signatures to be on the ballot without having to pay the filling fee. While running for mayor in 2001, Lee showed up to a mayoral candidates' forum in a dress. He used the opportunity to question Greg Nickels about a supposed cover-up regarding the investigation of the death of Kurt Cobain.  Notable incidents  In 2000 Krist Novoselic was granted a restraining order against Richard Lee, which expired in 2005. In 2004, Lee was arrested in Los Angeles at a court hearing for Courtney Love, in which he attempted to ask questions about killing her husband. The incident was covered in entertainment media, especially on Celebrity Justice. During the 2005 campaign, Greg Nickels got a mild restraining order against Lee, citing Lee's ambush interview practices over the past years as harassment. Nickel's lawyers, employed by the city, wanted a standard 500-foot restriction from the mayor's home and workplace, which would include city hall. The judge in the case kept the home restriction, but minimized the order to one floor of city hall and to a 50-foot radius in public places and events. Part of the motivation for the restraining order was Lee's attempt to interview the mayor at a Democratic Party event in Fremont to which many Seattle residents including Lee had been invited. Lee was ejected from the grounds by the owner, but remained on the sidewalk trying to ask questions of the mayor. As the mayor was about to leave, Lee was restrained by a plainclothes police officer that Lee then allegedly kicked in the leg. Lee pleaded not guilty, maintaining that it was he who was assaulted by the officer. During pretrial hearings, he succeeded in forcing the Seattle Police Department to return the original copy of his videotape of the incident, which they had confiscated, and refused to return over concerns of publicity. In 2008 the city was ordered to return the original videotape, which Lee then aired on his program; later that year the city dropped the charges against Lee.

The Grand Sierra has a movie theater, a Race & Sports Book, nightclubs including LEX a 25,000 sq ft venue with a swimming pool, lake golf driving range, a two screen cinema, an RV park and a recently opened ice rink. It is owned and operated by Southern California based investment group headed by The Meruelo Group. History MGM Grand (1978‚Äì1986) In 1975, officials from the Metro- Goldwyn Mayer Company began to scout out Reno locations for their proposed high rise hotel-casino they wanted to model after their very high-profile Las Vegas casino, the MGM Grand. Following a deal with and approval from the City Council, MGM purchased land between Mill and 2nd Streets, at that time a gravel pit. The Summer of 1976 saw construction begin on the 26 story, 1,015 room property that would then be one of the largest in the world. After two years of fast-tracked construction, the building opened with fanfare, fashion and media attention on May 3, 1978. In the Summer of 1981, MGM opened an expansion of the hotel with a 26-story wing plus an additional 900 rooms, making a total of 2,001 rooms and suites. Three years later in November 1984 MGM revealed plans to expand the Reno hotel further: a $60 million 26 story wing with another 954 rooms, which never materialized. After fights and issues with the City Council, the expansion was later approved on September 23, 1985, amid rumors the MGM would be sold. Less than five months later on November 16, 1985 those rumors proved to be true with Bally Manufacturing announcing that it would acquire the Reno and Las Vegas MGM's for $440 million, further questioning the newly approved expansion for Reno. Bally's (1986‚Äì1992) Bally's Reno logo (1986‚Äì1992) The increased purchase price transaction was completed in April 1986 and MGM Grand Reno became Bally's Reno, the price to purchase the MGM assets came out being more than $550 million. The expansion for Reno was delayed indefinitely leaving the current structure with 2,001 rooms. On April 18, 1989, Bally's shut down the popular Donn Arden production \\"Hello Hollywood Hello\\" that was created for the MGM Reno. It closed after 11 years and performances in front of more than 7 million people. It remains still the longest-running production show to ever play in Reno. In 1990 Wall- Street began to tout financial problems with Bally Manufacturing; but in July 1990, they refute the claim and announce they will continue to operate the hotel-casinos. Three months later in October 1990, it became known that Bally's was struggling with $1.8 billion in debts and announced a plan to restructure and reorganize to keep Bally's Reno operating. After two years of sluggish operations, on February 27, 1992, Bally Manufacturing, parent company of Bally's, filed for bankruptcy. The next month, in March 1992, the hotel was placed on the market in an attempt to aid their debt by unloading the non- revenue producing Bally's Reno, sister hotel Bally's Las Vegas was far more superior in terms of revenues. Quickly, bidding began between Hilton Hotels Inc and Harveys Casino. The bidding went on until June 1992 when Hilton put an end to the fight, bidding $83 million. The transaction took a few weeks to complete. Reno Hilton (1992‚Äì2006) Reno Hilton logo (1992‚Äì2006) On July 31, 1992, Bally's Reno became officially the Reno Hilton. Free of financial problems and immediately after the sale, Hilton began investing $86 million worth of renovations in 1994/1995 to transform completely the interior and exterior of the hotel and direct the theme towards a more Western image. In December 1993, during the renovations, Hilton confirmed that it was looking into building a 1,000 room addition. The Reno Hilton's ownership was a series of managers and company names; it was Hilton Hotel Inc. from 1992-1999 when Hilton spun off its gaming operations into a separate company called Park Place Entertainment. Then in 2003, following a 2001 purchase of Caesars World, Park Place changed its name to Caesars Entertainment, with Hilton still holding an affiliation with the company. Around this time, the Reno Hilton was again being renovated. In May 2005, it became known that Caesars Entertainment, which was pending in a merger with Harrah's Entertainment, had to disassociate all hotels under the Hilton brand as Hilton had removed itself from the company and did not want to become part of the merger. Consequently, the property was placed on the market and quickly picked up by a group of investors known as the Grand Sierra Resort Corp. The purchase price was $151 million. The transaction from Caesars Entertainment to GSR Corp involving the $151 million sale of the Reno Hilton was lengthy. The sale was announced in early May 2005 but wasn't completed until June 2006 due to finance and licensing problems. Grand Sierra Resort (2006‚Äìpresent) Grand Sierra Resort logo (2006‚Äì2012) After all problems were addressed with all parties involved, the Reno Hilton became the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino on June 24, 2006. During the first ownership of the Grand Sierra Resort nearly $100 million was spent to convert the property into the new brand. The money was spent on reconfiguration of the public areas, a new swimming pool area, update for the casino that included keeping the original MGM-like ceilings, a refreshed hotel lobby and converting floors 17‚Äì27 into \\"hotel-condos\\" called The Summit. The company had larger-scale expansion plans that included a water park, boutique shopping, a water and laser show, 48-story condominium high- rises and further renovations. Those never came to fruition. Briefly, the hotel was home to Nikki Beach nightlife and Ashton Kutcher's Dolce Enoteca restaurant. In October 2008, in the midst of the economic crises, GSR's ownership or group of investors failed to make payments on their loans with their financier, JPMorgan, essentially bankrupt, the bank foreclosed on the 2,001 room hotel/casino and assumed ownership, assigning it to their affiliate Credit Markets Real Estate Holdings to oversee operations. That affiliate brought on Las Vegas-based management companies such as Catalyst, who flips struggling hotel/casinos and makes them attractive to a buyer. Those companies, including the Navengante Group and Santo Gaming, both Las Vegas based, continued to make improvements to the resort such as adding or replacing restaurants. The hotel/condo program was eliminated and settlements with buyers are ongoing to this day, the renovated rooms above the 17th floor that are non-private owned rent as hotel rooms. In 2009, The Meruelo Group began looking at the property with an interest to purchase it. CEO Alex Meruelo was intrigued by the property's potential to truly become an elite destination resort. After negotiations between Meruelo and JPMorgan, a deal was reached to sell the 145-acre site for only $42 million. This payment was made in cash, and the deal was announced in February 2011. Quickly, the deal closed after regulatory approval in April 2011. Out of bank ownership, Meruelo pledged to continually make improvements. Not gamers, Meruelo, owner of successful restaurant chains, TV stations and construction companies, was now in the business of hotel/casinos. He brought on seasoned management from Las Vegas to help in his effort to rebrand the property. In August 2011, the company announced a multi-phase $25 million improvement program that would renovate the casino, hotel lobby, rooms and restaurants. In August 2012, that program was completed. Favoring bright and modern versus elegant and dark. Even with the first round of renovations completed, Meruelo was not stopping their improvements with renovations to their sports book, a new Spa, new stores and a $14 million nightclub opened in 2014. For the first time in the property's 30-year history, exterior enhancements were made in 2014. Grand Sierra Resort logo (2012‚Äì2014) Grand Sierra Resort logo (2014‚Äì2019) In Spring 2013, it was announced Meruelo Group had a firm deal to acquire an Atlantic City Casino and Hotel Trump Plaza for $20 million, however, in April 2013, that deal was put on hold as the parent company's mortgage holder put a stop to the deal. Meruelo was still committed to acquiring it and expanding their network of hotel/casinos. Another renovation for the meeting space occurred in the summer of 2015.

Communization and its Discontents: Contestation, Critique, and Contemporary Struggles. Minor Compositions, Autonomedia. 2011. 1st ed. It is important to note the big differences in perception and usage. Some groups start out from an activist voluntarism (Tiqqun, Invisible Committee), while others derive communization as an historical and social result emerging out of capital's development over the last decades (Endnotes, Th√©orie Communiste). Endnotes totally distinguishes itself from the mixing of all sorts of meanings of the word communization and explicitly refers to the different reception in the Anglophone world as opposed to the original French milieu from which it emerged as a critique. \\"It has thus become necessary to make the distinction: the 'communization theory' now spoken of in the English-speaking world is largely an imaginairy entity, an artefact of the Anglophone reception of various unrelated works...For us communization does not signify some general positive process of 'sharing' or 'making common'. It signifies the speficic revolutionairy undoing of the relations of property constitutive of the capitalist class relation. \\" e.g. Endnotes \\"What are we to do?\\"  Theory  In communist political theory, communization is the process of abolishing ownership of the means of production, which, in societies dominated by the capitalist mode of production, are owned by individual capitalists, states, or other collective bodies. In some versions of communist theory, communization is understood as the transfer of ownership from private capitalist hands to the collective hands of producers, whether in the form of co-operative enterprises or communes, or through the mediation of a state or federation of workers' councils on a local, national, or global scale. In other programs, such as those of some left communists (e.g. Gilles Dauv√©, Jacques Camatte), autonomists (e.g., Mario Tronti), and libertarian communists (e.g. Peter Kropotkin), communization means the abolition of property itself along with any state-like institutions claiming to represent a given subset of humanity. In these accounts humanity as a whole, directly or indirectly, would take over the task of the production of goods for use (and not for exchange). People would then have free access to those goods rather than exchanging labor for money, and distribution would take place according to the maxim \\"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\\"  History   Origins and precedents  The term communization was not used by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, but it was employed in the above sense by early Marxists.e.g. William Morris \\"The Policy of Abstention\\" (1887) and E. Belfort Bax \\"Et Impera\\" (1888) Communization in this sense is equivalent to the establishment of the \\"higher phase\\" of communist society described by Marx in Critique of the Gotha Program. In State and Revolution, Vladimir Lenin referred to the lower phase, organized around the principle \\"To each according to his contribution\\", as \\"socialism\\", with the higher phase as \\"complete communism\\", or \\"full communism\\", as Joseph Stalin would later put it. Thus both Lenin and Stalin gave grounds for thinking of communization not as a transition from capitalism to communism, but as a transition from socialism to communism, a transition that would take place after the working class had seized power, and which may last a long time (in the 1930s Stalin conceived of \\"full communism\\" as still a long way offSee e.g. Stalin‚Äôs ‚ÄúEconomic Problems of Socialism of the U.S.S.R.‚Äù (1939)). Thus the interval between the two transitions came to be seen as a necessary \\"period of transition\\" between the workers' revolution and communism. It appears that within so-called \\"communist\\" regimes the demand for \\"communization\\" was associated with an impatience with the \\"period of transition\\" and a desire to break with the remaining capitalist forms (e.g., money, wage labor) still in place in those regimes.e.g. some Chinese Ultra-Left tendencies during the so-called \\"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.\\" Those pushing for a move toward \\"communizing\\" in this sense were typically denounced as \\"ultra-left\\", with their suggestions dismissed as impractical and utopian, but they were able to point to the historical examples of the Paris Commune and the Spanish Revolution of 1936, where more radical measures of popular collectivization had been taken than in the Russian and Chinese revolutions, as well as to the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 and the Italian councils movement of 1919-1920 in which the historic \\"left communist\\" tendencies had been formed.  Late 20th century  The association of the term communization with a self-identified \\"ultra-left\\" was cemented in France in the 1970s, where it came to describe not a transition to a higher phase of communism but a vision of communist revolution itself. Thus the 1975 Pamphlet A World Without Money states: ‚Äúinsurrection and communisation are intimately linked. There would not be first a period of insurrection and then later, thanks to this insurrection, the transformation of social reality. The insurrectional process derives its force from communisation itself.‚Äù This vision was opposed to the statism and vanguardism of the Leninist conception of revolution, but it also identified the perceived failure of the Russian and Chinese revolutions (carried out on the Leninist politico-military model) with the insufficiency of measures taken to abolish capitalist social relations (e.g. lack of direct collectivization, persistence of monetary relations). It also reversed the supposed \\"pragmatism\\" of the Leninist focus on the state, arguing that the final goal of the \\"withering away of the state\\" could hardly be advanced by the seizure of state power and the establishment of a \\"revolutionary\\" bureaucracy, but that the most practical means to achieve this goal would rather be the abolition of the capitalist relations (money, capital, wages) on which state power depends. Thus La Banquise writes: Within this 1970s French tendency \\"communization\\" thus came to represent the absence of a period of transition and a conception of revolution as the application of communist measures throughout the economy and society.For an historical account see: Endnotes \\"Bring Out Your Dead\\", Endnotes no. 1 (2008). Although they do not use the term a very similar conception can be found in the early works of Antonio Negri, e.g. the chapter ‚ÄòCommunism and Transition‚Äô in his Marx Beyond Marx (1978), as well as in the 1980s works of the insurrectionist anarchist Alfredo M. Bonanno. The term is still used in this sense in France today and has spread into English usage as a result of the translation of texts by Gilles Dauv√© and Th√©orie Comuniste, two key figures in this tendency. In collaboration with other left communists such as Fran√ßois Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauv√© has attempted to fuse, critique, and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal Invariance), German-Dutch council communism, and the French perspectives associated with Socialisme ou Barbarie and the Situationist International.\\"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left.\\"Re-collecting our past - La Banquise He has focused on theoretical discussions of economic issues concerning the controversial failure of Second International Marxism (including both Social Democracy and Leninist \\"Communism\\"), the global revolutionary upsurge of the 1960s and its subsequent dissolution, and on developments in global capitalist accumulation and class struggle.  Early 21st century  In the late 1990s a close but not identical sense of \\"communization\\" was developed by the French post- situationist group Tiqqun. In keeping with their ultra-left predecessors, Tiqqun's predilection for the term seems to be its emphasis on communism as an immediate process rather than a far-off goal, but for Tiqqun it is no longer synonymous with \\"the revolution\\" considered as an historical event, but rather becomes identifiable with all sorts of activities ‚Äì from squatting and setting up communes to simply \\"sharing\\" ‚Äì that would typically be understood as \\"pre- revolutionary\\".\\"As we apprehend it, the process of instituting communism can only take the form of a collection of acts of communisation, of making common such-and-such space, such-and-such machine, such-and-such knowledge. That is to say, the elaboration of the mode of sharing that attaches to them. Insurrection itself is just an accelerator, a decisive moment in this process.\\" Anonymous, Call From an ultra-left perspective such a politics of \\"dropping-out\\" or, as Tiqqun put it, \\"desertion\\" ‚Äî setting up spaces and practices that are held to be partially autonomous from capitalism ‚Äî is typically dismissed as either naive or reactionary.For a critique of Tiqqun from an ultra-left perspective, as well as a description of the opposition between the two sense of \\"communization\\" see \\"Reflexions Around Call \\" Letters Journal #3. See also Dauv√© and Nesic, \\"Un Appel et une Invite\\". Due to the popularity of the Tiqqun-related works Call and The Coming Insurrection in US anarchist circles it tended to be this latter sense of \\"communization\\" that was employed in US anarchist and \\"insurrectionist\\" communiques, notably within the Californian student movement of 2009-2010.See e.g. \\"After the Fall: Communiqu√©s from Occupied California\\" \\"More recently its ideas have been elaborated and extended in discussions with like-minded groups including the English language Endnotes and the Swedish journal Riff Raff.

Professional boxing bouts are fought for a purse that is divided between the boxers as determined by contract. Most professional bouts are supervised by a regulatory authority to guarantee the fighters' safety. Most high-profile bouts obtain the endorsement of a sanctioning body, which awards championship belts, establishes rules, and assigns its own judges and referees. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional bouts are typically much longer and can last up to twelve rounds, though less significant fights can be as short as four rounds. Protective headgear is not permitted, and boxers are generally allowed to take substantial punishment before a fight is halted. Professional boxing has enjoyed a much higher profile than amateur boxing throughout the 20th century and beyond. In Cuba professional boxing is banned (as of 2020). So was also the case in Sweden between 1970 and 2007, and Norway between 1981 and 2014.  Early history  The June 1894 Leonard‚ÄìCushing bout. Each of the six one-minute rounds recorded by the Kinetograph was made available to exhibitors for $22.50.Leonard‚ÄìCushing fight Part of the Library of Congress/Inventing Entertainment educational website. Retrieved 12/14/06. Customers who watched the final round saw Leonard score a knockdown. In 1891, the National Sporting Club (N.S.C.), a private club in London, began to promote professional glove fights at its own premises, and created nine of its own rules to augment the Queensberry Rules. These rules specified more accurately, the role of the officials, and produced a system of scoring that enabled the referee to decide the result of a fight. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) was first formed in 1919 with close links to the N.S.C., and was re-formed in 1929 after the N.S.C. closed. In 1909, the first of twenty-two belts were presented by the fifth Earl of Lonsdale to the winner of a British title fight held at the N.S.C. In 1929, the BBBofC continued to award Lonsdale Belts to any British boxer who won three title fights in the same weight division. The \\"title fight\\" has always been the focal point in professional boxing. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, there were title fights at each weight. Promoters who could stage profitable title fights became influential in the sport, as did boxers' managers. The best promoters and managers have been instrumental in bringing boxing to new audiences and provoking media and public interest. The most famous of all three-way partnership (fighter- manager-promoter) was that of Jack Dempsey (heavyweight champion 1919‚Äì1926), his manager Jack Kearns, and the promoter Tex Rickard. Together they grossed US$8.4 million in only five fights between 1921 and 1927 and ushered in a \\"golden age\\" of popularity for professional boxing in the 1920s. They were also responsible for the first live radio broadcast of a title fight (Dempsey v. Georges Carpentier, in 1921). In the United Kingdom, Jack Solomons' success as a fight promoter helped re-establish professional boxing after the Second World War and made the UK a popular place for title fights in the 1950s and 1960s. Modern history 1900 to 1920 Philadelphia Jack O'Brien In the early twentieth century, most professional bouts took place in the United States and Britain, and champions were recognised by popular consensus as expressed in the newspapers of the day. Among the great champions of the era were the peerless heavyweight Jim Jeffries and Bob Fitzsimmons, who weighed less than 12 stone (164 pounds), but won world titles at middleweight (1892), light heavyweight (1903), and heavyweight (1897). Other famous champions included light heavyweight Philadelphia Jack O'Brien and middleweight Tommy Ryan. After winning the Bantamweight title in 1892, Canada's George Dixon became the first ever black athlete to win a World Championship in any sport; he was also the first Canadian-born boxing champion. On May 12, 1902 lightweight Joe Gans became the first black American to be boxing champion. Despite the public's enthusiasm, this was an era of far-reaching regulation of the sport, often with the stated goal of outright prohibition. In 1900, the State of New York enacted the Lewis Law, banned prizefights except for those held in private athletic clubs between members. Thus, when introducing the fighters, the announcer frequently added the phrase \\"Both members of this club\\", as George Wesley Bellows titled one of his paintings.Robert G. Rodriguez. The regulation of boxing, p32. McFarland & Co., Jefferson, NC 2008 The western region of the United States tended to be more tolerant of prizefights in this era, although the private club arrangement was standard practice here as well, San Francisco's California Athletic Club being a prominent example. On December 26, 1908, heavyweight Jack Johnson became the first black heavyweight champion and a highly controversial figure in that racially charged era. Prizefights often had unlimited rounds, and could easily become endurance tests, favouring patient tacticians like Johnson. At lighter weights, ten round fights were common, and lightweight Benny Leonard dominated his division from the late teens into the early twenties. Prizefighting champions in this period were the premier sports celebrities, and a championship event generated intense public interest. Long before bars became popular venues in which to watch sporting events on television, enterprising saloon keepers were known to set up ticker machines and announce the progress of an important bout, blow by blow. Local kids often hung about outside the saloon doors, hoping for news of the fight. Harpo Marx, then fifteen, recounted vicariously experiencing the 1904 Jeffries-Munroe championship fight in this way.Harpo Speaks! pp 59-60. Limelight Editions, New York, 1961 1920 to 1940 Jack Dempsey in the ring In the 1920s, prizefighting was the pre- eminent sport in the United States, and no figure loomed larger than Jack Dempsey, who became world heavyweight champion after brutally defeating Jess Willard. Dempsey was one of the hardest punchers of all time and as Bert Randolph Sugar put it, \\"had a left hook from hell\\". He is remembered for his iconic fight with Luis √Ångel Firpo, which was followed by a lavish life of celebrity away from the ring. The enormously popular Dempsey would conclude his career with a memorable two bouts with Gene Tunney, breaking the $1 million gate threshold for the first time. Although Tunney dominated both fights, Dempsey retained the public's sympathy, especially after the controversy of a \\"long count\\" in their second fight. This fight introduced the new rule that the counting of a downed opponent would not begin until the standing opponent went into a neutral corner. At this time, rules were negotiated by parties, as there were no sanctioning bodies. The New York State Athletic Commission took a more prominent role in organizing fights in the 1930s. Famous champions of that era included the German heavyweight Max Schmeling and the American Max Baer, who wielded a devastating right hand. Baer was defeated by \\"Cinderella Man\\" James Braddock, a former light heavyweight contender before a series of injuries and setbacks during the Great Depression and was at one point even stripped of his license. Most famous of all was Joe Louis, who avenged an earlier defeat by demolishing Schmeling in the first round of their 1938 rematch. Louis was voted the best puncher of all time by The Ring, and is arguably the greatest heavyweight of all time. In 1938, Henry Armstrong became the only boxer to hold titles in three different weight classes at the same time (featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight). His attempt at winning the middleweight title would be thwarted in 1940. 1940 to 1960 The Second World War brought a lull in competitive boxing, and champion Louis fought mostly exhibitions. After the war, Louis continued his reign, but new stars emerged in other divisions, such as the inimitable featherweight Willie Pep, who won over 200 fights, and most notably Sugar Ray Robinson, widely regarded as the greatest pound-for-pound fighter of all time. Robinson held the world welterweight title from 1946 to 1951 and the world middleweight title a record five times from 1951 to 1960. His notable rivals included Jake LaMotta, Gene Fullmer, and Carmen Basilio. Unfortunately, many fights in the 1940s and 1950s were marred by suspected mafia involvement, though some fighters like Robinson and Basilio openly resisted mob influence. Among the heavyweights, Joe Louis retained his title until his 1949 retirement, having held the championship for an unprecedented eleven years. Ezzard Charles and Jersey Joe Walcott succeeded him as champion, but they were soon outshone by the remarkable Rocky Marciano, who compiled an astounding 49‚Äì0 record before retiring as world champion. Among his opponents was the ageless Archie Moore, who held the world light heavyweight title for ten years and scored more knockout victories than any other boxer in history. 1960 to 1980 Graffiti of Muhammad Ali In the early 1960s, the seemingly invincible Sonny Liston captured the public imagination with his one-sided destruction of two-time heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson. One of the last mob-connected fighters, Liston had his mystique shattered in two controversial losses to the brash upstart Cassius Clay, who changed his name to Muhammad Ali after becoming champion. Ali would become the most iconic figure in boxing history, transcending the sport and achieving global recognition. His refusal to serve in the Vietnam War resulted in the stripping of his title, and tore down the barrier between sport and culture. Carlos Monz√≥n (right) fighting Nino Benvenuti in 1970 After three years of inactivity, Ali returned to the sport, leading to his first epic clash with Joe Frazier in 1971, ushering in a \\"golden age\\" of heavyweight boxing. Ali, Frazier, and the heavy-hitting George Foreman were the top fighters in a division overloaded with talent. Among the middleweights, Argentine Carlos Monz√≥n emerged as a dominant champion, reigning from 1970 to his retirement in 1977, after an unprecedented 14 title defenses. Roberto Dur√°n dismantled opponents for 6¬Ω years as lightweight champion, Defending the title 12 times, 11 by knockout. The late 1970s witnessed the end of universally recognised champions, as the WBC and WBA began to recognise different champions and top contenders, ushering in the era of multiple champions, unworthy mandatory challengers, and general corruption that came to be associated with sanctioning bodies in later decades. The end of this decade also saw the sport begin to become more oriented toward the casino industry. The Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas began to host major bouts featuring George Foreman, Ron Lyle, Muhammad Ali, Roberto Dur√°n, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns. Also, public broadcasts would be replaced by closed-circuit, and ultimately pay-per-view, broadcasts, as the boxing audience shrank in numbers. 1980 to 2000 In the early 1980s Larry Holmes was a lone heavyweight talent in a division full of pretenders, so the most compelling boxing matchups were to be found in the lower weight classes. Roberto Dur√°n dominated the lightweight division and became welterweight champion, but quit during the 8th round in his second fight with Sugar Ray Leonard (the famous \\"no mas\\" fight of Nov. 1980), who emerged as the best fighter of the decade. Leonard went on to knock out the formidable Thomas Hearns in 1981. Meanwhile, the junior welterweight division was ruled by Aaron Pryor, who made 10 title defenses from 1980 to 1985, before vacating the championship. Oscar De La Hoya The prestigious middleweight division was dominated by \\"Marvelous\\" Marvin Hagler, who fought Thomas Hearns at Caesars Palace on April 15, 1985. The fight was billed as \\"The War\\", and it lived up to its billing. As soon as the bell rang, both fighters ran towards the centre of the ring and began trading hooks and uppercuts nonstop. This continued into round three, when Hagler overwhelmed Hearns and knocked him out in brutal fashion. This fight made Hagler famous; he was able to lure Ray Leonard out of retirement in 1987, but lost in a highly-controversial decision. Hagler retired from boxing immediately after that fight. In the latter half of the decade young heavyweight Mike Tyson emerged as a serious contender. Nicknamed \\"Iron Mike\\", Tyson won the heavyweight unification series to become world heavyweight champion at the age of 20 and the first undisputed champion in a decade. Tyson soon became the most widely known boxer since Ali due to an aura of unrestrained ferocity, such as that exuded by Jack Dempsey or Sonny Liston. Much like Liston, Tyson's career was marked by controversy and self- destruction. He was accused of domestic violence against his wife Robin Givens, whom he soon divorced. Meanwhile, he lost his title to 42-1 underdog James Douglas. His progress toward another title shot was derailed by allegations of rape made by Desiree Washington, a beauty pageant queen. In 1992 Tyson was imprisoned for rape, and released three years later. With Tyson removed from the heavyweight picture, Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe emerged as top heavyweights in the early nineties, facing each other in three bouts. Meanwhile, at light welterweight, Mexican Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez compiled an official record of 89-0 before fighting to a controversial draw in 1993 with Pernell Whitaker, who later also became a great boxer. In the late 1990s Chavez was superseded by Olympic gold medalist Oscar De La Hoya, who became the most popular pay-per-view draw of his era. De la Hoya won championships in six weight classes, competing with fighters including Chavez, Whitaker, and F√©lix Trinidad. In the late 1990s Mike Tyson made a comeback, which took an unexpected turn when he was defeated by heavy underdog Evander Holyfield in 1996. In their 1997 rematch, Tyson bit a chunk from Holyfield's ear, resulting in his disqualification; Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for one year and he was fined US$3 million. Holyfield won two of the three title belts, but lost a final match in 1999 with WBC champion Lennox Lewis, who became undisputed champion. 2000 to present The Ukrainian Klitschko brothers, Wladimir and Vitali The last decade has witnessed a continued decline in the popularity of boxing in the United States, marked by a malaise in the heavyweight division and the increased competition in the Pay-Per-View market from MMA and its main promotion, the UFC. The sport has grown in Germany and Eastern Europe, and is also currently strong in Britain. This cultural shift is reflected in some of the changes in championship title holders, especially in the upper weight divisions. The light heavyweight division was dominated in the early part of the decade by Roy Jones, Jr., a former middleweight champion, and the Polish- German Dariusz Michalczewski. Michalczewski held the WBO title, while Jones held the WBC, WBA, and IBF titles, two of which had been relinquished by Michalczewski. The two fighters never met, due to a dispute over whether the fight would be held in the U.S. or in Germany. This sort of dispute would be repeated among other top fighters, as Germany emerged as a top venue for world class boxing. Sa√∫l √Ålvarez el canelo The Ukrainian Klitschko brothers, Wladimir and Vitali, both of whom held versions of the heavyweight title. The Klitschkos were often depicted as representing a new generation of fighters from ex-Soviet republics, possessing great size, yet considerable skill and stamina, developed by years of amateur experience. Most versions of the heavyweight title were held by fighters from the former Soviet Union. Since the retirement of Lennox Lewis in 2004, the heavyweight division has been criticised as lacking talent or depth, especially among American fighters. This has resulted in a higher profile for fighters in lower weight classes, including the age-defying middleweight and light heavyweight champion Bernard Hopkins, and the undefeated multiple weight division champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., who won a 2007 split decision over Oscar De La Hoya in a record-breaking pay-per-view event. Billed as the \\"fight to save boxing\\", the success of this event shows that American boxing still retains a considerable core audience when its product is of descent from the American continent. Other notable fighters in even lower weight classes are experiencing unprecedented popularity today. In the last five years junior lightweights Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales, Juan Manuel M√°rquez and multiple weight division champion Manny Pacquiao have fought numerous times on pay-per-view. These small fighters often display tremendous punching power for their size, producing exciting fights such as the incredible 2005 bout between Castillo and the late Diego Corrales. Interest in the lower weight divisions further increased with the possibility of a superfight between two of the current best fighters in the world, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. Experts predicted this would break current pay-per-view records, due to the tremendous public demand for the fight. Long negotiations finally culminated in the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight on May 2, 2015, six years after negotiation first began and resulted in estimated revenues of $450,000,000.  Length of bouts  Professional bouts are limited to a maximum of twelve rounds, most are fought over four, six, eight or ten rounds depending upon the experience of the boxers. Through the early twentieth century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit or the fight was stopped by police. In the 1910s and 1920s, a fifteen-round limit gradually became the norm, benefiting high-energy fighters like Jack Dempsey. For decades, from the 1920s to the 1980s, world championship matches in professional boxing were scheduled for fifteen rounds, but that changed after a November 13, 1982 WBA Lightweight title bout ended with the death of boxer Duk Koo Kim in a fight against Ray Mancini in the 14th round of a nationally televised championship fight on CBS. Exactly three months after the fatal fight, the WBC reduced the number of their championship fights to 12 rounds. The WBA even stripped a fighter of his championship in 1983 because the fight had been a 15-round bout, shortly after the rule was changed to 12 rounds. By 1988, to the displeasure of some boxing purists, all fights had been reduced to a maximum of 12 rounds only, partially for safety, and partially for television, as a 12-round bout could be broadcast in a one-hour television block (pre-match, then the bout which lasts 48 minutes overall, decision, and interviews). In contrast, a 15-round bout could require up to 90 minutes to broadcast (bout lasts 60 minutes, and both pre and post bout coverage including decision).  Scoring  If a knockout or disqualification does not occur, the fight is determined by a points decision. In the early days of boxing, the referee decided the winner by raising his arm at the end of the bout, a practice that is still used for some professional bouts in the United Kingdom. In the early twentieth century, it became common for the referee or judge to score bouts by the number of rounds won. To improve the reliability of scoring, two ringside judges were added besides the referee, and the winner was decided by majority decision. Since the late twentieth century, it has become common practice for all three judges to be ringside observers, though the referee still has the authority to stop a fight or deduct points. At the end of the fight, the judges scores are tallied. If all three judges choose the same fighter as the winner, that fighter wins by unanimous decision. If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge scores it a draw, the boxer wins by majority decision. If two judges have one boxer winning the fight and the third judge has the other boxer winning, the first boxer wins by split decision. If one judge chooses one boxer as the winner, the second judge chooses the other boxer, and the third judge calls it a draw, then the bout is ruled a Split draw. The bout is also ruled a Majority Draw if at least two out of three judges score the fight a draw, regardless of the third score. 10-Point system The 10 Point system was first introduced in 1968 by the World Boxing Council (WBC) as a rational way of scoring fights. It was viewed as such because it allowed judges to reward knockdowns and distinguish between close rounds, as well as rounds where one fighter clearly dominated their opponent. Furthermore, the subsequent adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, allowed for greater judging consistency, which was something that was sorely needed at the time. There are many factors that inform the judge's decision but the most important of these are: clean punching, effective aggressiveness, ring generalship and defense. Judges use these metrics as a means of discerning which fighter has a clear advantage over the other, regardless of how minute the advantage. = The Evolution of the 10-Point System = Modern boxing rules were initially derived from the Marquess of Queensbury rules which mainly outlined core aspects of the sport, such as the establishment of rounds and their duration, as well as the determination of proper attire in the ring such as gloves and wraps. These rules did not, however, provide unified guidelines for scoring fights and instead left this in the hands of individual sanctioning organizations. This meant that fights would be scored differently depending on the rules established by the governing body overseeing the fight. It is from this environment that the 10-Point System was born. The adoption of this system, both nationally and internationally, established the foundation for greater judging consistency in professional boxing.[https/:www.lawinsport.com/topics/articles/item/ever-wondered-how- professional-boxing-s-scoring-system-works How it works]; = How the System Works = In the event the winner of a bout cannot be determined by a knockout, technical knockout, or disqualification, the final decision rests in the hands of three ringside judges approved by the commission. The three judges are usually seated along the edge of the boxing ring, separated from each other. The judges are forbidden from sharing their scores with each other or consulting with one another. At the end of each round, judges must hand in their scores to the referee who then hands them to the clerk who records and totals the final scores. Judges are to award 10 points (less any point deductions) to the victor of the round and a lesser score (less any point deductions) to the loser. The losing contestant's score can vary depending on different factors. The 10-point Must System is the most widely used scoring system since the mid-twentieth century. It is so named because a judge \\"must\\" award ten points to at least one fighter each round (before deductions for fouls). Most rounds are scored 10‚Äì9, with 10 points for the fighter who won the round, and 9 points for the fighter the judge believes lost the round. If a round is judged to be even, it is scored 10-10. For each knockdown in a round, the judge deducts an additional point from the fighter knocked down, resulting in a 10‚Äì8 score if there is one knockdown or a 10‚Äì7 score if there are two knockdowns. If the referee instructs the judges to deduct a point for a foul, this deduction is applied after the preliminary computation. So, if a fighter wins a round, but is penalised for a foul, the score changes from 10‚Äì9 to 9-9. If that same fighter scored a knockdown in the round, the score would change from 10‚Äì8 in his favour to 9‚Äì8. While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but does not score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10‚Äì8. Other scoring systems have also been used in various locations, including the five-point must system (in which the winning fighter is awarded five points, the loser four or fewer), the one-point system (in which the winning fighter is awarded one or more points, and the losing fighter is awarded zero), and the rounds system which simply awards the round to the winning fighter. In the rounds system, the bout is won by the fighter determined to have won more rounds. This system often used a supplemental points system (generally the ten-point must) in the case of even rounds. If a fight is stopped due to an injury that the referee has ruled to be the result of an unintentional foul, the fight goes to the scorecards only if a specified number of rounds (usually three, sometimes four) have been completed. Whoever is ahead on the scorecards wins by a technical decision. If the required number of rounds has not been completed, the fight is declared a technical draw or a no contest. If a fight is stopped due to a cut resulting from a legal punch, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut.Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \\"Boxing\\" , World Book Online Americas Edition Judges do not have the ability to disregard an official knockdown. If the referee declares a fighter going down to be a knockdown, the judges must score it as such.  Championships  In the first part of the 20th century, the United States became the centre for professional boxing. It was generally accepted that the \\"world champions\\" were those listed by the Police Gazette. After 1920, the National Boxing Association (NBA) began to sanction \\"title fights.\\" Also during that time, The Ring was founded, and it listed champions and awarded championship belts. The NBA was renamed in 1962 and became the World Boxing Association (WBA). The following year, a rival body, the World Boxing Council (WBC) was formed.Piero Pini and Professor Ram√≥n G. Vel√°squez (2006). History & Founding Fathers WBCboxing In 1983, the International Boxing Federation (IBF) was formed. In 1988, another world sanctioning body, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) was formed. In the 2010s a boxer had to be recognized by these four bodies to be the undisputed world champion; minor bodies like the International Boxing Organization (IBO) and World Boxing Union (WBU) are disregarded. Regional sanctioning bodies such as the North American Boxing Federation (NABF), the North American Boxing Council (NABC) and the United States Boxing Association (USBA) also awarded championships. The Ring magazine also continued listing the world champion of each weight division, and its rankings continue to be appreciated by fans.

He was born at Muguru, village, Iyego Location, Kangema Division in Murang‚Äôa District. He was educated in Kenya and abroad. Michuki emerged as one of the prominent and long-serving civil servants and politicians as well as a businessman in Kenya. Michuki served Kenya in various capacities, including Permanent Secretary in the Finance Ministry, Chairman of the Kenya Commercial Bank, Member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister.\\"Minister‚Äôs Profile ‚Äì Hon. John Michuki, EGH, MP\\" Office of Public Communication, He was serving his 4th five-year term as a Member of Parliament for Kangema Constituency. Michuki had a reputation as a \\"ruthless\\" and efficient manager, and was widely acknowledged as among the best performing ministers in President Kibaki's Government. He was serving as the Minister for Environment and National Resources at the time of his death.  Early life  Michuki was born in December 1932 at Muguru village, Iyego Location, Kangema Division in modern-day Murang‚Äôa County. He was born to a large polygamous family of Chief Michuki wa Kagwi who had 47 wives. Michuki was the first-born son of Mariana Wanjiku, the 45th wife of Chief Michuki Kagwi. Despite his chiefly parentage, Michuki did not enjoy the privileges of life in his early upbringing. This was largely because his father died on 4 January 1940 when young Michuki was just seven years old. He suffered the fate of large polygamous families, where sons of older wives tend to disinherit those of younger wives. As such, Michuki's mother secured only 3 acres from the large Michuki estate. In many respects, Michuki's early life was similar to that of many post-colonial African elite who rose to prominence aided by a combination of the social capital and ties of extended family, networks of friends, sheer ingenuity and hard work. Although he was a self-made man, Michuki attributed his success to his disciplinarian father and a visionary and loving mother Mariana Wanjiku who, despite being illiterate, was keen on giving him education.  Education  Michuki's mother enrolled him at Muguru primary School in 1941, a year after his father's demise. In 1943 young Michuki dropped out of school a result of financial problems to cater for his fees. He travelled to Nairobi where he worked briefly in tailoring-related works where he fixed buttons and made button holes for the uniforms of the Pioneer Corp Unit, during the Second World War. By the time the war ended, Michuki had relocated to Nyeri where he worked in the same job near the old police station, earning 1 Kenya shilling per day. While in Nairobi, he also cooked for the close and distant relatives quarantined by the colonial government as a result suffering from a smallpox epidemic. While here, Michuki enrolled at Kiangunyi Primary School where he sat for and passed his Kenya African Primary Education (KAPE) in 1945. In 1947 Michuki was admitted to Nyeri High School for his Secondary education, proceeding to Mang'u High School for his Advance Level education. It was while a student at Mang'u High School that Michuki met his lifelong friend, Mwai Kibaki, under whom he later served a senior civil servant and as a cabinet Minister when the latter became the President of the Republic of Kenya in 2002. In 1961, Michuki secured a government scholarship to study at Worcester College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Economics, Finance and Public Administration.  Civil Service Career  Michuki began his long career as civil servant in 1957 when he was recruited as a clerk within the Provincial Administration immediately after graduating from Mang‚Äôu High School. Upon graduating from Worcester in 1961, Michuki returned to Kenya becoming the first African District Commissioner (Kenya)District Commissioner(DC) in Nyeri District.Kenya Parliament Online,Member of Parliament ‚Äì Michuki, John When Kenya re-gained independence in 1963, Michuki joined Kenneth Matiba and Duncan Ndegwa in the youthful team of senior civil servants in Jomo Kenyatta‚Äôs first Independent Government (1963‚Äì1969). His achievements enabled him to quickly rise up the ranks from an Under Secretary in the Treasury in 1963 to Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Treasury in 1964 and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance in 1965. During his tenure as permanent Secretary, Michuki represented the Kenya Government on the boards of numerous influential international bodies, including being an Alternate Governor for Kenya on the World Bank, the International Development Association (IDA) and International Finance Corporation (IFC).Windsor Golf Resort, Golf Committee Members, Available at In 1971, he was awarded the Fellow of International Bankers Association (1971 ‚Äì Washington) for his exemplary stewardship of the Ministry of Finance and later the Kenya Commercial Bank.\\"John Michuki\\", Create Your Reader 2009 Available at In 1970, President Jomo Kenyatta appointed Michuki as the Executive Chairman of the Kenya Commercial Bank where he served until 1979. When President Daniel arap Moi succeeded President Jomo Kenyatta as President upon the latter‚Äôs death in 1978, Michuki became one of the Kikuyu civil servants who left public service to embark on business and political careers.  Political career  Michuki tried his hand in politics when he vied for the Kangema parliamentary seat during the 1979 general election, the first in the Moi era. He, however, lost to the incumbent, Joseph Kamotho. Michuki made an impressive political come-back in the aftermath of the abortive Coup d‚Äô√©tat by elements of the Kenya Air Force that nearly toppled Daniel Moi from power on 1 August 1982 and the political shake-up that followed the \\"Njonjo Commission of Inquiry\\" which set the stage for the dramatic fall of the then powerful former Attorney-General and Minister for Constitution Affairs, Charles Njonjo, and many of his allies in 1983. Michuki captured the chairmanship of the then powerful single party, the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in 1983, and dislodged Kamotho from the Kangema seat in the 1983 snap election. President Daniel arap Moi appointed him Assistant Minister for Finance. However, Michuki lost his parliamentary seat and the cabinet post after the controversial ‚ÄòMlolongo‚Äô (queue voting) election in 1988.Njonjo Kihuria \\"Reflections of a Fallen Insider\\", xkenya.com, 15 June 2008. Available at http://www.xkenya.com/CategoryGeneralDetails.asp?InfoID=1&noticeid;=311 In the ensuing protest politics after the 1988 massively flawed elections, Michuki covertly supported an emerging group rallied around his Murang‚Äôa counterparts, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, advocating for Kenya's return to multi-party politics. This campaign culminated in the historic Saba Saba uprising that eventually mounted pressure on Moi to repeal of article 2A, that legalized KANU's one-party dictatorship, and Kenya's return to political pluralism in 1991.  Multi-party Politics  In 1991, Michuki aligned himself to the politics of the original Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) that emerged from the Saba saba protest politics. Although his friend, Mwai Kibaki, also left the government and formed the more conservative Democratic Party of Kenya in December 1991, Michuki maintained his loyalty to the more populist FORD. Michuki was again forced to choose his political path when the original FORD split into two rival factions: the right-leaning Ford-Asili under Kenneth Matiba and its rival Ford-Kenya led by the left-leaning Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Michuki threw his support behind Matiba and FORD-Asili.\\"Raila And Michuki Assassination Claims: Why Murder Is Definitely On Somebody's Mind\\", http://kumekucha.blogspot.com/2006/11/raila-and-michuki-assassination- claims.html During the seminal 1992 multiparty elections, Michuki recaptured the Kangema seat on the Ford-Asili ticket. But when Ford-Asili further splintered ahead of the 1997 elections, Michuki decamped to Ford-People and retained his Kangema seat on the party's ticket.  Kibaki Era  Michuki was at the center of the coalition-making politics ahead of the historic 2002 elections. He first joined a group of parliamentarians led by the then leader of Opposition, Mwai Kibaki, which formed the National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK), as a merger of smaller opposition parties that endorsed Kibaki as flag- bearer. In October 2002, NAK coalesced with the breakaway faction of KANU, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) in 2002, which dislodged Moi and KANU after four decades in power. Michuki became a central figure and a key Kibaki ally in the NARC politics, retaining his Kangema parliamentary seat. President Kibaki subsequently appointed him Minister of Transport and Communications in the NARC government. Michuki Rules Michuki's legacy as the Minister for Transport and Communications was the famous \\"Michuki Rules\\" aimed at restoring order in public transport, especially the chaotic Matatu (Taxi) sector. The rules which came into effect in February 2004 required all public taxis (\\"matatus\\") and buses to install speed governors, passenger safety belts, operate in clearly defined routes, to carry a specified number of passengers and their drivers and conductors to be disciplined and to have a clean security record. In recognition of his efforts to reform public transport, Michuki won the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights' Waziri (Minister's) award.\\"Annual Human Rights And Democracy Awards Past Awardees\\", The Kenya National Commission On Human Rights (KNCHR), The defeat of the government sponsored constitution in the 2005 referendum culminated to the cabinet reshuffle which saw Michuki appointed as the Minister of influential ministry Internal Security and Provincial Administration.\\"John Michuki\\", Trip Atlas online.

He would however serve this ministry for a short while as when the Grand Coalition government was formed after a power-sharing agreement between president Kibaki and the leader of the opposition Raila Odinga. Minister of Environment Michuki was appointed as Minister for the Environment and Mineral Resources in the Grand Coalition Cabinet named on 13 April 2008. He was also appointed by president Kibaki as an Acting Minister of Finance on 11 July 2008 to stand in for Amos Kimunya. Amos Kimunya stepped aside pending investigation on corruption allegation in the Ministry when he censored by parliament over the sale of Grand Regency Hotel and the Safaricom IPO. As Minister for Environment and Mineral Resources, has initiated diverse programmes and projects among them being the Nairobi River's Rehabilitation and Restoration Programme, the reclamation of the Kenya's five water towers (the Mau Forest Complex, Mount Kenya, Aberdare Range, Mount Elgon and Cherangany Hills). He was honoured with a UNEP Award for his clean-up of the Nairobi River and the city. Michuki is the force behind the enactment of a new mining act to regulate environmental degradation and mining. He also took key leadership role in addressing Africa's position towards the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (December 2009) and served as the Co-Chair of International Environmental Governance (IEG). Michuki led the Kenya delegation to the Durban Environmental Conference in South Africa on 28 November-9 December 2011 where he stated Kenya's determination to reduce the menace of global warming and called on the world's wealthy nations to assist the poor ones to mitigate the devastation of climate change. This turned out to be the Minister's last official assignment, having missed the 12th Special Session of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) Governing Council Global Ministerial Forum held in Nairobi on 20 February 2012.  Controversies   ‚ÄòShoot-to- Kill‚Äô  Perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding Michuki is the infamous ‚ÄòShoot-to-kill‚Äô order against the out-lawed Mungiki sect, which he is alleged to have directed the police while he served as the Minister for Internal Security. Human Rights groups condemned the order citing that it contravened both the Police Act and general Human Rights guaranteed by the constitution.

He also cited his long friendship with President Mwai Kibaki, who was heading the pro-constitution campaigns.

All Polish cities were renamed in Russian and the size of the map nearly doubled. The Soviet historiography believes that this map constitutes Belarus during World War II, not eastern Poland The Belarusian resistance during World War II opposed Nazi Germany from 1941 until 1944. Belarus was one of the Soviet republics occupied during Operation Barbarossa. Belarusian partisans may refer to Soviet-formed irregular military groups participating in the Belarusian resistance during World War II against Nazi Germany as well as the pro-German collaborationist structures behind the Soviet front.  Pro-Soviet resistance  Masha Bruskina with fellow resistance members before hanging, Minsk, October 26, 1941. After the victories of the Wehrmacht against the Red Army in 1941, Belarus was one of the Soviet republics that came under control of Nazi Germany (Operation Barbarossa). The official government of the occupation forces was established on August 23, 1941, under the direction of Wilhelm Kube, the German administrator of the Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien district. The German pacification operations were able to curb partisan activity significantly throughout the summer and fall of 1941. The Belarusian Auxiliary Police was established by the Nazis in July 1941 and deployed to murder operations particularly in February‚ÄìMarch 1942. The resistance movement first consisted of cut-off Soviet soldiers, some civilians began joining them around the summer of 1942. From that time until the end of the year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) of Byelorussia formed courses and offices helping those wishing to fight the Nazi Government. Generalreichskommissar Wilhelm Kube Already in July 1941, an underground group in the Vesnitsky village council of the Ushachsky district was created by the head of the Lesinsky outpost of the 13th Berezinsky border detachment (), Lieutenant Kudryavtsev. Underground workers established relations with the population, conducted oral campaigns among them, calling for a struggle against the invaders, and helped unite the locals. Soon it was decided to create a partisan detachment and begin an open armed struggle. The Nazis tracked down Kudryavtsev and one night surrounded the house where he was resting and killed him. The first partisan detachments were composed mostly of Red Army personnel, but also included local people. They were commanded by offices of the Red Army, the Soviet secret police NKVD or local Soviet or Communist apparatchiks. These detachments dated back to the early days of World War II: the detachment Starasyel'ski of major Dorodnykh in Zhabinka district (June 23, 1941),(HistBel-5) –ì—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—è –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ: –£ 6 —Ç. –¢. 5. –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å —É 1917‚Äî1945. ‚Äì –ú–Ω.: –≠–∫–∞–ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—ã–≤–∞, 2006. ‚Äì 613 —Å.; —ñ–ª. . p.492. the detachment of Vasily Korzh in Pinsk on June 26, 1941 and others. First awards to the partisans with order of Hero of the Soviet Union occurred on August 6, 1941; they were given to detachment commanders Pavlovskiy and Bumazhkov. Throughout 1941, the core of the partisan movement consisted of the straggling remains of the Red Army units destroyed in Operation Barbarossa, personnel of the destruction battalions, and local Communist Komsomol and Soviet apparatchiks. The most common unit of the period was the detachment. The \\"seed\\" partisan detachments, diversionist and organizational groups were actively formed and inserted into German-occupied territories beginning in the summer of 1941. Urban underground groups were formed as a force complementing the activities of partisan units, which operated in rural terrains. Organization As a controlling body, a network of underground Communist structures was actively developed on German-occupied territories, and it received an influx of specially picked Communist activists. By the end of 1941, more than two thousand partisan detachments (with more than 90,000 personnel) operated in German-occupied territories.–õ—ñ—Ç–≤—ñ–Ω–æ—û—Å–∫—ñ –Ü. –ê.

(—Ç.12). However, the activities of the partisan forces weren't centrally coordinated or logistically provided for until spring of 1942. In order to coordinate partisan operations, the Headquarters of the Partisan Movement, headed by Panteleymon Ponomarenko, the Russian-born former head of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, was organised on May 30, 1942. The Staff had its liaisons in the Military Councils of the fronts and armies. The territorial Staffs were subsequently created, dealing with the partisan movement in the respective Soviet Republics and in the occupied provinces of the Soviet Russia. Later NKVD, SMERSH and GRU began to train special groups of future partisans (effectively, special forces units) in the rear and dropping them in the occupied territories. The candidates for these groups were chosen among volunteers from regular Red Army, NKVD's Internal Troops, and also among Soviet sportsmen. When dropped behind Axis lines, the groups were to organize and guide the local self-established partisan units. Radio operators and intelligence gathering officers were the essential members of each group since amateur fighters could not be trusted with these tasks. Some commanders of these special units (like Dmitry Medvedev) later became well-known partisan leaders. Logistics difficulties The Soviet authorities considered Belarus to be of the utmost importance to the development of the Soviet partisan war from the very beginning. The main factors were its geography, with many dense forests and swamps, and its strategic position on the communications going from West to Moscow. In fact, Belorussian Communist bodies in the Eastern provinces of Belarus began to organize and facilitate organization of the partisan units on the day after the first directive issuing (directives No.1 of 1941-07-30 and No.2 of 1941-07-01). By the Soviet estimates, in August 1941 about 231 detachments were operating already. The \\"seed\\" units, formed and inserted into Belarus, totaled 437 by the end of the 1941, comprising more than 7.2 thousand personnel.(All-people struggle in Belarus against the German-fascist invaders) –í—Å–µ–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –±–æ—Ä—å–±–∞ –≤ –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –Ω–µ–º–µ—Ü–∫–æ-—Ñ–∞—à–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç—á–∏–∫–æ–≤. –¢. 1. –°. 84, 112., as cited in (HistB5) –ì—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—è –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ: –£ 6 —Ç. –¢. 5. –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å —É 1917‚Äî1945. ‚Äì –ú–Ω.: –≠–∫–∞–ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç—ã–≤–∞, 2006. ‚Äì 613 —Å.; —ñ–ª. . p.491. However, as the frontline moved further away, the logistical conditions steadily worsened for the partisan units, as the resources ran out, and there was no wide-scale support from over the frontline until March 1942. One outstanding difficulty was the lack of radio communication, which wasn't addressed until April 1942. The support of the local people was also insufficient.Turonek, P.76. So, for several months, partisan units in Belarus were virtually left to themselves. Especially difficult for the partisans was the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, with severe shortages in ammunition, medicine and supplies. The actions of partisans were generally uncoordinated. In the circumstances, the German pacification operations in Summer and Fall 1941 were able to curb the partisan activity significantly. Many units went underground, and generally, in the late Fall 1941‚Äîearly 1942, the partisan units weren't undertaking the significant military operations, limiting themselves to sorting out the organizational problems, building up the logistics support and gaining influence with the local people. By the incomplete data, in the end of the 1941, 99 partisan detachments and about 100 partisan groups operated in Belarus.(All-people struggle...) V.1. p.107., as cited in (HistB5) p.493.

In August 1941, about 231 partisan detachments were operating in Soviet Belarus. The units totaled 437 by the end of the 1941, comprising more than 7,200 personnel. In the period of December 1941, the German guard forces in the Army Group \\"Center\\" rear comprised 4 security divisions, 2 SS brigades, 260 companies of different branches of service. The Moscow Battle turned the tide in the morale of the partisans and of the local people in general. However, the real turning point in the development of the partisan movement in Belarus, and, in fact, on the German-occupied territories in general, came in the course of the Soviet Winter 1942 offensive.  1942, Vitebsk Gate  Oskar Dirlewanger as an SS- Oberf√ºhrer, 1944. In Belarus, the SS-Sonderbataillon \\"Dirlewanger\\" came under the command of Central Russia's H√∂herer SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer, Erich von dem Bach Zelewski. The \\"Dirlewanger\\" resumed anti-partisan duties in this area, working in cooperation with the Kaminski Brigade for the first time. Its conduct in the Soviet Union, rather than improving, worsened and atrocities were a daily occurrence. It is estimated that 200 villages were burned and 120,000 civilians were killed during the actions involving the Dirlewanger in Belarus 1942‚Äì1944. The Germans treated the local population abysmally (with the notable exception of the fraction of the civil administration headed by Wilhelm Kube), maintained kolkhozes in East and restored land possessions in West, collecting heavy food taxes, rounded up and sent young people to work in the Germany.Belarus was the republic hardest hit by the war that took from 25 to 40% of the republic's population. According to the Himmler's plan, 3/4 of the Belarusian population was to be eradicated and the remainder was to be used as a slave labour force. By Summer 1942 all the illusions some Belarusians might have had about the Nazi rule, even compared to the brutal Stalinist regime, were lost and the anti-fascist resistance rose dramatically. Overwhelmingly, Jews and even small-scale Soviet activists would feel more secure in the partisan ranks. The direct boost to the partisan numbers were the Red Army POWs of the local origin, who were let out \\"to the homes\\" in Fall 1941, but ordered by Germans to return to the concentration camps in March 1942.Turonek, p.78. In the Spring 1942, the aggregation of the smaller partisan units into brigades began, prompted by the experience of the first year of war. The coordination, numerical buildup, structural rework and now established logistical feed all translated to the greatly increased partisan units military capability, which showed, e.g., in the increased number of diversions on the railroads, reaching hundreds of engines and thousands of cars destroyed by the end of the year.By the German sources. Turonek, p.79. Also noted is that this result, while in itself spectacular, was of lesser relevance than expected, as the German offensive in 1942 came out in South. In 1942, the terror campaign against the territorial administration, which was manned by the local people (\\"collaborators and traitors\\") was additionally emphasized.Mentioned as primary in the report of the HQ of partisan movement on November 9, 1942. Turonek, p.79. This resulted, however, in the definite split of the local people's sympathies, resulting in the beginning of the organisation of the anti-partisan units with native personnel in 1942. By the November 1942, Soviet partisan units in Belarus numbered about 47,000 personnel. Chkalov Brigade, Belarus, 1943. The turning point in the development of the Soviet partisan movement came with the opening of the Vitsyebsk gate in February 1942. The partisan units were included in the overall Soviet strategical developments shortly after that, and the centralized organizational and logistical support had been organized, with Gate's existence being the very important facilitating factor. See also: Central Headquarters of Partisan Movement, Special Belarusian courses. By the November 1942, Soviet partisan units in Belarus numbered about 47.3 thousand personnel.  1943  In January 1943, out of 56,000 partisan personnel, 11,000 were operating in the West Belarus, which was 3.5 less per 10 thousand local people than in the East, and even more so (up to 5‚Äì6 factor) if accounting for the much more efficient evacuation measures in the East in 1941.Turonek, pp.83,86. This discrepancy wouldn't be sufficiently explained by the German treatment of local people, nor by the quick German advance in 1941, nor by the social circumstances then existing in these regions.Turonek, p.83.In fact, small land-owners in West showed \\"surprising\\" sympathies to the Partisans. Turonek, p.83. There is strong evidence, that this was decision of the central Soviet authorities, who abstained from the greater buildup of the Partisan forces in West Belarus, and let Polish underground military structures to grow unopposed in these lands in 1941‚Äì1942, in the context of relations with the Polish government in exile of Sikorsky.Turonek, p.84. Certain level of military cooperation, imposed by the respective commands, was noted between Soviet partisans and Armia Krajowa (AK), the people of Polish nationality were, to a degree, exampled from the terror campaign in 1942.To a certain surprise of Germans, Turonek, p.84. After the break of diplomatic relations between USSR and Polish government in exile in April 1943, the situation changed radically. From this moment on, AK was treated as hostile military force. The buildup of the Soviet partisan force in the Western Belarus was ordered and implemented during 1943, with 9 brigades, 10 detachments and 15 operational groups transferred from the Eastern to Western lands, effectively tripling the Partisan force there (to 36.8 thousand in December 1943). It is estimated that c. 10‚Äì12 thousand personnel were transferred, and about same number came from the local volunteers. The buildup of the military force was complemented by the ensuing buildup of the underground Communist Party structures and propaganda activity.Turonek, pp.84,85. The Stalingrad victory, certain curbing of the terror campaign (actually since December 1942, formally in February 1943) and amnesty promised to repenting collaborants were a significant factors in the 1943 growth of the Soviet partisan forces. Desertions from the ranks of the German-controlled Hilfspolizei and military formations strengthened, with sometimes whole units coming over to Soviet partisan side ‚Äì Volga Tartars battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), Gil-Rodionov 1st Russian People's brigade of the SS (2500 personnel, August 1943). Summarily, about 7 thousand people of miscellaneous anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force. About 1.9 thousand specialists and commanders were inserted in the Belarusian lands in 1943. However, the local people comprised the core of the personnel influx in the Soviet partisan force. In late May 1943, Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe, with permission of the headquarters of the Home Army, concentrated its forces (200 men) around Wyszkow. The Germans soon found out about it and surrounded the Poles. A skirmish ensued, in which 4 Poles were killed and 8 wounded. German losses were estimated at 15 killed and 22 wounded. Those who were not caught, divided themselves into two groups and headed north, to Bezirk Bialystok. On June 11, 1943, the UBK forces under Major Stanislaw Pieciul (Radecki) of the 4th Battalion engaged the Germans near the village of Pawly (Bielsk Podlaski County). 25 Poles and approximately 40 Germans died. In July 1943 the Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe units, active in Bezirk Bialystok, consisted of five Battalions. Altogether, there were 200 fighters, and during a number of skirmishes with the Germans (including the 1943 Polish underground raid on East Prussia), 138 of them were killed. These heavy losses were criticized by the headquarters of the Home Army, who claimed that the UBK was profusely using lives of young Polish soldiers. On August 17, 1943, upon the order of General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, the UBK was included into the Home Army. Soon afterwards, all battalions were transferred to the area of Nowogrodek. In the Fall 1943, the partisan force in BSSR totaled about 153,700, and by the end 1943 about 122,000, with about 30,800 put behind the frontline in the course of liberation of eastern parts of BSSR (in the end of 1943). After the liberation of BSSR, about 180,000 partisans joined the Soviet Army in 1944. During the 1941‚Äî1944 period, the turnaround in the Soviet partisan force in Belarus was about 374,000, about 70,000 in urban underground, and about 400,000 in the reserve of the partisan force. Among Soviet partisans in Belarus were people of 45 different ethnic backgrounds and 4,000 foreigners (including 3,000 Poles, 400 Czechs and Slovaks, 300 Yugoslavians, etc.). Around 65% of Belarusian partisans were local people. On September 22, 1943, Kube was assassinated in his Minsk home by a bomb as part of Operation Blow- Up; the bomb was placed by a Soviet partisan Yelena Mazanik, a Belarusian woman who had managed to find employment in Kube's household as a maid and presumably became his mistress in order to assassinate him.  1943‚Äì1944  Soviet partisans on the road in Belarus, 1944 The partisan movement was so strong that by 1943‚Äì44 there were entire regions in occupied Belarus, where Soviet authority was re-established deep inside the German held territories. There were even partisan kolkhozes that were raising crops and livestock to produce food for the partisans. During the battles for liberation of Belarus, partisans were considered the fourth Belarusian front. As early as the spring of 1942 the Soviet partisans were able to effectively harass German troops and significantly hamper their operations in the region. The buildup of the Soviet partisan force in the West Belarus was ordered and implemented during 1943, with nine brigades, 10 detachments and 15 operational groups transferred from the Eastern to Western lands, effectively tripling the Partisan force there (to 36,000 in December 1943). It is estimated that c. 10,000‚Äì12,000 personnel were transferred, and about same number came from the local volunteers. The buildup of the military force was complemented by the ensuing buildup of the underground Communist Party structures and propaganda activity. The Soviet victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, certain curbing of the terror campaign (actually since December 1942, formally in February 1943) and amnesty promised to repenting collaborators were a significant factors in the 1943 growth of the Soviet partisan forces. Desertions from the ranks of the German-controlled police and military formations strengthened, with sometimes whole units coming over to Soviet partisan side, including the Volga Tatars battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), and the Gil-Rodionov's 1st Russian People's brigade of the SS (2,500 personnel, August 1943). Summarily, about 7,000 people of miscellaneous anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force, while about 1,900 specialists and commanders were inserted in the Belarusian lands in 1943. However, the local people comprised the core of the personnel influx in the Soviet partisan force. Itzhak Rudnicki was active in the Wilno Ghetto underground movement from 1942 to 1944. In February 1943, he joined the Belarusian partisans in the Wilno Battalion of the Markov Brigade, a primarily non-Jewish unit in which he had to contend with antisemitism. Apart from a foray infiltrating the Wilno Ghetto in April 1943 to meet with underground leader Abba Kovner, he stayed with the partisans until the end of the war, fighting the Germans and their collaborators in the Narocz Forest in Belarus. In the Fall 1943, the partisan force in BSSR totaled about 153,000, and by the end 1943 about 122,000, with about 30,000 put behind the front line in the course of liberation of eastern parts of BSSR (end 1943). The partisan movement was so strong that by 1943‚Äì1944 there were entire regions in occupied Belarus, where Soviet authority was re-established deep inside the German held territories. There were even partisan kolkhozes that were raising crops and livestock to produce food for the partisans. The Bielski partisans' activities were aimed at the Nazis and their collaborators, such as Belarusian volunteer policemen or local inhabitants who had betrayed or killed Jews. They also conducted sabotage missions. The Nazi regime offered a reward of 100,000 Reichsmarks for assistance in the capture of Tuvia Bielski, and in 1943, led major clearing operations against all partisan groups in the area. Some of these groups suffered major casualties, but the Bielski partisans fled safely to a more remote part of the forest, and continued to offer protection to the noncombatants among their band. During the process of reorganization of the Nowogrodek Area of the Armia Krajowa, the Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe units created a battalion, which became part of the 77th Infantry Regiment of the Armia Krajowa, under Boleslaw Piasecki. In February 1944 the battalion had around 700 soldiers (some sources put the number at around 500). The unit took part in the Operation Tempest, fighting the Germans around Lida and Wilno (see: Wilno Uprising), where it suffered heavy losses. V Wile≈Ñska Brygada Armii Krajowej, commanded by Zygmunt Szendzielarz (≈Åupaszko), fought against the German army and SS units in the area of southern Wilno Voivodeship, but was also frequently attacked by the Soviet Partisans paradropped in the area by the Red Army. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by Lithuanian police and handed over to the German Gestapo. ≈Åupaszko escaped or was released in unknown circumstances at the end of April. In reprisal actions his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release. On June 12, 1944 General Tadeusz B√≥r-Komorowski, Commander-in-Chief of the Armia Krajowa, issued an order to prepare a plan of liberating Wilno from German hands. The Armia Krajowa districts of Vilnius and Navahrudak planned to take control of the city before the Soviets could reach it. The Commander of the Armia Krajowa District in Wilno, General Aleksander Krzy≈ºanowski \\"Wilk\\", decided to regroup all the partisan units in the northeastern part of Poland for the assault, both from inside the city and from the outside. On June 23, two squads of V Wile≈Ñska Brygada, commanded by \\"Maks\\" and \\"Rakoczy\\", attacked the Lithuanian policemen in Dubingiai. The starting date was set to July 7. Approximately 12,500 Armia Krajowa soldiers attacked the German garrison and managed to seize most of the city center. Heavy street fighting in the outskirts lasted until July 14. In Wilno's eastern suburbs, the Armia Krajowa units cooperated with reconnaissance groups of the Soviet 3rd Belorussian Front.  Soviets enter  General Krzy≈ºanowski wanted to group all of the partisan units into a re-created Polish 19th Infantry Division. However, the advancing Red Army entered the city on July 15, and the NKVD started to intern all Polish soldiers. In August the commander of all Home Army units in the Wilno area, Gen. Aleksander Krzy≈ºanowski \\"Wilk\\" ordered all six brigades under his command to prepare for the Operation Tempest ‚Äì a plan for an all-national uprising against the German forces occupying Poland. In what became known as the Operation Ostra Brama, the V Brigade was to attack the Wilno suburb of Zwierzyniec in cooperation with the advancing units of the 3rd Belorussian Front. However, for fear of being arrested with his units by the NKVD and killed on the spot, Zygmunt Szendzielarz ‚Äì ≈Åupaszko ‚Äì decided to disobey the orders and instead moved his unit to central Poland. The Operation Ostra Brama was a success and the city was liberated by Polish soldiers, but the Polish commander was then arrested by the Soviets and the majority of his soldiers were sent to Gulags and sites of detention in the Soviet Union. It is uncertain why Szendzielarz was not court-martialled for desertion. It is highly probable that in fact his unit was moved out of the battlefield by Gen. \\"Wilk\\" himself, due to the fact that ≈Åupaszka's unit has been long involved in fights with the Soviet partisans and he did not want to provoke the Red Army. Regardless, after crossing into Podlaskie and Bia≈Çystok area in October, the brigade continued the struggle against withdrawing Germans in the ranks of the \\"Bia≈Çystok Home Army Area\\". After the region was overrun by the Soviets, ≈Åupaszka's unit remained in the forests and ≈Åupaszka decided to wait for the outcome of Russo-Polish talks held by the Polish Government in Exile. At the same time the unit was reorganized and captured enough equipment to fully arm 600 men with machine guns and machine pistols. After the governments of the United Kingdom and United States broke the pacts with Poland and accepted the Polish Committee of National Liberation as the provisional government of Poland, ≈Åupaszka restarted the hostilities ‚Äì this time against a new oppressor, in the ranks of Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá organization. However, after several successful actions against the NKVD units in the area of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, it became apparent that such actions would result in a total destruction of his unit. During the battles for liberation of Belarus, partisans considered the fourth Belorussian front. After the liberation of BSSR, about 180,000 partisans joined the Soviet Army in 1944. During the 1941‚Äì1944 period, the turnaround in the Soviet partisan force in Belarus was about 374,000, about 70,000 in urban underground, and about 400,000 in the reserve of the partisan force. Among Soviet partisans in Belarus were people of 45 different ethnic backgrounds and 4,000 foreigners (including 3,000 Poles, 400 Czechs and Slovaks, 300 Yugoslavians, etc.). Around 65% of Belarusian partisans were local people. As part of the Nazis' effort to combat the enormous Belarusian resistance during World War II, special units of local collaborationists were trained by the SS's Otto Skorzeny to infiltrate the Soviet rear. In 1944 thirty Belarusians, known as \\"ƒåorny Kot\\" (\\"Black Cat\\") and personally led by Micha≈Ç Vitu≈°ka, were airdropped by the Luftwaffe behind the lines of the Red Army, which had already liberated Belarus during Operation Bagration. They experienced some initial success due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army, and some other German-trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest in 1945. Vitu≈°ka managed to escape to the West following the war, along with several other Belarusian Central Rada leaders.

A major operation of partisan formations against the railroad transportation and communications intended to disrupt the German reinforcements and supplies for the Battle of Kursk and later the Battle of Smolensk.http://slonimtown.nm.ru/rels.htm It involved concentrated actions by more than 100,000 partisan fighters from Belarus, the Leningrad Oblast, the Kalinin Oblast, the Smolensk Oblast, the Oryol Oblast and Ukraine within an area 1000 km along the front and 750 km wide. Reportedly, more than 230,000 rails were destroyed, along with many bridges, trains and other railroad infrastructure. The operation seriously incapacitated German logistics and was instrumental in the Soviet victory in Kursk battle. *Operation Concert, September 19 ‚Äì November 1, 1943. \\"Concerto\\"http://slonimtown.nm.ru/konc.htm was a major operation of partisan formations against the railroad communications intended to disrupt the German reinforcements and supplies for the Battle of the Dnieper and on the direction of the Soviet offensive in the Smolensk and Homel directions. Partisans from Belarus, Karelia, the Kalinin Oblast, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the Crimea participated in the operations. The area of the operation was 900 km along the front (excluding Karelia and Crimea) and 400 km wide. Despite bad weather that only permitted the airlift of less than a half of the planned supplies, the operation lead to a 35‚Äì40% decrease in the railroad capacity in the area of operations. This was critical for the success of Soviet military operations in the autumn of 1943. In Belarus alone the partisans claimed the destruction of more than 90,000 rails along with 1,061 trains, 72 railroad bridges and 58 Axis garrisons. According to the Soviet historiography, Axis losses totaled more than 53,000 soldiers. *Battle of Po≈Çock-Lepel, April 1944. Major battle between Belarusian partisans and German punitive expeditions. *Battle of Borys√≥w-Begoml, April 22 ‚Äì May 15, 1944. Major battle between Belarusian partisans and German punitive expeditions. *Operation Bagration, June 22 ‚Äì August 19, 1944. Belarusian partisans took major part in the Operation Bagration. They were often considered the fifth front (along with the 1st Baltic Front, 1st Belorussian Front, 2nd Belorussian Front and 3rd Belorussian Front). Upwards of 300,000 partisans took part in the operation.  Pro-independence resistance  Fr. Vincent Hadle≈≠ski, leader of the Belarusian Independence Party, executed by the Nazis In 1941, a significant part of the Belarusian pro-independence movement chose to collaborate with the Nazis following mass Soviet repressions in Belarus and discrimination of Belarusians in the Second Polish Republic throughout the preceding decades. However, as the war progressed, parts of the collaboration movement became less loyal to the Germans. By 1942, the Belarusian Independence Party emerged as an underground group uniting members of the Belarusian independence movement aiming to overthrow the Nazi rule. The group started preparing an anti-German uprising in Minsk.–ù–∞–ø—Ä—ã–∫–∞–Ω—Ü—ã —á—ç—Ä–≤–µ–Ω—è 1944 –≥. –¶–ö –ë–ù–ü —Ä—ã—Ö—Ç–∞–≤–∞—û —É –ú–µ–Ω—Å–∫—É –∞–Ω—Ç—ã–Ω—è–º–µ—Ü–∫–∞–µ –ø–∞—û—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å–Ω–µ –∑ –º—ç—Ç–∞–π –∞–±–≤—è—à—á—ç–Ω—å–Ω—è –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞–π –†—ç—Å–ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫—ñ, —è–∫–æ–µ –±—ã–ª–æ –∞–¥–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∞ –∑ –ø—Ä—ã—á—ã–Ω—ã —ñ–º–∫–ª—ñ–≤–∞–≥–∞ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç—É–ø—É –ß—ã—Ä–≤–æ–Ω–∞–π –ê—Ä–º—ñ—ñ. Miko≈Ça Abramƒçyk, president of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in exile, has visited Belarus during the war and established contacts with the Belarusian Independence Party but was then by force expelled to Paris by the Nazis where he lived under surveillance by the Gestapo. Germans reacted with repressions. The Catholic priest Vincent Hadle≈≠ski, who was the leader of the Belarusian Independence Party, was arrested by the German police on December 24, 1942 and executed in the Maly Trostenets extermination camp. In 1943, Ivan Yermachenka, an influential politician, was arrested amid his growing influence and under suspicion of organizing the assassination of Wilhelm Kube, tortured and expelled from Belarus.  Jewish forces  During the same period, Jewish residents of Belarus also took part in partisan activities. The units, based on family camps, was devised by Tuvia Bielski with his brothers in Western Belarus. Based from the forests near the Neman River, the family units was home to mostly women, children and elderly. The men who were able to carry weapons either guarded the camps or took part in partisan activities. While the main purpose of the camps was to shelter Belarusian Jews and create villages to survive, there were some camps that were set up to militarily combat the occupation government. One group, from 1941 until 1944, attacked or destroyed bridges, factories, railroad tracks and killed police and Nazi officials. The family camps also prevented the deportation of residents to either labor or concentration camps.  Polish forces  The Polish underground operated over the whole pre-war territory of Poland, including the Polish territories annexed by the Soviet Union. As non-communist Poles tended to consider the Soviets as occupiers even after the German invasion of the Soviet Union there was some conflict between Polish and Soviet partisans. June 22, 1943, Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party received orders in Moscow to destroy Armia Krajowa in Belarus. Since then, the number of conflicts between Soviet and non-communist Polish partisans intensified. One Polish unit was arrested December 1, 1943, some Polish officers were executed, the commander major Wac≈Çaw Pe≈Çka transported to Moscow.http://www.iwieniec.plewako.pl/AK/Iwieniecka%20AK.pdf  Resistance fighters   Anti-Nazi  *Ale≈õ Adamowicz *Zygmunt Andruszkiewicz *Yitzhak Arad *Asael Bielski *Tuvia Bielski *Zus Bielski *Masza Bruskina *Janka Bryl *Abba Kovner *Henryk Krajewski *Aleksander Krzy≈ºanowski *W≈Çadys≈Çaw Liniarski *Dov Lopatyn *Piotr Maszerau *Pancelajmon Panamarenka *Zinaida Portnova *Ivan Sergeychik *Yosif Strangelski *Piatro Sze≈Çachonaw *Janusz Szlaski *Shalom Yoran *Simcha Zorin  Anti-Soviet  *Wiaczes≈Çaw Adamowicz *Pawe≈Ç Trubecki *Micha≈Ç Vitu≈°ka  Other  *Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz *Eugenio Cal√≤ *Maria Fedecka *Vassili Kononov *Sergiusz Piasecki *Mo≈°e Pijade *Arturs Sproƒ£is *Zygmunt Szendzielarz *Pyotr Vershigora  Resistance units  *19th Infantry Division (Poland) *29th Infantry Division (Poland) *Anti-Fascist Military Organisation *Armia Krajowa in Belarus *Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie *Bielski partisans *Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje *Le≈õni *National Armed Forces *Polish 30th Infantry Division *Soviet partisan regiment 1941‚Äì1944 *Soviet partisan united formation 1941‚Äì1944 *Szare Szeregi *Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe In mass culture Soldiers depicting Belorussian partisans during a parade in Minsk on the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of Belarus in 2019.

It is common throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and New Zealand, partly as a migrant. In New Zealand, it is also known in the MƒÅori language as hƒ´hue. Description and habits The wingspan is 80‚Äì105 mm. This hawkmoth's basic coloration is in grayish tones, but the abdomen has a broad gray dorsal stripe and pink and black bands edged with white on the sides. The hindwings are light gray with darker broad crosslines. Its favourite time is around sunset and during the twilight, when it is seen in gardens hovering over the flowers. This moth is very attracted to light, so it is often killed by cars on highways. Its caterpillars eat the leaves of the Convolvulus, hence its Latin name \\"convolvuli\\". Other recorded food plants include a wide range of plants in the families Araceae, Convolvulaceae, Leguminosae and Malvaceae. It can be a pest of cultivated Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato or k≈´mara) in New Zealand and the Pacific. It feeds on the wing and has a very long proboscis (longer than its body) that enables it to feed on long trumpet-like flowers such as Nicotiana sylvestris.Michael Chinery, Collins Guide to the Insects of Great Britain and Western Europe The caterpillars can be in a number of different colours. As well as brown (pictured below) they have been seen in bright green and black. Similar species A. convulvuli is unmistakable in the eastern area of distribution, in the western area of distribution it can be mistaken for Agrius cingulatus. This species, found mainly in South and Central America is repeatedly detected on the western shores of Europe. Agrius cingulatus can be distinguished on the basis of the clearly stronger pink colouring of the abdominal segments and a similarly coloured rear wing base. In addition, Agrius convolvuli form pseudoconvolvuli Schaufuss, 1870 has some resemblance with North American species in the genus Manduca, for instance Manduca sexta.

They were one of the smallest steam locomotives to be inherited by the CI√â on its formation.  History  In 1875 Inchicore Works outshopped two railmotors, steam locomotives with a carriage on the same chassis to work the Castleisland and Gortatlea Light Railway. Both railmotors were rebuilt (the first in 1890) removing the carriage portion and leaving the locomotive as a small and light 0-6-0T. The two examples were numbered 90 and 100 and were put to work in the Cork area. Unusually, the centre driving wheels were flangeless giving very good working over tight radius tracks. They regularly shunted along the quayside at Cork and worked the car trains from the Ford works to Rocksavage yard. In the summer months both locomotives were coupled together to work the excursion trains on the lightly laid Timoleague and Courtmacsherry Light Railway. In 1890 the class was enlarged with Inchicore building two further examples for use on the Fermoy to Mitchelstown branch and two for the Kingsbridge to Inchicore branch, which they worked until 1945. Several detail changes were made over the years. One of the most noticeable was the replacement of the original chimney (which had a pronounced taper from base to apex), being replaced with a parallel version with a distinct lip.  Dimensions  * Driving Wheels: (10 spokes), centre wheels flangeless. * Cylinders: (2) * Boiler Pressure: * Weight:  Livery  As locomotives they were painted in dark green with red, black and light green (later black and white) lining, with numbers on buffer beams in yellow, shaded white and blue. The tank sides carried number plates with polished numbers against a paint black background on the plate. After about 1915 they became all-over plain grey, initially with numberplates painted on in grey, but latterly under CI√â these were removed and large pale yellow painted numerals applied instead. No. 90, the last survivor, appears to have been repainted black in its last few years in use, approximately 1957-60.  Preservation  One example, No. 90, was preserved for many years as a static exhibit at Mallow. This was painted in the green livery, as detailed above, but a cast number plate with black numerals on a silver background (not original) has replaced the painted numbers. After a brief spell in the CI√â workshops at Inchicore No. 90 was removed to the workshops of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead in 2005, to undergo restoration. The locomotive was back in steam by Sunday 30 September 2007 and can now be seen on static display in the Carriage Gallery at the Downpatrick Railway Museum.

For example, is an algebraic expression. Since taking the square root is the same as raising to the power , :\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}} is also an algebraic expression. By contrast, transcendental numbers like and are not algebraic, since they are not derived from integer constants and algebraic operations. Usually, Pi is constructed as a geometric relationship, and the definition of requires an infinite number of algebraic operations. A rational expression is an expression that may be rewritten to a rational fraction by using the properties of the arithmetic operations (commutative properties and associative properties of addition and multiplication, distributive property and rules for the operations on the fractions). In other words, a rational expression is an expression which may be constructed from the variables and the constants by using only the four operations of arithmetic. Thus, :\\\\frac{3x^2 - 2xy + c}{y^3-1} is a rational expression, whereas :\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1-x^2}{1+x^2}} is not. A rational equation is an equation in which two rational fractions (or rational expressions) of the form : \\\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} are set equal to each other. These expressions obey the same rules as fractions. The equations can be solved by cross-multiplying. Division by zero is undefined, so that a solution causing formal division by zero is rejected.

Georges Dum√©zil and others have argued that Hadingus was partially modelled on the god Nj√∂r√∞r. Gesta Danorum Hadingus is the legendary son of Gram of Denmark and Signe, the daughter of Finnish King Sumble. Gram steals Signe from her wedding, kills the husband (Henry, King of Saxony) and takes her to Denmark, where Hadingus is born. When Gram is killed by Swipdag, King of Norway, Hadingus is taken to Sweden and is fostered by the giant Wagnofthus and his daughter Harthgrepa. He is eager to become a warrior but Harthgrepa tries to dissuade him from it in favor of entering into a quasi-incestuous love-relationship with her. > Why doth thy life thus waste and wander? Why dost thou pass thy years unwed, > following arms, thirsting for throats? Nor does my beauty draw thy vows. > Carried away by excess of frenzy, thou art little prone to love. Steeped in > blood and slaughter, thou judgest wars better than the bed, nor refreshest > thy soul with incitements. Thy fierceness finds no leisure; dalliance is far > from thee, and savagery fostered. Nor is thy hand free from blasphemy while > thou loathest the rites of love. Let this hateful strictness pass away, let > that loving warmth approach, and plight the troth of love to me, who gave > thee the first breasts of milk in childhood, and helped thee, playing a > mother's part, duteous to thy needs. The Danish History, Book One Elton > (1905). Hadingus accepts Harthgrepa's embraces and when he wants to travel back to Denmark she accompanies him. After raising a man from the dead to obtain information, Harthgrepa is killed by supernatural beings. At this point Hadingus acquires a new patron, Odin, who predicts his future and gives him advice. The death of Hadingus, illustration by Louis Moe Hadingus wages wars in the Baltic and achieves victory and renown. He then returns to Scandinavia, defeats Suibdagerus, his father's slayer, and becomes king of Denmark. As king he has an eventful career ahead of him. He wars with Norwegians and Swedes, offends a god by killing a divine animal and atones for it by a sacrifice to Freyr, he rescues the princess Regnilda from giants and takes her as a wife, visits the underworld, participates in more wars and dies by hanging himself in front of his subjects. The story of Hadding is retold in fictionalized form by Poul Anderson in the novel War of the Gods.  See also  * Haddingjar Notes References * Dum√©zil, Georges (1973).

Born at H√©ricourt, and educated in Montb√©liard, he moved in 1905 to Saint Petersburg, Russia to work for the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. To improve the mobility of the imperial car park, he invented the K√©gresse track to modify normal motor vehicles into half-tracks. He was also a personal chauffeur of Tsar Nicholas II and the Head of the Mechanical Department of the Russian Imperial Garage at Tsarskoye Selo. The Aide-de-camp to Tsar Nicholas II, Prince Orlov wrote in a letter to the Tsar's Minister of the Court on May 15, 1914: \\"... I consider K√©gresse an irreplaceable worker and I am afraid his leaving will be a great loss for the garage. Your Highness knows, of course, how much His Majesty appreciates K√©gresse.\\" In 1908, the architect Lipsky VA designed a second two- storeyed Art Nouveau building for the Russian Imperial garage at Tsaskoye Selo / Pushkin, Saint Petersburg it had a total area of 367.6 sq. M. It housed the garage-residence Adolphe K√©gresse. The building is noteworthy and identifiable for inclusion of a grand staircase with an external bas-relief image of one of the first car races held regularly in Tsarskoe Selo before the First World War. After World War I K√©gresse was forced to return to his home country, where he was from 1919 employed by the Citro√´n company during the 1920s and 1930s to design half-track vehicles, together with engineer Jacques Hinstin. After leaving the Citro√´n company he developed in 1935 the AutoServe gearbox- transmission system. In 1939 he pioneered the development of modern small guided tracked bombs.

They have a hump- backed appearance with a strikingly small head, generally with a long proboscis for accessing nectar. They are rare and not widely known. The most frequently applied common names are small-headed flies or hunch-back flies. Many are bee or wasp mimics. Because they are parasitoids of spiders, they also are sometimes known as spider flies. Description Johann Wilhelm Meigen's Europ√§ischen Zweifl√ºgeligen The Acroceridae vary in size from small to fairly large, about the size of large bees, with a wingspan over 25 mm in some species. As a rule, both sexes have tiny heads and a characteristic hump- backed appearance because of the large, rounded thorax. In appearance, they are compact flies without major bristles, but many species have a bee-like hairiness on their bodies, and some are bee or wasp mimics. In most species, the eyes are holoptic in both sexes, the heads seemingly composed mainly of the large faceted eyes. This is in contrast to many insects in which the males have larger (even holoptic) eyes, whereas the females have normal eyes. The squamae are disproportionately large, completely covering the halteres, and the abdomen has an inflated appearance, often practically globular. The tarsi are equipped with large claws with three pulvilli below them. Taxonomy The Acroceridae are a small family in the Brachycera. They are members of the infraorder Muscomorpha, and DNA studies suggest that they are most closely related to the families Nemestrinidae and Bombyliidae.Wiegmann, Brian M; Yeates, David K; Thorne, Jeffrey L; Kishino, Hirohisa. Time Flies, a New Molecular Time-Scale for Brachyceran Fly Evolution Without a Clock. Syst. Biol. 52(6):745‚Äì756, 2003. print / . Online A 2013 analysis of morphological data suggested the Acroceridae were a sister group to the Asiloidea and Eremoneura.Lambkin, Christine L., et al. \\"The phylogenetic relationships among infraorders and superfamilies of Diptera based on morphological evidence.\\" Systematic Entomology 38.1 (2013): 164-179. The roughly 520 species are placed in 50 genera. In 2019, a revised classification of the family based on phylogenetic studies was published, listing five extant subfamilies and one extinct subfamily containing Archocyrtus from the Late Jurassic Karabastau Formation of Kazakhstan. Obsolete synonyms for Acroceridae include Cyrtidae, Oncodidae, and Ogcodidae. Distribution and habitat Acroceridae are cosmopolitan in distribution, but nowhere abundant. They appear episodically and in most places are rarely observed; of more than 500 species described, most are known from fewer than 10 specimens. They occur most commonly in semiarid tropical locations. Eulonchus sapphirinus feeding on Clintonia uniflora Behaviour As far as is known, all Acroceridae are parasitoids of spiders. They are most commonly collected when a spider from the field is brought into captivity. As in the related families, Bombyliidae and Nemestrinidae, members of the family undergo hypermetamorphosis: the adults do not seek out their hosts; instead, the first-instar larva is a planidium. Females lay large number of eggs, up to 5,000, and after hatching, the planidia seek out spiders. They do not resemble the triungulin of most beetles with a hypermetamorphosis, but do resemble the triungulin of Stylops. The larva can move with a looping movement like a leech or inchworm, and can leap several millimetres into the air. When a spider contacts an acrocerid planidium, the planidium grabs hold, crawls up the spider's legs to its body, and forces its way through the body wall, usually at an articulation membrane. Often, it lodges near a book lung, where it may remain for years before completing its development. Mature larvae pupate outside the host.Psilodera species, showing the proboscis below the body, holoptic eyes, texture of wings, and bee mimicry The adults of most species, like various members of the Tabanidae, Nemestrinidae, and Bombyliidae, are nectar feeders with exceptionally long probosces, sometimes longer than the entire body length of the insect. Unlike the other families, however, when not deploying the proboscis for feeding, the Acroceridae carry it lengthwise medially beneath the body, instead of projecting forward. As a result, the proboscis might escape casual notice, though careful inspection may reveal it projecting slightly behind the abdomen. Flies are usually found in small numbers on plants in July and August in the Palearctic realm.

He was credited to be a big hitter of the cricket ball and an attacking batsman. In the early 90s there was a call in Indian cricketing circles for a batsman who could hit hard and therefore Bedade got his chance. However the pressure to hit sixes on him was too much and although he did show his ability in the same series against Pakistan in Sharjah (India lost that match), his hitting was few and far between in the other chances given to him and therefore he was soon dropped and never given a chance again. Later career Bedade has continued to remain involved with cricket in different capacities. In 2006, he was the only ex-India player among the thirty five former first-class cricketers who took the umpires' examination which was being promoted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for former cricketers. Seven years later, in 2013, Bedade scripted another 'first' by becoming the only ex-India player to pass the BCCI's Curators' Certification Course, and that too with flying colours.

In Trinidad and Tobago, multi-colored model mausoleums or Mosque shaped model tombs known as Tadjah are used to display the symbolic part of this commemoration. They are built and paraded, then ritually taken to the sea on last day of observance, and finally discarded into the water. The word 'Tadjah' derived from the Arabic word Ta'zieh and signifies different cultural meanings depending on the region, time period, occasion, and religion. In British Guiana, (now called Guyana), and Suriname, the festival was called Taziya or creolized into Tadjah in reference to these floats, argurably the most visible and decorative element of this festival. Generally, Hosay lasts for 10 days and is observed in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar and in line with ten days Ashura commemorated by Shia Muslims throughout the world. The last four days are the most popular as the first six days are days of fasting, prayer and building of the ‚ÄúTadjahs‚Äù and ‚ÄúMoons‚Äù. PDF link Although Hosay was traditionally commemorated for Husain, its celebration in recent times has adopted all types of shades and characters from Sunni Islam and other religions including Hindus and Christians making the modern event a mixture of different cultures and religions. The event is attended by both Muslims and non-Muslims, depicting an environment of mutual respect and tolerance. A unique design of Tadja can be found during the Hosay celebrations in Cedros, a coastal village situated in the South-Western end of Trindad, that are built in an exclusive style that is not found anywhere else in the world, in terms of the art and style of construction. In nineteenth-century Trinidad newspapers as well as government reports called Hosay the \\"Coolie Carnival.\\"Specifically, Trinidad Sentinel 6 August 1857. Also, Original Correspondence of the British Colonial Office in London (C.O. 884/4, Hamilton Report into the Carnival Riots, p.18 Origins The Hosay (derived from Husayn or Hussein) celebration is a Caribbean manifestation of the Shia Muslim Remembrance of Muharram in Trinidad and Tobago and JamaicaShankar, Guha (2003) Imagining India(ns): Cultural Performances and Diaspora Politics in Jamaica. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Texas, Austin pdf (where is it spelled Hussay). The name Hosay comes from \\"Husayn\\" who was assassinated by Yazid in Karbala. This martyrdom is commemorated in the festival. In Trinidad and Tobago it is primarily celebrated in Saint James, in northwestern Trinidad and in Cedros in southwestern Trinidad. Recently it has been revived elsewhere. In Jamaica it is celebrated throughout the island. In the past, every plantation in each parish celebrated Hosay. Today it has been called an Indian carnival and is perhaps most well known in Clarendon where it is celebrated each August. People of all religions attend the event. A historic Ashura celebration in Jamaica, which is known locally as Hussay or Hosay. In the 1850s, very elaborately decorated models of mosques made of paper and tinsel called \\"tadjahs\\" were carried through the streets to the accompaniment of constant drumming. Small fires were lit in the gutters beside the streets over which the drumskins were heated to tighten the skins of the tassa drums. Mock stick fights celebrate the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali. The festival lasts three days ending with the throwing of the tadjahs into the sea at sunset on the third day. Although Hosay is a religious event for Shias, all of Trinidad's religious and ethnic communities participate in it, and it has become accepted as part of the national culture. The Remembrance of Muharram was continued to the Caribbean by Muslim indentured labourers and other migrant laborers from India. Hindu and Muslim Indians, who emphasized their common culture and celebration over religion, namely from Indian Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bihar, Madras as well as the provinces of Oudh and City of Lucknow, are essential to this celebration. These people entered Guyana in 1838, and Trinidad after 1845, from colonial India under British auspices (see Indo-Caribbean people). The observance of Hosay in Trinidad is traced back to 1854. Suppression In the 1880s the British colonial authorities became increasingly concerned about public gatherings, and in 1884 issued an ordinance to prevent the public Hosay commemorations. Thousands of workers, who had spent the year building their tadjahs joined a Hindu named Sookhoo, in petitioning the government to allow the festival per their agreement with the Governor, who was visiting London during this episode. When all appeals were ignored by the Protector of Immigrants, through ignorance of the new July 1884 prohibition, defiance, or both, the tadjahs were taken onto the streets at the appointed time, and in order of the estates. The first estate that took its tadjah onto the street had earned that right over the past months, and in some towns, Hosay went ahead. In Port-of-Spain (St. James) the police did not interfere, but in Mon Repos, San Fernando, on Thursday, October 30, 1884, buckshot was fired into the crowds of women, children and men.. After shots were fired by the police to disperse the procession, 22 \\"Indians\\" were killed immediately. Later, 120 were found with injuries, some of whom had run into the cane fields, to hide during the police attack. That day is commonly referred to in Trinidad history as the Muhurram Massacre by Indians and as the Hosay Riots in British and colonial records.

The institute was founded in Spain in 1848 by Father Joaquim Masmitj√† i de Puig as a means of rebuilding society through the education of young women.A daughter house of the community was founded in Los Angeles, California, USA, in 1871, and in 1924 formally separated from the Spanish congregation and was established as a distinct institute. Founding Fr. Joaquin Masmitj√° Joaquin Masmitj√° was born in Olot, Spain, on December 29, 1808, the fourth child of Francisco and Maria Gracia. He entered the minor seminary for the Diocese of Gerona and then went on to get degrees in canon and civil law. Masmitj√°, who was greatly devoted to the Blessed Virgin under the titles of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sorrowful Mother, was ordained a priest on February 22, 1834. Assigned to his hometown parish, Fr. Masmitj√° became increasingly concerned over the poor education of young girls. He sought to rebuild society through their education in prayer and Christian doctrine. On July 1, 1848, Masmitj√° founded the Institute of the Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. During the Spanish Civil War IHM sisters Carmen (age 41), Rosa (36), and Magdalena (34) Fradera, who were also blood sisters, were executed by the militia. They are among the 498 Martyrs of 20th Century Spain beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007. United States California In 1869, Fr. Masmitja's friend Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi of Monterey, California, was visiting Spain, and asked for some of the Sisters to come to California. Two years later, with Father Masmitja's approval, Mother Raimunda led nine others to the new California mission. The Sisters established two houses, one in Gilroy and the other in San Juan. Very soon the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart were teaching in several schools in different parts of California. Their lifestyle attracted young women to follow the charisma of Fr. Masmitja, and the Sisters inaugurated a third house in San Luis Obispo (1876), a fourth house in San Bernardino (1880), and finally the last house during the lifetime of Fr. Masmitja was established in Los Angeles (1886). On January 11, 1886, the IHMs began teaching in the Cathedral School of Los Angeles, directly behind the Cathedral. For several years it served as an elementary school, but under the leadership of Sister Gabriel, IHM, an academy for girls was added, four years of high school. The IHMs taught at the Cathedral School until June 1969,\\"The Immaculate Heart History\\", Immaculate Heart Community and also ran orphanages. Immaculate Heart Convent and College, later high school Mother Raimunda served as the provincial of the California sisters until her death in 1900. By 1906 the sisters were able to build their own convent, the Motherhouse. Bishop Francis J. Conaty played an important role in the acquisition of the property and the building of this Motherhouse for the IHMs. In 1916 Immaculate Heart College was established in Los Angeles. Part of the original convent building was razed in 1975 due to fire and safety concerns. Mother Genevieve Parker was instrumental in securing the separation of the California IHMs from the Spanish community. With the help of Bishop John Joseph Cantwell of Los Angeles, the separation was completed in 1924 and Mother Genevieve was elected the first mother-general. Arizona In 1911, five sisters from Spain and two from California were sent to start a school in Mazatl√°n, Mexico. Six years later, in 1917, the sisters were forced to leave due to the Mexican Revolution. During a stop in their journey back to California, Bishop Henry Granjon of Tucson, Arizona, invited the sisters to stay and they accepted. From there they began building schools and accepting postulants. The sisters evangelized not just in the schools but, after regular classes, in many missions in small mining towns around Tucson. Due to growth over time, in 1946 the sisters in Arizona became the Province of Saint Joseph. In 1947 the novitiate moved to Sabino Canyon Road, at the foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains outside Tucson. The Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Tucson, also have a Korean Ministry which allows the Korean Catholic community to use space at St. Ann's Convent, for Liturgy and faith formation. The IHM sisters remain active in both Arizona and Florida.Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Arizona, Florida) In 2010 the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary from Miami, started a new mission in La Concordia, Diocese of Jinotega, Nicaragua, Central America. Immaculate Heart Community By the 1960s there were 600 professed Sisters in 68 elementary schools, 11 high schools, one college, and two hospitals. In the late 1960s a dispute arose between the institute and Archbishop James Francis McIntyre of Los Angeles. The IHM Sisters took part in a process of renewal led by the psychologist Dr. Carl Rogers, founder of the Center for the Study of the Person, an affiliate of the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute. Carl Rogers, and his associates Bruce Meador and Bill Coulson, conducted encounter groups according to the principles of the Human Potential Movement.The Century of the Self: There is a Policeman Inside All Our Heads; He Must Be Destroyed, Adam Curtis, 2002. In such encounter groups, under the direction of a facilitator, participants were encouraged to share their real feelings as they interacted with the other group participants. The first encounter group was held in the summer of 1966 at the Immaculate Heart Novitiate in Montecito, California. With its apparent success, the experiment was begun en masse in 1967, with all the sisters and the schools they ran in the Los Angeles Archdiocese participating. The encounter groups facilitated change in the IHM community. It was among the first groups of women religious to modernize their rule in accord with the directives of Vatican II. Changes included a more democratic form of governance and replacing their religious attire with civilian dress. Cardinal McIntyre refused to let the sisters teach in archdiocese schools unless they wore habits and adhered to a variety of traditional rules. The sisters, in turn, objected to the Archbishop dictating their attire, bedtimes, and hours of prayer. Then-superior Anita Caspary remained firm in implementing the reforms and on February 1, 1970, about 300 of the IHM Sisters followed Caspary and were subsequently dispensed from their vows and fired from the schools in the archdiocese.Caspary, Anita. Witness to Integrity:The Crisis of the Immaculate Heart Community of California, Liturgical Press, (2003) They went on to form a non-canonical group that admits both men and women known as the Immaculate Heart Community. The 68 sisters who decided to remain were allowed to keep the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary as their name. As of 2015 there are five sisters. An ensuing property settlement left remaining the IHM sisters with certain properties, while those dispensed obtained control of Immaculate Heart College and Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles. The headquarters of the Immaculate Heart Community are at 5515 Franklin Avenue near Western Avenue, in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles. Immaculate Heart Blythe Street serves the San Fernando Valley, located in Panorama City, Los Angeles. The Immaculate Heart Community has since 1943 run a Center for Spiritual Renewal and La Casa de Maria on 26 acres in Montecito, California.Immaculate Heart Center for Spiritual Renewal (Montecito, California). This was also the novitiate for many years.Immaculate Heart Community.org: History As of 2011 the Immaculate Heart Community numbered 160 members. Wichita After failed attempts to resolve differences among themselves regarding the living of their original charism and the essential elements of religious life, Mother Joanne, a former Treasurer of the Institute, Sister Eileen, and Sister Giovanni were directed by the Holy See to find another diocese that would welcome them and their works. They relocated to the Diocese of Wichita in Kansas. The IHM Sisters of Wichita work primarily in the ministries of education, youth ministry, retreat work, and catechesis. Controversy The Convent of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was located in the Los Feliz district of Los Angeles, sharing the former Earle C. Anthony estate with the Cardinal Timothy Manning House of Prayer for Priests. Designed by Bernard Maybeck in 1927, the mansion was remodeled and enlarged in the mid-1990s. Both facilities were closed by the Archdiocese in 2011, and the complex was used as a location for the TV series My Name Is Earl and 90210. Disputes of ownership between two of the five remaining Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Archdiocese gained media attention when Katy Perry attempted to purchase the estate in 2015, with plans to restore it to a private mansion.

The squadron was formed in 1939 and saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. From 1941 to 1943, it mainly conducted maritime patrols off northern Australia. The squadron was based at Merauke in western New Guinea from November 1943 to July 1944, when it was withdrawn from operations. After being re-equipped, it operated as a heavy bomber unit from February 1945 until the end of the war. The squadron continued in this role until it was redesignated No. 1 Squadron RAAF in February 1948. The squadron was reformed in 1973 to operate transport helicopters but was again disbanded in 1989. History World War II No. 12 Squadron was formed as a general purpose unit at RAAF Base Laverton on 6 February 1939 under the command of Squadron Leader Charles Eaton. The squadron was initially equipped with four Hawker Demon biplane fighters and four Avro Anson maritime reconnaissance aircraft and commenced intensive training in May. No. 12 Squadron began to move to Darwin in July 1939, with its advance party arriving there on the 24th of the month.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 33 The squadron was the first RAAF unit to be permanently based in the Northern Territory and was initially stationed at Darwin's civil aerodrome.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 33‚Äì34 Seven No. 12 Squadron Ansons were based in Darwin by late August, and these began flying reconnaissance patrols on the last day of the month.Eather (1995), p. 47RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 34 The Demons were replaced with CAC Wirraway general purpose aircraft at Laverton on 1 September, and all of the squadron's aircraft had arrived in Darwin by 17 September. The squadron's flying was reduced during September and October to make personnel available to improve the aerodrome's facilities, but by the end of October it had returned to normal operations. These included escorting shipping, maritime reconnaissance and coastal patrols. No. 12 Squadron Wirraways at Darwin in January 1941 The squadron experienced considerable changes in 1940 and 1941. During the early months of 1940, its activities were expanded to include gunnery and bombing training and a No. 9 Squadron Supermarine Seagull was attached to the unit to assist with air gunnery practice. On 1 June No. 12 Squadron was split to form RAAF Station Darwin and No. 13 Squadron. As part of this reorganisation the squadron's headquarters became the RAAF Station's headquarters, Eaton, who was by now a Wing Commander, was appointed the commander of the station and all of the Ansons were transferred to No. 13 Squadron; only No. 12 Squadron's 'C' Flight remained with the unit. The squadron continued to conduct anti- submarine and maritime patrols and began a program of exercises with Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army units based at Darwin from July 1940. No. 12 Squadron relocated to the new military airfield in Darwin in April 1941 and reached a strength of 18 Wirraways in May.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 35 The squadron increased its flying in the later months of 1941 as war with Japan became increasingly likely.Eather (1995), pp. 47‚Äì48 Following the outbreak of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941 (local time), No. 12 Squadron was dispersed between two air bases; the squadron's 'B' and 'C' flights were transferred to Batchelor Airfield while 'A' flight returned to the civil aerodrome.Eather (1995), p. 48 On 12 December, the unit had a strength of 18 Wirraways but was down to 14 aircraft by mid-February 1942.Gillison (1962), pp. 238, 425 Two of the aircraft based at Darwin were destroyed on the ground in the devastating first Japanese air raid on Darwin which took place on 19 February 1942. The squadron also lost a considerable portion of its stores when a new hangar was destroyed at the civil aerodrome in this raid. Following the attack, No. 12 Squadron's surviving aircraft dropped supplies to the survivors of sunken ships and conducted patrols of the area around Darwin. It was stationed at Pell Airfield from 15 July ‚Äì 16 September 1942 while Batchelor was being used by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) units. No. 12 Squadron aircrew in the bar of the aircrew mess at Merauke No. 12 Squadron began to be re-equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers from October 1942. The squadron was the first unit in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) to receive these aircraft and their arrival was popular with the squadron's personnel as it was believed that the Vengeances would allow them to play an active part in the war. This did not eventuate, however, and No. 12 Squadron continued its routine program of patrols after all the Vengeances had arrived. The only exception to this was a bombing raid conducted on 18 June 1943 by twelve of the squadron's Vengeances against villages on Selaru in the Tanimbar Islands which were believed to house workers employed by the Japanese to build a new airstrip.Odgers (1968), pp. 58‚Äì59 This was the first attack to be conducted by Vengeances in the SWPA.Odgers (1968), p. 58 In May 1943, No. 12 Squadron was ordered to move to Merauke in western New Guinea, where it would come under the command of No. 72 Wing. The squadron's 270-man strong advance party arrived in Merauke on 8 July but found that no facilities had been constructed for the unit. As a result, its aircraft were stationed at Cooktown, Queensland, where they were used for anti-submarine patrols and the escort of shipping.Odgers (1968), pp. 114‚Äì115 No. 12 Squadron gradually moved to Merauke between September and November 1943, and continued to be employed mainly in maritime patrols. The squadron's only contact with the Japanese during its period at Merauke took place on 9 October when a Vengeance unsuccessfully attacked a float plane.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 36Odgers (1968), p. 116 In July 1944, No. 12 Squadron moved to Strathpine, Queensland, where it was reduced to cadre status ahead of being converted to a heavy bomber unit. The squadron moved to Cecil Plains in December and began to be reequipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers on 5 February 1945. No. 12 Squadron began to move to Darwin in late March 1945 and became operational there in early May. It flew its first heavy bomber operation on 24 May and attacked three Japanese ships on 26 May, setting one of them on fire.Nelmes (1994), p. 120 The squadron continued to attack Japanese shipping and installations in the Timor Sea, Banda Sea and Arafura Sea areas in conjunction with No. 21 and No. 24 Squadrons until the end of the war. During this period the squadron initially suffered from a shortage of spare parts but this was rectified after the unit gained access to USAAF spares at Biak.Nelmes (1994), pp. 120‚Äì121 From July, No. 12 and No. 99 Squadrons formed part of No. 85 Wing.Nelmes (1994), p. 119 The squadron's last bombing raid was conducted against a barracks at Kendari on 10 August and it dropped leaflets over Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies later in August to inform civilians of the Japanese surrender. Following this its Liberators dropped food and medical supplies to Allied prisoners of war (POW) and later repatriated POWs to Australia.Nelmes (1994), p. 122 In February 1946 No. 12 Squadron became a transport unit, though it only continued in this role until March when it moved to RAAF Base Amberley and became a lodger unit of No. 3 Aircraft Depot. No. 12 Squadron suffered 27 fatalities during World War II. In June 1947, No. 12 Squadron's aircrew moved to RAAF Base East Sale to begin conversion training for Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. The squadron continued operating these aircraft until 22 February 1948 when it was redesignated No. 1 Squadron. Helicopter squadron Boston bomber in Papua New Guinea No. 12 Squadron was re-formed at Amberley on 3 September 1973 to fly the RAAF's twelve new CH-47C Chinook helicopters. The helicopters were shipped from the United States to Brisbane on board the aircraft carrier , and arrived in Australia in March 1974. The squadron made its first flight in the aircraft on 8 July 1974, and was declared operational with the type in December that year. The Chinooks were primarily used to support Australian Army units based in northern Australia, though they also occasionally conducted air-sea rescues, provided flood relief and performed a range of other tasks in support of the civil authorities.RAAF Historical Section (1995), pp. 36‚Äì37 Unusual tasks included placing lighthouses in isolated locations and air conditioning plants on the roofs of tall buildings and supporting police anti-narcotics operations. In late August 1980 one of No. 12 Squadron's Chinooks flew from Amberley to Malaysia to recover a crashed Royal Malaysian Air Force S-61 Nuri helicopter; this was the longest helicopter deployment undertaken by the RAAF to that time.Eather (1995), p. 49 Amberley. Due to the need to reduce defence expenditure, the Australian government decided to retire the Chinook helicopters in 1989. Following the retirement of the Chinooks on 30 June 1989, No. 12 Squadron was disbanded on 25 August 1989. While it was hoped that the Army's new S-70A Blackhawk helicopters could fulfill some of the Chinook's roles, this was not successful.Eather (1995), pp. 49, 151 As a result, four of the ex-RAAF CH-47Cs were upgraded to CH-47D standard and assigned to 'C' Squadron of the Army's 5th Aviation Regiment from 1995.Eather (1995), p. 151 See also *Vultee Vengeance in Australian service References Notes Bibliography  12 Category:Military units and formations established in 1939 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1989 ","title":"No. 12 Squadron RAAF"},{"id":"4284250","text":"Beylerbeyi S.K. is a Turkish football club in Istanbul.

Peter Oberlander, (November 29, 1922 - December 27, 2008) was a Canadian architect and Canada's first professor of Urban and Regional Planning. Early life and education Born in Vienna, Austria, he settled in Britain with his family after fleeing the Anschluss in 1938. In 1940, he was deported to Canada where he was held in a series of internment camps. Presumed to be a \\"dangerous enemy alien\\", he was finally released in 1942, and received a Bachelor of Architecture degree from McGill University in 1945. After McGill graduation in architecture, Oberlander was the first Canadian to obtain the Master of Urban Planning and subsequently a PhD in Urban and Regional Planning from Harvard University. Thus started a pioneer career in education and practice of community and regional planning. Teaching and research The impending post- war urban development boom impelled Oberlander to plead for the need to educate urban planners in Canada, with explicit federal government fellowship support, now a forty-year-old tradition. N.A.M. Mackenzie, then President of the University of British Columbia and member of the Massey Commission, was intrigued by this simple idea, and within six months invited Oberlander to come to Vancouver and launch at UBC Canada's first full professional program in Community and Regional Planning. Four decades of teaching and research followed, during which Oberlander became the founding Director of the UBC School of Community and Regional Planning, and subsequently founding Director of the Centre for Human Settlements, devoted to planning research. Government career In 1970, Oberlander was called to Ottawa to initiate the Federal Government's Ministry of State for Urban Affairs, and become its inaugural Secretary (Deputy Minister). During his three-year tenure he created a process of tri-level consultation on urban development between federal/provincial/municipal governments, leading to planned re-use of redundant federal lands for local community needs; Vancouver's Granville Island and Toronto's Harbourfront are two examples. United Nations work Upon returning to UBC, Oberlander assisted in convening the UN Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat) in Vancouver in 1976 and following the Conference, founded the Centre for Human Settlements at the University, charged with continuing the Conference's research agenda. Between 1980 and 1990 he served on the Canadian Delegations to the annual meetings of the UN Commission on Human Settlements, Nairobi, Kenya. Beginning in 2002, Oberlander was deeply involved in persuading the Canadian Government to invite the United Nations to convene the UN World Urban Forum (WUF3) in Vancouver June 2006 and thereby commemorate the first UN Conference on Human Settlements, 30 years‚Äô earlier. It led to a formal invitation by the Prime Minister and its acceptance by the United Nations. The World Urban Forum III attracted more than 10,000 participants and set a new standard for substantive participation and networking among public, private, and NGO groups, and citizens generally, in exchanging practical solutions to urgent environmental problems resulting from unprecedented rates of worldwide urbanization. WUF3 contributed substantively to the global recognition for the urgent need for achieving Sustainable Urbanization by ‚ÄúTurning Ideas into Action‚Äù through the UN with Canada's initiative. For WUF3 Oberlander prepared a substantive report on Canada/UN- HABITAT Initiatives 1976-2006 titled ‚ÄúTowards Sustainable Urbanization‚Äù. It provided the first documented record of Canada's leadership in the field of human settlements within the UN system. Following his lifelong commitment to the motto \\"Ideas into Action\\", Peter's final project was to establish The Habitat Exchange, an on-line portal and archive of international human settlement resources.UBC Habitat Exchange Oberlander was posthumously awarded with the United Nations Scroll of Honour Award on World Habitat Day, October 4, 2009, for his work and dedication to improving global urban living conditions. Other activities During the 1960s, Oberlander worked extensively with Thompson, Berwick and Pratt, an architectural and planning firm in Vancouver. During the 1990s Oberlander maintained his professional involvement as Associate Partner with Downs/Archambault and Partners (now DA Architects + Planners) in Vancouver. He was also Chairman of the Vancouver School Board in the 1960s, and contributed to many community projects in Vancouver, nationally and internationally. Oberlander was the UBC Professor Emeritus in Community and Regional Planning, pursuing an active research program at the UBC Centre for Human Settlements until his death. Concurrently, since 1995, he served as Adjunct Professor in Political Science at Simon Fraser University. Between 1998 and 2008, Oberlander served as a Federal Citizenship Court Judge. Personal life Oberlander was married to Order of Canada inductee and landscape architect Cornelia Hahn Oberlander.

Niedra's first collection of poems was published when he was only nineteen years old, and he was still in his teens when his stories based on history and folklore began to appear in the newspaper Baltijas Vƒìstnesis. Between 1890 and 1899 he studied theology at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu). Aesthetically blending realistic fantasy with idealism, his stories, criticism and plays often treated the formation of the Latvian intelligentsia and the situation of the peasantry with regard to the dominant Baltic Germans. Believing that society can only develop through evolution rather than revolution, Niedra was a fierce opponent of socialism and came to be seen as a reactionary in an increasingly revolutionary society. After collaborating with the German military authorities and their defeat, Niedra fled Latvia. Returning in 1924, he was tried for treason and banished. In exile, the pastor of a German congregation in East Prussia, Niedra took German citizenship and penned a lengthy work entitled Tautas nodevƒìja atmi≈Üas (The Memoirs of a Traitor to the Nation); the first edition of the first part was destroyed by the dictator KƒÅrlis Ulmanis after the 15 May 1934, coup d'√©tat, and his works were banned.

Located on Lincoln Highway (also part of U.S. Highway 30), it is known as one of the few Catholic schools in Illinois that has a self-imposed enrollment limit. History Providence Catholic High School began as St. Mary Academy for Girls, a commercial school in Joliet, Illinois run by the Sisters of Loretto. The school opened in 1880, though the original building was not opened until 1883. Eventually, academic classes were added. In 1918, the Archdiocese of Chicago invited the Sisters of Providence to take over the school. On October 22 of that year, the school's name was changed to Providence High School. In 1931, the academic classes were stopped as the Great Depression took its toll on the school. In 1932, the school reverted to a two-year commercial school. A four-year secretarial program opened in 1938. Though the academic courses were reinstated after the Depression, the school building was condemned as a fire hazard in 1959 and demolished. From 1959 through 1962, the school met at St. Mary Nativity Elementary School. When the old building was demolished, it is said that students sifted through the wreckage looking for bricks that were not crushed. They wrapped the bricks and sold them as souvenirs to help build the new Providence.https://www.providencecatholic.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/history.html In 1962, the modern Providence High School was opened. The most obvious change was location: the school had left Joliet and was now located a few miles to the east in New Lenox. The other major change was the shift to a coed school. Though Providence was a relatively new school, the community of New Lenox was not heavily populated then. Enrollment dropped, and the school began suffering financially. Father Roger Kaffer (later Bishop Kaffer) was named the new principal and arrived in 1970. He began a campaign to improve the academic standing of the school and the transportation options for students traveling great distances. It was his practice to visit every family that had a child enrolled in the school. The 1971 enrollment was 490; by 1975, it had reached 785. Growth during the late 1970s and early 1980s made additions to the school building necessary.https://www.providencecatholic.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/09/history.html The Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, the Midwest U.S. province of the Order of Saint Augustine, was invited by the diocese to take control of the school after the 1984‚Äì85 school year. A college preparatory curriculum was added, as was a refocus on the spiritual mission of the school. The religious studies course work was upgraded, and a retreat program was begun. The name of the school was changed to \\"Providence Catholic High School\\" in 1985 to reflect these changes. In 1998, the school decided to limit enrollment in order to retain a more personal atmosphere with students. The school has added 55,000 square feet to the original building with the addition of a science and fine arts wing in 2002 and a Student Commons Addition in 2018. Today the school sits on 75 acres with three campuses. In 2018 the school celebrated its 100th Anniversary as Providence Catholic High School.

The invention of smokeless powder in the late 19th century immediately rendered all of the large-bore black powder rifles then in use obsolete. To keep pace with the French (who had adopted smokeless powder \\"small bore\\" ammunition for their Lebel Model 1886 rifle) the Germans adopted the Gewehr 88 using its own new M/88 cartridge, which was also designed by the German Rifle Commission.8√ó57mm IS cartridge portrait ‚Äì Totgesagte leben l√§nger, Wild und Hund 11/2006 The rifle was one of many weapons in the arms race between the Germanic states and France, and with Europe in general. There were also two carbine versions, the Karabiner 88 for mounted troops and the Gewehr 91 for artillery. Later models provided for loading with stripper clips (Gewehr 88/05s and Gewehr 88/14s) and went on to serve in World War I to a limited degree. Unlike many German service rifles before and after, it was not developed by Mauser but the arms commission, and Mauser was one of the few major arms manufacturers in Germany that did not produce Gewehr 88s. Design In 1886, fifteen years after their defeat by German forces in the Franco-Prussian War, the French Army introduced the new Lebel magazine rifle firing an 8 mm high-velocity projectile propelled by the new smokeless powder. This made Germany's rifle, the Mauser Model 1871, obsolete due to its large and slow 11 mm round propelled by black powder. The practical result was that the French rifle had greater accuracy and range, giving French troops a tactical advantage over the German Army. In response the German Army's Rifle Testing Commission developed the Gewehr 88 which was adopted for service in 1888. For this reason the Gewehr 88 is also known as the \\"commission rifle,\\" or \\"reichsgewehr\\". Cartridge 1888 pattern M/88 (left) alongside the 1905 pattern 7.92√ó57mm Mauser S Patrone The first step was to select a new cartridge. This began by adapting a Swiss design, resulting in the Patrone 88 or M/88 of 1888, an 8 mm rimless \\"necked\\" cartridge (bullet diameter 8.08mm / .318 in) loaded with an 8.08 mm (.318 in) 14.6 g (226 gr) round-nose bullet propelled by a single-base smokeless powder. In 1905, the 8 mm M/88 cartridge was replaced by the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser S Patrone (ball cartridge) which was loaded with a new 8.20 mm (.323 in) 9.9 g (154 gr) spitzer bullet and more powerful double-base smokeless powder resulting in nearly 40% higher muzzle velocity and 30% more muzzle energy. Receiver and magazine Five-round clip with 1888 pattern M/88 ammunition The Gewehr 1888 is a further development of the receiver and bolt of the Gewehr 1871 combined with a Mannlicher magazine. It has a receiver with a \\"split bridge\\" (i.e., the bolt passes through the receiver and locks in front of the rear bridge); a rotating bolt head; and the characteristic Mannlicher- style \\"packet loading\\" or \\"en-bloc\\" system in which cartridges are loaded into a steel carrier (a charger clip) which is inserted into the magazine, where it holds the cartridges in alignment over a spring. As shots are fired the clip remains in place until the last round is chambered, at which point it drops through a hole in the bottom of the rifle. This system was used in almost all Mannlicher designs and derivatives, and while it allows for speedy reloading, it also creates an entry point for dirt. To settle a patent infringement claim by Steyr-Mannlicher, Germany contracted the Austro-Hungarian company to be one of the manufacturers of Gewehr 88s. Bolt and barrel The commission rifle's bolt action design was a commission modified Mauser action. The barrel design and rifling were virtually copied from the French Lebel. The rifle has an odd appearance as the entire barrel is encased in a sheet metal tube for protection, but with the tube removed the rifle looks rather modern. This tube was intended to increase accuracy by preventing the barrel from directly contacting the stock, but in practice it increased the risk of rusting by providing a space for water to be trapped if the rifle was exposed to harsh conditions. The Karabiner 88 utilized a different bolt handle, which resembled those found on commercial sporting rifles. Service history Some early models had flaws due to rushed ammunition production. This was used in 1892 by the then notorious anti-Semitic agitator Hermann Ahlwardt, member of the German Reichstag, to spread an anti-semitic conspiracy theory. Many of the Gewehr 88-rifles were produced by the armament manufacturer Loewe & Company, whose chairman was Jewish entrepreneur Isidor Loewe. Isidor Loewe also held a controlling interest in the Waffenfabrik Mauser. According to Ahlwardt's claims, Loewe would either deliberately supply the German army with insufficient rifles, or, along with other Jews, secretly exchange rifles with flawed ones after they had passed the reliability tests. Ahlwardt accused Loewe of being a spy for France, and denounced the rifle as a Judenflinte (\\"Jews' musket\\"). After these claims were found insupportable, Ahlwardt was sentenced to 4 months in prison for malicious falsehood.http://www.zeit.de/2004/03/Seite_3_2fDetje Part of the production run was exported to China (see lower) or Latin America (for example Brazil army use them in War of Canudos in 1896‚Äì1897). The commission rifle saw field service with Germany's colonial expansion, including in China during the Boxer Rebellion (with the Gewehr 88s and the unlicensed Hanyang 88 copies also being used by the opposing Chinese troops), and served as a front line weapon for German troops during World War I until 1915 when the supply of Gewehr 98s increased. When Germany replaced the 88 with the Gewehr 98, many of the rifles were given to Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire during World War I because both states had a shortage of rifles (however, it was used extensively by the Turkish Army even through the 1930s and 1940s). Many Gewehr 88 rifles stayed in active service in second-line units, reserves, and in armies allied with the Germans through and well past World War I. Most of the Gewehr 88s seen in the US are the ones that were given to the Turkish forces in World War I and have been modified from the original design. [no citation] The Turks issued these and updated versions at least as late as the 1930s. Gewehr 88/05 rifles were also used by Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, (for example as modified guard shotgun) or Poland. Gewehr 88 rifles have been used widely during post World War I revolutions, uprisings and wars (usually on both sides of the Russian Civil War, the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19, the Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918‚Äì20), the Greater Poland Uprising (1918‚Äì19), the Silesian Uprisings, the Turkish War of Independence, the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, by the Ulster Volunteers and by Lithuanians in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence). About 5,500 Gewehr and Karabiner 88s were delivered to the Lithuanian Army in 1919‚Äì1920 (granted by Germany and sold by France and the UK). Used by the paramilitary Rifle Union, the rest were kept in the storage and were re-barreled before World War II. Inter-war Germany used Gewehr 88 rifles only for the militia. Gewehr 88 rifles were also used in the Spanish Civil War by both sides. At the beginning of World War II some Gewehr 88 rifles were still in use, by second line units or paramilitary organizations (or partisans) in Poland and Yugoslavia. Part of the ex-UVF rifles are used by Home Guard in United Kingdom in 1940. Ethiopean rifles (some ex-UVF rifles also found their way there) also saw action during the East African Campaign. These rifles were also used by the German Volkssturm in 1944‚Äì1945. Gewehr 1888 and its copy Hanyang 88 were the main rifles in China for over 50 years. China also used this rifle extensively during the Qing dynasty and the Republican era. China first bought Gewehr 88 rifles for the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894‚Äì1895 and after that started production of the unlicensed Hanyang 88 copy. In the beginning of the 20th century China bought for a second time a large number of original Gewehr 88 rifles. In following nearly 50 years it and its Hanyang 88 copy were used in the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese Civil War and the War of Resistance against Japan and proved more than adequate against the Japanese Arisaka Type 38 rifle, though the latter was newer by 30 years. The last time they saw action in Chinese service was during the Korean War, where some of them were captured and taken to the US as souvenirs. The rifle was adopted during a period of rapid development in firearms technology, and marked Germany's shift to a smokeless powder. This explains why its period as the primary German service rifle was just over a dozen years, but it remained in limited service for much longer. In 1898 a Mauser design was adopted, the Gewehr 98, which was the culmination of a series of Mauser models in the 1890s. It was a superior replacement using the same ammunition with a stronger powder charge. However, this rifle soon had to be converted to fire the new pointed round that Germany adapted after the turn of the century. With these modifications the newer design remained in use until the end of World War II. The Gewehr 88 was also sometimes made into very elegant sporting rifles by gunsmiths in Germany. Examples of these usually show first-class workmanship and special features such as folding sights and altered bolt handles. Some Karabiner 88 carbines are known to have been produced in 7√ó57mm Mauser instead of the usual M/88 or the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser chambering. These were likely intended for sale in South America, where use of the 7√ó57mm cartridge was widespread. All known 7√ó57mm Karabiner 88s were produced by Haenel. Variants At the time of adoption, the M/88 \\"Patrone 7.9 mm\\" was loaded with a 14.6 g (226 gr) round nose bullet that measured 8.08 mm (.318 in) in diameter. In 1894/95 the German Army changed the barrel specifications from 7.9/8.1 mm to 7.9/8.2 mm hoping to improve accuracy and Gewehr 88 rifles made from that date on had different bores. The 8.08 mm (.318 in) bullet diameter however remained unchanged. After 1895 most Gewehr 1888 rifles were regrooved. In 1903, the Germany Army adopted a new service cartridge that fired lighter bullets measuring 8.20 mm (.323 in) in diameter. From then on, many Gewehr 88 rifles were rechambered to fire the new 1903 pattern 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge becoming Gewehr 88 S rifles. This rechambering required more work as the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser chambering required a wider chamber throat to take the thicker brass of the new 1903 pattern cartridge. 7.92√ó57mm Mauser adapted rifles have the receiver marked with a large \\"S\\" rollmark. From 1905 the rifles were also converted to use the Gewehr 98 type stripper clip by adding stripper clip guides to the top rear of the receiver and altering the magazine becoming Gewehr 88/05 rifles. After the start of World War 1, some of the remaining Gewehr 88 S rifles were modified to the Gewehr 88/14 standard, which was generally similar to Gewehr 88/05 but with cruder workmanship. Some 88's were sold to various nations or armed groups, or captured in combat and therefore a wide variety of markings can be found such as Bulgarian stars, English proofs, Turkish crescents and symbols, Polish eagles etc. Gew 88's were re-serialized by the army capturing them in some rare cases(i.e.; Greece/Turks) or/and when they were re-barrelled. The markings found on Gew 88's are very extensive and therefore are a topic of their own. Modern ammunition use The maximum operating pressure for the Gewehr 88 commission rifle is less than that of any 8 mm Mauser rifle, as the makers of the Gewehr 88 did not fully understand the greater energy of smokeless powder compared to black powder. Shooters planning to use modern 8 mm ammunition in a Gewehr 88 slug their bore and chamber as there are four different possible bores and grooves and chamber dimensioning combinations found on the Gewehr 88 rifle. High performance and hence high pressure or military ammunition designated for machine gun use cannot be fired safely in a Gewehr 88 commission rifle. Defects Although the packet loading system proved to be a design shortcoming, it is not uncommon to encounter a Gewehr 88 today which still retains it. Some of them were modified to use the stripper clips used with the Gewehr 98 by milling a slot into the left side of the action and adding stripper clip guides on the top of the receiver. Through this slot projects a bar which retains the cartridges in place against the magazine spring's pressure. The hole in the bottom of the rifle is often covered with a small piece of sheet metal. Unlike many rifles designed later, the bolt head of this rifle is able to be removed from the bolt body. This piece could be removed during disassembly, and was frequently lost. Additionally, both the ejector and the extractor that are attached to the bolt head are prone to falling out if care is not taken during disassembly and reassembly.

The park serves as a social hub for the neighbourhood. History The park was named after the Choi Sai Woo Reservoir, which was formerly located in the park. According to the commemorative plaque in the park, the reservoir was built by Taikoo Sugar Company Limited in 1894; it was the largest and the last of the five private reservoirs built by the company. During the drought and bubonic plague outbreak that started in 1894, the reservoir once supplied water to Tai Ping Shan District. It was filled in by Li Ka Shing to create the current park site. In World War II it was the scene of bitter fighting as the Japanese advanced towards Wong Nai Chung Gap to split the defence of Hong Kong into two. The park was built at a cost of $9.5 million and opened by the Urban Council in August 1986. It was designed to retain most of the existing mature trees and shrubs on site. An opening ceremony, officiated by Urban Councillor Kim Cham and the Director of Urban Services, was held on 16 January 1987.

The institution is accredited through the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) and its students are eligible for federal student aid programs. Messenger College offers Bachelor of Arts and Associate of Arts degrees. Distance learning is offered through Messenger College On-Line. History Joplin Era In September 1987, Messenger College was created by the merging of two collegiate institutions. In November 1983, the Pentecostal Church of God, the sponsoring organization of the two denominational colleges in the United States, elected to merge those institutions into one college in Joplin, Missouri, the host city of its international headquarters. Southern Bible College in Houston, Texas and Evangelical Christian College in Fresno, California were closed and the resources moved to Joplin, Missouri to create Messenger College. Messenger College was opened in newly constructed facilities on of wooded property across from the international offices of the church denomination. It is the Pentecostal Church of God's national collegiate institution, serving as the organization's educational arm for its ministers, missionaries, teachers, and other professionals to serve its constituency and others in the United States and abroad. During the 2011 tornado that devastated the city of Joplin, Messenger College and The Pentecostal Church of God opened its doors to the people of Joplin for emergency relief, housing, and some day care services. Dallas-Fort Worth Era In 2012, Messenger College relocated its campus to Euless, Texas, in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. In 2018, Messenger College relocated again to Bedford, Texas still in the Dallas- Fort Worth Metroplex, united once again with the campus of the Pentecostal Church of God's International Missions Center. Academics Major Programs Messenger College offers two major programs, Christian Ministry and Christian Counseling. In Christian Ministry there are seven different concentrations that can be applied to the degree: Student Ministry, Worship Ministry, Inter- Cultural Ministry, Pastoral Ministry, Biblical Studies, Discipleship Ministry, and Administration and Leadership. These concentrations allow for a deeper connection to the specific area of ministry a student is hoping to work in. The Christian Ministry major program can be followed through a one-year certification, a two-year associates, or a four-year bachelor's degree. The Christian Counseling program can only be followed through a four-year bachelor's degree.

It was stated as being owned by the Mountford family and being located within Kingshurst Park. The wood received its current name in the 19th century and by the 1920s, it was under the ownership of the Scout movement. In the 1970s, the fields surrounding the wood were sold to make way for housing development. The wood was preserved in the 1960s when the Kingshurst Hall Estate was completed so that it could act as a buffer between the estate and other nearby estates.The Town Planning Review, page 30, volume 26 (April 1955-January 1956), University of Liverpool Department of Civic Design Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council bought the wood in 1984 and designated it as a Local Nature Reserve in 1991. Nature During May, the floor of the wood is covered in bluebells and towards the closing of the year, fungi can be seen. During spring, wood anemone, and celandine are located in different parts of the forest. The wood is home to various species of birds, such as spotted woodpeckers and sparrowhawks, which breed throughout the year there. The most common species of trees found growing within the wood are birch and oak. Ash and willow trees are found within the wood along with invasive species such as sycamore. As sycamore trees do not support as much wildlife as the native tree species, its presence is controlled.

It was published in Germany in 2000 and translated into English by Oliver Latsch in 2002 for The Chicken House, a division of Scholastic publishing company. It was also adapted into a film in 2006. Plot summary The Thief Lord follows the story of two brothers, Prosper and Boniface (Bo), who run away to Venice, Italy. They are taken in by a group of street children who live in an abandoned movie theater, the Stella, and are led by a proud orphan named Scipio. He appears to steal valuables and the orphan group sells them to a sly shopkeeper, Ernesto Barbarossa. A customer of Barbarossa, calling himself the Conte, asks the \\"Thief Lord\\" to steal a wooden lion's wing for him. The runaway boys' aunt and uncle figure out where they are and set a detective, Victor Getz, on their trail. Victor recognizes the boys on the street and manages to initiate a conversation with innocent little Bo. Bo accidentally lets slip that he lives in an old movie theater. When the rest of the children see Victor, they cause a distraction and run away, taking his wallet with them. In his search for the theater, Victor visits the home of Dottor Massimo, the owner of the Stella, where he sees Scipio, who is actually the son of the rich Dottore. When Victor arrives at the Stella, the optic clan ambushes him. When Prosper confronts Scipio, he learns that Scipio is indeed Dottor Massimo's son. While they are gone, Victor escapes, leaving a note that he will not reveal their location if they do not steal the precious lion's wing. The children leave that night to steal it from a woman called Ida Spavento. Arrived in her house, the children meet Scipio, who wants to steal the wing as well. In the following argument, Ida is awakened by the racket that the children make and confronts them with an old rifle. When they explain, Ida tells them the story of the wing, which came from a magical merry-go-round. It has the ability to change a person's age. She agrees to let them have the wing if they let her accompany them to the exchange. The next night, all of the children go for the deal except Hornet and Bo. They join Ida and Scipio, meet with the Conte and his sister, Morosina, and make the exchange. They follow the Conte through a maze of islands to one in particular called Isola Segretta. They watch the pair unload the wing and go inside. Suddenly Ida drops the binoculars she was using into the lagoon. The sound travels to the island. Morosina rushes out with a shotgun and two huge dogs firing away randomly into the night. The group speeds off and regroups at the pier. When they return to the theater, Hornet and Bo are gone, leaving a note that there were police at the door. They angrily confront Victor, who informs them that he did not direct the police's attention there. To add to the misery he tells them that the lire they received are fake. While searching for Hornet and Bo, they find Hornet at an orphanage and manage to get her out. However, they did not find Bo at the orphanage. They spend a restless night at Ida's house, but Prosper cannot sleep and wanders outside, where he meets Scipio. He says that they are going to get the money that is rightfully theirs. They travel back to the island and get caught in the act of climbing a wall by the Conte's sister. The two end up locked up in a stinking stable on the island. Meanwhile, Victor receives a phone call from Esther, informing him that she had Bo, but that he had misbehaved and run away from them. Victor finds Bo at the Stella and takes him back to Ida's, where they find Prosper missing. On the island the next morning, Scipio and Prosper meet the Conte and Morosina, who are both young children. They tell him that the magical merry go-round worked. Scipio demands a ride and comes off an adult. Just as he gets off the merry-go-round, Barbarossa, the man who found the Conte and hired the Thief Lord for the job of stealing the wing, arrives. However, while Barbarossa becomes a seven-year- old boy, he accidentally breaks the merry-go-round. Scipio and Prosper leave after promising the Conte that they will not talk about the merry-go-round, and Barbarossa will be forced to give the Conte all the money in his shop safe. The next day, when everyone at Ida's home finds Prosper, Scipio, and Barbarossa. They do not recognize Scipio or Barbarossa and Prosper cannot explain. Scipio sets up a meeting between Barbarossa and Esther. Esther adores Barbarossa and his manners and decides to adopt him. Prosper, Bo, and Hornet decide to live with Ida and go to school, while Mosca and Riccio live in an abandoned warehouse. Scipio decides to work for Victor. Eventually, he and Prosper take another trip to the Isola Segreta only to find that the Conte and Morosina have disappeared. Esther eventually catches Barbarossa stealing her jewelry and other possessions and sends him off to boarding school, where he becomes a menacing bully; he forces other children to do things for him like his homework, encourages them to steal, and intimidates them to call him \\"The Thief Lord\\". Scipio, when he becomes an adult, he works as Victor's assistant in his detective agency and he was freed from his father's envy and cruelty. Characters Scipio Massimo: (pronounced ship-ee-ohAccording to the pronunciation in the audiobook. Read by Simon JonesIn Italian, sc + i creates a \\"sh\\" sound; see http://www.impariamo.com/forum/viewtopic.php?printertopic=1&t;=2876) The Thief Lord. Bo alone is allowed to call him 'Scip' (although on one occasion Prosper is allowed to). He is thirteen, has dark brown eyes and raven black hair. He also wears a mask that he found. He is the former son of Dottor Massimo (what the other children first don't know). Scipio is clever and quick-witted, but he is hated and abused by his father and being talked to as if he were \\"too stupid to put his own pants on.\\" This feeling is so strong that it causes him to ride the magical merry-go-round and become older. Scipio, while having no care for his father, has a kind heart, especially for poor children such as Prosper, Bo, Riccio, Mosca and Hornet. He also seems to have a soft spot for cats. After becoming an adult, he abandons his father and becomes Victor's assistant and new adoptive son in his detective office and changes his name to Scipio Fortunato (\\"the fortunate one.\\"). Prosper Hartlieb: A 12-year-old orphan and brother of Boniface (Bo). He is very caring to all his friends and especially to his younger brother. Prosper has dark hair. He is described to always have a very serious look on his face. He tends to worry excessively, but is very mature. Prosper is sensitive and does not like stealing; he especially forbids Bo to steal in case Esther uses Bo's behavior against him. Since his mother's death, he has taken care of his brother by himself until taken in by Scipio. He is also referred by his nickname \\"Prop\\" throughout the book. Boniface Hartlieb: Also known as Bo, Boniface is 5 year old orphan who ran away to Venice along with his brother, Prosper. He is described having \\"blond hair and an angelic face.\\" He admires Scipio and wants to grow up just like him, much to his brother's dismay. Caterina 'Hornet' Grimani: The only girl in the Stella cinema. Hornet used to live with Riccio and Mosca in the basement of an abandoned house. Scipio found them and took them to the Stella. She is described to be \\"slender, with a brown plait braided down to her hips\\". Her plait resembles a hornet's stinger, which is where she got her nickname, 'Hornet'. Hornet is an avid reader, and on occasion reads to the rest of the orphans. She is the only one of the children who is not afraid to stand up to Scipio. Hornet still has got parents, but she doesn't want to live with them. Riccio: (Pronounced Ree-choh) A scrawny boy and smaller than Prosper (but claims not to be much younger). He has brown hair that sticks out everywhere, earning him his nickname, Hedgehog. He has missing teeth, which he lost in a chase. His bed is stuffed with stuffed animals and comics. He grew up in an orphanage, never knowing his parents. Scipio found Riccio when Riccio attempted to steal something off of him. Mosca: A tall, muscular boy of African descent. Riccio says that his skin is so dark that \\"he could creep through the shadows\\". He loves the water and made his own boat. Mosca loves tinkering with his radio. Although he does not speak of his past, he is said to have a horrible family that he dislikes. Victor Getz: A detective looking for Bo and Prosper hired by Esther and Max Hartlieb. He likes collecting disguises, especially false beards, and has lived in Italy for 15 years. He speaks both English (his mother tongue) and Italian. He chases after Prosper and Riccio on their way back from Barbarossa's. He is kidnapped by the children, and later escapes, but gives his word he will not tell where they are. Esther referred to him after going to the police who were no help. He soon befriends the children and lies to Esther, saying the boys left Venice. Victor has two pet tortoises named Lando and Paula. Ida Spavento: A nice lady who looks after the kids for a while and, at the end of the book, takes in Prosper, Bo, and Hornet. She is an orphan and grew up in an orphanage. She found the Conte's wing during her early life at the orphanage and kept it until she gave it to Scipio's gang to sell to the Conte. She also has a bad smoking habit, but she is trying to quit. Esther Hartlieb: Prosper and Bo's rich aunt. She only wants to keep Bo because he looks like an angel. She is very biased toward Prosper and wanted him to go to a boarding school (where he could hardly see Bo). She hires Victor to find the two boys and ends up adopting Barbarossa (as a child after he had taken a ride on the magical merry-go-round). Later, she finds out Barbarossa has been stealing her valuable items that had gone missing long ago that disappeared into his room. She sends him away to a boarding school where he is feared by the other children. Max Hartlieb: Prosper and Bo's rich uncle. Along with Esther, Max thinks Bo is an angel because he looks like one. He does not like children. He is described as \\"a giant\\" and has small, dull eyes and a nose peeling from sunburn when he hired Victor. Ernesto Barbarossa: Sometimes referred as \\"the Redbeard\\" or \\"Baby Barbarino\\" (after he was turned unto a child). An extremely cheap antique dealer who does not ask many questions and loves to cheat people. He ends up riding and breaking the merry-go-round and gets stuck at an age a little younger than Bo. At the end of the book, Barbarossa is adopted by Esther (he wants to live with her because she is rich). However, Esther finds him stuffing her earrings into his pockets and then discovered in his room a collection of valuable items that had disappeared. He was sent to a boarding school where he becomes a bully; he made the other children do his bidding, including his homework and even steal. He also forced everyone to address him as \\"the Thief Lord.\\" Conte: The old man that Scipio, Mosca, and Prosper met in a confessional while planning to steal something for him. He is the Thief Lord's first client asking for something to be stolen and says that he will give him a large amount of money ( five million lire). The money exchanged for the stolen wooden wing turns out to be fake (because he cannot afford real money). He uses the wing to fix the merry-go-around, and becomes a child. He and his sister offer Scipio a ride in exchange for the stolen wooden wing (instead of money they do not have). The Conte's real name is \\"Renzo\\". Contessa: The Conte's younger sister. Her real name is Morosina. She was the one who found Prosper and Scipio wandering around in the Isola Segreta and held them captive for the night. She did not want Scipio and Prosper to ride on the magical merry-go-round. Dottor Massimo: Dottor Massimo is Scipio's disowned father. He owns a mansion that he and Scipio live in and several movie theaters in Venice, including the Stella. Scipio doesn't have a very good relationship with his dad and thinks he is a very serious and selfish person. References :2. Funke, Cornelia Caroline., and Oliver Latsch. The Thief Lord.

The current hill, about above sea level and about above the Neman, is a remnant of the larger hill that was destroyed by erosion. The hill was known as sacred among locals and played a role in the ceremonies of pagan Lithuanians. It is featured in many local legends and is protected by the state as a mythological object. A large stone at the top of the hill, known as the altar stone, was destroyed by a miller in 1811. Rambynas became popular with Prussian Lithuanians at the end of the 19th century who organized various events, most notably celebrations of the Saint Jonas' Festivals or Rasos (summer solstice), on the hill. They rebuilt the altar in 1928. The hill is popular with Lithuanian neo-pagans and hosts the annual celebrations of the summer solstice on 23 June. Geography Location map of Rambynas (pink line denotes the Lithuania‚ÄìRussia border) The hill is located between the villages of Bitƒónai and Bardinai on the right bank of the Neman River. The nearest towns are Pagƒógiai and Vilky≈°kiai. The river serves as the border between Lithuania and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia. Rambynas is located about north of Neman (previously Ragnit, Ragainƒó) and east of Sovetsk (previously Tilsit, Til≈æƒó). Geographically, it is part of the long moraine ridge known as Vilky≈°kiai ridge formed during the last glacial period. A large landslide in length and in width occurred on 12 September 1835. Smaller landslides occurred on 21 July 1878 (about in length) and in summer 1926. Today, only its northern slope survives. The remaining hill measures in length and up to in width. It rises about above sea level and about above the Neman. History Early history The hill and the surrounding area was long inhabited as evidenced by two socketed axes from the Bronze Age (1100‚Äì850 BC) found on Rambynas. Historians believe that the hill was the location of Ramigƒó, a fort of the Skalvians, one of the Baltic tribes. In 1275, the fort was attacked and destroyed by the Teutonic Order. The vogt of Sambia first attacked Ragnit (Neman), then crossed the river, and captured Ramigƒó. That signified Teutonic conquest of Skalvia. However, an exploratory excavation of about area in 2002 by found no significant cultural layer. The name Rambynas (as Rambyn) was mentioned in 1385 and 1394 in the Die Littauischen Wegeberichte, a report of military routes into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania prepared by the Teutonic Order. The report also mentioned a sacred forest to the east of the hill. The 1422 Treaty of Melno established the border between Teutonic Order and Lithuania. The hill remained on the Teutonic side, later part of Prussia inhabited by a large Lithuanian-speaking minority (Prussian Lithuanians). While the region officially converted to Christianity, old pagan beliefs persisted. In 1595, cartographer Caspar Hennenberger published an explanation to his map of Prussia. He mentioned that Rambynas was considered a sacred place and that women had to be clean and well dressed if they wanted to climb the hill or they would become ill. wrote in 1769 that locals performed pagan rituals on the hill despite prohibitions from the Christian priests. In 1867, , a journalist from Berlin, visited Rambynas and wrote that newlyweds would climb the hill and would leave small sacrifices. The most extensive description of the hill and its legends was provided by , a Lithuanian- language teacher in Tilsit. In 1838, he published Scenes from Lithuanian People's Lives (Szenen aus dem Volksleben der Litauer). He also described a 600-year-old three-trunk linden tree that grew near the hill and was worshiped as goddess of fate Laima's tree. Resurgence Altar built in 1928 Gisevius' stories popularized Rambynas among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1881 or 1884, Vid≈´nas began organizing Saint Jonas' Festival (also known as Rasos) on the hill. However, it was a private property and thus it was difficult to host larger and more frequent events. Therefore, Birutƒó Society purchased a plot of land in 1896 and the same year organized a larger festival on the hill. However, Birutƒó lacked financial strength to pay the purchase price and the plot was transferred to . Two other plots were owned by the Garden Beautification Society in Tilsit and by the . In 1910, Prussian Lithuanians established a society that collected money to buy the entire hill and charged 10 pfennigs for the admission to the hill. There were plans to build a monument to poet Kristijonas Donelaitis on Rambynas, but they were not realized due to World War I. After the Klaipƒóda Revolt in 1923, Klaipƒóda Region (including Rambynas) became part of Lithuania. The hill became a frequently visited location and developed into a kind of resort. The nearby village of Bitƒónai had three restaurants. Celebrations of the Saint Jonas' Festivals became grand affairs attended by many dignitaries. For example, in 1929, the celebrations were attended by a delegation from the League of Nations; its head even swore an improvised oath in the name of pagan thunder god Perk≈´nas. In 1928, Martynas Jankus built an altar and started keeping a guestbook, which is known as the Eternal Book of Rambynas. After World War II, authorities of the Lithuanian SSR allowed to resume the celebration of the Saint Jonas' Festivals in 1957. They even built a cement stage for events (it was demolished in 2010). German writer Johannes Bobrowski described old time celebrations on Rambynas in his 1966 novel Litauische Claviere. Protected area The first preserves in Lithuania were established in September 1960. Among the 89 preserves established on that date, there was a landscape preserve of Rambynas covering . In September 1992, Lithuania established 30 regional parks, including the Rambynas Regional Park with initial area of . The landscape preserve was reduced to and became an integral part of the park. However, the directory of the park was established only in 2001. The same year, Rambynas (area of ) was added to the cultural object registry as a mythological object. The new directory with funding from Phare strengthened the eroded slopes, installed paths and staircases for visitors, conducted environmental and archaeological research. In 2007‚Äì2013, the park built further paths, viewing platforms, information stands, etc. A barn of a pre-war restaurant, owned by Gustavas Volbergas, was reconstructed into a visitor center. Altar A stone with a carving of the Columns of Gediminas and a neo-pagan altar on Rambynas Hill (demolished in 2010) At the top of the hill, there was a large stone known as the altar stone. It was first mentioned by Georg Christoph Pisanski in 1769. According to an 1867 description by Otto Glagau, the stone had a flat top and measured about 15 cubits (approximately ) in diameter. The taller side measured and the lower . According to Eduard Gisevius, the stone had carvings of a sword, human hand and feet, animal footprints, and something that resembled a Greek temple. This information is dubious as Gisevius wrote many years after the destruction of the stone and no other account mentioned the markings. The stone was broken up in 1811 by a German miller named Schwartz from the Bardehnen (Bardinai) village to make a millstone. As he could not find local help, he had to hire three German workers from Tilsit (Sovetsk). According to local legends, the workers were injured and the miller soon died. The circumstances of his demise vary: he lost his mill in a storm in 1818 and died in an accident working in another mill; he lost his business and became an alcoholic; he was found crushed and strangled by the millstone. In 1928, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania, Martynas Jankus and Juozas Adomaitis decided to build the altar on Rambynas and carve Columns of Gediminas into the top stone. In 1939, Klaipƒóda Region was annexed by Nazi Germany and the altar was demolished. The altar, designed to burn fire, was re-built during the Soviet era (exact circumstances are not known). In 2010‚Äì2011, Pagƒógiai Municipality cleaned up Rambynas' territory, strengthened the eroded slopes, and improved the sightseeing platform. At the same time, the altar was demolished and replaced by an abstract sculptural composition by sculptor . It is meant to symbolize the Prussian trinity ‚Äì Potrimpo, Perk≈´nas, and Peckols ‚Äì and includes a small metal altar for sacred fire. Eternal Book A woman signs in the book in 1934 In 1928, for the 10th anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania, Martynas Jankus decided to create a guestbook for those who visited Rambynas. Signing in the book became an integral part of the tradition during the interwar celebrations of Saint Jonas' Festival. The book, known as the Eternal Book of Rambynas, is one of the largest in Lithuania. It measures and is thick. It weighs and is accompanied by a wooden case that weights another . The covers are wood upholstered with leather and metal corners and close with two buckles. The second page is a portrait of Grand Duke Vytautas by Adomas Varnas. The first comment was left by Vyd≈´nas. The visitors left notes and comments in Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Russian, German, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Japanese, Hindi. The Japanese comments were left by , Assistant Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The last entry was made on 16 March 1939, four days before the German ultimatum to Lithuania. Jankus took the book to Kaunas where it was kept by polkovnik . In 1963, it was transferred to the Martynas Ma≈ævydas National Library of Lithuania where is it kept in the rare manuscript section. In 2002, a copy was made by Dalia Marija ≈†aulauskaitƒó and is kept at the Martynas Jankus Museum in Bitƒónai. Museum visitors are free to sign in the book. The copy has 1,000 pages and at is heavier than the original. Legends Lithuanian mythology View from Rambynas The sacred hill is surrounded by many legends and stories. According to one of them, the altar stone was put on Rambynas by thunder god Perk≈´nas who also buried a treasure of gold and silver harrow under the stone. Perk≈´nas then chose the hill and his home. Another story has it that the altar stone was brought by giant Rambynas, one of three sons of Nemunas, who offered it as a sacrifice to Perk≈´nas. The hill became a temple attended by priests (krivis) and priestess (vaidilutƒó). They were driven away by the Teutonic Order, but laumƒós cursed the stone ‚Äì while the stone stood, good fortune would bless the region; if the stone was damaged, bad fortunes would follow. Napoleon's treasure There are many local stories and legends about a treasure supposedly buried on or near Rambynas by the retreating French Grande Arm√©e after the unsuccessful invasion of Russia in 1812. The X Corps commanded by General Jacques MacDonald retreated from Riga via Tilsit where he spent five days. Stories circulated that in 1920, when Klaipƒóda Region was administered as a mandate of the League of Nations by the French, a group of Frenchmen dug up some boxes at a local cemetery. In 1930, a detailed map was purportedly discovered that showed where the treasure was buried. This inspired several expeditions in the 1930s in attempts of finding it. Another attempt was organized in summer 1974 by Soviet authorities. According to various stories, it was a direct order from Moscow. The area of excavations was guarded by Soviet troops and involved two visitors from East Germany. In July 2003, Lithuanian newspapers published a story that a treasure was found near Rambynas, but it was quickly debunked as an embellishment of a previous April Fools' Day joke. The various attempts at finding the treasure damaged the hill, local cemeteries, and several other local archaeological and cultural objects.

It was established in 1888, having originally been conceived around 1850. In 1913, the museum building was expanded by the Czech architect Karel Pa≈ô√≠k who designed a structure of four symmetric pavilions with a facade in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The four pavilions contain the departments of archaeology, ethnology, natural history, and a library. After being closed for several years due to heavy damage in the recent war, the museum has re-opened and is in the process of mounting new and pre-existing exhibits. The museum is a cultural and scientific institution covering a wide range of areas including archaeology, art history, ethnology, geography, history and natural history. The Sarajevo Haggadah, an illuminated manuscript and the oldest Sephardic Jewish document in the world issued in Barcelona around 1350, containing the traditional Jewish Haggadah, is held at the museum.

History and Governance Museum Development Medieval tombstones in National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina courtyard's botanical garden. The museum is a cultural and scientific institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Though conceived in 1850 as an idea by the Ottomans when they ruled Sarajevo, it was not until the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (which captured modern day Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Ottomans in 1878) that the museum was officially established and built. =1888-1913= Part of the Austro-Hungarian policy goals was to raise literacy levels and maintain European-standard education. Under their administration, a Museum Society was formed on February 1, 1888 in order to further this agenda in the form of a museum. The first director of the museum was Mr. Kosta H√∂rmann, an advisor to the Austro-Hungarian government. Greatly influenced by the orientation of 19th-century European science heuristics and culture, the museum's collection under H√∂rmann grew rapidly especially in the departments of natural history and archaeology. By the early 20th century, the museum began to outgrow its original premises and in 1908, construction on a new building to house the museum's collections began. Construction on the new building completed in 1913 and the Museum was officially opened on October 4 of that year. Throughout this all, the museum was funded by the Austro-Hungarian's departments of education and culture as well as by private donations and charity events led by the Museum Society. =1913-1991= National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina With the opening of the museum in its new home in 1913 (where it still remains), its collections that varied from history, geography, archaeology (prehistoric, ancient and mediaeval), ethnology, history of art and natural history (biology, geology and mineralogy), and to some extent language, literature, statistics and bibliography, were divided into four buildings based on a new set of categories: Archaeology, Ethnology, Natural History, and the Library. Two years later in 1914, as World War I began, the museum suspended its operations. After the end of the war in 1918, which was followed by the first union of the South Slavs, the museum resumed its operations under the administration of what was then called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later known as Yugoslavia. Under this administration, which lasted during the interwar years of 1918-45, a hegemonic centralized administration was developed in which the judicial branch of government along with the Serbian bourgeoisie, paid very little economic and cultural attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina. This led to an abrupt socio- economic, political and cultural decay in Sarajevo as it found itself in the margins of the Kingdom. The National Museum thus lost much of its funding and clout and was beginning to lose its ability to maintain and archive its artifacts. As World War II approached in 1941 (and lasted till 1945), the National Museum's troubles further developed as its opportunities to operate diminished. It was during this war-time period that the National Museum experienced the least activity and development. After World War II, under a Socialist Yugoslavia, the National Museum made slow progress until the early part of the 1960s. Culture was declared to be of special importance for society by the Socialist Government and this period in time marked some of the National Museum's highest achievements in scientific research and publishing activities and exhibitions.

During this period, was significant the contribution of Museum's Natural departments in the development of the Movement ‚ÄúScience to Youth\\" ‚Äì Alliance of Young Researchers of Bosnia and Herzegovina. =War years 1992-1995= Structural damage in Museum's courtyard (botanical garden), sustained in 1992-95\\\\. The War in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992-95 not only ended the prolific activity of the National Museum, but it directly caused structural damage to the building. During this time, artillery shells crashed through the roof, 300 windows were broken, and many of its gallery walls torn down. Sections of the Museum's artifacts and archives that could not be hidden were exposed to the elements or artillery. The Museum's director at the time, Dr. Rizo Sijari, was killed by a grenade blast on December 10, 1993 while he was arranging the holes in the museum's building to be covered by UN relief plastic sheeting. Nevertheless, it never closed completely. =1995-2012= After the end of the war, the museum reopened as a work in progress thanks to numerous donations and contributions by: the Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments and National Museum, the Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNESCO, the Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport, the Institute for Planning and Construction of the City of Sarajevo, the International Peace Center in Sarajevo, Swiss museums, Swiss ICOM and the Swiss National Museum in Zurich, BHHR, Norks Folkesmuseum from Oslo, the Swedish Cultural Heritage without Borders Foundation, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Ethnography, the Museum of Islamic Art and other Swedish museums, as well as many others. =Closure 2012-2015= After 2010 the Museum began to run out of funds; during 2011 the Museum's 65 employees came to work for over a year without being paid. National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina - posters on entrance On Thursday, 4 October 2012, the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina closed its doors completely and indefinitely, the first time in 124 years. The Council of Europe noted: \\"After the war the different cultural groups, who define themselves as nations, have all wanted their own national cultural institutions.\\", leading to the neglect of the former national institutions such as the museum, the Historical Museum and the National and University Library. Demonstrations took place to protest the closure. Several students chained themselves to a pole in the lobby and remained inside, declaring they would stay there until the museum reopened, while dozens of others held a sit-in in front of the building. During the shutdown, staff continued to work unpaid, safeguarding the collection and the building. =2015-= The Museum reopened its doors to the public in September 2015, following an agreement between the different layers of Bosnia's complex government pledging financing for the museum and six other national cultural institutions. Departments and Exhibitions The Department of Archaeology The Department of Archaeology includes sections for prehistory, ancient history, mediaeval history, documentation and a conservation laboratory. The archaeological collections document all aspects of human life in Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Old Stone Age to the late Middle Ages. The artifacts of the collections have mainly been collected during field research, though some have been acquired by exchange, gift or purchase. =Exhibitions= Bosnia and Herzegovina in Ancient History, Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Middle Ages. The Natural History Department Calcite Crystal found at Trebeviƒá mountain around Sarajevo; Bosnia and Herzegovina on display at National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Natural History Department covers the flora and fauna and the geology of Bosnia and Herzegovina and elsewhere, consisting of around 2,000,000 specimens collected from field research, exchange, gift or purchase. The Department consists of a Geology Section, a Zoology Section and a Botany Section, the latter including the Botanical Garden. =Exhibitions= Botanical Garden, Pleistocene and subfossil vertebrates of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Fauna of mountain rivers and streams, Cave fauna, Minerals, Rocks and ores, Flora and fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Higher fungi (Macromycetes, Medicinal plants and endemic plants of the Dinarides,Mammals, Invertebrates and Birds of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ethnology Department The Ethnology Department is responsible for collecting, preserving, exhibiting and studying all aspects of the material, spiritual and social culture of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since 1913, the Department has been arranged to illustrate a traditional urban house in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The collection of ethnological material began when the Museum was established in 1888, with the purchase of some very valuable ethnological artifacts such as sets of traditional costume. The Department is engaged in museological work, scientific research and educational work. =Exhibitions= Dioramas and models,The life and Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Urban Population in the 19th century, Which shirt is mine? - temporary exhibition. The Library of the National Museum The Library of the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina was opened in 1888 as the first scientific library in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It contains about 250,000 publications (journals, periodicals, books, newspapers) in the fields of archaeology, history, ethnology, folklore, mineralogy, geology, botany, zoology and museology. Publications are now exchanged with 341 institutions. Herald of the Museum The Herald of the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the oldest scientific journal in the country, with a first issue published on 1 January 1889. Herald was published quarterly, and its first editor was Kosta H√∂rmann. Sarajevo Haggadah The Sarajevo Haggadah, a 600-year-old Jewish manuscript, and one of Bosnia's most prized relics, is housed in a high-security glass case. The manuscript, handwritten on bleached calfskin, dates to the once-thriving Jewish community in Spain and describes events ranging from the Creation to the Jewish exodus from ancient Egypt to the death of Moses. It is estimated to be worth over 700 million dollars. New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art offered in November 2012 to host the relic for three years, but the country's Commission for the Preservation of National Monuments rejected the offer due to the unresolved legal status of the National Museum. Additionally, moving the document to New York would have required special care, for which the funds needed to prepare for the transfer were unavailable.

The expression for the relativistic energy of a particle with rest mass and momentum is given by :E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2. The energy of an ultrarelativistic particle is almost completely due to its momentum (), and thus can be approximated by . This can result from holding the mass fixed and increasing to very large values (the usual case); or by holding the energy fixed and shrinking the mass to negligible values. The latter is used to derive orbits of massless particles such as the photon from those of massive particles (cf. Kepler problem in general relativity). In general, the ultrarelativistic limit of an expression is the resulting simplified expression when is assumed. Or, similarly, in the limit where the Lorentz factor is very large ().  Expression including mass value  While it is possible to use the approximation E = pc, this neglects all information of the mass. In some cases, even with p\\\\gg m, the mass may not be ignored, as in the derivation of neutrino oscillation. A simple way to retain this mass information is using a Taylor expansion rather than a simple limit. The following derivation assumes c=1 (and the ultrarelativistic limit pc\\\\gg mc^2 ). Without loss of generality, the same can be shown including the appropriate c terms. * E = (p^2 + m^2)^{1/2} * E = p(1 + \\\\frac{m^2}{p^2})^{1/2} The generic expression (1+x)^{1/2} can be Taylor expanded, giving: * (1+x^2)^{1/2} = 1 + \\\\frac{x^2}{2} - \\\\frac{x^4}{8} + ... Using just the first two terms, this can be substituted into the above expression (with \\\\frac{m}{p} acting as x), as: * E = p(1 + \\\\frac{m^2}{2p^2}) * E = p + \\\\frac{m^2}{2p}  Ultrarelativistic approximations  Below are some ultrarelativistic approximations in units with .

It has been making leather goods since 1866, when it was founded in Hockley, Birmingham. In the 1880s, the production of bicycle saddles began, the first saddle patent having been filed in 1882. Homepage of Brooks England Ltd. website, Dec. 2012 In a 2014 interview with Feel Desain, a Brooks spokesperson stated that according to family legend, the company began when founder John Boultbee Brooks, a horse saddle manufacturer, tried to use a bicycle after his horse died but found the wooden seat very uncomfortable.

In 2002, they sold Brooks to Selle Royal of Italy.\\"The Brooks Bugle\\", Issue Four, page 23, 2012 Edition, Brooks England Ltd. Underside of a Team Pro Classic The fundamental design of a Brooks saddle is a leather top stretched between a metal \\"cantle plate\\" at the rear and a nose piece, to which it is attached with steel or copper rivets. Using a threaded bolt, the nose piece can be moved forward independently of the rails, tensioning the leather. It is important not to over-tension the leather or it may tear, especially at the rivets. Normally the nose bolt should not be adjusted unless the saddle becomes noticeably sagged, in which case it should only be adjusted in fractions of a turn until the top is comfortable again. After a certain period of use, which can be from 100 miles to 1,000 miles depending on the leather used to make the top, the saddle visibly moulds itself to the rider and \\"dimples\\" appear where the \\"sit bones\\" normally rest. This is caused by fibres in the leather breaking down under the weight of the rider. The saddle is normally more comfortable by this stage, although some riders find that no break-in period is necessary for comfort and other riders never find a Brooks saddle comfortable, even after many thousands of miles. Leather saddles are not waterproof (although this does mean they are able to absorb and dissipate sweat by \\"breathing\\"). Brooks produce a dressing, Proofide, which should be applied occasionally. The composition of Proofide is mainly tallow, the current blend also includes some citronella oil,Proofide tins have ingredients stated on them identifiable by its sharp odour. Leather saddles are two or three times heavier than modern plastic or carbon-fibre designs (although the titanium versions of the Team Pro, Swift and Swallow race saddles are an exception to this heaviness) but, for some riders, the traditional appearance and long-distance comfort make this a worthwhile trade- off.http://www.ebykr.com/brooks-england-eternal-one/ Brooks England: The Eternal One, Feb. 2018 The saddle companies Lycett and The Leatheries were taken over by Brooks.

It is owned by Dumfries and Galloway Council and is situated next to the London Road and the railway line in the town. The park features a bandstand, all weather tennis & netball courts, skatepark, football pitch and a football stadium. The park and stadium were named after the Earl of Stair, who bequeathed the land to the local authorities. A stand was first constructed for football in 1932. The record attendance of 6,000 was set by a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers in 1948. When Stranraer entered the Scottish Football League in 1955, a terrace cover was erected, called the Shed. There were no significant further changes until 1981, when Stair Park became the last ground in league football in either England or Scotland to install floodlights. Stair Park was significantly improved in the 1990s. 300 seats were installed in the Shed, then a new main stand with 1,524 seats was constructed. This cost ¬£520,000 to build, with the club committee raising ¬£120,000 of the cost and the rest financed by grants from the Football Trust and the district council. There is not normally segregation at Stranraer matches, but there are 2,000 places for away fans. When there is no segregation away fans normally settle down in the Coo Shed.

Background After the emancipation of slaves in the British Empire, the plantation owners of Trinidad were desperate for new sources of labour. In 1839 the British government began a programme of recruiting Indian labourers in Calcutta to be sent to Trinidad. They bound themselves to work as indentured labourers for a set number of years on the plantations. The mostly Hindu and Muslim labourers were required to work seven and a half hours a day, six days a week for three years, receiving about 13 cents a day for their work. At first, half of the recruits were women but, in 1840, the proportion was reduced to a third of the number of men. In 1844, the period of indenture was extended to five years with a guarantee that, if they wished, they would get a free passage home at the end of their service. In 1853 the law was again amended to allow the indentured labourers to re-indenture themselves for a second five-year term or, if they wished, to commute any portion of their contract by repayment of a proportionate part of their indenture fee. Newly arrived indentured Indians in Trinidad Industrial unrest on the plantations was gaining momentum to be followed by a deepening depression in the sugar industry in 1884. This atmosphere was also fuelled by frequent strikes. In the previous year, met with restrictions on the use of torches the African community celebrating ‚ÄòCanboulay‚Äô reacted and this resulted in violence. The decision by the authorities to prohibit the Indians from entering the towns with their processions, which began, on the estates ‚Äòwere regarded by the Indians as an arbitrary and unjust measure‚Äô. The Indians protested with a petition led by the Hindu Sookhoo and 31 others. On 26 October Administrator John Bushe consulted the Executive Council on \\"the final arrangements to be made for preserving order during the Hosea.\\" Acting Colonial Secretary, Mr. Pyne informed the Inspector Commandant of Police, Captain Baker instructing him on the \\"deployment of police, marines, from the HMS Dido, and a volunteer force.\\" 27 October ‚Äì Captain Baker personally monitors the situation. The next day Baker reports that the Indians would make no attempt to enter San Fernando. In a series of telegrams Baker attempts to avoid an armed confrontation with the Indians, however Mr. Pyne appeared bent on such a confrontation to show the Indians who was in charge. (Shantal Ramnarine) Events of 30 October 1884 At midday the first procession of 6,000 was sighted approaching San Fernando reaching Cross Crossing about 2:30 pm and proceeded along to the entrance of Cipero Street. There the Indians met by British troops under Major Bowles of the First North Staffordshire Regiment. The local magistrate, a Mr. Child, read the Riot Act and when the crowd failed to disperse, Child ordered the police to fire upon the unarmed Indians. Two volleys were fired into the crowd. At the Mon Repos Junction of the Princes Town and Circular roads a similar fate was to meet the Indians there. The procession was in sight about 3:30 pm. Captain Baker gave the order to fire a single volley of bullets after the Riot Act was read.

She was born Esther Georgina Harwood, the elder daughter of George Harwood, a former clergyman, Liberal Member of Parliament for his home town of Bolton, master cotton spinner, and an author and barrister. Her family was steeped in politics: her maternal grandfather, Sir Alfred Hopkinson, KC (the first Vice- Chancellor of Manchester University), three uncles, and her stepfather, John Murray (Principal of the University College of the South West of England, Exeter), all became MPs. She was educated at St Michael's School, Oxford, and at Lady Margaret Hall, and once considered a political career herself. In 1932 she married Christopher Battiscombe (d.1964), a lieutenant-colonel in the Grenadier Guards. For a time they lived in Zanzibar, where Colonel Battiscombe was Secretary to the Sultan. They then lived at Durham before moving to the Henry III Tower at Windsor Castle as Colonel Battiscombe became honorary secretary of the Society of the Friends of St George's from 1958-60. Her best known books were biographies of the Victorian romantic novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge (1943); Catherine Gladstone, the wife of Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone (1956); English churchman John Keble (1963); and Alexandra of Denmark (1969). The biography of Keble was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Battiscombe was drawn to the subject of Queen Alexandra, wife of Edward VII, because she suffered from the same form of deafness, otosclerosis, that had afflicted the queen, and was very deaf from the age of about 20 until she was 50. Two operations and a modern hearing aid entirely overcame this disability, but, as she said, it gave her \\"some understanding of Alexandra's predicament.\\" As a royal biographer, she was appalled by the way in which members of the Royal Family were frequently treated, decrying the sensational and the scandalous, rightly considering many royal biographies ill-informed, and noting that \\"so often the unfortunate royalties do not even receive common politeness from those who write about them\\". Battiscombe also wrote biographies of Christina Rossetti (1965) and Shaftesbury (1974), and her other titles include Two on Safari (1946); English Picnics (1949); Reluctant Pioneer: The Life of Elizabeth Wordsworth (1978); The Spencers of Althorp (1984); and Winter Song, a book of poems (1992). She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1964. She died in 2006, aged 100.

R√©seau Saint-Lazare is the network of railway lines originating from Saint Lazare Station in Paris. The network stretches from Paris to Normandy and encompasses suburban services. Parisian suburban rail services are operated under SNCF's brand name Transilien. Intercity services are also operated by SNCF but under the brand name Corail. Track Cohabitation of both intercity and suburban rail did cause problems. Junctions were not carefully planned, and extensions were simply grafted onto the existing network. The Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest's suburban network was particularly touched by problems of cohabitation on the line and at stations since it had the largest suburban network in France. The problem resided in the fact that lines crossed each other, creating unnecessary bottlenecks and hold ups. In 1880, the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest operated four lines out of Saint-Lazare: the lines to Versailles Rive Droite and Argenteuil separated at Asni√®res whilst the lines to Saint-Germain and Rouen separated at Colombes. As they were, both lines to Argenteuil crossed those to Saint-Germain and Rouen at Asni√®res. The Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest thus decided create a spur, opened in 1891, from B√©con-les-Bruy√®res and La Garenne-Colombes. In 1892, the line to Saint-Germain was rerouted to a spur of the line to Versailles instead of the line to Poissy whilst the line to Poissy was rerouted to a spur of the line to Argenteuil, avoiding crossings. The bridge over the River Seine still had four tracks, but serving two pairs of lines. These modifications were only sufficient for a time as traffic was in constant increase, growing from 26 million passengers in 1888 to 42 million in 1898. The tunnel at Batignoles (now Pont Cardinet) was another bottleneck, so a fourth tunnel was built, but later demolished along with all save one tunnel in 1912. At that time, the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat possessed eight tracks leaving Saint-Lazare, which were split into four groups: *Groupe I: Auteuil *Groupe II: Versailles *Groupe III: Saint-Germain *Germain IV: Normandy The eight tracks were supplemented by two sidings, used to transfer rolling stock and locomotives, as well as a second bridge at Asni√®res. World War I slowed expansion and the second bridge was only built in 1921, the year when a grave accident occurred in the Batignoles tunnel and precipitated its demolition. The demolition of the tunnels as well as the transfer of the terminus of the line to Auteuil at Pont Cardinet freed up platforms at Saint-Lazare and increased tracks in the tranch√©e des Batignoles from eight to ten and split in five groups: *Groupe I: Auteuil, leaving Pont Cardinet *Groupe II: Versailles *Groupe III: Saint-Germain *Groupe IV: Argenteuil *Groupe V: Mantes, via Poissy *Groupe VI: Mantes, via Conflans An eleventh track, used for servicing, was built for reversing locomotives. The pont d'Asni√®res was widened to accommodate the ten tracks. A saut-de-mouton (flying junction) was built between Asni√®res and Bois-Colombes to avoid the crossing of the groupe IV and groupe V lines. Two joining lines were built in 1923 and 1925 at La Folie and Bezons to relieve suburban lines from goods services. The station building at Bois-Colombes was rebuilt above the railway line in 1934 as well as the quadrupling of the line as well as replacement of all the remaining level crossings by bridges or underpasses between 1933 and 1935. The line was also rebuilt on a 585 m long viaduct between Bois-Colombes and Le Stade (Gennevilliers). Other modernisation projects included the electrification of the R√©seau Saint-Lazare. Electrification Third rail electrification The Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest had hoped to electrify parts of its lines to Saint-Germain and Argenteuil as early as 1908. Many of the construction work on the lines were initiated to alleviate operational issues but steam traction meant that without remote driving or the locomotive, engines had to be turned around the train at termini. Third rail electrification had been applied to Paris' underground and the Chemin de Fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans's line from Les Invalides with success. Rolling stock chosen were two carriage 22m long EMUs of Z 1300 class resting on two bogies and compatible with rolling stock used on the line at Les Invalides. 1500 V overhead electrification had been dismissed by the French Government following World War I and so 650 V third rail electrification was chosen. A special commission had found that the R√©seau √âtat Saint-Lazare was in need of electrification on the railway lines to Saint-Germain, Versailles Rive Droite, Saint-Nom-la-Bret√®che, Puteaux, Issy-les-Moulineaux and Argenteuil. The Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest and then the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat from 1909 had worked towards that goal by simplifying track layout in Paris' close suburbs. On 24 April 1924, the third rail was switched on groupe II on the 6 km section between Paris and B√©con-les-Bruy√®res and on groupe IV on the 6 km section between Paris and Bois-Colombes. The press as well as the public saluted the arrival of the electric train which made some steam hauled trains look old. Indeed, some coaches in use were old 19th century double-deck passenger cars with notorious comfort. The rames standard was capable of carrying 372 seated passengers and were capable of being coupled together. They were stabled at Rueil-Malmaison, Bois-Colombes and Champ de Mars and servicing was performed at La Folie. The 7 km long railway line to Auteuil was electrified in January 1925. The line to Saint- Germain-en-Laye was electrified up to Rueil-Malmaison (14 km) in June 1926, then extended to Saint-Germain in 1927. The line to Versailles Rive Droite was electrified in July 1928 as well as between Puteaux and Issy-les-Moulineaux, Saint-Nom-la-Bret√®che in May 1931 and the 10 km long line to Argenteuil in 1936 after the quadrupling of the tracks two years earlier. Electricity was fed to the EMUs under the third rail, as opposed to above the rail in Southern England. The third rail was fed by fourteen sub-stations themselves fed by 15000 V and 1500 V by power stations at Nanterre and Issy-les-Moulineaux. the sub-stations was partially automated in the early 1930s. When electrification was implemented, zoned services were put in place to decrease travel time, this meant that not all trains served all stations and semi-direct trains served the further stations. This decreased travel time for users of further town. From 1926, three trains served the Saint-Germain line: *Saint Lazare- B√©con omnibus every fifteen minutes *Saint Lazare-B√©con direct then omnibus to Rueil every half-hour *Saint Lazare-Rueil direct then omnibus to Saint-Germain every half-hour (steam operated until 1927) To maximise electrification efficiency, Bloc automatique lumineux signalling (BAL) tested between Rueil- Malmaison and Le Pecq followed by a widespread implementation on all the close suburb between 1924 and 1931. Overhead electrification Allied bombing in 1944 destroyed much of the railway installations and disorganised services. Operated by the SNCF since 1938, R√©seau Saint-Lazare, like R√©seau Nord and R√©seau Est was to be electrified with overhead wire. As it had been the case with other modernisation projects, track alteration took place when it was being prepared for electrification. A fourth track was installed between Ach√®res and Poissy in 1961 as well as a saut-de-mouton and an intermediate terminus at Poissy. A fourth track was also installed on a 6 km long stretch of line between Vernouillet and Les Mureaux. Stations at Sartrouville and Les Mureaux were expanded and a through track installed for suburban services. 25 kV electrification by overhead wiring was made live on groupe V in 1966, on 11 January between Ach√®res and Mantes for use for goods services only and on 20 September between Gare Saint-Lazare and Ach√®res for suburban passenger services alike. To prepare for the arrival of overhead electrification, important structural work was done. Initiated in 1962, work ended in 1966. It included the raising of the bridge of the Place de l'Europe situated above the platforms at Gare Saint-Lazare and lowering the tracks below the b√¢timent des docks, offices situated above high numbered platforms, lengthening of the platforms allocated to intercity services and the construction of the state of the art signal box, poste tout relais √† transit souple (PRS). Electricity was switched on the line to Mantes via Conflans on 27 March 1967 and from Conflans to Pontoise on 14 May 1968. Rolling stock As a heritage of the Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest and the Chemin de fer de l'√âtat and due to its size, the R√©seau Saint-Lazare inherited a number of particular and specifically designed rolling stock. Steam traction The following locomotives were in use for passenger duties on the R√©seau Saint-Lazare: *030 T Ouest *040 TA Ouest *120 T Ouest *131 TA Ouest *141 TC Ouest *141 TD Ouest Electric traction The following rolling stock is in use for passenger duties on the R√©seau Saint- Lazare: *SNCF Class BB 16000 *SNCF Class BB 16500 *SNCF Class BB 17000 *SNCF Class BB 26000 Including some electric multiple units: *SNCF Class Z 1300 *SNCF Class Z 1500 *SNCF Class Z 6300 *SNCF Class Z 6400 *SNCF Class Z 20500 *SNCF TGV R√©seau Diesel traction Since the electrification of the main line to Caen and Cherbourg in June 1996, there no longer are regular services using diesel for Gare Saint-Lazare although some regional services in Normandy, part of the R√©seau Saint-Lazare use DMUs and diesel locomotives. *SNCF Class BB 67400 *SNCF Class T 1000 *SNCF Class T 2000 *SNCF Class X 4630 *SNCF Class X 72500 *SNCF Class X 73500 Hauled stock *Bidel passenger cars *Voiture √âtat √† 2 √©tages 1933-1984 *Rame inox de banlieue 1970‚Äìpresent *Voiture de banlieue √† 2 niveaux 1975‚Äìpresent Depots Trains operating in the R√©seau Saint Lazare are maintained in several engine sheds or EMT: *B√¢tignoles (Grandes-Lignes) *Clichy-Levallois (Transilien) **Asni√®res-sur- Seine (Transilien) *Ach√®res **Mantes-la-Jolie (Freight & Transilien) *Sotteville *Caen Category:SNCF ","title":"R√©seau Saint-Lazare"},{"id":"4285135","text":"Felix Walker (born 5 March 1935) is a Swiss economist and politician of the Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC).

In recent years the population has exceeded 1,000 and historically the population has been around 8,000. It is in the ecclesiastical parish of Borrisoleigh and Ileigh in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly.Official website of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly ‚Äì parish of Borrisoleigh & Ileigh. Location and access The town is part of the civil parish of Glenkeen in the historic barony of Kilnamanagh Upper. It is situated on the R498 Nenagh‚ÄìThurles road. To the east, the R501 goes to Templemore with fine views of the Devil's Bit mountain on the left hand side near Drom and Barnane. History Borrisoleigh derives its name from the ancient territory of U√≠ Luighdheach in which it was situated. An annual cattle fair was held here every 27 November until the 1960s. The first recorded settlement here was an abbey established by St. Cualan at Glean Caoin, anglicised as \\"Glankeen Abbey.\\" Kilcuilan (St. Cualan's Church) was dedicated to him at a nearby holy well. A bell attributed to this saint, known as the \\"Bearnan Culan\\" or \\"Glankeen Bell\\" is now housed at the British Museum in London. A replica may be seen in the sanctuary of the parish church in Borrisoleigh. After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, the O'Dwyer and DeBurgo clans established a fortress on the River Camoge as a defence against the native settlement at Ileigh. Its ruins may still be seen as you leave Borrisoleigh on the Templemore Road. In October 1846, absentee landlord Lord Portarlington threw a banquet at the Temperance Hall in Borrisoleigh while the surrounding parish was suffering through the Great Famine. He left a meager one hundred pound donation to the local Poor Relief Committee when he returned to England. Catholic church The parish priest Michael Slattery was appointed as Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly in 1833. Slattery was succeeded by Father William Morris, who led 118 local men in signing the Cormack Petition in 1858. This document provides a vital snapshot of the town's population, including its largest families (in this order): Ryan, Bourke, Kennedy, Dwyer, Maher, Gleeson, Harrington, and Patterson. It also shows the top 10 male given names were: John, James, Patrick, William, Michael, Daniel, Martin, Philip, Thomas, Edmond (tie), and Jeremiah (tie). Borrisoleigh has produced two well-known Catholic bishops: Joseph Shanahan (1871‚Äì1943) and Thomas Quinlan (1896‚Äì1970). Church of Ireland In 1785, a parish church for the Church of Ireland parish of Glenkeen was built in Borrisoleigh, on the site where St. Brigid's Cemetery is today. The glebe- house, which had a glebe of , was in the townland of Glenkeen.

In the period between 1906 and 1915 the newspaper was published on a weekly basis. From 1991 to 1995 it appeared once a month, reverting to weekly publication in 1996 and then fortnightly in the years 1997‚Äî1999. In 1999 the paper became a weekly again. \\"Nasha Niva\\" Online (nn.by) was set up in 1997. By 2017 it became the most frequently visited website in Belarusian language. According to Media IQ estimation, \\"Nasha Niva\\" remains free of state propaganda and keeps one of the highest ratings in journalism ethics among Belarusian media. Being in an open opposition to Alexander Lukashenko‚Äôs regime, the newspaper was cracked down by the government numerous times, received huge fines and was excluded from state circulation. The editors and journalists were arrested, questioned and beaten by the police and KGB officers. As of 2020 the editor-in-chief is Jahor Marcinoviƒç, who succeeded Andrej Dy≈Ñko. History \\"Nasha Niva\\" logo in the early 20th century (written in the Belarusian Latin alphabet) Editors office after police search, 2010 1906‚Äì1915 \\"Nasha Niva\\" was inspired by Iskra, a political newspaper, published by the RSDLP since 1901. At the BSA conference in June 1906 Belarusian journalist Anton ≈Åuckeviƒç announced his intention to create a party newspaper. The co-founders were his brother Ivan and Alaksandar U≈Çasa≈≠, a landowner from the Miha≈≠ka estate near Minsk, who was for many years the newspaper's publisher and editor. The name for the publication was taken from a poem by Janka Luƒçyna \\"–†–æ–¥–Ω–∞–π —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–Ω—Ü—ã\\" (\\"To Fatherland\\"). The first issue was published on 23 November 1906, under the editorship of titular counselor Zigmund Volsky. Since the fifth issue from 8 December 1906, the chief editor was Alexander Vlasov. In the first three years, the newspaper published 960 reports from 489 areas, 246 poems by 61 authors, and 91 articles by 36 special reporters. Only in 1910 \\"Nasha Niva\\" published 666 various correspondence from 427 people. \\"Nasha Niva\\" covered a wide range of political, economic, and cultural issues. Every issue included the following sections: government actions, political review, life of the countryside, life of the city, feuilletons, the newest literary works in Belarusian, correspondence, news from Russia and Lithuania, book digest, history notes, notes on agriculture, applied mechanics, personal ad. The newspaper saw as its main task the consolidation of a Belarusian political nation. It was also ‚Äì as was observed at the time ‚Äì the first source of information to be free of government interference. The editors office also strived to preserve and promote Belarusian culture. National civil society rallied around the newspaper; numerous agricultural initiatives, youth groups and publishing houses used it as a voice to promote their activities. In 1911 its circulation was about 3000. Up to October 1912, the newspaper was printed both in Cyrillic and Latin scripts. From the 43 issue of 24 October 1912, the publication completely switched to the Cyrillic alphabet. A subscription for a year cost 5 roubles, the price for one issue was 5 kopeks. The newspaper's defence of national interests provoked attacks by the Russian censorship throughout its existence. Even a discussion on agrarian topics organised in 1907 ‚Äì including an article entitled 'The Land Question in New Zealand' ‚Äì was found 'seditious' and 'disrespectful of the government'. The editor, Alaksandar U≈Çasa≈≠, was tried and imprisoned. On several occasions, the entire run of a particular issue was confiscated and the editors were compelled to pay fines. = Editors office = Editors office, 1907 Subscribers and correspondents of the newspaper became central figures of national political and intellectual life, e.g. Ci≈°ka Hartny (pseudonym of ≈πmicier ≈Ωy≈Çunoviƒç), one of the first leaders of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, or Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç, political leader in the Western Belarus and author of the first printed grammar of the Belarusian language. One of the major figures behind the formulation of the newspaper's political goals was Ivan ≈Åuckeviƒç from Minsk, founder of the famous Belarusian Museum in Vilnius and sponsor of numerous political and cultural projects. Working alongside him was his brother, Anton ≈Åuckeviƒç, whose ideas were decisive in the formation of the programme of the Belarusian Socialist Party (Hramada). He would eventually become the Prime Minister of the Belarusian People's Republic. Vac≈Ça≈≠ ≈Åasto≈≠ski, another future Prime Minister of the Belarusian People's Republic, became secretary of the newspaper in 1909 and in the years 1912‚Äî1913 acted as its de facto editor. He was in charge of the historical agenda, which was one of the main topics in Nasha Niva. Janka Kupa≈Ça, a famous poet, became the newspaper's editor in March 1914. The editors office located on , 14. Kupa≈Ça continued in this role until the Autumn of 1915 when Vilnius was occupied by the Germans and normal life in Belarus came to a standstill. By early 1909 the editors office included six permanent employees ‚Äì ≈Åuckeviƒç brothers, Alaksandar U≈Çasa≈≠, Vac≈Ça≈≠ ≈Åasto≈≠ski, Janka Kupa≈Ça and . In the Summer of 1909 they were joined by . However, the group was divided into two parts. ≈Åuckeviƒç brothers and U≈Çasa≈≠ were the so-called ‚ÄòUpper House of Parliament‚Äô, they used the separated room and communicated to others by notes that were put through a slot under the door. The ‚ÄòUpper Parliament‚Äô strived to keep the publication alive and receive fees, while the ‚ÄòLower Chamber‚Äô performed all the everyday tasks. Their articles were published under pseudonyms, all their decisions could be overridden by the ‚ÄòUpper House‚Äô veto. The tense relations between the collaborators are presumably the main reason of Siarhiej Pa≈Çujan‚Äôs suicide in 1910. According to the archives, in 1909 the newspaper had subscribers even in Prague, Paris, Lviv and USA. Anton ≈Åuckeviƒç, Alaksandar U≈Çasa≈≠, Branis≈Ça≈≠ Tara≈°kieviƒç, ≈πmicier ≈Ωy≈Çunoviƒç and Vac≈Ça≈≠ ≈Åasto≈≠ski all fell victims of the Soviet repressions in the 1930s. =Belarusian Language= According to some research, in the early 20th century the Belarusian language was mostly used by the peasantry and neglected by intelligence and upper classes. \\"Nasha Niva\\" introduced standards of usage into the Belarusian literary language. It was actively involved in both the creation of classical Belarusian literature and the evolution of the idea of Belarusian statehood. One of the newspaper's characteristic features was the strong interactive relationship that it built with readers. There were more than three thousand permanent and temporary correspondents who submitted information to the editor. A large number of contributors from various regions of Belarus were involved in the publication of both journalistic pieces and literary works. This provided a unique opportunity to re-establish the literary language by establishing norms of usage that were the most widespread throughout the country as a whole. The newspaper thereby played an invaluable role in fixing the orthography, grammar and word-formation patterns of the modern Belarusian language. Jakub Ko≈Ças, a classic of Belarusian literature, was an active contributor to \\"Nasha Niva\\". It was also \\"Nasha Niva\\" that discovered the works of Maksim Bahdanoviƒç and ≈πmitrok Biadula. It published the writings of many prominent intellectual figures, including Janka Kupa≈Ça, Anton ≈Åuckeviƒç, Maksim Bahdanoviƒç and Vac≈Ça≈≠ ≈Åasto≈≠ski. Nasha Niva realised the unpopularity of the Belarusian language among rural populations. As the main step to improve the issue it promoted education in Belarusian and advocated people‚Äôs right to use their native language in schools and in church. =Publishing= The newspaper became the centre of intellectual life, it acted as the focal point for the independent cultural and social projects that grew up around it. Since 1907 the editors office has been engaged in book publishing. \\"Nasha Niva\\" performed the coordinating function of a publishing centre. Especially popular were the annual Belarusian Calendars, almanacs in which readers could find not only the usual kind of day-to-day information but also literary works. The publishing centre also published books, both original and in translation. A satirical magazine 'Krapiva' (Nettles) was published in Vilnia in 1912, and the agricultural department of Nasha Niva grew into the independent 'Sacha' (Wooden Plough) magazine published in Minsk from the end of 1913. Under the newspaper's auspices one of \\"Nasha Niva\\" founders, Ivan ≈Åuckeviƒç, began to collect artefacts for the future Belarusian National Museum. Most of it is currently stored in the National History Museum of Lithuania. Staff of the newspaper helped Ihnat Bujnicki form the first Belarusian theatre company. More than 1 mln copies of the newspaper were published between 1906-1915. The scale of the work accomplished by \\"Nasha Niva\\" has allowed historians and researchers of culture to define early 20th century Belarusian culture as the 'Nasha Niva period' when referring to the quantitative and qualitative changes in the development of modern culture and society.  First World War  In 1914 Nasha Niva could no longer criticize the government that was at war because such opposition could be perceived as unloyalty to the state. The newspaper published articles and reports on patriotic actions of ordinary Belarusians, but its editorial position didn‚Äôt demonstrate any support to the Russian military. The Russian army was described as alien as the German one. With the outbreak of war Nasha Niva issues halved in volume. Since the Autumn of 1914, the blank spaces appeared on its pages, left by the state censors. The last issue was published in the Summer of 1915 when the majority of the staff were called to active military service. Revival Attempt in 1920 The first attempt to revive the newspaper was made by Maksim Harecki in Vilnia in 1920. The first issue of the revived Nasha Niva, now described as a socio- political and literature daily newspaper, appeared on 28 October 1920, soon after the beginning of ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny. From the 4th issue, the editor-in- chief was Viaƒças≈Ça≈≠ Znamiaro«îski. In December 1920 the newspaper was banned again, this time by the Polish military censorship. 1991 Revival in Vilnius The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the rapid growth of the independence movement in Belarus made it possible for the newspaper to be re- established. The publication of Nasha Niva was relaunched by journalist Siarhiej Dubaviec in Vilnius in May 1991. The revived newspaper came to occupy a special place among other Belarusian periodicals. \\"Nasha Niva\\" abandoned the 'defensive strategy' and self-imposed isolation inherent to much of the Belarusian-language media of the Soviet times. The newspaper opened its pages to discussions on universal topics and published numerous translations of foreign literature. The paper discussed two topics in particular: the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and a possible model of relations between Belarus and other nations of the region. In 2000 Siarhiej Dubaviec resigned, Andrej Dy≈Ñko became the new editor-in-chief. In 1996, the newspaper's editorial office relocated to Minsk, Belarus. The topics covered by \\"Nasha Niva\\" shifted from literature and culture towards political and social issues. In 1999 the newspaper became a weekly once more. In 2002 the volume increased from 12 to 16 pages weekly, and in 2005 to 24. At its peak the print run reached 8,000. Following pressure from the state and denial of access to the national press distribution system, \\"Nasha Niva\\" changed to a pocket format and increased the number of pages to 48. The circulation decreased to 2,200 copies. In 2006 \\"Nasha Niva\\" decided to expand its online version, Andrej Skurko headed the web department, Andrej Dy≈Ñko became the new chief of the paper edition. In the 1990s work began on the production of a facsimile edition of the issues of the newspaper that appeared in the years between 1906 and 1915. At the same time material has been collected for the compilation of a dictionary of the language used in those early years of \\"Nasha Niva\\". State pressure Since 1995 and especially in the 2000s, \\"Nasha Niva\\" has faced pressure from the authoritarian regime of Alexander Lukashenko. The paper was persecuted for using the traditional Belarusian orthography (Tara≈°kievica). In 1998 the newspaper won a trial in court and got permission to continue using the classical orthography. \\"Nasha Niva\\" used the classical spelling until 2008; it then shifted to the spelling taught in schools in order to 'improve communication between intellectuals and the public', as an editorial on the topic made clear at the time. In 2005 the authorities banned distribution of the newspaper through the Belarusian postal system and the official distribution agency which delivered the paper to shops and newsstands. The circulation dropped from 3500 to 2000 copies. Only in 2006 the publication received four official warnings for not indicating the legal address. In fact, four different leaseholders broke the contracts with the editors office without any notification or explanation as soon as \\"Nasha Niva\\" notified the Information Ministry about their agreements. Between 2006 and 2008 the newspaper had to be distributed by volunteers. For this reason, the newspaper switched to A4 format, so it would be easier to put into bags and envelopes. \\"Nasha Niva\\" has been tried in court and fined on many occasions, with the KGB conducting searches both in the newspaper's office and the journalists personally. In 2006 the newspaper's Chief Editor, Andrej Dy≈Ñko was arrested and spent 10 days in prison. After his arrest Minsk authorities issued an official statement that the distribution of Nasha Niva in the city ‚Äòwas inappropriate‚Äô. On 29 April 2006, 300 activists organized a rally in support of Nasha Niva at the Oktyabrskaya square, 10 people were arrested. In March 2008 the police attacked and arrested journalists Syamyon Pechanko and Andrei Lyankevich, while they were reporting from a rally in Minsk. Pechanko was accused for organization of the rally and received 15 days in prison. In 2008 the Belarusian government took a course on the liberalization of the media, following requirements of European Union. At the end of 2008 \\"Nasha Niva\\" and \\"Narodnaya Volya\\" were allowed back to the state subscription and retail via newsstands. Soon \\"Nasha Niva\\" switched from bw to colour print, its circulation grew to 6000. However, as soon as in 2010 almost half of the July print run was confiscated and destroyed by the government. The censored issue had an article on Russian NTV documentary ‚ÄòThe Godfather‚Äô about Alexander Lukashenko which was considered a ‚Äòpropaganda strike‚Äô against the Belarusian president. In December 2010 the editors office was searched by the KGB, all office equipment had been confiscated. The searches were also done in Andrey Skurko apartment.  2010s  By 2010 the web-portal Nasha Niva became the most popular internet resource in the Belarusian language. According to statistics drawn up by Google Analytics, in 2017 monthly visitors of NN.by exceeded 600,000, more than 7,000,000 pages were viewed. Approximately 84% of the visits were from Belarus, 49% are from Minsk. In 2011, ≈πmicier Pankaviec was appointed editor of the weekly paper edition. \\"Nasha Niva\\" had circulation around 8000, 50% were distributed by subscription. On 11 April 2011, the terrorist bombing took place at a Minsk Underground. \\"Nasha Niva\\" covered the events and the aftermath. Later the publication was accused of making false statements by the Information Ministry. The editors office, private apartments of the staff were searched, the journalists were questioned the general prosecutor‚Äôs office, and the Belarusian security service, known as the KGB. \\"Nasha Niva\\" wrote that one of the victims was left in the station up to late evening, the authorities considered that information to be false and compromising. On 27 April 2011, the Ministry of Information instituted legal proceedings to close \\"Nasha Niva\\" and Narodnaya Volya newspapers. The International resonance forces the authorities to close the cases in early June. The Ministry initiated claims on administrative offences against the newspapers, both investigations ended with 14 mln Belarusian roubles fines to the publications. According to BAJ deputy director Andrej Bastuniec, since 2012 the situation with freedom of speech and media in Belarus stagnated on a very low level. In 2012 Andrej Dy≈Ñko was banned from travelling abroad, only after six formal complaints to the authorities he was excluded from the blacklist. In 2017 \\"Nasha Niva\\" became the third among most popular media in Belarus and launched Nasha Nina web project for female audiences (the title is based on a wordplay ‚Äì Nina is a female name). On 1 March 2017, chief editor Andrej Skurko resigned, his position was taken by Jahor Marcinoviƒç. Skurko remained deputy editor-in-chief. By 2018, the editors office included 12 journalists. Nasha Niva on paper was published monthly in 3000 print runs. The price of one newspaper was 2.5 Belarusian roubles.  Online newspaper  On 11 May 2016, the editors office announced that Nasha Niva will concentrate on the Internet version, while the paper one will keep publishing on a monthly basis. However, the fundraising to support the paper edition didn‚Äôt succeed. On 6 June 2018, the editors office announced the closure of paper runs and complete transfer to the web. According to \\"Nasha Niva\\" statistics, in May 2018 its web portal was visited by 475,000 unique users, 7.1 mln of pages were read. The audience mostly consisted of people of age 25-35, 60% of NN.by visitors were male. In February 2018 the website was attacked by bots, in March 2019 \\"Nasha Niva\\" social media accounts were attacked from Belarusian IP address. In June 2020 \\"Nasha Niva\\" lost its domain name nn.by to the delay in payment. According to the state‚Äôs law, the unpaid domains go up for auction on the next day after payment expiry. The newspaper continued operating at Nashaniva.by web address. The original domain was restored on 30 June 2020. Like many other independent media websites, NN.by was shut down on 8 August 2020, when the presidential elections in Belarus took place. During the anti- Lukashenko riots in Minsk \\"Nasha Niva\\" journalist Natalla ≈Åubnie«îskaja was shot with a rubber bullet by the police. Jahor Marcinoviƒç was arrested on 11 August on his way home from the protests rally in Minsk.

The lock is on the Berkshire bank between Aston and Remenham. Built by the Thames Navigation Commission in 1773, the lock is named after the village of Hambleden, a mile (1.5 km) to the north. The great weir is impressive and there are walkways over it from the lock to the small village of Mill End on the Buckinghamshire bank. Here is situated the picturesque Hambleden Mill, and the site of a Roman villa is nearby. History The mill at Hambleden is mentioned in Domesday Book, which implies there was also a weir here then. There is reference to the weir, with a winch (for pulling boats through the flash lock) in 1338. The pound lock was the fourth downstream in the series of locks built after the 1770 navigation act. The others were built of fir which had to be replaced by oak after a dozen years. In 1777 a small brick house was built and Caleb Gould became keeper. This eccentric, who baked bread for bargemen, ate a dish of onion porridge every night, wore a long coat with many buttons and walked daily to Hambleden marking a cross on the ground where he reached, was in post at the lock for 59 years and was succeeded by his son. Weir, mill and walkway at Hambleden There is reference to continuing use of the flash lock and winch at the weir until the middle of the nineteenth century. The channel downstream of the lock which takes navigation clear of the weir and weir pool was excavated in 1825. The lock was completely rebuilt in 1870 after years of complaint about its condition. In 1884 the new weirs were built and after public complaints the walkway was built to reopen the ancient right of way.Fred. S. Thacker The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs 1920 - republished 1968 David & Charles The lock was rebuilt in 1994. Access to the lock The lock can be reached from the village of Aston on the same side, after a short walk; access to the track leading to the lock is immediately to the west of the Flower Pot pub. From the opposite side the walkways across the weirs provide easy access from Mill End. Reach above the lock View downstream towards Temple Island Looking upstream from Henley Bridge The river curves round to the south, passing, on the Buckinghamshire bank, Greenlands, a large country house built in the nineteenth century which is now the home of the Henley Management College. After the turn is Temple Island, which is the start of the Henley Royal Regatta course. The regatta is rowed upstream over a wide straight course of 1 mile, 550 yards (2,112 m). On the Berkshire bank are open fields, lawns and Remenham Farm, part of the village of Remenham. The regatta lawns continue up to Henley Bridge, while the town of Henley on Thames stretches along the Oxfordshire bank. The annual Henley Festival is also held on the reach, stretching between just upstream of Hambleden village and just short of the next lock upstream from Hambleden, Marsh Lock. After Henley Bridge is the Henley river front with boat hire and a landing stage for riverboat cruises. After a small wooded island is the larger Rod Eyot, and Mill Meadows provides public open space on the Henley side of the river. The River and Rowing Museum is situated here. On the Berkshire bank the land rises steeply with a wooded escarpment hanging over Marsh Lock. Sports clubs on the reach *Upper Thames Rowing Club *Remenham Club *Leander Club *Henley Rowing Club Thames Path The Thames Path stays on the Berkshire bank to Henley Bridge, and is here in better condition for the benefit of the rowing coaches who cycle along it. It crosses Henley Bridge and continues on the Oxfordshire bank to Marsh Lock. Kayak and canoe use thumb Looking upstream from the lock Since the 1940s kayakers and canoeists have used the weir structure for recreation. In each of the four sluices a concrete ramp of about 16 deg has been fixed to the weir apron, on top of these a hinged steel plate is fixed. The hinged steel plate is adjustable between the 16 deg of the base concrete ramp and approx 28 deg. The adjustment of the steel plate is currently by pneumatic bellows installed between the plate and the concrete base. Literature and the media Jerome K Jerome wrote of \\"the rather uninteresting river residence of my newsagent - a quiet unassuming old gentleman, who may be met with about these regions, during the summer months, sculling himself along in easy vigorous style, or chatting genially to some old lock-keeper, as he passes through\\". The newsagent in question was W H Smith whose residence was Greenlands. Caleb Gould's gravestone at Remenham has the elegy > This world‚Äôs a jest, > And all things show it; > I thought so once, > And now I know it.

The college was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and had a peak enrollment of 750 students. The college closed operations at the end of July 2016 due to a significant budget shortfall and a continuing lawsuit against the federal government. History St. Catharine College traced its roots to classes held in a \\"still house\\" in the early 1800s. In 1839, the Kentucky Sisters of St. Dominic obtained a charter to grant educational degrees and a campus was built along Bardstown Road, today's U.S. Route 150. After a fire in 1904 destroyed the school's main building, the decision was made to rebuild. A statue and plaque were installed to mark the location of the original building. In 1920, the state amended the school's charter to give it the authority to found colleges and grant collegiate degrees. In 1931, the school was re-dedicated as St. Catharine College, a women's academy and junior college. The school became co-educational in 1951 and received accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1958. In late 2003, St. Catharine Junior College received approval from the United States Department of Education to begin offering four-year programs. The Richard S. Hamilton Health and Sciences Building, containing classrooms and laboratories, was completed in 2006. Aquinas Hall, an apartment-style upperclassmen residence hall, was opened in 2011. The Emily W. Hundley Library was added in 2013. Presidents The college was originally governed by the Officers of the Congregation of Dominican Sisters, with the Mother Mary Louis Logsdon, O.P. serving as the college president from 1931 to 1941. In 1957, Sister Jean Marie Calahan, O.P., who was not an officer of the congregation, became the next college president. Martha Layne Collins, who had been the first woman to serve as Governor of Kentucky, was the college's sixth president. President William D. Huston was the first male to serve as president of the college. He was followed by President Cindy Gnadinger who began serving as the college president in July 2015. Financial problems and closure The school was investigated by the federal government between 2011 and 2014 after it offered financial aid to students in its new four-year class offerings without receiving federal approval. Officials at the college claimed it was not required because the programs had not substantially changed the school's educational composition. The federal government agreed to reimburse some funding for the year 2014 but did not immediately make a decision about the prior three years. In 2015, the Department of Education placed the college on heightened cash monitoring, requiring the school to distribute financial aid to students and then apply for reimbursement. An audit uncovered \\"severe\\" findings. As a result, the Board of Trustees replaced William D. Huston, who had served 18 years as the college's president, hired a compliance director, and replaced its senior leadership team and 90% of the staff in the business and financial aid offices. In February 2016, the college sued the federal government, seeking $645,000 in reimbursement and other financial compensation. On June 1, 2016, St. Catharine announced that it would close at the end of July due to a $5 million deficit brought on by the construction of new residence halls, the health sciences building, and the new library. The college's dispute with the government over withheld student aid had resulted in enrollment declining from 600 students to 475 for the fall semester. At the time of its closing, the college offered 17 Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, one Master of Arts degree, and five Associate degree programs, along with one certificate program. It also featured the Berry Farming Program, based on the work of activist, farmer, and writer Wendell Berry; the program is currently searching for a new host. Athletics St. Catharine College offered men and women's basketball, men and women's bowling, men and women's cross-country and track and field, men and women's golf, men and women's swimming, men and women's soccer, men's baseball, women's fast pitch softball, women's volleyball and cheerleading. The college was a part of the NAIA Mid-South Conference. Gallery Image:Richard S. Hamilton Health and Science Building.jpgThe Richard S. Hamilton Health and Science Building.

She would have been overshadowed at court by the chief queens Nefertari, and later Iaret. Mutemwiya is only shown on the monuments of her son Amenhotep III. While she occasionally was identified by some researchers as a daughter of King Artatama I of Mitanni, no evidence proves that she is the same person, and nothing about her own background is known.Betsy Bryan, The Reign of Thutmose IV, (Johns Hopkins University Press: 1991), p.119 There seemed to be evidence that she was not a daughter of Artatama,Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, (Blackwell Books: 1992), p.221 but this theory has been discarded.O'Connor, David and Cline, Eric H. Amenhotep III: Perspectives on His Reign University of Michigan Press. 2001 Cyril Aldred has suggested that Mutemwiya be a sister of Yuya. He argues that since Mutemwiya was present during the early years of her son's reign, she might have engineered the marriage between Tiye and the young king to connect her family with royalty. However, this theory is poorly supported by texts or archaeological finds. Mutemwiya held many titles including God‚Äôs Wife (Hm.t-nTr), Lady of The Two Lands (nb.t-tAwy), Great King‚Äôs Wife, his beloved (Hm.t-nsw-wr.t mry.t=f), noblewoman, countess (r.t-pa.t), Great of Praises (wr.t-Hsw.t), Sweet of Love (bnr.t-mrw.t), Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (Hnw.t-rsy-mHw), and God's Mother (mwt- nTr).Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens: A Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Golden House Publications, London, 2005, The titles king's mother and god's mother amount to the same thing since the god in question was the reigning king, Amenhotep III.Betsy Bryan, Chapter 6: \\"Thutmose IV Abroad and at Home\\" in 'The Reign of Thutmose IV,' pp.113-118 All of these titles, including that of Great Royal Wife, were used only after her husband's death, during her son's reign. At the time of Amenhotep III‚Äôs accession to the throne she gained prominence as the new pharaoh's mother.Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2006, p. 114. Mutemwiya is shown in the Luxor temple, in scenes depicting the divine birth of her son Amenhotep III. The scenes resemble (and in some cases copy) scenes of the divine birth of Hatshepsut in Deir el-Bahari. Hatshepsut had used the birth story to reinforce her claims to the throne. Amenhotep was the son of a ruling Pharaoh and it seems that the birth scene is used to stress the semi-divine nature of Amenhotep III. In a key scene Mutemwiya is shown seated on a bed receiving the god Amun who had taken the form of her husband Thutmosis IV. They are in the presence of the goddesses Selket and Neith. The scenes show Amenhotep III to be the result of the union of his mother with the god Amun himself. A pregnant queen Mutemwiya as later shown being led to the birthing room by Isis and Khnum.Aldred, Cyril, Akhenaten: King of Egypt ,Thames and Hudson, 1991 (paperback). A partial granite statue representing Mutemwiya was found in Karnak and it now is in the collection of the British Museum. The statue takes the form of a rebus showing the goddess Mut seated in a barque, thereby forming her name. Mutemwiya is named in the inscription on the side of the barque.Quirke, Stephen and Spencer, Jeffrey, The British Museum Book of Ancient Egypt, Thames and Hudson, 1992, p 78. Along with her daughter-in-law, Tiye, she also is shown on the Colossi of Memnon erected by Amenhotep III.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), pp. 132-141.  Death  The date of Mutemwiya's death is unknown, but she is believed to have survived long into her son's reign. The evidence for that is her presence among the sculptures of the Colossi of Memnon, which was built well into his reign, as well as a mention of her estate on a wine-jar label found in Amenhotep III's Malkata palace in Thebes.

Seaman worked in the Israeli civil service for 31 years (1983-2014) and is currently English language editor at Mida, an online conservative Israeli current affairs and opinion magazine. Between 2000-2010, he served as the director of the Israeli Government Press Office (GPO), part of the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem responsible for the foreign media contingent in Israel. His last public position was Deputy Director General for Information at the Israeli Ministry of Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs where his outspoken views were often seen as controversial. In August 2013, Seaman was suspended from his government position as Director of Interactive Media because of comments he made in a private Facebook posting about Japanese commemorating the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Palestinians commemorating the Nakba. Seaman was the bureau chief of Voice of Israel, a private Israeli English-language news and talk internet radio station that existed from 2014 to 2015. Seaman hosted In The Lions' Den with Daniel Seaman and Daniela Traub interviewing such guests as Dr. Einat Wilf, Zvi Yehezkeli, Ehud Gol, Col. Richard Kemp, Dr. Joy Browne, Bassem Eid and other political and media figures. Biography Seaman was born on a US Air Force base in Germany, the son of an American father and a mother born in Israel. His family moved from the United States to Israel in 1971 and settled in the port city of Ashkelon. He enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces serving in an elite paratroop unit in 1979 and is a veteran of the 1982 Lebanon War. Between 1983 and 1989 he was employed by the Israeli consulate in New York City. While there he completed a BA in political science, with honors, at the City University of New York's Hunter College. Seaman served as an adviser and spokesperson to the governments of six prime ministers: Yitzhak Shamir, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Ehud Barak. Seaman was directly responsible for coordinating the press coverage of several heads of states visits to Israel including US President Bill Clinton, British prime minister Tony Blair, Canadian prime minister Jean Chr√©tien, Australian prime minister John Howard, Jordan's King Hussein and Chinese president Jiang Zemin. He was a member of the Israeli press delegation to the Aqaba peace talks (see Road map for peace, Red Sea Summit in Aqaba, Jordan, June 4, 2003). Seaman received the Israel Outstanding Civil Service Award in 2000 for coordinating the international press coverage of Pope John Paul II's visit to the Holy Land in March 2000. Seaman was appointed as acting director of the Government Press Office (GPO) in December 2000 and worked with thousands of foreign journalists who covered news events in Israel and the Palestinian territories until 2010. He had worked for the GPO for several years and was the first civil servant promoted to directorship of the GPO after a period of 30 years. During his tenure as GPO director he implemented several measures that improved working conditions for foreign journalists in Israel. This notwithstanding, there were numerous complaints about his treatment of journalists unsympathetic to Israeli policies (see Controversies below). He took a leave of absence from his post in November 2008 and announced his candidacy in the Likud party primaries for the 18th Knesset, but withdrew his candidacy. Seaman lectures on Israeli and Middle-Eastern affairs and appeared on dozens of international news media outlets. Views and opinions Seaman is said to have observed the a dramatic intensification of public diplomacy in coverage of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, what interviewers have called \\"cognitive warfare\\" waged in a \\"battlefront of perceptions\\", in which Israel must handle a \\"global media battle\\". Israel is, he adds, suffering \\"strategic damage\\" from this area. In this, he sees the media as \\"agenda-driven\\" concerning the Palestinian narrative and Palestinian society highly mobilized, and these two elements cause Israel's image to suffer in international reportage. The problem is, he argues, that the Arab world fails to maintain journalistic standards accepted in the West, and in waging their media war insult the free press tradition which, he affirms, Israel upholds. Critics claim that his demand for stricter standards is damaging media relations.Ron Schleifer, Jessica Snapper, Advocating Propaganda ‚Äì Viewpoints from Israel: Social Media, Public Diplomacy, Foreign Affairs, Military Psychology, and Religious Persuasion Perspectives, Sussex Academic Press, 2015 PP.57-63 Regarding journalists involved in covering the conflict he has stated: > I don't work with journalists directly anymore and it's a huge relief. They > disregard the laws of the country, they don't respect boundaries in Israel > in ways they wouldn't dare in other countries. . They're insulted when they > have to go through regular security checks like everyone else .. and > sometimes the journalists knowingly assist enemies of the state. Journalists must prove their credentials. Activists, he says, should not be described as something they are not, journalists. Israelis when hurt return to a normal life quickly, whereas Palestinians exploit their tragedies as weapons in a media battle. The effect is to impress world opinion with the idea that Palestinians suffer more than do Israelis. The Israeli media also have problems, with, he calculates, 90% of media reflecting what is only 5% of Israeli public opinion. He is critical of the vocal exposure of the multiplicity of voices in Israel in lieu of a \\"centralization across all sectors\\" that would permit Israel to deploy a formidable \\"unified force of opinion\\". In Operation Cast Lead, Israel blocked foreign journalists from entering the Gaza Strip to report on the war. This raised an outcry of protest, with UNWRA claiming that failure of access by journalists hindered a truthful representation of what was occurring. The reason given by the Israeli government for its ban was that international correspondents would be endangered there, and that to protect them, Israel would have to divert resources towards their protection better spent on fighting Hamas. Seaman was quoted on CNN as saying that Israel had learnt a lesson from its war with Hezbollah in Lebanon earlier in 2006:'There was too much exposure, it had an effect on our ability to achieve strategic goals', a declaration taken to indicate the real rationale behind the government's ban.Ivor Gaber and Lisa Thomas, 'Is the BBC Biased? The Corporationa and the Coverage of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War', in Heather Savigny, Dr Lee Marsden eds.,Media, Religion and Conflict, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013 pp.39-57 pp.39-40. Seaman was also quoted by The New York Times's Ethan Bronner as arguing: 'Any journalist who enters Gaza becomes a fig leaf and front for the Hamas terror organization, and I see no reason we should help that.'Amahl Bishara, 'The Geopolitics of Press Freedoms in the Israeli-Palestinian Context', in Lena Jayyusi, Anne Sofie Roald (eds.), Media and Political Contestation in the Contemporary Arab World: A Decade of Change, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016 pp.161-185 p.177. The Goldstone Report on the war added that Seaman also expressed the view that foreign correspondents lacked professionalism and took \\"questionable reports at face value without checking\\".Adam Horowitz, Lizzy Ratner, Philip Weiss (eds.)The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict, Nation Books, 2011 p.285. In May 2018, during an interview to the Israeli news channel i24 News Seaman stated that \\"I am an Islamophobe. Because we have lived here long enough to know what they are capable of doing\\". Controversies Conflicts with journalists As the director of the GPO, Seaman came under criticism for not issuing journalists with Israeli press cards. Additionally, he was accused by one journalist of becoming aggressive, abusive and using foul language against journalists he considered hostile and unfair towards Israel. Such journalists included Israeli mainstream media employees such as Atta Awisat, a veteran staff photographer at Yedioth Ahronoth, then the largest newspaper in Israel, allegedly due to clearance issues with the security agencies.http://b.walla.co.il/item/1411702 Seaman did not deny using this type of policy towards blatantly anti-Israeli media outlets: > I can make journalists' lives more difficult. There are certain guidelines > that allow me to do that. Such as with the case of [Swedish newspaper] > Aftonbladet, and their despicable anti-Semitic [...] report on the IDF > [purportedly] abducting Palestinians and using their body organs. We didn't > prevent Aftonbladet from working here. We just took our time. To this day, > the correspondents from Aftonbladet do not get a press card immediately. We > can take up to 90 days and we can take longer... Another journalist who became the target of Seaman's contempt was J√∂rg Bremer, a 15-year veteran of the press corps in Jerusalem, who worked as the correspondent of the right-liberal German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. In his case, he was denied not the renewal of his press card, but the extension of his residence visa. For calling this measure a political way of keeping unwanted journalist at bay and for asking for the German government's support, Bremer was described by Seaman in a newspaper interview as \\"an idiot,\\" \\"a piece of shit\\" and \\"a miserable liar.\\" Bremer said in response that \\"Seaman wants journalists to lick his feet. He gets enjoyment from the situation, and uses his power instead of helping. It is harmful to Israel.\\" On 11 March 2007, Haaretz reported that the Israeli Civil Service Commission was investigating foreign journalists' accusations that Government Press Office director Daniel Seaman has treated them improperly and enforced the procedures for receiving a press pass in an inequitable manner. In August 2013, Haaretz accused him of having \\"gained a reputation for his confrontations with foreign correspondents and for the complaints they lodged against him\\" and called him \\"an abusive racist.\\" The article, included selected quotes from Seaman's personal Facebook page. Seaman was admonished by the government, which distanced itself from his views and then suspended him from his position as Director of Interactive Media because of offensive, racist comments. Comments against Japanese nuclear victim commemorations > I am sick of the Japanese, 'Human Rights' and 'Peace' groups the world over > holding their annual self-righteous commemorations for the Hiroshima and > Nagasaki victims. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the consequence of Japanese > aggression. You reap what you sow. Instead, they should be commemorating the > estimated 50 million Chinese, Korean, Filipino, Malay, Vietnamese, > Cambodian, Indonesian, Burmese and other victims of Japanese imperial > aggression and genocide. The statement, posted on Seaman's personal Facebook page, lead to a rebuke from the Japanese government and an official Israeli apology. Editorials in Tablet and Israel National News called Seaman's suspension over the incident \\"misguided.\\" Anti-Palestinian online postings ‚Äî The Palestinians' 65-second siren commemorating the Nakba is \\"not nearly enough time to stop and pause to think about how stupid they are.\\" ‚Äî \\"Is there a diplomatic way of saying 'Go F*** yourself'?\\" - Facebook posting, 26 May 2013, in response to conditions for the renewal of peace talks set by Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. ‚Äî Similarly, he wondered whether Muslims \\"stop eating each other\\" during Ramadan. Media and book coverage * Seaman is mentioned extensively in Stephanie Gutmann's book The Other War‚ÄîIsraelis, Palestinians and the Struggle for Media Supremacy(October 2005). Chapter 10, \\"His Own Private Jihad,\\" is specifically about his efforts to curb Palestinian influence on the media coverage. * Media, Religion and Conflict by Heather Savigny, states, \\"Daniel Seaman, the Director of the Israeli Government Press Office, commenting on the international television coverage of the 2006 Israel- Hezbollah war, was quoted by CNN as saying: \\"There was too much exposure, it had an effect on our ability to achieve strategic goals, so that's one of the lessons we learned from the war in Lebanon.\\" * Intifada: Palestine and Israel - The Long Day of Rage by David Pratt quotes Seaman as saying, Israel would not \\"...behave just to be liked by the Europeans or lay down and play dead. We are going to defend ourselves,' he continued. \\"Seaman pulled no punches and called it as he saw it, berating whatever country or organization he felt 'appeased Palestinian terrorism.' He even included the United Nations Palestinian relief agency UNWRA, accusing it of turning a blind eye to weapons stored in its food warehouses. \\"So I'm asking you, what are these organizations doing when they criticise Israel?

In recent years, Hackney Road has begun to experience the gentrification of nearby Columbia Road or Broadway Market. Despite this, a number of derelict buildings still remain, including the empty Children's Hospital. Completing the picture are striptease venues such as Browns and The Olde Axe (Clifton 2002), a bingo hall, fast-food outlets and building sites. However, there is a city farm, which brings a touch of the pastoral to this particularly urban area. Hackney City Farm is located at the junction of (intersection with) Goldsmith's Row on the northern (Hackney) side of the road. Next to the farm is Haggerston Park. In 2008 a 178-room Days Hotel London Shoreditch opened at the junction with Pritchard's Road. This has since become the RE Hotel London Shoreditch.

It is 40 kilometres long (24 miles); 36 kilometres (22 miles) of it being dedicated high speed tracks.It was scheduled for completion by 2005 and opened in 2009. Together with the HSL 1 to the French border and HSL-Zuid to Amsterdam, the line has shortened journeys between Brussels, Paris and the Netherlands. HSL 4 is used by Thalys trains, Eurostar e320 trains and fast internal InterCity trains (Class 13 locomotives with I11 vehicles). It was used by Fyra until the cancellation of the service. It is also tentatively planned to be used by DB Baureihe 407 trains. Route The high-speed HSL 4 begins just north of Antwerp (near Luchtbal), and runs 36 km where it meets the Dutch border.  From Brussels to Antwerp  Though HSL4 begins in Antwerp, it is part of a Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam corridor. High speed trains like Thalys, upon departing Brussels for Amsterdam, first use the existing, conventional track, electrified at 3 kV DC. From Brussels South station, trains travel northwards through the Brussels-Central and Brussels-North stations. At Schaarbeek the line splits in two; the eastern branch continues to Li√®ge and the German border, the northern branch towards Antwerp and the Dutch border. Between Brussels and Antwerp (47 kilometres), trains travel at 160 kilometres per hour on line 25N and then the upgraded existing line 25 (with the exception of a few segments where a speed limit of 100‚Äì120 km/h is imposed).  From Antwerp north  In Antwerp, a tunnel has been constructed underneath the city to permit high-speed trains to run directly through Antwerpen-Centraal to the new high-speed line north, an extension of line 25 until Luchtbal station, after which line 4 (HSL 4) starts. Trains enter the 1.5-kilometre long, two-tube tunnel past Berchem at 90 kilometres per hour. They exit the tunnel at 40 km/hour, it seems due to stability and infiltration concerns. The line surfaces at Antwerpen-Dam as line 25, and after crossing the Albert Canal, crosses the existing Antwerp-Essen line at 120 km/h. At the E19/A12 motorway junction, trains leave the regular line to run on new dedicated high-speed tracks to the Dutch border (40 kilometres away) at up to 300 kilometres per hour. The route parallels the E19 motorway until the border, which has required the building of several bridges. The line passes through Schoten, Brasschaat, Brecht, Wuustwezel, and Hoogstraten, before crossing the border into the Netherlands and connecting to the Dutch HSL-Zuid. Stations Antwerpen-Centraal station has been completely reorganised. A tunnel has been constructed to permit the passage of trains under the city, additionally creating a subterranean junction between Berchem station and Antwerpen-Dam station, passing through Antwerpen-Centraal. With these works completed, the station has four levels and 14 tracks: *level +1 (the original station) has 6 terminating tracks, arranged as two groups of three and separated by an opening allowing natural light to reach the lower levels *level 0 contains ticketing facilities and commercial space *level ‚àí1 (7 meters below road level) has 4 terminating tracks, also arranged as two groups *level ‚àí2 (18 meters below road level) has 4 tracks, which end up in the two-track-wide tunnel under the city (used by high-speed trains and fast InterCity services) The HSL 4 is the only high-speed line in Belgium that features an intermediate station at Noorderkempen (Brecht) for use in regular speed passenger service.  Tunnel Peerdsbos ('Solar Tunnel')  The line features a 'Solar Tunnel' near Antwerp. The above-ground tunnel Peerdsbos is comparable to an avalanche gallery except instead of snow it protects the trains from falling trees and the highway traffic on the E19. It was constructed as an alternative to felling parts of the nearby forest. The 'tunnel' is unique as it is covered with 16,000 solar panels. The line's operator claim this provides 3300 MWh of electricity per year and cuts CO2 emissions by 2400 tonnes a year.Europe‚Äôs first ‚Äúgreen‚Äù train leaves the station thanks to Belgium‚Äôs Solar Tunnel June 6, 2011 See also * High-speed rail in Belgium External links *Belgian high-speed rail site References Category:High-speed railway lines in Belgium Category:Railway lines opened in 2009 Category:Standard gauge railways in Belgium ","title":"HSL 4"},{"id":"4285347","text":"Puck railway station is a railway station serving the town of Puck, in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland.

In the early 21st century, some 760 day schools teach more than 250,000 children. Torah Umesorah have established yeshivas and kollelim in every city with a significant population of Jews. Rabbi Joshua Fishman served from 1980 as executive vice-president until his retirement in June 2007. The current Menahel (\\"principal\\") or national director, is Rabbi David Nojowitz.Josh Nathan-Kazis, \\"Why Did a Jewish Schools Charity Loan $2.3M to Failing Hedge Fund?\\", Forward, 14 September 2016; accessed 26 September 2016 History Torah Umesorah, the National Society for Hebrew Day Schools, was the first national Jewish organization in the United States to pioneer Jewish day schools in this country. It started to develop these in 1944, during World War II and at a time when the United States was at war with the Axis Powers and Europe's Jews were being consumed by the Nazi genocide of the Holocaust. Challenging the prevailing mood of the times, Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz and other rabbis founded Torah Umesorah to develop a network of Jewish day schools across North America. Rabbi Mendlowitz was born in Hungary and was then serving as the head of the Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in Brooklyn, New York. He selected Dr. Joseph Kaminetsky in 1945 as the first full-time Director; Kaminetsky was given the mandate to fulfill the vision of the founding rabbis. He served until 1980, overseeing the establishment of Orthodox day schools at hundreds of sites across the country; he is considered the most influential leader of Torah Umesorah. He had a doctorate from Columbia Teachers College.Jonathan Rosenblum, \\"Dr. Joe, we owe you (Tribute to Dr. Joe Kaminetsky)\\", Jerusalem Post, 26 March 1999; via Jewish Media Resources; accessed 26 September 2016 In 1944 there were few Orthodox Jewish day schools in the United States, let alone authentic yeshivas or Beis Yaakov schools. and most were in New York, e.g. RJJ, Torah Vodaas, Chaim Berlin The afternoon/Talmud Torah system was deemed \\"failing to transmit Yiddishkeit in a compelling manner to students who arrived tired in the afternoons and were constantly subjected to assimilationist influences in American culture.\\" By the end of the twentieth century, Torah Umesorah had developed more than 600 yeshivas and day schools in the United States and Canada, enrolling more than 170,000 Jewish students.a few years later: \\"about 200,000 are presently enrolled in some 900 Jewish day schools\\" \\"an in between count was 760 schools The organization's motto is \\"the children are the future,\\" or in Hebrew, ◊ô◊© ◊¢◊™◊ô◊ì. Planning Torah Umesorah The founders of Torah Umesorah wanted to establish a different model of education. At the time, Jewish parents generally sent their children to non-sectarian public schools during the day. In the afternoons or on Sundays they would send the children to Cheder or Talmud Torah-type Jewish-run schools for religious training, as had been the tradition in Europe. Parents feared that in North America, this approach was failing to transmit Judaism in a compelling and lasting manner. Students went to Jewish classes when tired in the afternoons. They were subject to the secularizing forces in their mixed communities, encountering the larger American society and culture in public school, on the street, and at home. There were only four or five Jewish day schools outside New York City. The rabbis intended their new school system to have a dual-curriculum: Jewish day schools would provide a Judaic (Jewish or Torah religious) education for half the day and a good secular education in classical subjects, all in one building or complex. They planned for each new school to be guided by an ordained rabbi who would serve as the headmaster or principal. He would recruit a \\"general studies\\" associate principal (also known as the \\"English principal\\"), preferably someone who was also loyal to the traditions of Judaism. The associate would recruit, assist, supervise and guide the teachers who would teach the secular subjects generally taught in the public schools. Post-war conditions American Jews were shocked as they learned the overwhelming scale of Jewish deaths due to the Holocaust of World War II; six million Jews had been killed, and the great European Jewish communities and Torah centers destroyed. Many American Jews had lost relatives in Europe. In addition, more than half a million United States Jews had served in the US armed forces; some participated in the liberation of the concentration camps, or worked with the millions of displaced people in camps after the war, including Jews trying to find out if any of their families had survived. Many American Jews were sympathetic to the rabbis' appeals to ensure a moderate Jewish education for their children, at least until the Bar Mitzvah age (12-13). In addition, most Jews in the United States felt pride when the new State of Israel was established, due in part to fierce fighting by the many European Zionist Jews who had immigrated there when it was Mandate Palestine. The United States was the first nation to officially recognize the new Jewish state. With a renewed commitment to Judaism, American Jews wanted to ensure that their children learned the Hebrew language, connected with the core of Judaism and religious studies, and had the opportunity to learn secular subjects at a high level. The new Jewish days schools were believed to be a means to accomplish the new goals of all-day Jewish schooling‚Äîor, all-day schooling under Jewish religious auspices. Parents believed that having their children study in the Cheders and Talmud Torahs had failed to gain their commitment to Judaism and practicing as religious adults. After Torah Umesorah was established, and its affiliated schools were attracting students, the parents of its students were encouraged to enroll them in Jewish high schools, to maintain students' commitment to Judaism. Transferring Jewish students to public high schools in adolescence was considered a risk, as they were subject to many outside influences. Other Orthodox efforts In the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, particularly in many areas of Brooklyn, various Hasidic and Haredi groups (such as Satmar, Bobov, Vizhnitz and many others) also attracted many new supporters for yeshiva education, which was more intensively Torah-based than the Jewish day school model being promoted by Torah Umesorah. Notable was Merkos L'inyonei Chinuch, which was founded in 1942 by Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the United States in the postwar years were often strong supporters of the Orthodox Jewish day schools. They wanted their children to identify as Jews and practice the religion so that it could continue. For instance, the Lithuanian Mir yeshiva had no wish to emulate the educational goals of secular (Jewish) society. They sent their children of high school age to yeshivas (for the boys) and Beis Yaakovs (for the girls); most of the curriculum was devoted entirely to Talmud and rabbinical literature (for the boys) and study of Tanakh and Jewish laws and customs (for the girls). These were combined with fervent Jewish worship. The new institutions thrived in their own right and mostly followed the guidelines of their own rosh yeshivas and rebbes. Late 20th century to present As noted, Dr. Joe Kaminetsky served from 1945 until 1980 as operational head of Torah Umesorah. In 1945 when there were few Jewish day schools outside New York City. In 1946 New York had an estimated 7,000 students in 27 yeshivos of various sizes, and there was one yeshiva in each of Baltimore, Chicago, and Jersey City. By the time of his death in 1999, Kaminetsky had set up hundreds of Jewish day schools across the country, in which 160,000 children were enrolled. Rabbi Joshua Fishman succeeded Kaminetsky, and served as executive vice-president until retiring in June 2007. He was a disciple of Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner (1906‚Äì1980), who was among the leaders of Agudath Israel of America. The current Menahel (\\"principal\\") or national director, is Rabbi David Nojowitz. He returned to the United States to take this position after having served as Rosh Kollel in Melbourne, Australia, for 25 years. In 2008 Torah Umesorah had an annual budget of $39 million; this was \\"the last year for which it made its tax documents public.\\" Toward the latter part of the twentieth century, Torah Umesorah officials found that teachers and rabbis from the Haredi and Hasidic schools were consulting with its staff for training to improve classroom management, enhance classroom discipline and learn up-to-date teaching skills and techniques which they often did not receive during yeshiva training. They began to set up regular classes for training of teachers and principals. Torah Umesorah has worked to find funding to establish kollelim (\\"post-graduate\\" Talmudic schools) in any community that is willing to set up the infrastructure and host such efforts. Some young rabbis and rebbetzins (their wives) have taken full- and part-time positions as Jewish educators in the local day schools. They also frequently serve in local Orthodox synagogues as \\"pulpit rabbis.\\" In some instances they have founded new Jewish day schools and synagogues of their own. Relationship with Modern Orthodox groups By the 1980s and 1990s, some Modern Orthodox communities pushed to establish day school-type Jewish high schools. However, Torah Umesorah's rabbinical board of advisers, who are also the core of the Haredi Agudath Israel of America rabbinic leadership, do not condone coeducation beyond the beginning of adolescence (or earlier). Although most Jewish day schools have both boys and girls as students, with some, but not all, classes conducted separately, the rabbis did not approve of co-ed high schools. The rabbis and the rosh yeshivas prefer that boys who graduate eighth grade continue in all-male traditional yeshivas (\\"Talmudical academies\\") and girls study at Beis Yaakov (\\"Beth Jacob\\") type schools. Modern Orthodox schools are served by Prizmah (which also services Community, Conservative and Reform day schools) and the Torah Educators Network (which also services yeshivish schools). Partners in Torah Under the guidance of Rabbi Eli Gewirtz, Torah Umesorah began a new initiative to promote Jewish adult education. Partners in Torah matches Jewish men and women across the globe who want to study Jewish text or to know more about their heritage with a compatible study partners for up to an hour a week of interactive study by phone or Skype and, if possible, in person. By 2009, the international Partners in Torah had more than 30,000 members, as documented in their new book,Gewirtz, Eli (2009). Partners in Torah, Partners in Eternity: The Personal Stories, the Life-changing Encounters , Targum Press. released in 2009. By July 2017 it had connected over 72,000 Jewish adults for weekly study. Project SEED Under Project SEED, yeshiva students (boys and girls in their teens and early 20s) are recruited and sent on two to six-week summer trips to distant smaller Jewish communities, where they teach classes or supervise children in summer day-camps. These may or not be accredited by a third party association, such as the Western Association of Independent Camps or the American Camping Association. The counselors provide Torah-oriented experience in an environment where they and the campers are strictly separated by gender. Project SEED pays most yeshiva students a stipend to defray much (but not all) of the cost of their stay at their destination, air-fare, room and board, trips and other transportation.

The term featural was introduced by Geoffrey Sampson to describe the Korean alphabet and Pitman shorthand. Joe Martin introduced the term featural notation to describe writing systems that include symbols to represent individual features rather than phonemes. He asserts that \\"alphabets have no symbols for anything smaller than a phoneme\\". A featural script represents finer detail than an alphabet. Here, symbols do not represent whole phonemes, but rather the elements (features) that make up the phonemes, such as voicing or its place of articulation. Theoretically, each feature could be written with a separate letter; abjads or abugidas, or indeed syllabaries, could be featural, but the only prominent system of this sort is the Korean alphabet, also known as hangul. In the Korean alphabet, the featural symbols are combined into alphabetic letters, and these letters are in turn joined into syllabic blocks, so the system combines three levels of phonological representation. Some scholars (e.g. John DeFrancis) reject this class or at least labeling the Korean alphabet as such. The Korean script is called by Daniels a \\"sophisticated grammatogeny\\". Others include stenographies and constructed scripts of hobbyists and fiction writers (such as Tengwar), many of which feature advanced graphic designs corresponding to phonologic properties. The basic unit of writing in these systems can map to anything from phonemes to words. It has been shown that even the Latin script has sub- character \\"features\\".See .

Many languages written in the Latin alphabet make use of diacritics, and those letters using diacritics are sometimes considered separate letters within the language's alphabet. The Polish alphabet, for example, indicates a palatal articulation of some consonants with an acute accent. The Turkish alphabet uses the presence of one or two dots above a vowel to indicate that it is a front vowel. The Japanese kana syllabaries indicate voiced consonants with marks known as dakuten. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) also has some featural elements, for example in the hooks and tails that are characteristic of implosives, , and retroflex consonants, . The IPA diacritics are also featural. The Fraser alphabet used for Lisu rotates the letters for the tenuis consonants Íìë , Íìî , Íìù , Íìö , and Íìó 180¬∞ to indicate aspiration.

Biography  In collaboration with other left communists such as Fran√ßois Martin and Karl Nesic, Dauv√© has attempted to fuse, critique, and develop different left communist currents, most notably the Italian movement associated with Amadeo Bordiga (and its heretical journal Invariance), German-Dutch council communism, and the French perspectives associated with Socialisme ou Barbarie and the Situationist International.\\"The text surveys the Italian and German lefts, Socialisme Ou Barbarie and the Situationist International and describes the theoretical development of the French ultra-left.\\"Re-collecting our past - La Banquise He has focused on theoretical discussions of economic issues concerning the controversial failure of Second International, Marxism (including both Social Democracy and Leninist Communism), the global revolutionary upsurge of the 1960s and its subsequent dissolution, and on developments in global capitalist accumulation and class struggle. Among English-speaking communists and anarchists, Dauv√© is best known for his Eclipse and Re-emergence of the Communist Movement, first published by Black & Red Press (Detroit, Michigan) in 1974 and Critique of the Situationist International, first published in Red Eye, Berkeley, California. An essay from the first pamphlet, and the whole of the second article, were reprinted by Unpopular Books in London as What is Communism (1983) and What is Situationism respectively, in 1987. The first pamphlet was reprinted with a new foreword in 1997 by Antagonism (London). It includes Dauv√©'s own translations of two of his articles and one by Fran√ßois Martin, both originally published in (Paris: Champ Libre, 1972). These articles develop Bordiga's critique of Second International productivism in light of Marx's writings on formal and real subsumption and the global uprisings of 1968, and theory of communization by drawing on council communist and Situationist traditions. Dauv√© also participated in the journal La Banquise, which he edited with Karl Nesic and others from 1983 to 1986. This sought to develop the new communist program suggested in Le Mouvement Communiste through a critical appraisal of post-1968 radical politics, including Situationist and autonomist experiments. It also developed the theory of society's real subsumption into capital. The editors describe their aims and influences in (La Banquise, 2, 1983). More recently, Dauv√©, along with Nesic and others, has published the irregular journal Troploin, featuring articles on the collapse of both Leninist and Keynesian regimes of accumulation and the transition to \\"globalized\\" neoliberal expansion, the Middle Eastern conflicts, September 11, and the rhetoric and logic of the War on Terrorism. Many have been translated into English by Dauv√© himself and are archived on the Troploin website.

He is a professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and one of contemporary epistemology's most prominent proponents of naturalized epistemology. Biography Kornblith received his B.A. from State University of New York at Buffalo in 1975 and his PhD from Cornell University in 1980, where he studied under Sydney Shoemaker and Richard Boyd. Before coming to University of Massachusetts in 2003, Kornblith taught at the University of Vermont, where he also chaired the department from 1991 to 1997. His research interests include epistemology, metaphysics and the philosophy of mind. Apart from naturalized epistemology, his most recent work includes the role of intuitions in philosophical theorizing, the conflicts between internalism and externalism in epistemology, and the mental states of non-human animals. Naturalistic account of inductive inference In his 1993 book Inductive Inference and Its Natural Ground (MIT Press, 1993) Kornblith argues that inductive knowledge is possible by virtue of a fit between our innate psychological capacities and the causal structure of the world. Following Boyd, Kornblith takes the causal structure in question to be a structure of natural kinds, i.e., of homeostatically clustered properties. Such natural kinds provide a natural ground for inductive inference by virtue of the fact that our innate inferential tendencies (as revealed by empirical psychology) are structured in a way that assumes a world of natural kinds, and, thereby, tend to provide us with accurate beliefs about the world in an environment populated by such natural kinds. Knowledge as a natural kind Kornblith is perhaps most well known for his defense of the view that knowledge is a natural kind. This claim is defended in his book Knowledge and its Place in Nature (Oxford University Press, 2002) where Kornblith argues that knowledge, as it is being studied in cognitive ethology, is a sufficiently robust and inductively valuable category to qualify as a natural kind. Consequently, he claims, the proper method for epistemology is empirical, contrary to what has been assumed by most epistemologists, who traditionally have proceeded by way of conceptual analysis and the probing of intuitions rather than by way of empirical investigation. Against conceptual analysis Kornblith's case for knowledge as a natural kind provides the basis for his critique of philosophy as conceptual analysis. According to Kornblith, the proper object of philosophical analysis is not concepts, but the phenomena picked out by those concepts. At the same time, Kornblith's work in semantics indicates that his claims about conceptual analysis can, in fact, be motivated independently of his view on knowledge as a natural kind. In particular, he has argued that semantic externalism provides the correct semantics not only for natural kinds but also for artifactual kinds ‚Äî a claim that, if true, would lend plausibility to the idea that empirical investigation provides a promising philosophical method, quite independently of whether or not a majority of the objects of philosophical inquiry turn out to be natural kinds.

In 2010, Von Westphalen was the first signatory to the Aktion Linkstrend stoppen, which opposed the Berlin Declaration of the Christian Democratic Union's leadership to change economic positions. She accused the German Catholic Scouting Association of Saint George of allowing alcohol and promoting the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, which she called \\"propaganda from the gay lobby\\". She signed the Marburger Declaration of 2009, for the \\"freedom and self-determination against totalitarian aspirations of the Lesbian and Gay Associations\\". She considered homosexuality as a \\"considerable health and psychological risk\\", and accused the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany of attacking conversion therapy, which she believed limited the \\"freedom of assembly, speech, scientific discourse, and the choice of therapy.\\"  Awards and honors  In 2002, Von Westphalen was created a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II. She was made a Dame of Honor and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. She was awarded the Federal Cross of the Order of Merit by the German federal government.  Personal life  Schloss Laer Von Westphalen was married to Count August von Westphalen zu F√ºrstenberg and had six children. She lived with her family in her husband's family home, Schloss Laer, in Meschede. After the death of her mother in 1992, Von Westphalen encouraged her father to allow the Catholic congregation Servants of Jesus and Mary to use the family castle, Haus Assen. Von Westphalen died on 21 January 2016 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

Strinda had been built in 1955, and later building another school right next to it was then a completely new concept. The two schools were at that time in the former municipality of Strinda. History Blussuvoll was built in 1958 when the municipality of Strinda decided to allow the students to study for eight years and even a non-mandatory ninth year (at the time the lower secondary schools educated 7.-9. Grade). In 1963 the school was largely expanded, with two new wings to the south, and therefore created an irregular schoolyard only open to the south, and one can say the strected design of the school complicates communication between the three wings. The whole school is built in two storeys above ground and with a basement. Materials used is white, brushed chalk on the walls and red brick on the roof (Strinda is built in the similar materials, thus giving the area a unified look). Until 2006 most of the facades were still standing, receiving both scepticism (as the facade was getting really old) and enthusiasm (as it was an un-touched monument of 1950s school design). In the winter of 2005/06, the whole school was torn to give way to a completely new construction, as the whole building suffered from rust, mold and generally poor condition on furniture, walls and equipment. Students then attended the barracks at Persaunet. The new school building was completed in fall 2007.

G√≥mez D√°vila's fame began to spread only in the last few years before his death, particularly by way of German translations of his works. He was one of the most radical critics of modernity whose work consists almost entirely of aphorisms which he called \\"escolios\\" (\\"glosses\\").  Biography  G√≥mez D√°vila was a Colombian scholar who spent most of his life in the circle of his friends and within the confines of his library. He belonged to the upper circles of Colombian society and was educated in Paris. Due to severe pneumonia, he spent about two years at home where he was taught by private teachers and developed a lifelong love of classical literature. He never, however, attended a university. In the 1930s he went back from Paris to Colombia, never to visit Europe again, except for a six-month stay with his wife in 1948. He built up an immense library containing more than 30,000 volumes around which his literary existence centred. In 1948 he helped found the Los Andes University in Bogot√°. In 1954, G√≥mez D√°vila's first volume of works was published by his brother, a compilation of notes and aphorisms under the title Notas I ‚Äì the second volume of which never appeared. The book remained virtually unknown because only 100 copies were printed and these were presented as gifts to his friends. In 1959, he followed this with a small book of essays under the title of Textos I (again, no second volume was published). These essays develop basic concepts of his philosophical anthropology as well as his philosophy of history, often in literary language full of metaphors. In these essays, he first voices his intention to create a \\"reactionary patchwork\\" because reality, he said, cannot be represented in a philosophical system. After the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1958 G√≥mez D√°vila was offered the post of chief advisor to the state president which he rejected as he did with respect to later offers, in 1974, to become ambassador in London. Though he supported the later president Alberto Lleras Camargo's role in bringing down the dictatorship, he refrained from any political activity himself, a decision he had already reached early on in his practice as a writer. From this decision resulted his strong criticism not only of left-wing but also of right-wing and conservative political practices, even though his explicitly reactionary principles show some similarities to conservative viewpoints. His skeptical anthropology was based on a close study of Thucydides and Jacob Burckhardt as well as his affirmation of hierarchical structures of order on society, state and church. G√≥mez D√°vila emphatically criticised the concept of the sovereignty of the people as an illegitimate divinisation of man and a rejection of the sovereignty of God. He was likewise deeply critical of the Second Vatican Council which he saw as a problematic adaptation to the world. He particularly deplored the destruction of the Latin liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church in the wake of the Council. Similar to Juan Donoso Cort√©s, G√≥mez D√°vila believed that all political errors ultimately resulted from theological errors. That is why his thought can be described as a form of political theology. The modern ideologies such as (American) liberalism, democracy, and socialism, are the main targets of G√≥mez D√°vila's criticism, because the world influenced by these ideologies appeared to him decadent and corrupt. G√≥mez D√°vila discussed a vast range of topics, philosophical and theological questions, problems of literature, art, and aesthetics, philosophy of history and the writing of history. He employed a literary method of succinct statements with a great sensibility for matters of style and tone. The literary method he developed to perfection is the gloss, the scholion, which he used to comment on the world, particularly in the five volumes of Escolios a un texto impl√≠cito (1977; 1986; 1992) that he published from the seventies to the nineties. He created \\"the reactionary\\" as his unmistakable literary mask and made it into a distinctive type of thinking about the modern world as such. In his later work he attempted to define the \\"reactionary\\" with which he identified in an affirmative way by locating him somewhere beyond the traditional position of left and right. On the basis of a Catholic traditionalism influenced by the intellectual probity of Nietzsche and others he criticized modernity and saw his work as that of a partisan for a \\"truth that will not die\\". G√≥mez D√°vila made no attempts to make his writings widely known. Only by way of German (and later Italian as well as French and Polish) translation beginning in the late eighties did G√≥mez D√°vila's ideas begin to be read among poets and philosophers such as Robert Spaemann, Martin Mosebach, Botho Strau√ü, Reinhart Maurer, Rolf Schilling, Heiner M√ºller, Franco Volpi, Asfa-Wossen Asserate and Krzysztof Urbanek.

It is the westernmost part of Long Beach, separated from the rest of the city by the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710) and the Los Angeles River. Its boundaries are the Los Angeles River to the east, Interstate 405 to the north, Anaheim Street to the south, and Los Angeles, Carson and the Terminal Island Freeway to the west. The largest industry in the area is the combined Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. There is also a large Shell Oil refinery in nearby Wilmington and the massive Intermodal Container Transfer Facility (ICTF) on the neighborhood's western edge. The neighborhood is a mix of older residential housing, apartments and townhouses, and industrial buildings. The primary thoroughfare is Santa Fe Avenue, which runs north to south through the center of the neighborhood. The neighborhood has three official parks, including Silverado Park. In 2010 a renewed 12.39 acre park, named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, was completed next to Cabrillo High School. The neighborhood was historically a working-class neighborhood due to its proximity to the Port of Long Beach and the large Shell Oil refinery in nearby Wilmington. A large U.S. Navy housing complex once stood in the neighborhood, on Santa Fe Avenue near Pacific Coast Highway (Cabrillo High School now stands on the site). Like many neighborhoods with largely working- class populations, deindustrialization in the 1970s took its toll, and the neighborhood was largely poor by the early 1980s. A local neighborhood group, the West Long Beach Association, was founded in 1997 to improve the living conditions in the neighborhood. While conditions have improved in the early 2000s, the neighborhood is still one of the poorest in Long Beach. , residents in West Long Beach had no access to banking services. There has been and continues to be heavy gang activity and a high rate of violent crime in the neighborhood, and large portions of the neighborhood are under gang injunctions directed at the East Side Longos, West Side Longos gang and Rollin 80's West Coast Crip Gang, as well as home to other local gangs such as Sons of Samoa Samoan gang, Westside Islanders Guamanian/Filipino gang, Pimpside Phamily Filipino gang, Cove Side Gangsta Crip gang, and Long Beach Satanas Filipino gang. West Long Beach has a history of Japanese Americans starting with fishery workers who once lived on Terminal Island in the turn of the 20th century. According to the 2000 US Census, there were 35,637 residents of the 90810 ZIP code, which is nearly coterminous with West Long Beach. In terms of race and ethnicity, the neighborhood's population was roughly 23.8% Caucasian, 16.4% African American, 0.8% American Indian, 23.2% Asian, 3.1% Pacific Islander, 27.2% other races, and 5.5% two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos made up 45.6% of the population. The area is served by Cabrillo High School (9‚Äì12), Stephens Middle School (6‚Äì8), Muir Academy (K‚Äì8), Garfield Elementary (K-6) and Hudson School (K-8); all operated by the Long Beach Unified School District. Police service in the area is rendered by the Long Beach Police Department Western Division, which operates a station at Pacific Coast Hwy and Santa Fe.

He was a vigorous defender of Pope Pius XII over accusations that he had failed to do what he could to defend the Jews and others persecuted by the Nazis. Fr. Robert A. Graham (right) July 1992 at wedding at Annunciation Church in Washington, DC. The son of Charlie Graham, a former professional baseball player for the Boston Red Sox and part owner of the San Francisco Seals (baseball), Graham joined the California province of the Jesuits as a young man. He was ordained priest in 1941 and was soon sent to New York City to work on the Jesuit weekly, America, where he remained for two decades. In 1952, he gained a doctorate in political science and international law from the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva during a sabbatical. In 1959, his book, Vatican Diplomacy: A Study of Church and State on the International Plane, was published. This treatise on pontifical ecclesiastical diplomacy published by Princeton University Press would endure to become a discipline classic thus qualifying Rev. Graham as one of the Church's experts on the subject of Holy See diplomacy. This classic treatise continues to be used by English-language scholars specializing in the field of pontifical ecclesiastical diplomacy and diplomatic history even today. Following the publication of his book Rev. Graham travelled the world interviewing witnesses on the Vatican's diplomatic response to Nazism during the Second World War at a time when the Vatican archives remained closed. To counter growing attacks, in 1965 the Vatican began publication of some of its wartime documents in a series of books edited by a Jesuit team, Actes et Documents du Saint Si√®ge relatifs √† la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Graham joined them in Rome in 1966 from the third volume (eleven would eventually be published by the project's completion in 1981. With Vatican permission, Graham also supplied researchers on request with other documents not included in the published collection. In 1968, Graham published a book, \\"The Pope and Poland in World War II,\\" a summary of Volume III of the Actes, which deals with the Church in Poland. Graham often published the findings of his research for La Civilt√† Cattolica, the Jesuit- run, Catholic journal in Italy. In 1996, Graham published English translations of some of his La Civilta Cattolica articles in his book, The Vatican and Communism During World War: What Really Happened (1996)Graham, Robert. \\"The Vatican and Communism During World War II: What Really Happened\\" (1996), p. 7, in PDF at Google Books Graham often wrote a column for Columbia, the official magazine of the Knights of Columbus. Graham's research was not limited to the Vatican archives. When a family friend had mentioned that one of their neighbors in New York spent part of the Second World War as an escaped British prisoner-of-war living in the Vatican, he dropped what he was doing to fly to the US to meet with William C. Simpon. Simpson who had become part of Msgr O'Flaherty network, later wrote a book on the subject titled A Vatican Life Line in 1996. Graham criticised what he called \\"irresponsible muddying of the well-springs of history\\" by some writers on the Vatican during the Second World War. He felt that had Pius XII spoken out more forcefully against Nazi persecution, \\"Hitler would have gone on a rampage of revenge - not only against Jews but against German bishops as well.\\" Graham regarded the refutation of accusations against Pius XII as vital. \\"While his detractors can no longer injure him, their slanders and insinuations continue to plague the Church, for when a Pope is defamed, the Church suffers.\\" In matters regarding Pius XII, he worked with Raimondo Spiazzi. He revanched himself with ever new details, documents, or letters, which he continued to discover long after his 80th birthday. The New York Times quoted him \\"I am 79, I thought I ought to unload this stuff, before I pop off\\"New York Times, February 17, 1997, p. 31 Graham remained in Rome until illness struck in 1996, when he returned to his native California. He died in 1997, aged 84, leaving behind a large body of published and unpublished work.  Publications  *Alvarez, David and Graham, Robert A.

It is now mostly in ruins. History Initial construction of Fort Charles began as early as the 1630s, with the aim of protecting Charlestown and its harbour.Machling, Tessa C. S. (2012). The Fortifications of Nevis, West Indies, from the 17th Century to the Present Day: Protected Interests?. Archaeopress, Oxford, London. Mounting 26 cannon, Fort Charles was the main fort on the island, although there were numerous other, smaller gun emplacements. The reason for all of these fortifications was the protection of Nevis' lucrative sugar trade, which at one time was more profitable for Britain than all of the North American colonies combined. In 1706, the entire island was overrun by French forces under Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. During this action, Fort Charles was outflanked and taken from the landward entrance. Many of the cannon on the island were disabled by the French prior to their leaving. In 1782, the fort elected to hold its fire when French Admiral Count Fran√ßois de Grasse passed within range on his way to Saint Kitts; the French fleet was vastly superior to Nevisian defences. The entire island of Nevis subsequently surrendered to de Grasse without a shot, allowing him to lay siege to Brimstone Hill on Saint Kitts. Fort Charles was briefly manned by a small French garrison during this time, and all serviceable guns were removed for use against the British on Saint Kitts. Although de Grasse was successful in taking Saint Kitts, the Treaty of Paris returned both Saint Kitts and Nevis to the British. Two more attacks were made on Nevis in 1805 and 1806 by French forces led by J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, but were repulsed. thumb By 1854, all forts on Nevis were abandoned. Currently the site is largely overgrown; there remains an old wall, a cistern, a powder magazine, and several cannons. References *Machling, Tessa C. S. (2012).

Helder was a product of Ajax Amsterdam's youth system, of whom played for Arsenal together with clubs in Holland's top flight being Sparta Rotterdam, Vitesse Arnhem and NAC Breda as well. Playing career  Born in Leiden, Helder played for Sparta Rotterdam as well as Vitesse Arnhem of the Eredivisie before joining Arsenal on 14 February 1995, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Nottingham Forest on 21 February. He was the final signing made by George Graham, who left a week after his arrival. Helder with Arsenal made 27 league appearances plus 12 as a substitute, with him scoring his solo goal for the club which came in a 3‚Äì2 win over Middlesbrough In late 1996, just after the appointment of Ars√®ne Wenger as manager, Arsenal sent him on loan to Benfica where he sustained a serious injury. Returning to the club, he found that he had been replaced by Marc Overmars in the summer of 1997 and was thus unable to break back into the first team. Helder then moved to NAC Breda in his native Netherlands and after a short spell there, he went to play in China for Dalian Wanda FC. Soon afterwards he returned to Breda in a second spell at the club before moving on to MTK Hung√°ria FC of Hungary. He then returned home to trial with FC Dordrecht, of which proved to be unfruitful. Helder eventually signed for RBC Roosendaal in 2000 and two years later moved on to that of TOP Oss where he brought an end to his playing career one year afterward. In July 2006, Helder made a surprise appearance for Arsenal in Dennis Bergkamp's final ever game, a testimonial against Ajax. Helder also appears regularly in Masters footballing tournaments and soccer clinics. International career In his Dutch international footballing career, Helder earned four caps altogether for the Oranje.  Personal life  In an interview in 1999 he stated that during his stay at NAC he tried to commit suicide because of problems resulting from compulsive gambling. However, he continues to gamble, and is sometimes seen playing poker on the English Five television station, representing the Netherlands. Subsequent to his retirement from the game, Helder took up music and is currently an experienced and well known instrumentalist especially in the role of a percussionist. He also became a stand up comedian.  References  Category:1968 births Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:S.L.

Description The holotype of Borealopelta on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta. Nodosaurids, like their close relatives the ankylosaurids, were heavily armored dinosaurs adorned with rows of bony armor nodules and spines (osteoderms), which were covered in keratin sheaths. All nodosaurids, like other ankylosaurians, were medium-sized to large, heavily built, quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaurs, possessing small, leaf-shaped teeth. Unlike ankylosaurids, nodosaurids lacked mace-like tail clubs, instead having flexible tail tips. Many nodosaurids had spikes projecting outward from their shoulders. One particularly well-preserved nodosaurid \\"mummy\\", known as the Suncor nodosaur (Borealopelta), preserved a nearly complete set of armor in life position, as well as the keratin covering and mineralized remains of the underlying skin, which indicate the animal had red and white camouflage. Classification The family Nodosauridae was erected by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890, and anchored on the genus Nodosaurus. The clade Nodosauridae was first defined by Paul Sereno in 1998 as \\"all ankylosaurs closer to Panoplosaurus than to Ankylosaurus,\\" a definition followed by Vickaryous, Teresa Marya≈Ñska, and Weishampel in 2004. Vickaryous et al. considered two genera of nodosaurids to be of uncertain placement (incertae sedis): Struthiosaurus and Animantarx, and considered the most primitive member of the Nodosauridae to be Cedarpelta.Vickaryous, M. K., Maryanska, T., and Weishampel, D. B. (2004). Chapter Seventeen: Ankylosauria. in The Dinosauria (2nd edition), Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., and Osm√≥lska, H., editors.

appearance of nodosaurids in both North America and Europe is worthy of consideration. Europelta is the oldest nodosaurid from Europe, it is derived from the lower Albian Escucha Formation. The oldest western North American nodosaurid is Sauropelta, from the lower Albian Little Sheep Mudstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, at an age of 108.5¬±0.2 million years. Eastern North American fossils seem older. Teeth of Priconodon crassus from the Arundel Clay of the Potomac Group of Maryland, which dates near the Aptian‚ÄìAlbian boundary. The Propanoplosaurus hatchling from the base of the underlying Patuxent Formation, dating to the upper Aptian, is the oldest known nodosaurid. Polacanthids are known from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The timing of the appearance of nodosaurids on both continents indicates that the origins of the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the \\"middle\\" Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae by the end of the Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of the continents from each other by rising sealevels. Below is a table showing the age difference between continents. North American nodosaurids are teal, European nodosaurids are green, European polacanthids are blue, and North American polacanthids are brown. Other nodosaurids or polacanthids are black. This table supports the observations by Kirkland et al. (2013).

KNRK's studios and offices are located on SW Bancroft Street in Downtown Portland.947.radio.com/directions while the station transmitter is located off SW Fairmont Court in Portland.Radio-Locator.com/KNRK Programming The station plays mostly familiar alternative rock tracks recorded between the 1970s and 2010s, ranging from David Bowie to Of Montreal. It also features specialty shows such as \\"Passport Approved,\\" which focuses on international rock music. On Sundays, an experimental program known as \\"The Bottom Forty\\" is heard, an alternative to conventional Top 40 Countdown shows.947.radio.com/bottom-forty There is also \\"Greasy Kid Stuff,\\" a Saturday morning program specializing in music for youngsters. History On November 1, 1992, KMUZ-FM signed on the air.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1993 page B-295 It was owned by Pacific Northwest Broadcasting, along with AM 1230 KMUZ (now KRYN). The station aired the Bonneville Beautiful Music format, led by veteran program director and then VP of KMUZ, Claude Rorabaugh. William F. King, now deceased, was CEO. It was powered at 3,200 watts on the 223-foot PGE tower on Mt. Scott in SE Portland, so it only could be heard from north to south - Battleground to Wilsonville, west to east - Forest Grove to Troutdale. On March 6, 1995, KMUZ-FM switched to modern rock as KNRK. It was re-branded as \\"94-7 NRK\\". The station's playlist was made up of alternative rock music by bands such as The Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Radio personalities Stephanie Steele and Mike Chase hosted a morning show dubbed \\"S & M.\\" A DJ who only goes by his middle name, Gustav, hosted weekday afternoons. Gradually the station's format began to shift towards harder rock music in the late 1990s. The conventional DJs like Gustav and Daria O'Neill were gradually replaced by \\"shock-jocks.\\" Music from bands like Limp Bizkit, Korn, Puddle of Mudd and Godsmack made up much of the playlist. The station's harder edge came to an end on May 12, 2004. Two morning DJs played audio recordings of Nick Berg's violent death on the air and added their own snide commentary. Hundreds of angry phone-calls and e-mails flooded into the station. KNRK's General Manager fired both of them, along with their producer. Following the incident, KNRK temporarily pulled all of its DJs off the air and played only music and commercials, in addition to the nationally syndicated talk show Loveline in the evenings. Brief messages by station program director Mark Hamilton explained the changes and plans to reshape the station. Listeners were encouraged to submit their ideas via an online survey or to call in with their own suggestions. Soon thereafter, KNRK became \\"94/7 FM.\\" A staff of personalities returned and the station's music, while still alternative, leaned a bit more pop. HD Radio KNRK broadcasts in the HD Radio format. The HD2 subchannel carries \\"94/7 Too,\\" playing rock music. In 2007, KNRK introduced \\"94/7 Too,\\" an online station focusing entirely on bands based or initially established in the Pacific Northwest. It was added to over- the-air radio on 910 AM in July 2010. That station flipped format to sports talk in 2013, with 94/7 Too moving to 94.7FM's HD2 signal and streaming online.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=24 HD Radio Guide for Portland New personalities were added in 2015 (Derric in the evenings) and 2016 (Middays with Pepper).

This also includes many rock carvings and paintings that were found in the Gi√£o archaeological station. This period of prehistory and the Roman occupation known not just for its influence on toponymy, were important for many of the defensive and habitation structures that dot the landscape of the municipality. These include many of the castros that exist throughout the area, and in particular, in the parishes of √Åzere, √Ålvora, and Cendufe. During the Middle Ages many of these proto-cultural sites were abandoned for medieval parishes or monasteries located along plains or atop strategic hills, such as the Monastery of Ermelo (Cistercians) or Santa Maria de Miranda (Benedictine). These areas facilitated settlement, which was tied to herding and seasonal cultivation, while the mountains provided many sources for game. The facility of settlement greatly enhanced its importance, since its proximity to Spanish territory favoured strategic expansion into the south: the number of medieval bridges in the area, such as in Vilela and Cabreiro improved further expansion. In documents dating back to the tenth and eleventh centuries, there were several military, social centres, and infrastructures that had been built along these northern positions. A Roman-type bridge within the municipal limits, was constructed between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and first referenced during the named Inquiri√ß√µes de 1258 (1258 Inquiries), when the name Arcos appeared in Portuguese toponymy. Although abandoned in the thirteenth century, the Castle of Santa Cruz in Vila Fonche, which predates the village, was one of the first human centers, helping to protect human populations and facilitate communication that crossed the bridges along the Vez River. By 1258, the castle controlled a geographic area that included the present boundaries of Arcos de Valdevez. Its importance along these trade and military routes influenced King Manuel I to elevate this \\"metro-pole\\" to the status of village in 1515. Liberal reforms during the eighteenth century expanded the administrative limits of the municipality, with the annexation of the areas of Soajo, Ermelo, and Gavieira. Geography Physical geography The green hilltops in the municipality of Arcos de Valdevez, within the civil parish of Salvador A view from the small civil parish of Eiras, showing the dispersed communities in the foothills of Peneda-Ger√™s mountain range The River Vez, with the Church of the Esp√≠rito Santo in the background, within the parish of Gavieira Arcos de Valdevez is situated in the northwest Portuguese peninsula of the historical province of Minho, in the district of Viana do Castelo. It is limited in the east by Spanish Galicia, in the south by the municipality of Ponte da Barca, in the southwest and west by Ponte de Lima, also by its western frontier with Paredes de Coura, in the north by Mon√ß√£o and northwest by Melga√ßo.Pacto de Autarcas (2011), p.6 Territorially, it occupies 20.18% of the Alto Minho subregion, 2.10% of the Norte region, or approximately 0.5% of continental Portugal. The physical geography of the municipality consists of three fundamental morphological units: the river-valley depression occupied by the Rivers Vez and Lima, of which 35% of the municipality is located; the mountainous escarpment of the Peneda-Ger√™s; and an accidented area in the west that extends to the eastern limits of the municipality.Pacto de Autarcas (2011), p.8 The Vez valley, which crosses the territory from north to south, divides the mountainous western and eastern areas, and is the location of the principal activities of the territory. Human geography The municipal seat of Arcos de Valdevez, the city specifically, is composed of the civil parishes of Salvador and S√£o Paio, which together account for a population of approximately 2204 inhabitants. It is characteristic of the larger area of northern Portugal, with a relatively homogeneous culture and population, dispersed within a similar scenic environment; it is one of the larger municipalities in Portugal, with an area of approximately . Administratively, the municipality is divided into 36 civil parishes (freguesias): * Aboim das Cho√ßas * Agui√£ * Alvora e Loureda * Arcos de Valdevez (S√£o Salvador), Vila Fonche e Parada * Arcos de Valdevez (S√£o Paio) e Giela * √Åzere * Cabana Maior * Cabreiro * Cendufe * Couto * Eiras e Mei * Gavieira * Gondoriz * Grade e Carralcova * Guilhadeses e Santar * Jolda (S√£o Paio) * Jolda (Madalena) e Rio Cabr√£o * Miranda * Monte Redondo * Oliveira * Pa√ß√¥ * Padreiro (Salvador e Santa Cristina) * Padroso * Portela e Extremo * Prozelo * Rio de Moinhos * Rio Frio * Sabadim * S√£o Jorge e Ermelo * Senharei * Sistelo * Soajo * Souto e Taba√ß√¥ * T√°vora (Santa Maria e S√£o Vicente) * Vale * Vilela, S√£o Cosme e S√£o Dami√£o e S√° The largest of these parishes, Gavieira, Soajo, Cabreiro, Gondoriz, and Sistelo, are located in the mountainous areas that are part of Peneda-Ger√™s National Park. The municipal seat is situated from Braga Municipality and from Porto, in the civil parish of S√£o Salvador. The urban agglomerations of Arcos de Valdevez coincide roughly with the principal roadway, the Estrada Nacional E.N.101, that links Braga with Mon√ß√£o. The construction of the ancillary I.C.28 altered this pattern, permitting rapid access to Arcos de Valdevez from other regional centres. Administratively, along with Viana do Castelo, Ponte da Lima, and Ponte de Barca, it is overseen by the VALIMA Associa√ß√£o de Munic√≠pios do Vale do Lima (Association of Municipalities of the Vale do Lima). Since 1981 the population of the municipality has been in steady decline; relative to the 2008 census, the population of the municipality has decreased, but at a rate far less than following the urbanization brought on by the Carnation Revolution in Portugal.Pacto de Autarcas (2011), p.10 The result has been an emigrant population, with most activities and residential concentration within a small area along the southwest border. Consequently, the urban areas of Salvador (with an urban density of 1090 habitantes/km¬≤) and its neighbouring parishes (S√£o Paio, Agui√£, and Giela) have seen some concentration. Architecture The Peolourinho de Arcos de Valdevez was constructed to mark the settlement of Portuguese territory in the area Civic * Bridge of Arcos de Valdevez () - constructed during the nineteenth century, beginning in 1876 and finalized in 1880, to replace the medieval construction. The monument is composed of stone blocks in four arcs with ample lateral accesses in a Roman style that open to a flat platform. * Castro of √Åzere (), a fortified castro placement in Monte, erected during the Iron Age, but inhabited from the eighth century B.C.; * Dolmens of Serra do Soajo (), a group of dolmen constructions, in various states of ruin, used by the ancient settlers of the region, in the foothills of the Serra do G√™res, near Mezio and Cabana Maior; * Manor of Quinta de Aboim () - located in the parish of Aboim das Cho√ßas, is an example of a nobleman's eighteenth-century manor house; * Pillory of Arcos de Valdevez () - in 1515 King Manuel I had this stone structure built in the main square, but it was moved in 1700 from the Municipal Square () to the river's edge, until finally being re-erected in a small square along a strip near the main church. In 1998, it was replaced in its present location. Designed by Jo√£o Lopes, it is a single structure in the form of a twisted colonnade, surmounted by the Portuguese military sphere and national shield, atypical of common pillory use. * Summer-House of Requeijo () - a manor house with a characteristic rectangular plan from the eighteenth century, and constructed with two towers, three-floors, and a lateral Franciscan chapel. The main floor is encircled with elaborate entrances and columns. Religious * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o () - a seventeenth-century chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception; * Church of Arcos de Valdevez () - this church was constructed under the guidance of King Pedro II, during the eighteenth century over the medieval ruins. Its interior is richly decorated with gold-leaf cornices and wood-carved ornamentation from the late eighteenth to nineteenth centuries. In 1776 the Calv√°rio chapel, along the southern annex, was completed in the Rococo style; * Church of Nossa Senhora da Lapa () - was constructed to the cult of Nossa Senhora da Lapa, with influences from the Beira region, it was completed in 1767, and is characterized by a central plan with a tower and the main chapel designed by Andr√© Soares in the Baroque style. The interior, including the altars and ornamentation was completed in the Rococo-style. * Church of S√£o Bento () - dedicated to Saint Benedict, is located on a prominent overlook, west of the village, it was completed in 1674, incorporating the older Franciscan Monsatary (today survived by a lone house), and decorated with azulejo and diverse religious images from the seventeenth century; * Church of S√£o Paio () - its construction was begun in 1781 and completed in the nineteenth century, it includes a single bell and staircase, apparently influenced by architecture in Oporto. Azulejos on the front fa√ßade date back to the nineteenth century. * Church of the Esp√≠rito Santo () - the church dedicated to the Holy Spirit, was established by the Confraria do Esp√≠rito Santo in 1681, in the Mannerist-style and remodelled during the nineteenth century in the neo-Classical tradition. Its interior shows notable examples of seventeenth-century paintings, as well as a sculpted pulpit that is attributed to the Arcuense manuel Gomes, based on original plans by the painter √Ålvares Costa. * Church of the Miseric√≥rdia e Cruzeiro () - in 1595, the Confraria da Miseric√≥rdia (the Brotherhood of the Miseric√≥rdia) was established in Arcos, and promoted the construction of the villages first temple, which was completed in 1710. The church presents a Rococo architecture, that is richly decorated in Baroque (the main and side doorways) and neo-Classical (pulpits and sacristy) elements. Located in an enclosed lateral square, formerly the old cemetery, it is an example of eighteenth- century design, with a base decorated with representations of the life of Christ. * Monastery of √Åzere () - a Benedictine monastery * Monastery of Ermelo (), a Romanesque monastery and church, but also a group of churches that correspond to the area of the River Lima, it was heavily altered in 1760. From the writings of Carlos Alberto F. de Almeida (1988), the decoration of the capitals and corners show an evolution in comparison to those in the Minho watershed, comparable to those in Valdreu (Terras de Bouro), Ferven√ßa (Celorico de Basto), and Ferreira (Pa√ßos de Ferreira). Sport The municipal government has funded several sports related projects to develop local athletics, including the construction and maintenance of the following: * Arcos de Valdevez Municipal Pool (), that includes a 47m x 17m x1.8m deep pool, a health club, a commercial area with three shops and snack-bar; the building offers swimming lessons, hydrogymastics, hydro-therapy, jacuzzi, as well as aerobics and training services; * Coutada Municipal Stadium (), that supports the activities of the local schools, sports teams (especially soccer and rugby), as well as athletics that include infrastructures for track events, administration, receptions, and a bar. In addition, there are several local sports organizations and clubs that benefit from the local infrastructures or offer different sporting services; these include the local equestrian and nautical club. The local football (soccer) club in Arcos is the C.A. Valdevez (), established in 1945, and currently playing the Portuguese Second Division Series A league. Arcos de Valdevez has a rugby team, Clube de Rugby de Arcos de Valdevez.

Life St√∂cker was raised in a Calvinist household and attended a school for girls which emphasised rationality and morality.http://en.muvs.org/topic/helene-stoecker-1869-1943-en.pdf She moved to Berlin to continue her education and then she studied at the University of Bern, where she became one of the first German women to receive her doctorate. In 1905 she helped found the League for the Protection of Mothers (Bund f√ºr Mutterschutz, BfM), and she became the editor of the organisation's magazine Mutterschutz (1905-1908) and then Die Neue Generation (1906‚Äì1932). In 1909, she joined Magnus Hirschfeld in successfully lobbying German parliament from including lesbian women in the law criminalising homosexuality.Elena Mancini, Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 25 St√∂cker's influential new philosophy, called the New Ethic, advocated the equality of illegitimate children, legalisation of abortion, and sexual education, all in the service of creating deeper relationships between men and women which would eventually achieve women's political and social equality. St√∂cker's plaque in Berlin During World War I and the Weimar period, St√∂cker's interest shifted to activities in the peace movement. In 1921 in Bilthoven, together with Kees Boeke and Wilfred Wellock, she founded an organisation with the name Paco (the Esperanto word for \\"peace\\") and later known as War Resisters' International (Internationale der Kriegsdienstgegner, WRI). She was also very active in the Weimar sexual reform movement. The Bund f√ºr Mutterschutz sponsored a number of sexual health clinics, which employed both lay and medical personnel, where women and men could go for contraception, marriage advice, and sometimes abortions and sterilisation. From 1929 to 1932, she took one last stand for abortion rights. After a papal encyclical, the Casti connubii, issued on December 31, 1930Casti connubii denounced sex without the intent to procreate, the radical sexual reform movement collaborated with the Socialist and Communist parties to launch one final campaign against paragraph 218, which prohibited abortion. St√∂cker added her iconic voice to a campaign that ultimately failed. When the Nazis came to power in Germany, St√∂cker fled first to Switzerland and then to England when the Nazis invaded Austria. St√∂cker was attending a PEN writers conference in Sweden when war broke out and remained there until the Nazis invaded Norway, at which point she took the Trans-Siberian Railway to Japan and finally ended up in the United States in 1942. She moved into an apartment on Riverside Drive in NYC and died there of cancer in 1943. Published works Books * 1906 ‚Äì Die Liebe und die Frauen.

He was the son of Cairell mac Muiredaig Muinderg (died 532) and brother of Demm√°n mac Cairill (died 572), previous Kings of Ulaid.Byrne, Table 6; Charles-Edwards, appendix XXI; Mac Niocaill, pg.74 According to some sources, he was high-king of Ireland.Byrne, pp. 109-111, 285 B√°et√°n sought to impose his authority over D√°l Riata in Scotland, and over the Isle of Man. Medieval Ulster genealogists describe him as r√≠ √ârenn ocus Alban (king of Ireland and Scotland), and quote from a poem, now lost, which has him receiving tribute from Munster, Connaught, Skye and the Isle of Man. This is probably to overstate his power, and represents what it meant to be high-king in much later times, rather than in B√°et√°n's day.Byrne, pp. 109-110. B√°et√°n is said to have forced the king of D√°l Riata to pay homage to him at Rinn Seimne on Islandmagee near Larne, modern County Antrim possibly in 574 or early 575. √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in is thought to be the king in question, and Ulster sources say that B√°et√°n collected tribute from Scotland.Byrne, pg.110; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (EMI) ,pg.50; Mac Niocaill, pg.77; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (NHI), pg.216 B√°et√°n's power can best be judged by the actions of his enemies, √Åed mac Ainmuirech of Northern U√≠ N√©ill and √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in of D√°l Riata.

Career Early assignments Nessler began his professional broadcasting career sharing play-by-play radio duties with Al Ciraldo on Georgia Tech basketball on WGST from 1980-81 through 1984-85, and handled the play-by-play for the Atlanta Falcons from 1982 to 1988 on WGST and WSB before assuming the same position for the Minnesota Vikings during the 1988 and 1989 seasons. He also called preseason telecasts for the Miami Dolphins for several years, and has done play-by-play of ACC football and basketball telecasts for Jefferson- Pilot. CBS Sports In 1990 and 1991, Nessler worked for CBS Sports, calling NFL games, college football, and college basketball (both men's and women's college basketball).Bowl Championship Series - Nessler, Brad, espn.go.com; accessed December 1, 2016. ESPN and ABC Sports Nessler's career with ESPN began in 1992 with college basketball games, and also Big Ten and Thursday night football contests, and expanded with the addition of ABC Sports assignments in 1997. Nessler has also appeared annually as a commentator in EA Sports' NCAA Football series. Also, his voice (and that of his broadcast partner, Dick Vitale) was featured in EA Sports' NCAA March Madness video game series. =College football= When Nessler began calling college football for ABC in 1997 he was regarded as the #3 play-by-play man behind Keith Jackson and Brent Musburger. He was promoted to #2 upon Jackson's scaling back to West Coast games in 1999, and was the #1 Saturday afternoon play-by-play man from 2006 until the 2008 season. In July 2009, ESPN announced that Nessler would move to the top play-by-play man for ESPN's coverage of college football, being primarily responsible for ESPN's Saturday Primetime game airing at 7:45 PM Eastern Time. He originally worked with Gary Danielson as his college football color man when he began working for ABC in 1997, but from 1999 to 2008 called games alongside Bob Griese (who traded positions with Danielson). Starting in 2006, Paul Maguire joined Nessler and Griese as a third color commentator for the Saturday afternoon college telecasts. Upon the announcement of Nessler's move to ESPN's Saturday Primetime telecasts, it was also announced that he would be teamed with former Penn State quarterback Todd Blackledge and sideline reporter Erin Andrews beginning with the 2009 college football season; this crew also called the January 1, 2010 Capital One Bowl on ABC. =NBA and college basketball= From 2002 to 2004, Nessler was a broadcaster for the NBA, including calling the 2003 NBA Finals. During this particular period, Nessler was accused (particularly by Richard Sandomir of The New York Times) of not knowing game strategy well, lacking rhythm and enthusiasm in his game call, not bringing out the best in his partners (i.e. Bill Walton and Tom Tolbert), too often ignoring the score, and tending to stammer. Starting in 2006, Nessler had provided play-by-play for SEC games on Super Tuesday and Thursday Night Showcase, alongside Sean Farnham or Dick Vitale (and formerly Jimmy Dykes) and sideline reporter Heather Cox. He also covered Saturday afternoon games for ESPN during the regular college basketball season, and previously appeared on ABC. =Monday Night Football= On September 11, 2006, ESPN began its coverage of Monday Night Football with a Week 1 doubleheader. Nessler teamed with Ron Jaworski, Dick Vermeil, and Bonnie Bernstein to call the second game, featuring the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders. On September 13, 2010, Nessler again worked a Monday Night Football game, teaming with Trent Dilfer and Suzy Kolber to call the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs in the second game of that night's Week 1 doubleheader. On September 12, 2011, Nessler and Dilfer called the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos in the second game of the Week 1 doubleheader; the game included a 63-yard field goal kicked by Oakland's Sebastian Janikowski, which tied the NFL record at the time. NFL Network In May 2011, Nessler was hired by NFL Network to call its Thursday Night Football telecasts, on which he was teamed with analyst Mike Mayock for an eight-game package. He continued to call the game package in 2012 and 2013, expanded to thirteen games, before CBS Sports took over responsibility for the package in the 2014 NFL season. Return to CBS CBS Sports announced on May 31, 2016 that Nessler would return to the network to serve as lead play- by-play announcer for SEC college football games beginning in the 2017 season, replacing the outgoing Verne Lundquist. He is teamed with Gary Danielson, who he worked with at ABC from 1997‚Äì1999, and Jamie Erdahl.JAMIE ERDAHL NAMED LEAD REPORTER FOR THE SEC ON CBS He also provides play-by-play for college basketball for the network usually teaming with analyst Bill Raftery. Also, he will fill-in for James Brown as studio host on NFL on CBS when Brown is away on assignment. Nessler's first SEC game for CBS was Florida at Arkansas on November 5, 2016. He assumed duties as CBS' lead college football announcer for the Sun Bowl one month later. In 2018 Nessler called his first NCAA March Madness on TBS. Personal life Nessler is a graduate of Minnesota State University, Mankato. He now lives in the Atlanta area with his wife and family.

Retrieved 21 March 2009. 17th century In 1602 Gaelic chieftain Con O'Neill of Clandeboye owned large tracts of North Down, including Killyleagh. O'Neill sent his men to attack English soldiers after a quarrel and was consequently imprisoned. O'Neill's wife made a deal with Scots aristocrat Hugh Montgomery to give him half of O'Neill's lands if Montgomery could get a royal pardon for O'Neill. Montgomery obtained the pardon but King James I divided the land in three, with the area from Killyleagh to Bangor going to another Scot, James Hamilton, later 1st Viscount Claneboye. A map of Killyleagh from 1625 showed the castle as having a single tower on the south side of a residence.\\"History of Killyleagh Castle \\". Irish Secrets. Retrieved 28 March 2009. In about 1625 Hamilton moved from Bangor to Killyleagh Castle, where he built the courtyard walls. It has been the home of the Hamilton family ever since. Viscount Claneboye's son, James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil, built the second tower. He supported the Stuart monarch Charles I of England and the castle was besieged in 1649 by Oliver Cromwell's forces who sailed gunboats into Strangford Lough and blew up the gatehouse. The Earl fled, leaving behind his wife and children. Parliament fined him for the return of the castle and his land. The 1st Earl's son, Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil, rebuilt the castle in 1666. He erected the north tower and built (or perhaps restored) the long fortified bawn (wall) in the front of the castle. The 2nd Earl's castle is mostly what remains today. In 1667 the 2nd Earl married Lady Alice Moore, daughter of the Earl of Drogheda, and their only child died in infancy. Lady Alice discovered that her father-in-law, the 1st Earl of Clanbrassil, had stated in his will that should Henry die without issue the estate should be divided between five Hamilton cousins, the eldest sons of his five uncles.Burke, John (1833). A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland. Bentley. p. 348. She destroyed the will and had her husband make his own will in 1674, leaving the estate to her. Henry died of poisoning in 1675, then Lady Alice died in 1677, leaving the estate to her brother.\\"Ghost in the castle \\". Down Recorder, 27 October 1977. Reproduced at Welcome to Killyleagh. Retrieved 29 March 2009. The cousins, however, were aware of the 1st Earl's will and pursued their rights as inheritors. The matter was concluded 20 years later when a copy of the original will was discovered. By then, the cousins were all dead. The last to die was James Hamilton of Neilsbrook, County Antrim, son of Archibald Hamilton, the next brother of James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye. James Hamilton of Neilsbrook had been confident of a settlement in his favour and had bequeathed the estate to be divided in two, with one half going to his daughter Anne Stevenson, n√©e Hamilton, and the other half to his younger brothers Gawn and William Hamilton. In 1697 the probate court divided the castle, with Gawn and William gaining the main house and the two towers and their niece Anne receiving the bawn and gate house. Gawn and William had to open a new entrance on the north side in order to enter their castle. 18th and 19th centuries William died without children in 1716 and the castle passed to successive generations of Gawn Hamilton's descendants. Gawn's great- grandson Archibald Hamilton Rowan, an Irish nationalist of the United Irishmen, lived in the castle as one of his homes between 1806 and 1834 after his return from exile in America. Hamilton Rowan's grandson, Archibald Rowan- Hamilton, and his wife employed architect Sir Charles Lanyon from 1850 to renovate the castle, creating its romantic silhouette with the addition of the turrets. James Hamilton of Neilsbrook's daughter Anne married Hans Stevenson and her estate passed to her son James Stevenson, then to his daughter Dorcas, later Dorcas Blackwood, 1st Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye (1726‚Äì1807), and on to Dorcas's great-grandson Frederick Temple Blackwood, 5th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye (1826‚Äì1902). In 1860 the 5th Baron gave the bawn and gate house to the Hamiltons and commissioned a replacement gate house to better match the main castle. The Baron added Hamilton to his surname just before marrying his distant cousin Hariot Georgina Rowan-Hamilton, daughter of Archibald Rowan- Hamilton, in 1862. 20th century The castle came under attack by the Irish Republican Army during the troubles of the 1920s. Gawn Rowan Hamilton has said: \\"I have a cutting from the Belfast Telegraph which tells the story of my great-great uncle being woken at 2 am and exchanging gunfire from the battlements, which was terribly exciting.\\" Architecture The architecture of the castle has no traces of an Irish tower house or castle. Benjamin Ferrey created a baronial gatehouse to match the two surviving corner towers to the castle. Lanyon's imposing doorcase was a celebration of Rowan-Hamilton's access through their front door for the first time in almost 200 years. The heavy plasterwork is by Mr. Fulton. Drawing room, dining room and library interconnect and look south into the garden. Lanyon retained the vaulted rooms in the northern circular tower and the pentagonal rooms in its Georgian counterpart. He re-encased the entire exterior while respecting the original fenestration. At roof level he provided a flurry of candle snuffers.Jeremy Williams, Architecture in Ireland 1837-92 References Category:Castles in County Down Category:Grade A listed buildings Category:Register of Parks, Gardens and Demesnes of Special Historic Interest Category:Killyleagh ","title":"Killyleagh Castle"},{"id":"4285730","text":"Jim Kajiya is a pioneer in the field of computer graphics.

The line runs between in the west and in the east. Attleborough is situated between and , from London Liverpool Street via . The station is managed by Greater Anglia, which also operates most of the services calling at the station. Some East Midlands Railway also stop at Attleborough. History The Bill for the Norwich & Brandon Railway (N&BR;) received Royal Assent on 10 May 1844. The line was to link with an Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) project of a line from Newport in Essex to Brandon in Norfolk. Once complete the line would enable trains to travel from Norwich to London. Work started on the line in 1844. One month before the N&BR; opened a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the N&BR; came into effect and so Attleborough station became a Norfolk Railway asset.Allen, Cecil J. The line opened on 30 July 1845 including the ECR Brandon to Newport line. However, the line only got to Trowse, in the suburbs of Norwich, as the contractors were having to build a swing bridge to cross the navigable River Wensum. Attleborough station was, as it is now, situated east of Eccles Road station and west of Spooner Row station. Two years after opening the Norfolk Railway closed in September 1847. This meant was the next station east of Attleborough. The ECR and its rival the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) were both sizing up the NR to acquire and expand their railway empire. The ECR trumped the EUR by taking over the NR, including Attleborough Station on 8 May 1848. Seven years after the ECR took over the NR Spooner Row reopened on 1 December 1855. Five years after its reopening Spooner Row closed for a second time on 1 August 1860, once again leaving Wymondham as the next station east of Attleborough. Two years after Spooner Row station closed the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway, which wished to amalgamate formally but could not obtain government agreement for this until an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed by the amalgamation. Actually, Attleborough became a GER station on 1 July 1862 when the GER took over the ECR and the EUR before the Bill received the Royal Assent. 20 years after the GER was formed Spooner Row reopened for the third and final time. The system settled down for the next 4 decades, apart from the disruption of First World War. The difficult economic circumstances that existed after World War 1 led the Government to pass the Railways Act 1921 which led to the creation of the Big Four. The GER was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Attleborough became a LNER station on 1 January 1923. On nationalisation in 1948 the station and its services came under the management of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The station's ticket office was closed in the 1960s. Upon privatisation in the 1990s the station and most of its services were transferred to Anglia Railways, with services to the Midlands being transferred to Central Trains. On 1 April 2004 management of the station passed on to National Express East Anglia, then known as \\"one\\". On 11 November 2007, services to Liverpool were transferred to East Midlands Trains upon the breakup of the Central Trains franchise. In 2008 NXEA opened a new ticket office at Attleborough as part of its Rural Stations Restaffing Initiative, almost 41 years to the day since the original office was closed. This has also been closed (exact date unknown), and has been replaced by a ticket machine. On 5 February 2012, the station and most of its services were transferred to Abellio Greater Anglia. Wooden level crossing gates adjacent to the station used to be opened and closed manually by a signaller in the local signal box. However, in 2012 the signal box was closed and the crossing was renewed with automatic barriers with warning lights. On 18 August 2019, all services operated by East Midlands Trains were transferred to East Midlands Railway upon the expiry of the former's franchise. There is no footbridge at this station.

It is an impressive three-storey tower house, built in 1622 by Roland Savage, a Norman landlord, at the site of a ninth-century round tower. It was occupied until 1731, when it was deserted.

The tower was remodelled in Gothic style in 1800 by a Col. Johnston, and in 1836 some further work was performed by a very young Master Montgomery of Grey Abbey.

The line was to link with an Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) project of a line from Newport in Essex to Brandon in Norfolk. Once complete the line would enable trains to travel from Norwich to London. Work started on the line in 1844. The line and its stations were opened on 30 July 1845. Spooner Row station opened with the line and was, as now, situated east of Attleborough station and west of Wymondham station. The line ran from Ely to Trowse, in Norwich. The link into Norwich was delayed due to the need to build a bridge over the River Wensum that kept the river navigable. One month before the N&BR; opened a Bill authorising the amalgamation of the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway with the N&BR; came into effect and so Spooner Row station became a Norfolk Railway asset.C.J. Allen The NR closed Spooner Row station in September 1847. In 1848 the NR was absorbed by the Eastern Counties Railway. The ECR reopened Spooner Row station on 1 December 1855. The station closed for a second time on 1 August 1860. An Act of Parliament on 7 August 1862 authorised the amalgamation the ECR and the Eastern Union Railway, which resulted in the formation of the Great Eastern Railway (GER). Subsequent to this, Spooner Row reopened for the third and final time on 1 March 1882. The difficult economic circumstances that existed after World War 1 led the Government to pass the Railways Act 1921 which led to the creation of the Big Four. The GER amalgamated with several other companies to create the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Spooner Row became a LNER station on 1 January 1923. On nationalisation in 1948 the station and its services came under the management of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The original station buildings were destroyed by fire in the 1970s. Upon privatisation the station and its services were transferred to Anglia Railways on 2 March 1997. On 1 April 2004 the station and its services were transferred to National Express East Anglia, then known as \\"one\\". On 5 February 2012 these were transferred to Abellio Greater Anglia. Original wooden level crossing gates adjacent to the station used to be operated manually by a signaller based in the local signal box. However, in 2012 the signal box was closed and the crossing gates were renewed with automatic barriers and warning lights. The signal box is due to be relocated to Wymondham Abbey railway station on the heritage Mid-Norfolk Railway. In 2015, the Government nationalised Network Rail so only the Train Operating Companies (TOC‚Äôs) and Rolling stock companies remained private. Facilities Today the station is unstaffed, with sheltered seating on both platforms. Access to 1 and 2 is via the road junction (there is no footbridge). On the westbound (Cambridge) platform there are unusually two help-points. The eastbound (Norwich) platform is considerably lower in height than is usual on the British railway network. Services Spooner Row is a request stop. , on weekdays there are two trains each morning to , also calling at . There is one train each afternoon to , also calling at , , , and . On Saturdays, the station is served by one train in each direction, with the Cambridge service extended to . There is no Sunday service.

The population in 2011 was 9,213,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 238.25 km¬≤. It is the northernmost municipality in Portugal. The present Mayor is Manoel Batista, elected by the Socialist Party. The municipal holiday is Ascension Day. History Parada do Monte, Gave and the plateau of Castro Laboreiro were locations of many megalithic burial mounds and graves that suggest the presence of human settlement in the mountains of the region. Alongside is the hilltop castle, that stood firm during the Galician-Leonese battles. Over the streams they built bridges in solid masonry, while dozens of fishing villages sprung from the banks of the River Minho, in addition to the Romanesque convents, churches and chapels, some of which are quite Romanesque. Oral tradition suggest that the castle of Melga√ßo was constructed during the reign of King D. Afonso Henriques, around 1170. It was this monarch that conceded to Melga√ßo the first forum letter, between 1183 and 1185, that was later confirmed by King D. Afonso in 1219, and replaced by a Foral (charter) issued by King D. Afonso III, in 1258. The existence of a forum letter suggests that some settlement existed on the site. The hilltop of Melga√ßo, overlooking the Minho River, was strategically located enroute to Galicia, in addition to terrestrial commercial routes. In the neighbourhood were the protectorates of two great monasteries, in Fi√£es and Paderne. The small burg required further protection from Leonese forces, resulting in the construction of a larger structure, on a site that would later be erected the keep tower. It was during the reign of King D. Sancho II that the town began to be encircled by a defensive fortification. Its need was already evident in the reign of King D. Afonso II, during the politico-military battles that were motivated by the monarch's struggles with his sisters. Between 1211-1212, the north of Portugal was invaded by Leonese forces, justifying the construction of the wall, which was already under construction by 1245, with the help of local initiatives and the convent of Fi√£es. Geography The distribution of the civil parishes of Melga√ßo (the mountainous parts in dark) Administratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes: * Alvaredo * Castro Laboreiro e Lamas de Mouro * Chavi√£es e Pa√ßos * Cousso * Cristoval * Fi√£es * Gave * Paderne * Parada do Monte e Cubalh√£o * Penso * Prado e Remo√£es * S√£o Paio * Vila e Roussas Architecture Civic * Bridge of Cava da Velha () * Cinema Museum of Melga√ßo, established by French film critic Jean-Loup Passek * Fountain of S√£o Jo√£o () * Settlement of Laboreiro () * Thermal Spa of Peso () Military * Castle of Castro Laboreiro () * Castle of Melga√ßo () Religious * Church of the Divino Salvador de Paderne () * Church of Santo Andr√© () * Church of S√£o Martinho () References External links *Melga√ßo Photographs ","title":"Melga√ßo, Portugal"},{"id":"4285847","text":"Personal History is the 1997 autobiography of Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham.

He is currently the foundation academy manager of Premier League side Crystal Palace. McGoldrick played for clubs Arsenal, Crystal Palace, Manchester City, Northampton Town and Stockport County. He also featured for sides Kettering Town, Nuneaton Town and Corby Town. McGoldrick was capped as an international for the Republic of Ireland's national football team. Club career He started out at non-league side Kettering Town, but following a transfer to Nuneaton Borough he established himself as a utility player in the early 1980s. He went on to move into the Football League with Northampton Town, where he collected a Fourth Division title medal in 1987. McGoldrick then went on to have a spell at Crystal Palace. Whilst with Palace he played in the 1988‚Äì89 Second Division playoff final. During the game he supplied the cross which set up Ian Wright's goal which secured promotion to the First Division in Palace's 4‚Äì3 aggregate victory over Blackburn Rovers. He also won a Zenith Data Systems Cup winners medal with the club in the 1990‚Äì91 season. During that season, Palace also recorded their best-ever finish of third place within the league. He did however, miss out on the club's appearance in the 1990 FA Cup Final. All in all with Crystal Palace he was capped 147 times, scoring 11 goals altogether. McGoldrick moved to Arsenal after Crystal Palace's relegation from the Premier League in 1993. At Arsenal, he linked up with Wright once again, making his debut in the Charity Shield against Manchester United on 7 August 1993. He played a total of 38 games in the 1993‚Äì94 season, which included a substitute appearance in Arsenal's European Cup Winners' Cup final win over Parma. McGoldrick was thereafter less of a regular due to the arrival of players like Glenn Helder. He was also known for taking Arsenal's corner kicks with an unorthodox 'looping' style, by lofting the ball high into the air before it dropped in the penalty area. In all he played 57 times for Arsenal, scoring one goal; his goal coming in the 1993‚Äì94 European Cup Winners' Cup against Standard Li√®ge. He left Arsenal for Manchester City in the autumn of 1996. The move was initially on loan, becoming permanent on 18 October 1996 following a ¬£300,000 transfer. McGoldrick joined the club amid a whirlwind of managerial changes. Initially signed on loan by caretaker-manager Asa Hartford (who took over from Alan Ball), his permanent move was the only signing of Steve Coppell's 32-day reign, and he played under two more managers before the end of the season. McGoldrick spent two seasons with City, but was consigned to the reserves for much of his final season at the club, a loan spell at Stockport County providing his only first-team action for 1998. He stayed on the payroll at Manchester City until retiring as a player in 1999. He afterwards played veterans football for Great Wakering Rovers. International career He was capped at international level for the Republic of Ireland; he was a member of Ireland's 1994 World Cup squad though he did not play in the tournament. Management career After retiring as a player, he had short spells as manager of Corby Town in 2000 and Bashley in 2003. Prior to becoming player-manager at Corby Town he had a brief spell as the club's commercial manager. In 2008, he was confirmed as the under-14s manager at Northampton Town. During the following year he stepped up to become manager of the club's youth team. However, after a spell at Northampton, McGoldrick's old club Crystal Palace sought to appoint him as one of their youth team managers in 2013. However, in that year he instead opted to establish a football academy at the Thomas Becket Catholic School, based in Northampton, Northamptonshire. Wherein the school players aged 16 years and over would have the opportunity of pursuing a full-time footballing scholarship along with a triple BTEC Sport diploma. At the start of the 2016‚Äì17 season, McGoldrick was again offered by Crystal Palace a post at the helm of the side's academy. McGoldrick went on to accept and take up the position as the manager of the club's academy. Novelty song Josh Widdicombe fronted 90's football podcast Quickly Kevin, Will He Score? released a song featuring McGoldrick's name being sung to a jaunty tune, a running joke on the podcast. The aim was to get to Xmas number one in 2019. However, the single failed to break the top 40.

It is situated on a coastal plain called The Fylde. Blackpool Tramway runs through Rossall, with two stations: Rossall School on Broadway and Rossall Square on South strand. Early history Before the Norman conquest of England of 1066, the manor of Rossall was‚Äîas part of the ancient hundred of Amounderness‚Äîin the possession of Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold II. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the manor was listed as Rushale, and in later documents as Rossall (1212) and Roshale (1228). In 1086, the area of Rossall was assessed at two carucates of land. King John gave the estate to Dieulacres Abbey in Staffordshire in 1206. Later in the 13th century, the moiety of Little Bispham and Norbreck was added to the estate. The abbot of Dieulacres leased Rossall to George Allen, who was a relative of his. The Allens, a prominent Roman Catholic family, occupied the manor until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. Cardinal William Allen was born at Rossall in 1532. Dieulacres Abbey was dissolved in the 1530s and Rossall was sold to Thomas Fleetwood. Later, when George Allen's grandson Richard died, Thomas Fleetwood's son Edmund evicted Richard's widow and daughters, and they went to live with Richard's brother, Cardinal Allen. Rossall Hall In 1733, Margaret Fleetwood, heiress to the Rossall estate, married Roger Hesketh of North Meols and Tulketh Hall, bringing Rossall into the Hesketh family. The couple chose to live at Rossall and it is likely that Roger Hesketh built the hall that existed into the 20th century. Previous houses on the estate were said to have been eroded or swept away by the sea. A chart drawn for Hesketh in 1737 shows a ruined \\"Old Rossall\\" slightly north of Rossall Hall. According to John Martin Robinson in A Guide to the Country Houses of the North West, the 18th century hall was a \\"great rambling whitewashed house\\", with irregular wings. By the 19th century, it had five family bedrooms, nursery rooms, a drawing room, dining room, libraries and an organ room, as well as servant accommodation and service rooms. The grounds included a workshop, four stables, a shippon, a coach house, an ice house and a gazebo. By the 1830s, the house and estate was in the ownership of Edmund's descendant Peter Hesketh, High Sheriff of the County of Lancashire and MP for Preston, who later changed his name to (Sir) Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood. By 1844, Hesketh had run into serious financial difficulties. He had engaged Frederick Kemp as his agent and the two had considerable financial differences of opinion. Kemp borrowed against the estate revenues to finance the expansion of Fleetwood, and Hesketh became over-leveraged. He was obliged to sell much of the estate, together with Rossall Hall itself. The Hall was taken over by Rev. St. Vincent Beechey and converted into a Church of England boarding school, designed as a Northern equivalent of Beechey's Marlborough College and later to become Rossall School. Geography and administration Rossall is located in the south-west of Fleetwood along the coast with Thornton-Cleveleys to the south. Rossall is in the Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency. Rossall ward is one of five local council wards in Fleetwood. An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to include part of Fleetwood with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 6,381. Rossall School Rossall School is the most prominent school in Fleetwood., The school is a co- educational, independent, day and boarding school catering to ages 5 to 18. It was founded in 1844 on the site of Rossall Hall by Rev. St Vincent Beechey. Notable people *Cardinal William Allen - born 1532 and died on 16 October 1594.

Geography Mount Murud at the elevation of 2,424 m, is the highest mountain in Sarawak, located at the boundary between Miri and Limbang Division, in the Kelabit Highlands. It is a white-yellowish sandstone mountain, formed during the Miocene Epoch, extends for 4 km long, running in the ENE-WSW direction. Mount Murud has two highest points, with one point higher than the other by only 15 m. History According to a local legend, there was once a penghulu (headman) named Baya Kalong who stayed near the present-day Mount Murud area. He had a beautiful daughter named Kelawing. Kelawing was later married to another young penghulu named Tingang who came from another longhouse. However, Tingang's younger brother named Lawi became jealous of his brother and beheaded Kelawing while the couple was walking upstairs into longhouse. Tingang became angry and tried to kill his brother. Then, their father's sound came from heaven who condemn them for breaking their promise of not fighting each other. After that, a severe thunderstorm came and buried Tingang's longhouse with all its inhabitants with stones raining from the sky. The piles of stones later formed Mount Murud. The first attempt to climb Mount Murud was made in 1914 by John Coney Moulton, curator of Sarawak State Museum but failed due to food shortage and killings of their native guides due to a Dayak Lun Bawang invasion. He made a second attempt to climb the mountain in 1920 but failed again. The first successful ascent of Mount Murud was by a Swedish zoologist who was also a curator of Sarawak State Museum, Eric Mj√∂berg in October 1922. He spent six days at the summit of the mountain and collected various animal and plant species. His collections were documented by various authors in the third volume of Sarawak Museum Journal in 1928. Following this, his footsteps were followed by other botanical collectors in the 1960s and 1990s. During Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, a Gurkha post was built at the summit. In the 1980s, a man from Ba'kelalan named Agung Bangau saw a vision to build a church there. A church was later built at a plateau on the mountain and the first prayer meeting was held in July 1985, attended by 600 people from the nearby villages of Ba'kelalan and Bario. Today, a village is built around the church completed with public amenities; receiving visitors around the world. It is regarded as a sacred mountain where smoking and alcoholic drinks are prohibited. Prayer meetings are held every two years by the Mount Murud Prayer Ministry. In 1995, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) organised an expedition to Mount Murud. During the expedition, a species of Vanilla orchid named Vanilla kinabaluensis, Rafflesia pricei, and slipper orchid Paphiopedilum were discovered. A total of 70 samples were collected by the UNIMAS expedition team. Biodiversity The UNIMAS expedition team defined the animal and plant species collected from 1,500 m to 1,800 m range above sea level as species originating from the Mount Murud; because specimens collected below this level can originate from the mountain surroundings. Mj√∂berg noted in 1925 that nine species of birds that were previously known as originated from Mount Kinabalu are also found at Mount Murud. This is supported by another evidence that 77% of Pteridophyte and 75% of orchids are common in both mountains. However, despite the close proximity of Mount Murud with Mount Mulu (65 km WSW of Mount Murud), both mountains have different summit flora. As of 1995, a total of 35 pteridophytes, 7 gymnosperms, 96 monocotyledons, and 207 dicotyledons were listed as summit flora of Mount Murud. The tropical pitcher plant species Nepenthes murudensis is named after the mountain and is thought to be endemic to its summit area.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997.

The first Reverend of the Cottle Church was Rev. Daniel Davis. After Thomas Cottle's death in 1828, the church fell into disuse.

The doctrine requires that municipalities use their zoning powers in an affirmative manner to provide a realistic opportunity for the production of housing affordable to low and moderate income households. The doctrine takes its name from the lead case in which it was first pronounced by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1975: Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township (commonly called Mount Laurel I), in which the plaintiffs challenged the zoning ordinance of Mount Laurel Township, New Jersey, on the grounds that it operated to exclude low and moderate income persons from obtaining housing in the municipality. History Initial development After the decision in Mount Laurel I, suits were filed against numerous municipalities. The plaintiffs in such suits fell into three classes: lower income persons who actually sought housing and advocacy organizations on their behalf; the New Jersey Public Advocate; and builders who sought to construct developments containing affordable housing. These early exclusionary zoning suits were beset by numerous difficulties and little, if any, affordable housing resulted. In 1983 appeals in several of these cases (of which Southern Burlington County N.A.A.C.P. v. Mount Laurel Township was again the lead case), gave the New Jersey Supreme Court the opportunity to reaffirm and tweak the Mount Laurel Doctrine and provide several mechanisms and remedies to make the doctrine more effective. 1980s legislative reaction The New Jersey Supreme Court was aware that the Mount Laurel II decision would be controversial and would engender debate about the proper role of the courts. The opinion invited legislative action to implement what the court defined as the constitutional obligation. In 1985 the New Jersey Legislature responded by passing the Fair Housing Act. Accepting the premise that there was some constitutional obligation for municipalities to foster some degree of affordable housing, this legislation created an administrative agency, the Council on Affordable Housing (COAH), to establish regulations whereby the obligation of each municipality in terms of the number of units and how the obligation could be satisfied. A municipality which elected to participate in COAH's administrative process prior to being sued was provided with protection from litigation and especially the builder's remedy. As a transitional provision, the act provided that municipalities involved in litigation when the act was passed were to be able to transfer the litigation to COAH unless manifest injustice would result. COAH developed regulations under which the specific number of affordable units that each municipality would be required to provide (its \\"pre-credited need\\") could be determined. Participating municipalities developed compliance plans to address this need by such means as the application of credits (e.g. filtering, spontaneous rehabilitation, extra credit for rental units), the use of regional contribution agreements (transferring part of the obligation to a willing municipality, usually an urban center, in the same region along with payment in an amount agreed by the municipalities) and zoning for affordable housing (usually involving increased density and mandatory set-asides). When COAH approved a municipality's compliance plan it would grant \\"substantive certification\\" which was designed to provide the municipality with protection from exclusionary zoning litigation. From the municipal point of view, the advantages of COAH's administrative process included the use of a formula to calculate fair share that might produce a lower obligation than the court would impose, the availability of the regional contribution agreement to reduce the number of units and the ability to determine where in the municipality that affordable housing ought to be developed rather than being forced to permit a development as a reward to a successful builder-plaintiff. Those municipalities that chose not to participate in COAH's administrative process remained vulnerable to exclusionary zoning lawsuits and the prospect of the builder's remedy. The disadvantage would be that a participating municipality might be required to zone some land in a manner that extra housing would be produced. Some municipalities, believing that the likelihood of facing an actual exclusionary zoning lawsuit was low enough, took their chances in not participating. Criticism of the decision While the Mount Laurel decision mandates a state constitutional obligation for every municipality in a \\"growth area\\" to provide a fair share of its region's present and prospective housing needs for low and moderate income families, there is no funding source specified for low or very-low income families, in a state that already has some of the nation's highest property taxes.\\"McHose Says 'Fair Housing' Bill Misses the Mark; Doesn't Address Why Housing is Unaffordable in New Jersey\\" , Alison Littell McHose press release dated June 11, 2007 on PoliticsNJ.com. Accessed June 22, 2007. Some have accused the decision for being an example of judicial activism.Editorial. \\"Judicial Duty in New Jersey\\", The New York Times, February 24, 1986. Accessed June 22, 2007. \\"For 11 years, New Jersey's Supreme Court has struggled with the constitutional issues implicit in the desire of Mount Laurel, a Burlington County township, to zone out low-income housing. For its labor the court earned its share of criticism for judicial activism. Last week, it yielded supervision of housing to a new state agency, the Council on Affordable Housing. That was no defeat for judicial activism but a handsome vindication of it.\\" 1980s judicial response to the Fair Housing Act The New Jersey Supreme Court welcomed the Legislature's adoption of the Fair Housing Act. A number of trial court decisions had denied transfer of pending cases to COAH under the manifest injustice standard, but the Supreme Court read that term very narrowly and ordered the cases transferred. The trial courts were directed to conform their rulings with regard to calculation of each municipality's obligation and how to meet it to COAH's regulations and the statute was found facially constitutional and interpreted to grant COAH ample authority, such as restraining the use of scarce resources (sewer capacity, potable water, land) for other than providing affordable housing, to assure that affordable housing might actually be built. The Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) COAH is a currently defunct government agency created in the 1980s to administer Mt. Laurel requirements.

In Morris County as a whole, between 2010 and 2014, there were only 39 units of affordable housing for every 100 renters classified as having extremely low income (ELI). This is a 6% decrease in the number of units since 2000. The suburban town has acquired COAH-certified credits associated with previous iterations of the third round of affordable housing, which reduced the town‚Äôs affordable housing obligation (16). To address the current lack of affordable housing, Chatham Township is in the process of building the third round of affordable housing units in compliance with the Mount Laurel Doctrine. Sterling Sun Homes Developers will be constructing 25 affordable housing on the 3.6 acre site of the current skate park on Southern Boulevard. Objections: The Chatham Township community has raised several objections to the new affordable housing units consistent historical and regional objections to the Mount Laurel Doctrine. Many citizens have raised concerns about the impact fees that will be imposed on the residents to help fund the new affordable housing units. A Chatham Township resident, speaking at the Township Committee meeting on September 12, 2019, suggested this ‚Äúpunitive fee...can‚Ä¶ be passed and simply not implemented‚Äù. This suggestion mirrors the open refusal to comply with the Mount Laurel Doctrine I, which requires the municipality to provide housing for people of multiple income brackets, which was common between 1975 and 1981. The Mount Laurel Doctrine requires municipalities to add fair share housing via municipal zoning. Aside from the monetary cost, residents have raised concerns about the loss of open space and trees. This development will require the removal of 18 trees on the skate park property and is slated to exceed the allowed building height in the township by 2.98 feet. The conflict over open space is one that is occurring in many municipalities, such as those in the \\"Builder‚Äôs remedy lawsuit cases\\". A group of teens raised concerns about the loss of the community‚Äôs skate park, for which there are no current plans to rebuild. As this area is suburban, a resident said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not averse to affordable housing in itself,‚Äù but he is ‚Äúaverse to is an expanded population‚Äù as the town is characterized by low-density housing. Another resident noted that the location of the development is in a high traffic area near the elementary school, and the new residents will lead to reduced parking and pedestrian safety. Concerns about the changing suburban form come up frequently in \\"legislator outcry\\" in connection to concerns that New Jersey suburban communities will begin to look like cities. New Jersey mayors have traditionally opposed affordable housing. The stance of town leadership on fair land use policies is unclear as the public has been excluded from many of these discussions surrounding inclusionary inclusionary zoning via the Open Public Records Act (N.J.S.A 10:4-12 ) are taking place in executive session, rather than the public session. Vacant and abandoned properties Some have argued that the deluge of abandoned and vacant properties in New Jersey should be taken into account before forced building occurs in less crowded areas. They have also suggested that the state step up funding for code enforcement to reduce burdens of urban blight on attractive home development, including enforcement on absentee landlords. The City of Newark is \\"working with the Urban League to identify vacant or abandoned properties that can be sold to small developers to then sell at cost to residents. About 16 percent of Newark's housing is vacant and the city has a high eviction and foreclosure rate according to a Rutgers report.https://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2016/02/a_year_later_newark_sweetheart_land_deals_harbor_m.htmlhttps://urbanomnibus.net/2016/02/why- hasnt-anyone-built-on-newarks-1000-love- lots/https://www.tapinto.net/towns/newark/articles/new-quality-of-life- initiative-will-ramp-up- codehttps://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2018/04/can_newark_be_a_model_city_to_curb_against_gentrif.htmlNew Brunswick Picks Committee, Law Firm to Move on Abandoned Houses https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/articles/new-brunswick-picks-committee- law-firm-to-move-o-4Mayoral Musings: Vacant and Abandoned http://www.snjtoday.com/story/38565358/mayoral-musings-vacant-and- abandoned#.W0d-k2SYxc8.twitterEver Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tnEver Since The Great Recession, Zombie Houses Have Haunted New Jersey https://n.pr/1UQY1tnVacant and afraid: Getting a grip on abandoned homes  Opinion http://s.nj.com/gCDW8TI See also *Abbott district, a similarly controversial legal doctrine resulting from a series of New Jersey Supreme Court cases holding that the education of children in poor communities was unconstitutionally inadequate. *Frederick Wilson Hall, who wrote the initial decision * Latino Action Network v.

His father was a planter. Davis began studies at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1808. There he became an abolitionist and a friend of William Wilberforce. Ministry Davis returned to the Leeward Islands and worked strongly, but quietly, for abolition in St. Kitts and Nevis. He later became a minister at St. Paul's Anglican Church in Nevis, and in 1824, became the first minister at the newly built Cottle Church. He found that St Kitts and Nevis were playing a part on behalf of the abolitionists out of all proportion to their size and importance. This was due to two prominent residents of St Kitts, James Ramsay (who had introduced William Wilberforce to the abolition movement) and James Stephen, a lawyer. Both these men were so outspoken in their abhorrence of slavery that after much persecution from other members of the plantocracy they were forced to leave the island; but not before they had been able over a long period to send detailed accounts of the ill treatment of slaves in the two islands to Wilberforce and other abolitionists fighting for the cause in England. Events in these two small islands became very influential in determining the final victory for abolition. By 1812 when he was ordained Davis was in two minds whether to take up the rectorship he had been offered of St. Paul‚Äôs, Charlestown. He wished to see his family again but this feeling was dampened by the idea of returning to a land of slaves. But he came back, and stayed. In a letter to an abolitionist friend he wrote, ‚Äúit will be my great objective to encourage the extensive propagation of our religion among the negroes, as well as to improve the impression which has already been made on the white inhabitants. It ought indeed to be considered disgraceful to the policy of any society, that the space of nearly three centuries should have expired since one people or other, professing civilization and Christianity, have made but feeble efforts, or rather no efforts, for the extension of their blessings among the laborious and ignorant‚Äù. But it was not to be an easy ministry. He found that neither planters nor their field slaves were much interested in his invitations to come for worship and instruction. It was not until 1818 that, under the pressure of the ameliorative policies of the British government, local political circles were forced to accept that attitudes had changed back in Britain. With the help of the vigorous leadership in the church of Beilby Porteus, the Bishop of London, Davis was slowly able to make progress. By 1822 there were Sunday schools in every parish in Nevis. Slaves on enlightened plantations were allowed markets on days other than Sundays that had otherwise prevented them from attending church. But above all Davis had begun to win the support of a growing number of planters to the cause of conversion. Towards the end of 1821 Thomas Cottle, a former President of the Island Council and a prominent planter, came forward with a proposal to build this church. Davis' consecration In 1824 two Bishops (known for their opposition to slavery) were appointed for the newly created Sees of Jamaica (Bishop Lipscomb) and Barbados with the Leeward Islands (Bishop Coleridge). This was a signal to the local plantocracy that the British government was now fully committed to the policy of improving the condition of slaves in its colonies and was conscious that full freedom could not be very long delayed. By the time Davis left the island for St Kitts 19 schools with an aggregate attendance of 1,247 slave pupils had been established; and just before his departure he founded, along with those who supported his views, a branch society of the Society for the Conversion of Slaves. The most active promoters of the new society‚Äôs first meeting were Thomas Cottle and Norton Herbert, the nephew of Frances, Lady Nelson. Davis remained in St Kitts until 1838 and later became the first Bishop of Antigua. On 24 August 1842, Davis was consecrated a bishop at Westminster Abbey. Fierce to the end in attacking racial prejudice from whatever quarter it appeared, Davis died in London, aged 70, in 1857. References * Hubbard, Vincent K. 2002. \\"Swords, Ships & Sugar\\".

He is currently managing director, global football, at City Football Group. Club career Hull City Born 5 February 1960 in Seaham, County Durham, Marwood started his career at Hull City, joining in 1976 as an apprentice and making his way up through the youth and reserve ranks. A pacy and tricky Winger, he made his debut aged 19 in a Third Division match against Mansfield Town on 12 January 1980. He spent five seasons with the Tigers, during which time they were relegated to the Fourth Division and then promoted back to the third. After 1983‚Äì84, in which Hull City reached the Associate Members' Cup Final and narrowly missed out on promotion to the Second Division, Marwood attracted the interest of Sheffield Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday Marwood was signed by Sheffield Wednesday for ¬£115,000. In all he played 191 times for Hull and scored 53 goals. At Wednesday, he became known as one of the First Division's most consistent and productive wingers, thanks to his pace and close ball control. The newly promoted Owls had a strong return to the top-flight, finishing eighth and fifth in Marwood's first two seasons at the club, although Wednesday were unable to compete in the 1986‚Äì87 UEFA Cup due to the ban on English clubs in European competitions as a result of the Heysel disaster in 1985. Arsenal Despite Wednesday's form tailing off after that, Marwood still shone in the side and he was signed by Arsenal for ¬£800,000 in March 1988, as manager George Graham was searching for a more dependable alternative to the erratic and injury prone Martin Hayes. He made his Arsenal debut against Oxford United on 30 March 1988. Marwood's impact at Arsenal was nearly immediate; his crosses supplied striker Alan Smith with goals throughout the 1988‚Äì89 season, in which Arsenal won the First Division title for the first time since 1971. Smith himself credits Marwood as being the most prolific supplier of assists while he was at Arsenal. During this time, Marwood firmly established himself as the club's first choice left winger ahead of Martin Hayes. Unfortunately for Marwood, injury forced him to miss the last five matches of the season, which included Arsenal's title- winning match against Liverpool at Anfield. Nevertheless, he still took away a league winners medal with 31 appearances that season. However, with the ban on English clubs in Europe still in place, Marwood was unable to have a crack at the European Cup. However, injury restricted Marwood's chances in the 1989‚Äì90 season, and he only managed nineteen matches that season. After Arsenal signed Swedish international winger Anders Limpar in the summer of 1990, it was clear Marwood would no longer be an automatic first choice. Sheffield United He was sold to Sheffield United for ¬£350,000 in September 1990; in all he played 60 matches for Arsenal, scoring 17 goals. In three seasons at United, Marwood only managed 22 appearances, and was loaned to Middlesbrough before making a permanent move to Swindon Town midway through 1992‚Äì93; Marwood played eleven times as Swindon won promotion to the Premier League, but was released by the club that summer. Barnet He finished his career at Barnet where he spent one season, playing 23 games as Barnet were relegated from Division Two. International career Marwood's performances for Arsenal earned him an England cap, in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia on 16 November 1988. Professional Footballers' Association Marwood was chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association between 1990 and 1993. Career after retirement Since retirement, Marwood has written his autobiography, The Life of Brian (), and has become a commentator on Radio 5 Live, Sky Sports and STAR Sports. He worked as UK sports marketing manager for Nike from 1997 - 2009 Manchester City He joined Manchester City with the title of football administrator in 2009, being an ex-colleague of former executive chairman, Garry Cook, at Nike.

It had been experiencing financial troubles and was placed on \\"warning status\\" by its regional accreditor the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in late 2013. On April 15, 2014, university officials reported that Interim President Ken Winters stepped down for family reasons April 12, and that former President Robert Imhoff and his wife Jackie Imhoff, the vice president of adult services, who had stepped down from their positions in February but were still receiving a salary, were fired. Robert Thomas \\"Tom\\" Walden was named to replace Winters. On April 16, it was announced that the university did not have enough money to pay staff, and would close at the end of June. On October 6, 2014, it was announced that Mid-Continent University had filed for bankruptcy.  History  The university opened as the West Kentucky Baptist Institution in January 1949 in Clinton, Kentucky. In 1957, the university moved to Mayfield and changed its name to Bible Baptist Institute. In June 1965, the Board of Trustees changed the name of the school to Mid-Continent Baptist Bible College. In 1972, the Harris family of Graves County donated approximately 100 acres to the college and construction began on this campus. By 1992, LaVerne Butler, then-president of the university facilitated the school's accreditation. He retired in 1997. On May 20, 1993, the Board of Trustees changed the name to Mid-Continent College, and after organizing into two separate colleges, changed the name to Mid-Continent University. In December 2013, the school's accreditation warning by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools was extended for a second year. This in turn triggered the denial of Federal financial aid from the United States Department of Education and put the school in financial difficulty. On April 16, 2014 all remaining employees were laid off although plans were for the school to remain open and staffed with volunteers until after graduation. Every class with at least one student graduating in May was covered by volunteers. On April 18, 2014, Western Kentucky University developed a special offer to accept all credits and waive application fees as well as other special incentives to ease the transition for Mid-Continent students. On April 19, Midway College made a similar announcement. Shortly afterwards, the school announced teach-out agreements with Murray State University, University of the Cumberlands and Campbellsville University. Academics The university offered three bachelor's degrees: (bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, and bachelor of ministry) and two associate's degrees: (associate of arts and associate of science). On April 15, 2014, Mid-Continent's Board of Directors voted to cease operations and instruction, effective June 30, 2014. All faculty and staff were dismissed, with the exception of a few faculty members that agreed to volunteer their services without pay until the end of the semester, in order to accommodate graduating seniors. Athletics Mid-Continent teams were known as the Cougars. The university was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA); primarily competing in the NAIA's American Midwest Conference (AMC), the Cougars also competed as a member of the Division I Mid-East Region of the NCCAA. Men's sports included baseball, basketball, cheerleading and soccer; while women's sports included basketball, cheerleading, softball and volleyball.

Sir Robert de Myneris appeared in the court of Alexander II of Scotland where he received royal patronage, rising to become a chamberlain in 1249. Sir Robert received grants for lands in Glen Lyon and Atholl. These grants were further reinforced by a grant to his son, Alexander of Strathtay in 1296. Alexander also acquired the lands of Weem and married Egida, a daughter of James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland. The Clan Motto originates from the Battle of Teba (1330), at which Chief Lord Robert the Menzies first uttered the phrase in response to a call to action by Sir James Douglas, and the Clan Crest originates from that battle as well.The Red & White Book of Menzies, page 68 Wars of Scottish Independence Alexander's son, another Sir Robert was a companion-in-arms of Robert the Bruce, and was awarded lands in Glen Dochart, Finlarig, Glen Orchy and Durisdeer. 15th and 16th centuries Another Sir Robert Menzies who was the eighth chief built Weem Castle, near the current Castle Menzies in about 1488. The castle was plundered in 1502 by Stewart of Garth in a dispute over the lands of Fothergill. Janet Menzies had married a Stewart about a century earlier, and Garth claimed the lands as part of her tocher, or dowry. Menzies appealed to the Crown, and James IV of Scotland found in his favour. The king ordered Stewart to make restitution, and erected the Menzies lands into the free barony of Menzies in 1510. In 1540 James Menzies of Menzies married Barbara Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Atholl and cousin to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was the future king. 17th Century & Civil War During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms despite having royal links and links to the Stewarts the Clan Menzies opposed Charles I and as a result Menzies was harried by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Montrose sent a messenger to Menzies seeking his support but for whatever reason the messenger was wounded. Montrose retaliated and in the skirmishing the Menzies chief was fatally wounded. His son was a Major in the Covenanter army and was killed at the Battle of Inverlochy (1645). Menzies families in the north, independent from the chiefs in Perthshire fought on the side of Montrose. Sir Gilbert Menzies of Pitfolds was with Montrose throughout his campaign and was also at the Battle of Inverlochy when his chief's son was killed. In 1665 Sir Alexander Menzies was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia. Alexander's brother was Colonel James Menzies of Culdares who claimed to have survived no less than nine serious wounds. James is the ancestor of the present chiefs. Another of Alexander's brothers was killed at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The chiefs of Clan Menzies opposed the policies of James VII of Scotland (II of England). When James was forced from his throne in 1688 the Menzies chiefs supported Mary II of England and Prince William of Orange. However the clan was again divided as Major Duncan Menzies of Fornock led his men in the Highland charge at the Battle of Killiecrankie in which they defeated Government troops. Amongst the Government troops at Killiecrankie were hundreds of their Perthshire kinsmen, who had formed and Independent Highland Company.Simpson. Page 76. The Menzies Independent Company later fought at the Battle of Cromdale in 1690 where the Jacobites were defeated.Simpson. Page 81. 18th Century & Jacobite Uprisings During the Jacobite rising of 1715 Menzies of Culdares supported the Jacobite cause. He was captured and exiled to Maryland in America. He later returned to Scotland but in the Jacobite rising of 1745 he was beyond active campaigning, however he sent Prince Charles Edward Stuart a fine horse. The clan was out in force under Menzies of Shian who was killed along with his son during the campaign. The Menzies lands of Glen Lyon provided shelter for refugees from the Battle of Culloden, including members of Prince Charles's personal staff. Clan Chief The current chief of Clan Menzies is David R.S. Menzies of Menzies. Castles Castles that have been owned by the Clan Menzies have included, amongst many others: Castle Menzies, historic seat of the chief of Clan Menzies *Comrie Castle, four and a half miles west of Aberfeldy in Perthshire is a ruinous L-plan tower house that was built and held by the Menzies family. The castle was burned in 1487 and the clan moved to Weem, which is now known as Castle Menzies. However Comrie was used by branches of the clan until about 1715. *Castle Menzies, originally known as the Palace of Weem, near to Aberfeldy, Perthshire, is an extended Z-plan tower house. The original Palace of Weem was built after 1487 but was sacked fifteen years later by Neil Stewart of Garth. The castle was occupied by Oliver Cromwell's forces in the 1650s. The chiefs of Clan Menzies did not support the Jacobite rising of 1745 and the Jacobite leader, Charles Edward Stewart stayed for two nights in the castle. However four days later it was occupied by British-Hanoverian forces led by the Duke of Cumberland. During World War II the castle was used as a Polish Army medical supplies depot. It later became derelict but was acquired by the Menzies Clan Society in 1957 who have set about having it restored. *Meggernie Castle, eight miles north of Killin, Perthshire, was originally held by the Clan Campbell but passed to the Menzies of Culdares branch of the clan, who supported the Jacobite cause. There is a story that the castle is haunted by the ghost of the wife of one of Menzies lairds who cut her in half in a jealous rage. He managed to bury her lower half but not her upper half which was concealed in an upper chamber of the castle. As such it is said that the upper floors of the castle are haunted by the apparition of the upper half of her body and the lower floors and burial ground by the apparition of the lower part of her body. *Pitfodels Castle, was to the south-west of Aberdeen, but little remains of the castle that was replaced by Norwood Hall. The castle was originally held by the Reids but passed by marriage to the Menzies family in the sixteenth century. The Menzies family also held Pitfodel's Lodging, a house in Aberdeen that has also been demolished. Pitfodels Castle had been abandoned in about 1622. The Menzies of Pitfodels branch of the clan were also Jacobites and the family founded the Catholic College of Blairs. *Culdares, near Fortingall, Perthshire, is the site of a castle or old house that was the seat of the Menzies of Culdares branch of the clan.

Although overshadowed in terms of prestige by Robert Falcon Scott's concurrent Discovery Expedition, the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work. Its achievements included the establishment of a manned meteorological station, the first in Antarctic territory, and the discovery of new land to the east of the Weddell Sea. Its large collection of biological and geological specimens, together with those from Bruce's earlier travels, led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906. Bruce had spent most of the 1890s engaged on expeditions to the Antarctic and Arctic regions, and by 1899 was Britain's most experienced polar scientist. In March of that year, he applied to join the Discovery Expedition; however, his proposal to extend that expedition's field of work into the Weddell Sea quadrant, using a second ship, was dismissed as \\"mischievous rivalry\\" by Royal Geographical Society (RGS) president Sir Clements Markham. Bruce reacted by obtaining independent finance; his venture was supported and promoted by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The expedition has been described as \\"by far the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of the Heroic Age.\\" Despite this, Bruce received no formal honour or recognition from the British Government, and the expedition's members were denied the prestigious Polar Medal despite vigorous lobbying. After the SNAE, Bruce led no more Antarctic expeditions, although he made regular Arctic trips. His focus on serious scientific exploration was out of fashion with his times, and his achievements, unlike those of the polar adventurers Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen, soon faded from public awareness. The SNAE's permanent memorial is the Orcadas weather station, which was set up in 1903 as \\"Omond House\\" on Laurie Island, South Orkneys, and has been in continuous operation ever since.  Background to the expedition  William S. Bruce, SNAE expedition leader During his student years‚Äîthe 1880s and early 1890s‚ÄîWilliam Speirs Bruce built up his knowledge of the natural sciences and oceanography, by studying at summer courses under distinguished tutors such as Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson. He also spent time working voluntarily under the oceanographer Dr John Murray, helping to classify specimens collected during the Challenger expedition. In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies altogether, and embarked on a voyage to the Antarctic in the whaler Balaena, as part of the 1892‚Äì1893 Dundee Whaling Expedition. On his return, he began organising an expedition of his own to South Georgia, claiming that \\"the taste I have had has made me ravenous\\", but he could not obtain funding. He then worked at a meteorological station on the summit of Ben Nevis, before joining the Jackson‚ÄìHarmsworth Arctic Expedition to Franz Josef Land as a scientific assistant. Between 1897 and 1899 he made further Arctic trips, to Spitsbergen and to Novaya Zemlya, first on a private trip organised by Major Andrew Coats, later as a scientist on the Arctic survey vessel Princess Alice. This vessel was owned by Prince Albert of Monaco, a renowned oceanographer who became a friend and supporter of Bruce. After returning from the Arctic in 1899, Bruce sent a lengthy letter to the Royal Geographical Society in London, applying for a scientific post on the major Antarctic expedition (later to be known as the Discovery Expedition), which the RGS was then organising. His recent experiences made it \\"unlikely that there was any other person in the British Isles at that time better qualified\\". Bruce's letter, which detailed all his relevant qualifications, was acknowledged but not properly answered until more than a year had passed. By then, Bruce's ideas had progressed away from his original expectation of a junior post on the scientific staff. He now proposed a second ship for the expedition, separately financed from Scottish sources, which would work in the Weddell Sea quadrant while the main ship was based in the Ross Sea. This proposal was denounced by RGS president Sir Clements Markham as \\"mischievous\\" and, after some heated correspondence, Bruce resolved to proceed independently. In this way the idea of a distinctive Scottish National Antarctic expedition was born. Bruce was supported by the wealthy Coats family, who were prepared to give whole-hearted financial backing to a Scottish expedition under his leadership. However, as a result, he had acquired the lasting enmity of Markham.  Preparations   Scotia  In late 1901, Bruce purchased a Norwegian whaler, , at a cost of ¬£2,620 (approximately ¬£ as of ). During the following months, the ship was completely rebuilt as an Antarctic research vessel, with two laboratories, a darkroom, and extensive specialist equipment. Two huge revolving cylinders, each carrying of cable, were fitted to the deck to enable deep-sea trawling for marine specimens. Other equipment was installed for making depth soundings, for the collection of sea water and sea-bottom samples, and for meteorological and magnetic observations. The hull was reinforced to withstand the pressures of Antarctic ice, and the ship was re-rigged as a barque with auxiliary engines. This work increased the cost of the ship to ¬£16,700 (approximately ¬£ as of ), which was met by the Coats family who altogether donated ¬£30,000 towards the total expedition costs of ¬£36,000. Renamed Scotia, the ship was ready for her sea trials in August 1902.  Personnel  The expedition's scientific staff consisted of six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, had been a member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who had worked in the Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was taxidermist. Bruce appointed Thomas Robertson as Scotia's captain. Robertson was an experienced Antarctic and Arctic sailor who had commanded the whaling ship Active on the Dundee Whaling Expedition. The rest of the 25 officers and men, who signed for three-year engagements, were all Scotsmen, many used to sailing in icy waters on whaling voyages.  Objectives  The objectives of the expedition were published in the Scottish Geographical Magazine and in the RGS Geographical Journal, in October 1902. They included the establishment of a winter station \\"as near to the South Pole as is practicable\\", deep sea and other research of the Antarctic Ocean, and systematic observations and research of meteorology, geology, biology, topography and terrestrial physics. The essentially Scottish character of the expedition was expressed in The Scotsman shortly before departure: \\"The leader and all the scientific and nautical members of the expedition are Scots; the funds have been collected for the most part on this side of the Border; it is a product of voluntary effort, and unlike the expedition which will be simultaneously employed in the exploration of the Antarctic, it owes nothing to Government help\\". As the work of the expedition would be mainly at sea, or within the confines of the winter station, only a few dogs were taken, to facilitate the occasional sledge journey. Rudmose Brown records that of the original eight dogs, four survived the expedition; they \\"pulled well in harness, their only weak point being their paws which... were apt to be cut when on rough ice\\".  Expedition   First voyage, 1902‚Äì1903  Scotia left Troon, Scotland, on 2 November 1902. On her way southward she called at the Irish port of Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire), at Funchal in Madeira, and then the Cape Verde Isles before an unsuccessful attempt was made to land at the tiny, isolated equatorial archipelago known as St Paul's Rocks. This attempt almost cost the life of the expedition's geologist and medical officer, James Harvie Pirie, who was fortunate to escape from the shark-infested seas after misjudging his leap ashore. Scotia reached Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 6 January 1903, where she re- provisioned for the Antarctic journey ahead. South Orkney Islands On 26 January, Scotia set sail for Antarctic waters. The crew had to manoeuvre round heavy pack ice on 3 February, north of the South Orkney Islands. Next day, Scotia was able to move southward again and land a small party on Saddle Island, South Orkney Islands, where a large number of botanical and geological specimens were gathered. Ice conditions prevented any further progress until 10 February, after which Scotia continued southward, \\"scudding along at seven knots under sail\\". On 17 February the position was 64¬∞18‚Ä≤S, and five days later they passed 70¬∞S, deep within the Weddell Sea. Shortly after this, with new ice forming and threatening the ship, Robertson turned northward, having reached 70¬∞25‚Ä≤S. Having failed to find land, the expedition had to decide where to winter. The matter was of some urgency, since the sea would soon be freezing over, with the risk of the ship becoming trapped. Bruce decided to head back to the South Orkneys and find an anchorage there. In contrast to his stated object, to winter as far south as possible, the South Orkneys were more than from the South Pole, but the northerly location had advantages. The relatively brief period during which the ship would be frozen in would allow more time for trawling and dredging operations early in the year. Also, the islands were well-situated as a site for a meteorological station‚Äîtheir relative proximity to the South American mainland opened the prospect of establishing a permanent station. \\"Omond House\\" It took a month of hard sailing before Scotia reached the islands. After several foiled attempts to locate a suitable anchorage, and with its rudder seriously damaged by ice, the ship finally found a sheltered bay on the southern shore of Laurie Island, the most easterly of the South Orkneys chain. On 25 March the ship safely anchored, settling into the ice from shore. She was then rapidly converted to winter quarters, with engines dismantled, boilers emptied, and a canvas canopy enclosing the deck. Bruce instituted a comprehensive programme of work, involving meteorological readings, trawling for marine samples, botanical excursions, and the collection of biological and geological specimens. The major task completed during this time was the construction of living accommodations for those who would remain on Laurie Island to operate the proposed meteorological laboratory. The buildingits walls built from local materials using the dry stone method, and roof improvised from wood and canvas sheetinghad two windows and was fitted for six people. It was christened \\"Omond House\\" after Robert Omond, director of the Edinburgh Observatory and a supporter of the expedition. Rudmose Brown wrote: \\"Considering that we had no mortar and no masons' tools it is a wonderfully fine house and very lasting. I should think it will be standing a century hence ...\\" In general, the party maintained excellent health. The exception was the ship's engineer, Allan Ramsay, who had been taken ill with a heart condition in the Falklands during the outward voyage. He chose to remain with the expedition, but he grew steadily weaker as winter progressed. He died on 6 August, and was buried on the island. As winter turned to spring the level of activity increased, and there were numerous sledge journeys, including some to neighbouring islands. Near Omond House, a wooden hut was constructed for magnetic observations and a cairn was built, high, on top of which the Union Flag and the Saltire were displayed. Scotia was made seaworthy again, but remained icebound throughout September and October; it was not until 23 November that strong winds broke up the bay ice, allowing her to float free. Four days later she departed for Port Stanley, leaving a party of six under Robert Mossman at Omond House.  Buenos Aires, 1903‚Äì1904  Orcadas Base, formerly Omond House On 2 December 1903, the expedition reached Port Stanley, where they received their first news from the outside world since leaving the Cape Verde Islands. After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where she was to be repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after the expedition's departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the R√≠o de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December. During the following four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the Argentine government over the future of the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who was director of the Argentine Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered no objection to this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the Argentine government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House building, its furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological instruments, to the Argentine government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times. Several of the original crew left during the Buenos Aires interlude, some through illness and one discharged for misconduct, and replacements were recruited locally. Scotia left for Laurie Island on 21 January, arriving on 14 February. A week later, having settled the meteorological party, who were to be relieved a year later by the Argentine gunboat Uruguay, Scotia set sail for her second voyage to the Weddell Sea.  Second voyage, 1904  The coast of Coats Land, discovered by the SNAE in March 1904, photographed in 1915 during Shackleton's expedition Scotia headed south-east, towards the eastern waters of the Weddell Sea, in calm weather. No pack ice was encountered before they were south of the Antarctic Circle, and they were able to proceed smoothly until, on 3 March, heavy pack ice stopped the ship at 72¬∞18'S, 17¬∞59'W. A sounding was taken, revealing a sea-depth of , compared to the which had been the general measurement up to that date. This suggested that they were approaching land. A few hours later, they reached an ice barrier, which blocked progress towards the south-east. Over the following days, they tracked the edge of this barrier southwards for some . A sounding from the barrier edge gave a depth of only , which strongly indicated the presence of land behind the barrier. The outlines of this land soon became faintly visible, and Bruce named it Coats Land after his chief sponsors. This was the first positive indicator of the eastern limits of the Weddell Sea at high latitude, and suggested that the sea might be considerably smaller than had been previously supposed. A projected visit to Coats Land by a sledging party was abandoned by Bruce because of the state of the sea ice. Piper Gilbert Kerr alongside a penguin, March 1904 On 9 March 1904 Scotia reached its most southerly latitude of 74¬∞01'S. At this point, the ship was held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was during this period of inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea. Scotia headed for Cape Town by a route that took it to Gough Island, an isolated mid-Atlantic volcanic projection that had never been visited by a scientific party. On 21 April, Bruce and five others spent a day ashore, collecting specimens. The ship arrived in Cape Town on 6 May. After carrying out further research work in the Saldanha Bay area, Scotia sailed for home on 21 May. On the voyage home the party called at Saint Helena and visited Napoleon's exile home which they found neglected and in disrepair. On 7 June the ship reached Ascension Island where they were impressed by the sight of giant turtles, some of them across. The final port of call was at Horta in the Azores, where they stopped briefly on 5 July before heading for home.  Homecoming and after  The expedition was warmly received on its return to the Clyde on 21 July 1904. A formal reception for 400 people was held at the Marine Biological Station, Millport, at which John Murray read a telegram of congratulation from King Edward VII. Bruce was presented with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society's Gold Medal, and Captain Robertson with the silver medal. Following the expedition, more than 1,100 species of animal life, 212 of them previously unknown to science, were catalogued; there was no official acknowledgement from London, where under the influence of Markham the work of the SNAE tended to be ignored or denigrated. Its members were not awarded the prestigious RGS Polar Medals, which were bestowed on members of the Discovery Expedition when it returned home two months after Scotia. Polar Medals would also be awarded after each of Sir Ernest Shackleton's later expeditions, and after Douglas Mawson's Australasian expedition. Bruce fought unavailingly for years to right what he considered a grave injustice, a slight on his country and on his expedition. Some of the aversion of the London geographical establishment may have arisen from Bruce's overt Scottish nationalism, reflected in his own prefatory note to Rudmose Brown's expedition history, in which he said: \\"While Science was the talisman of the Expedition, Scotland was emblazoned on its flag; and it may be that, in endeavouring to serve humanity by adding another link to the golden chain of science, we have also shown that the nationality of Scotland is a power that must be reckoned with\\". Gough Island, visited by the SNAE on its return from the Weddell Sea in 1904, photographed in 2005 A significant consequence of the expedition was the establishment by Bruce, in Edinburgh, of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, which was formally opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906. The Laboratory served as a repository for the large collection of biological, zoological and geological specimens amassed during the Scotia voyages, and also during Bruce's earlier Arctic and Antarctic travels. It was also a base from which the scientific reports of the SNAE could be prepared, and it served as general headquarters where polar explorers could meet ‚Äì Nansen, Amundsen and Shackleton all visited ‚Äì and where other Scottish polar ventures could be planned and organised. Although Bruce continued to visit the Arctic for scientific and commercial purposes, he never led another Antarctic expedition, his plans for a transcontinental crossing being stifled through lack of funding. The SNAE scientific reports took many years to complete; most were published between 1907 and 1920, but one volume was delayed until 1992. A proposal to convert the Laboratory into a permanent Scottish National Oceanographic Institute failed to come to fruition and, because of difficulties with funding, Bruce was forced to close it down in 1919. He died two years later, aged 54. By this time, the Scotia expedition was barely remembered, even in Scotland, and it has remained overshadowed in polar histories by the more glamorous adventures of Scott and Shackleton. In these histories it is usually confined to a brief mention or footnote, with little attention given to its achievements. Bruce lacked charisma, had no public relations skills (\\"...as prickly as the Scottish thistle itself\\", according to a lifelong friend), and tended to make powerful enemies. In the words of oceanographer Professor Tony Rice,Author of Deep Ocean (Natural History Museum, London 2000, ) his expedition fulfilled \\"a more comprehensive programme than that of any previous or contemporary Antarctic expedition\\". The expedition ship Scotia was requisitioned during the Great War, and saw service as a freighter. On 18 January 1916 she caught fire, and was burned out on a sandbank in the Bristol Channel. One hundred years after Bruce, a 2003 expedition, in a modern version of Scotia, used information collected by the SNAE as a basis for examining climate change in South Georgia during the past century. This expedition asserted that its contribution to the international debate on global warming would be a fitting testament to the SNAE's pioneering research.

Alight has humanitarian programs and provides medical care, shelter, protection services, clean water, community development support, microloans, and help for women who have suffered violence, as well as other opportunities to help refugees.ARC Programs. In Africa, Alight has programs in Liberia, Sudan,ARC Sudan Darfur,ARC Darfur Uganda,ARC Uganda RwandaARC Rwanda and Sierra Leone. In Asia, Alight programs are concentrated in PakistanARC Pakistan and in Thailand.ARC Thailand In Pakistan, Alight has recently been working with to help civilians who have fled fighting between the government and the Taliban in northwest Pakistan. Alight also responded to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, providing relief services in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and a Fishing Boat Project in Thailand. Haiti On January 12, 2010 a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck just outside Port-au-Prince. The capital city and surrounding towns were completely destroyed and a million people were left homeless. 50,000 were reported to have died. On January 14, the first Alight emergency response team members arrived in Port-au-Prince. They started planning the response, hiring local staff, and coordinating with the United Nations and other partners. In the following days and weeks additional staff with expertise in emergency response, logistics, health, water/sanitation, shelter, and protection arrived in Haiti. Alight distributed food to 2,200 people in the Delmas district of Port-au-Prince, 1,000 hygiene and kitchen kits in the Nazon district. On January 26, Alight began managing settlement of 5,000 people in Terrain Acra district of Port-au-Prince, working with multiple relief agencies. In the next few months the camp size grew to 25,000 people.Video of ARC Terrain Acra settlement Of the 19 most crowded settlements (of 300 total), Terrain Acra was the only one with an organization overseeing and coordinating relief activities. Four cargo planes carrying 90,000 pounds of donated emergency medical and shelter supplies arrived in Port-au-Prince from Minneapolis. In Terraine Acra Alight opened a health clinic, distributed shelter materials, built latrines and sanitation systems. On February 9, the first three child-friendly spaces opened in the Terraine Acra settlement. 300 children were expected and 1,000 showed up. On April 10, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Asha-Rose Migiro visited Alight's camp in Terrain Acra . Alight is working with the local community and coordinating with international and local NGOs to help people survive and rebuild. C√¥te d'Ivoire The American Refugee Committee team has been responding to the refugee crisis on the border between C√¥te d'Ivoire and Liberia since December 2010, constructing shelters to house refugees in Nimba County, Liberia. Kyrgyzstan On Sunday June 20, 2010 Alight's Rapid Response Team arrived in Osh, Kyrgyzstan to assess the situation and the needs of the affected communities. Liberia In the fall of 2003, Alight launched a program to assist those who had been displaced by the Second Liberian Civil War. Alight began providing services to people living in camps at Brown's Town and Unification Town and continues serving those locations today. Pakistan =Afghan refugees= Today, there are millions of Afghan refugees living in refugee camps in Pakistan‚Äôs Baluchistan Province. Some fled the oppression of the Taliban, others the Soviet invasion in the 1980s. For years they have known no way of life other than in the camps. Entire generations have grown up without the right to move about freely or the possibility to make a living for their families. Alight provides primary health care to 98,000 Afghan refugees in the camps and in the surrounding communities. Alight also provides special attention to pregnant mothers and training for refugees in caring for their own communities. Alight helps refugees cope with the frustrations of living in a camp by organizing youth clubs and activities, working to prevent and respond to domestic violence in the camps, and building awareness of the threat of HIV/AIDS. =Earthquake relief= In October 2005, a massive earthquake shattered communities throughout mountainous northern Pakistan. The impact has been long-lasting, with entire families and villages wiped out and vital infrastructure destroyed. Within hours of the quake, Alight began getting survivors in Bagh District the emergency relief they needed ‚Äì clean water, nutritious food, shelters for those left homeless and in need of emergency medical attention. Today, Alight's efforts are focused on working with communities to rebuild health care clinics and water systems in the region so that survivors can care for themselves. =2009 Pakistan displacement crisis= In the spring of 2009, three million people fled for their lives from fighting between Taliban forces and the Pakistani government in the mountainous region of northwestern Pakistan. Many fled to camps without clean water or enough to eat. But the vast majority have been taken in by local communities, packed in tight quarters ‚Äì sometimes 50-60 people in very small homes. Water and sanitation systems were on the brink of collapse, and there was a serious threat of outbreaks of disease.\\"On the ground in Pakistan after devastating floods,\\" Minnesota Public Radio/NPR. Alight quickly began trucking clean water into refugee camps and digging wells and latrines to ensure safe and sanitary living conditions. Aid workers have also stepped in at local clinics to provide comprehensive medical care and to try to reach as many survivors as possible. Alight is also currently working to help Pakistani families who have begun returning. So far, 100,000 families have gone back to the Swat Valley. But the fighting destroyed infrastructure and other systems, leaving people without basics like clean water and sanitation. Alight will soon begin work digging wells and repairing infrastructure so that basic necessities will be waiting for families when they return home.ARC 2008 Annual Report, pp. 21. =2010 floods= In late July 2010 monsoon rainfall caused flash floods swelling the river Swat and killing over 1,100 people. Alight's Emergency Response teams began work as the flooding subsided in early August, providing clean water and mobile health clinics for survivors. Alight's mobile health teams, especially water and sanitation teams, assembled and began coordinating with partners and authorities. Swat, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar were the most severely affected areas. Roads were washed out, bridges gone, internet and telephone were functioning intermittently. Many affected communities remained inaccessible except by helicopter; others had been entirely obliterated. Rwanda Alight began work in Rwanda in December 1994, following the genocide. Alight manages all three major refugee camps in Rwanda, providing health care, water, construction, and sanitation services as well as programs combating gender-based violence and HIV/AIDS. Alight also manages successful income generation programs in the camps and hires and trains refugees wherever possible. In 2005, the government of Rwanda asked Alight to build a refugee camp at Nyabiheke to accommodate 5,000 new refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Alight quickly constructed roads, bridges, shelters, latrines, storage warehouses, and health centers, and began receiving refugees within a month of the request. The culminating achievement of the construction efforts was the drilling of a borehole to tap an aquifer, which provides 100,000 liters of naturally purified, filtered water per day. In the fall of 2007, Alight expanded Nyabiheke Camp to receive 2,000 more people fleeing increased violence.\\"ARC in Rwanda,\\" ARC website. Sudan =Darfur= The American Refugee Committee is taking a variety of actions to directly help millions of Darfuris who are without access to clean water, who are unable to make a living for their families, who live in camps with no access to farmland or who are forced to flee fighting too frequently to raise any crops. Alight's corps of midwives assist pregnant mothers to safely deliver their babies, and health clinics provide treatment and medications to thousands of people each month. Alight is working with Darfuri communities to dig wells that will provide safe drinking water to thousands, and Alight is partnering with families to plant crops that will feed and support them. Alight provides tools and seeds and the families bring the farming skills to grow the food that will sustain them. In schools Alight provides children with nutritious meals. Parents have one less mouth to feed, and their children will be educated and better prepared to help rebuild the region when the fighting has ended.ARC 2008 Annual Report, pp. 20. =Southern Sudan= Alight began operations in Kajo Keji County in Southern Sudan in 1994, providing health services to people displaced by the war. Operations have since grown dramatically, and Alight now operates an integrated program of health care, water and sanitation, and microenterprise development for war-affected residents and returning refugees. Since 2006, Alight has been implementing a major, long-term initiative to expand comprehensive reproductive health care services in Southern Sudan. Alight has recently initiated the Through Our Eyes project in southern Sudan, using hands-on video and community participation to get people talking about gender-based violence and how to prevent it. Alight currently works in Juba, Kajo Keji, Malakal, Nimule, and Yei.\\"ARC in Southern Sudan,\\" ARC website.

Origins The movement against the Book of Common Prayer, partly inspired by Parliament, had come to a head with the submission of the 'Root and Branch' petition of 1640, which demanded 'that the said government (meaning the episcopal system) with all its dependencies, roots and branches be abolished'. Among the 'branches' was the Book of Common Prayer which was said to be a 'Liturgy for the most part framed out of the Romish Breviary, Rituals, [and] Mass Book'. Thus in 1641 an abridgement of Knox's Book of Common Order was presented to Parliament. In 1644 another adaptation of the same original was presented to the Westminster Assembly and printed. However, the parliamentary divines resolved to produce their own book and set up a committee which was to agree on a set of instructions for ministers in charge of congregations, not a form of devotion but a manual of directions. While the English Book of Common Prayer had early use in Scotland, it is a fixed liturgy, providing a range of fixed prayers and detailed tables of fixed lessons. It is therefore not easy to compare it with the Directory. However, the Directory does very much follow the Book of Common Order used in Scotland from 1564 which is derived from John Knox‚Äôs Forme of Prayers used in the English Congregation in Geneva. In this book there is discretion in the wording of the prayers and no fixed lectionary. The Directory was produced by a parliamentary subcommittee. The chair of the subcommittee was Stephen Marshal. Other members included Thomas Young, Herbert Palmer and Charles Herlie. Representing the independent congregations there was Philip Nye and Thomas Goodwin, and representing Scotland were Alexander Henderson, Robert Baillie, George Gillespie and Samuel Rutherford.Lukas Vischer (2003) Christian Worship in Reformed Churches Past and Present, pp. 78-79 The text appears to be in the style of Philip Nye's writing. Contents The Directory was something like an agenda, but it was also something of a handbook of pastoral practice containing a lengthy section on visiting the sick, and a detailed section on preaching. The book reflected the compilers' view that only what is mandated by explicit Scripture, whether by explicit command, precept or example or by good and necessary consequence can be deduced from Scripture was warranted in the public worship of God. The objections to the Directory advanced by Henry Hammond, later Chaplain to Charles I, in his \\"A View of the New Directory and a Vindication of the Ancient Liturgy of the Church of England\\" issued at Oxford in August 1645 are worth noting. Hammond notes six basic characteristics purposely avoided in the Directory: (1) a prescribed form or liturgy, (2) outward or bodily worship, (3) uniformity in worship, (4) the people having a part through responses in prayers, hymns and readings, (5) the division of prayers into several collects or portions, (6) ceremonies such as kneeling in communion, the cross in baptism and the ring in marriage. In respect of (1) this has been covered already. In respect of (2), doting on ceremonies and outward gestures (e.g. bowing to the east) was indeed avoided. As for (3), it was intended that there be uniformity in the parts of worship though not the words, while in regard to (4) and (5) the Directory is not so opposite as Hammond suggests although it does not seem very positive on singing. In regard to (6), kneeling in communion and the cross in baptism had been matters of long and significant controversy between the parties in the Church of England. Hammond then notes sixteen items avoided in the Directory which are more particularly related to the parts of the service: (1) pronouncing of absolution, (2) the necessity of singing psalms and other hymns of the church, (3) the use of the doxology, (4) the use of the ancient creeds, (5) the frequent use of the Lord‚Äôs Prayer and prayers for the King, (6) saints days and the Christian year, (7) the reading of the commandments and associated prayers, (8) the order of the offertory, (9) private baptism, (10) a prescribed catechism [but this was covered by a later production of the Assembly], (11) confirmation, (12) solemnities of burial for the sake of the living, (13) thanksgiving after childbirth, (14) communion for the sick, (15) The Commination service at the beginning of Lent, (16) the observation of Lent, Rogation days and the Ember weeks. Several of these items (1-5,7,10) had use in other Reformed Churches, but the major items did not. In response to the view that the Directory outlines a dull, unimaginative service, one must not underestimate the verbal imagery of the Puritan service based on the Bible. Some particular emphases are the following: The form of worship is centred on the reading of Scripture. The canonical scriptures are to be read in order, a chapter of each testament at a time, after which there was a long prescribed prayer and then the minister was to preach to the effect that 'his own and his hearers' hearts [are] to be rightly affected with their sins'. Baptism was to be administered at this same service using a font which the people could see and where they could hear, rather than hitherto where fonts had often been placed at the entrance of the Church. A long instruction preceded the administration of the rite which, among other things, made the point that baptism is not so necessary that the child be damned or the parents guilty if it were not administered, on the grounds that the children of the faithful 'are Christians and federally holy before baptism.' There was to be prayer that the inward baptism of the Spirit would be joined with the outward baptism of water. The Communion was to be celebrated often, though how often is not made clear - to the Scots quarterly or half-yearly was sufficient, but some English Puritan churches observed monthly, while most Anglicans only communicated once a year - and was to take place after the morning sermon. Those wishing to receive communion were to sit about or at the communion table. The italicised words were a compromise between the Scottish view of the necessity of sitting around a table and a common view in England that partaking in the pews was in order. The words of institution from the gospels or St. Paul were an essential part of the celebration followed by a prayer of thanksgiving 'to vouchsafe his gracious presence, and the effectual working of his Spirit in us; and so to sanctify these elements, both of bread and wine, and to bless his own ordinance, that we may receive by faith the body and blood of Jesus Christ crucified for us, and so feed upon him that he may be one with us, and we with him, and that he may live in us and we in him and to him, who hath loved us and given himself for us'. The bread was then to be broken and shared and the wine also. The collection for the poor was to be organised so that it in no way hindered the service. Marriage involved the consent of the parties, publication of intention, and a religious service in a place of public worship on any day of the year but preferably not the Lord's Day. It consisted of prayer, an explanation of the origin and purpose of marriage, an enquiry as to if there is any impediment, the exchange of vows, the pronouncement that the couple be husband and wife, and a closing prayer. A register of marriages was to be kept. Burial There was not be any ceremony at a burial because, it is stated, of the superstitions and abuses that have occurred. But it was in order for the minister to put the friends of the deceased in mind of their duty to improve the occasion, and 'civil respects or deferences' at the burial, 'appropriate to the rank and condition of the party deceased' were permitted. Use by the Church of England In some areas of the country, notably in London and Lancashire, Presbyterian classes (presbyteries) were set up in 1646 and operated until the Restoration of Charles II in 1660. Although by no means universally adopted even within these areas, there is good evidence to show that many of these parishes both bought and used the Directory. It was probably also used in parishes with Congregationalist, or Independent, ministers. However, those parishes that did adopt the Directory were in the minority, and the Book of Common Prayer continued in use secretly across much of the country, particularly in relation to funerals. It is clear that the Directory was deeply unpopular with the majority of the population, and some of the best evidence for its use can be deduced from negative reactions to it, in particular the dramatically reduced baptism rate in those parishes where the Directory was adopted. Use by the Church of Scotland The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland adopted the Westminster Directory during that Assembly's 10 Session on 3 February 1645. In adopting the text of the Directory, however, the Assembly provided several clarifications and provisions and later, during Session 14 on February 7, 1645, it provided even further clarifications for application within the Church of Scotland.Acts of the general assembly of the church of Scotland, 1638-1842 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Printing and Publishing, 1843) pp. 115-116, 120-121. The adopting acts, therefore, attempted to keep intact those traditions and practices of the Scottish church where they differed from those of some English churches, whether Puritan or Independent, so long as these differences proved no offense to those English churches.Sprott, George Washington, The worship and offices of the church of Scotland (Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1882). Such differences in implementation included, for instance, the Scots coming forward to sit around the communion table, retaining the use of the epiclesis, the singing of a Psalm while tables dismissed and came forward, the distribution of bread and wine by communicants among themselves, and \\"a sermon of Thanksgiving\\" after communion. The Westminster Directory did, however, have the effect of suppressing the Scottish \\"Reader's Service\\" and of eliminating the practice of ministers bowing in the pulpit to pray prior to the sermon.Sprott, George Washington, The worship and offices of the church of Scotland (Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons, 1882) and Chapell, Bryan, Christ-Centered Worship: Letting the Gospel Shape Our Practice (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2009).

Shot on location in the Philippines in 1965, the film tells the story of an American detective investigating a series of murders linked to a Manila nightclub. The killings are carried out by a monster so that a beautiful blonde woman, who is actually hundreds of years old, can use the victim's blood to stay forever young. Blood Thirst was actually completed in 1965 but was not released in the US until 1971,Senn, Bryan (2019). Twice the Thrills! Twice the Chills! Horror and Science Fiction Double Features 1955-1974. Jefferson NC: McFarland & Company Inc. p. 354. . where it was put on a double bill with the British film Bloodsuckers (UK, 1971). Blood Thirst mostly played the grindhouse circuit. Plot New York City detective and sex-crimes specialist Adam Rourke (Winston) has gone to Manila to help his friend, Inspector Miguel Ramos (Victor Diaz), investigate the murders of several young women. All have had their blood drained through identical 10 cm incisions on the inside of each forearm. Miguel suspects a homicidal maniac but has heard rumours that a \\"strange blood cult\\" is to blame. Adam goes undercover as a writer seeking the story of the latest victim, Maria Cortez, a hostess at the Barrio Club, owned by Mr. Calderone (Vic Silayan). Adam goes to the club. He brushes off a pretty hostess, Theresa (Judy Dennis), and instead watches beautiful blonde Serena (Nielson) dance. He and Calderone discuss the article about Maria. That night, Adam kills a man who attacked him in his hotel room. Afterwards, he is stopped by a seemingly homeless man who in reality is Herrera (Eddie Infante), an undercover officer with a prosthetic leg who is Adam's police liaison. Sylvia (Henryk), Miguel's adopted sister, drives Adam into the countryside and dumps him there, accusing him of not taking the case seriously. As he walks to his hotel, he sees a drunken Theresa arrive home. Out of sight of Adam, she is jumped by a humanoid monster. At the club, Serena suddenly clutches her face and runs off the dance floor. She looks older than she had earlier. Miguel contacts the police in Lima and learns that Calderone and Serena fled Peru two years earlier, after Calderone was implicated in the murders of several young women. Elena, another club hostess, is then kidnapped by the monster. Adam is unaware of the monster but suspects that Calderone is the murderer. Serena disingenuously tells Adam that Calderone \\"is a maniac and he'll kill to protect his secret.\\" She introduces Adam to Louisa, a new hostess. Louisa is actually Sylvia. She has fallen in love with Adam and wants to help him. She points out that Serena's wrist-to-elbow armbands are of Aztec or Inca origin. The monster kills Elena in a secret chamber beneath the Barrio Club. He moves a bowl of her blood in front of Sylvia, who is seated in a chair with a brightly lit box behind her head. She throws powder into the blood. Smoke rises and when it clears Serena is young again. Serena asks Adam to her home and tells him lies. She says that Calderone killed his wife and made it look like suicide, and that he forces her to dance at the club. Adam passes out from the drugged drink that Serena gave him. As this happens, Sylvia discovers the secret chamber and is grabbed by the monster. Adam awakens tied to a tree. Serena explains that she was chosen \\"by her people\\" to become one of the \\"golden goddesses\\" but she must have the blood of other women to maintain her eternal beauty. The blood is mixed with the powdered roots of ancient trees and the \\"electrical energy of the sun harnessed in a small container.\\" Serena removes an armband to show Adam her scar, identical to those of the murder victims. But just as she is about to stab Adam, she begins ageing rapidly and runs for the chamber. Adam is freed by one of Calderone's men and calls the police. Adam takes Miguel to the chamber, where the monster is about to kill Sylvia. Instead, he attacks the men, inadvertently moving the bowl of Elena's blood in front of Serena. Miguel shoots the monster four times to little effect. The monster begins strangling both men, but Herrera hits him with his artificial leg. The monster falls and strikes his head. Adam and Miguel save Sylvia. Serena throws powder into Elena's blood. When the smoke clears, she is a very old woman. She throws another handful and after the smoke dissipates only her clothing and armbands remain. The monster dies, revealing himself to be Calderone.

Blood Thirst was given a GP rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) upon its release. GP meant that parental guidance was suggested, but not required, which allowed the film to be exhibited to audiences of all ages. Release Chevron Pictures distributed Blood Thirst as the second feature on a double-bill with what film critic and psychometrist Bryan Senn considers to be the inferior British horror film Bloodsuckers (titled Incense for the Damned in the UK). He notes that \\"by 1965, producing a black-and-white picture, much less an import with no star names, was asking for distribution trouble, and the film sat on the shelf for half-a-dozen years before Chevron decided they needed a co-feature for their British snoozer Blood Suckers.\\" The US poster for the films carries a warning which reads \\"Notice: We are not responsible for your nightmares when you see this blood-curdling gruesome twosome!\\"  Home media  Blood Thirst was released on DVD by Image Entertainment on July 24, 2001, as a double- feature alongside Blood Suckers (1989). Image later re-released the film on September 2, 2003 as a part of its three-disk \\"Box of Blood\\" movie pack. The film was later released by Alpha Video on March 23, 2004. On August 2, 2005, it was released by Diamond Entertainment as a part of its two-disk \\"Vampire Collection\\". It was later released on August 5, 2008, by Retromedia in its \\"Morella's Blood Vision\\" movie pack. The film was last released by Cav Distributing Corporation on September 10, 2013, as a part of a \\"Drive-In Collection\\". Reception Theatrical reviewers praised the on-screen appearance of Blood Thirst. Senn writes that \\"The film's stark black-and-white photography takes an atmospheric turn from the outset, particularly during the nighttime shots of the shadow-filled, deserted streets, the planes of light and darkness becoming almost noirish in their intensity.\\" Similarly, internet critic Mdeapo says that \\"Visually, this film is framed in an artful manner and the black-and-white photography is crisp, adding atmosphere and shadow.\\" And critic David Elroy Goldweber describes Blood Thirst as having \\"unusually good staging of shots and black-and-white cinematography. The lighting, the framing, the subtle camera work is very sophisticated for films of this kind.\\" The same critics are relatively gentle with the film as a whole. Blood Thirst is \\"an uneven but entertaining mishmash of film noir, Filipino horror, and seedy spy flick,\\" a \\"watchable and brief drive-in number that would be a perfect second bill to The Awful Dr. Orloff or Nightmare Castle (...) humorous and exotic enough to keep your interest on a dark and rainy night\\" and a picture that \\"might work without sound as a background movie during a party.\\" However, critics found the film's monster to be somewhat laughable. One writes that \\"the creature looks like the Michelin Man after stepping on a hornets' nest,\\" while another describes him/it as having \\"a face like a melting marshmallow.\\" Mondo Digital calls it \\"a moody, gothic blend of police procedural and sadistic horror, with the latter finally taking over completely the lively final ten minutes.\\" David Cornelius from DVD Talk panned the film, criticizing the film's acting, dialogue, and nonsensical plot. Eric Cotenas from DVD Drive-In gives the film a mixed review, commending the film's interesting monster, Nielson's performance, and monochrome cinematography, but also stating that the film is \\"mostly a snooze.\\" Fred Beldin from Allmovie gives the film a positive review, commending the film's set pieces, quick pacing, and Winston's performance, writing that \\"Blood Thirst is an entertaining horror/mystery tale with a twist on the standard legends that vampire fans might be expecting.\\" On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar indicates that he likes the film, while noting its plot is occasionally clunky and shows obvious cheapness.

They range in color from light brown to red or black and are located in areas most often exposed to the sun, particularly the hands, face, shoulders, arms and forehead, and the scalp if bald. The spots derive their name from the fact that they were once incorrectly believed to be caused by liver problems, but they are physiologically unrelated to the liver, save for a similar color.Karen J. Carlson, Stephanie A. Eisenstat, Terra Diane Ziporyn, The new Harvard guide to women's health, Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 337. From the age of 40, the skin is less able to regenerate from sun exposure, and liver spots are very common in this age group, particularly in those who spend time in the sun. In the overwhelming majority of cases, liver spots pose no threat and require no treatment, though they occasionally have been known to obscure the detection of skin cancer. However, despite being a benign condition, liver spots are sometimes considered unsightly and some people choose to have them removed. This can be done by electrosurgery, laser treatment, cryotherapy, or the use of depigmentation agents, such as hydroquinone, tretinoin, topical cysteamine, azelaic acid, or alpha hydroxy acids.  Causes  Histology slide of a solar lentigo Differently from the melanotic nevi and the verrucous nevi on the skin, age spots change in color and in shape with time. Michelitsch and Michelitsch propose an hypothesis inspired by their misrepair-accumulation aging theory for the development of age spots. They propose that aged basal cells contain lipofuscin bodies cannot be removed and might promote the aging of neighboring, generating a feedback loop whereby more and more neighbor cells become aged and lipofuscin-containing. Such cells might then aggregate into a spot with an irregular shape. They propose that the protruding of a flat spot is a result of the death of aged cells in the spot and release of lipofuscin bodies. The aggregating cells would form a capsule, and the dense lipofuscin bodies make the protruding spot soft and dark in color. However, this proposal appeared as a preprint in 2015, has little direct empirical support, and has never been published in a peer reviewed journal. Another group has reported that \\"age spots\\" taken from human skin biopsies of patients facial senile lentigo of Fitzpatrick skin type III or IV aged 55-62 are enriched with senescent fibroblasts compared to surrounding skin. The dark coloration appeared to be due to higher melanin levels and activity of tyrosinase in the senescent fibroblasts than in the controls, potentially related to lower SDF1 expression. Patients were then administered six weekly treatments of microneedle fractional radiofrequency aimed at eliminating dermal senescent fibroblasts; this led to a marked decrease in epidermal pigmentation compared to baseline, accompanied by a decrease in the synthesis of collagen and the normalization of suppressed SDF1 expression. Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually done by a dermatologist. Treatment Treatment for liver spots is almost never done for health-related reasons, though it is sometimes done for aesthetic ones. Skin-bleaching products that inhibit pigmentation or cosmetic creams containing the ingredients alpha hydroxy acids or retinoids are known to be effective. Liver spots can also be frozen off with liquid nitrogen (that is, via cryosurgery).

It offers Jewish religious and cultural education as well as conventional secular education for students from Kindergarten to Year 12 though its two school components: \\"a full-time primary school\\", and high school. It is the only Jewish day school in WA. Notable students include singer Troye Sivan and his brother and musician Tyde Levi. History The Perth Hebrew School, housed by The Perth Hebrew Congregation was the forerunner to Carmel School. In 1957 a Jewish kindergarten was opened with 17 pupils, which led to the creation of Carmel School in 1959. Its first location was adjacent to the Brisbane Street synagogue, before moving to the current location in Yokine in 1962. The junior high school was opened in 1974 and in 1978 the senior high school was completed.Carmel School History In November 2006 it opened a state-of-the-art Early Learning Centre which houses students from Kindergarten to Year 1. Since 2008, the school has hosted annual meetings by The Australian Association for Religious Education entitled \\"Common History ‚Äì Shared Future\\", which are \\"about Judaism [and] featuring some eminent Jewish educators and speakers from around the world\\". In 2009, on the 80th birthday of Carmel School Life Member Harry Hoffman OAM, the school published a book about his life entitled Hate Never Sat at My Table. The author was then-principal Christina Dullard. In honour of Hoffman's (and the Korsunski's) philanthropic contributions to Carmel, in the same year the school was renamed H & S Hoffman and G Korsunski Carmel School. On 13 September 2009 the Kadima Performing Arts Centre, a state-of-the-art building for drama and arts and media was opened. It also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009. In 2012, the drama theatre was named the Nassim Family Theatre, in lovely memory of Gladys Nassim at a cocktail evening. In 2017, the School hosted its first High School musical Little Shop of Horrors, in the Nassim Theatre to sell-out crowds. The school has officially adopted The Jewish War Memorial (located on Fraser Avenue, Kings Park). It seeks to do research into the military servicemen. The school has also adopted the Memorial to the Victims of the Holocaust. In 2010, the Ishioka and Lara Hana Brady, the subjects of the book Hana's Suitcase were invited to visit Carmel and speak about the Holocaust. In 2011, the school officially opened its new gym. In 2011, \\"in commemoration of Gilad Shalit‚Äôs captivity, members of the executive went into Carmel School, and delivered a presentation in honour of Gilad Shalit\\". They gave out yellow ribbons to students, and encouraged them to sign the \\"'hands for hope' banner, which was sent to Gilad Shalit's tent in Jerusalem\\". The school holds annual Jewish camps for students, which are hosted by Israeli madrichim. Relationship with community Carmel School is at the heart of the Perth Jewish community and is situated in the same area as the Jewish Centre, Maccabi Grounds, The Maurice Zeffert Home, and other Jewish facilities. It upholds a relationship with all these places, as well as the synagogues located in Perth. Due to the Maurice Zeffert Home's close proximity to Carmel School, the residents at the aged care facility are entertained with performances by and visits from Carmel School Students at regular intervals. Motto and vision Carmel School's motto is Emunah V'da‚Äôat (English: Faith and Knowledge) and is the philosophy of the school. This motto is displayed on the school crest. The vision of the school is Am Yisrael Chai.School approach The Carmel experience is empathetic, academically rigorous, of high quality and grounded within the practices and traditions of Modern Orthodox Judaism and Zionism. Students benefit from a stimulating academic environment, while being simultaneously encouraged to delve deeply into their faith and culture, thereby understanding themselves and their potential. This is the School motto 'Faith and Knowledge' in practice. Religion Hebrew and Jewish Studies are both WACE subjects which are taught to high school students, while various Judaica topics are taught to the younger students. Praying is compulsory every morning before school commences. Debbie Posner is the Torah enrichment teacher, and Debbi Benn is the Head of Primary School Hebrew and Jewish Studies. Simon Lawrence is the Director of Jewish Studies for the School The entire campus has a No Meat Policy and all food on site is encouraged to be in accordance with the kashrut laws. Education The school has no enrolment fee and a fee schedule for the School is available on request. The School's goal is for all Jewish children to be able to access a Carmel education and so it offers fee assistance where possible, on application. In Australian Jewish high schools, Holocaust education is taught as part of the Jewish Studies curriculum under Contemporary Jewish History. A study of Jewish schools in Australia by Sophie E. Gelski entitled The Missing Paradigm, cited Dr Judith Berman's research Berman's 1998 and 2001 research, which focused on \\"the Jewish day school experience in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, over a fifty year period\\". She noted that \\"although the time devoted to teaching the Holocaust had increased, it did vary between a one semester course at Carmel School\\". The School offers a range of WACE subjects including English and English Literature, Mathematics Specialist, Mathematics Methods, Mathematics Applications, Visual Arts, Drama, Music, Media Production and Analysis, Human Biology, Physics, Physical Education Studies, Chemistry, Politics and Law, Finance and Accounting, Business Management, Modern History, Religion and Life and Hebrew. In January 2009, the school had 67 computers but with the explosion of IT in both the community and the education sector, the School has rapidly expanded its fleet of computers. Carmel now supports over 500 devices on its wired network, and 3000 devices on its wireless networks, allowing an open and connected teaching and learning environment for Staff and Students. With a focus on enhanced educational outcomes, the School embraced the rich Windows10 learning environment issuing staff and students from Year 5 onwards with their own laptops for teaching and educational purposes. Carmel is further deploying these same learning technologies into classrooms down to Year 1, providing touch, stylus and other enhanced learning tools. School leaders Debbie Silbert has been President of the Board since 2016. Prior to that, Larry Rudman was the Board President.

Controversy In 1996, there was a case in which a mother who was a Reform Convert sought to have the Orthodox school accept her son for enrolment. A court case ensued in after \\"the [family] was handed a letter stating specific religious restrictions which would be placed on their son because he was not Jewish according to Orthodox definitions, and therefore prohibited by halacha from participating in some school programs. The Equal Opportunity Tribunal handed down a 46-page document in which it dismissed the family's complaint.\\"http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives/PKaperth.htm The result of the Goldberg vs. Korsunski Carmel School case, delivered in 1999, was significant for all religious schools, as it effectively allowed \\"such school to discriminate in favour of members of that particular religion or creed, as long as the discrimination is in 'good faith'\\". The Equal Opportunity Tribunal defined 'good faith' as \\"in accordance with practices or beliefs of that religion or creed\\", and added that it was not required of the school to have to justify those practises or beliefs to \\"the outside world\\". In 2008, a Carmel School science teacher committed suicide after being \\"linked to child sex-offense allegations\\". The 15-year-old was not a Carmel student. The lawyers involved in the case said he had been led to believe the youth was 17, when in reality he was underage. The then Carmel School Board President told newspaper JTA \\"the school board had [already] decided to suspend him because of the allegations\\". He was not able to be formally notified as he \\"died the next day\\". His funeral was attended by over 500 people, including many Carmel students and teachers.

As Transport Minister, Batchelor oversaw the $750 million Regional Fast Rail project. In 2000, the State Government approved funding to upgrade rail lines to provide fast rail passenger services between Melbourne and Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong and Traralgon. As Minister for Energy and Resources, Batchelor initiated the roll-out of smart meters to 2.5 million homes and businesses. The roll-out of smart meters was reportedly to assist with consumer choice on electricity providers and to help manage climate change. However, the roll-out was stopped when the budget blew-out from $800 million to $2 billion. The roll-out was completed under the Andrews Government in 2015. According to Melbourne public transport academic Paul Mees, Batchelor \\"was staunchly against privatisation when in opposition and then continued with privatisation and reprivatisation in government. On 7 October 2010 Batchelor announced, he would not re-contest his seat at the 2010 state election. He retired at that election. Dorothy, his partner, was also reported to be retiring from work. Other roles Prior to entering politics, Batchelor was a union official at Furnishing Trades Union, 1972-1982. From 1983 to 1990, he was ALP Victorian branch state secretary. In February, 2012, Batchelor was appointed President of the Community Broadcasting Foundation. The Foundation, based in Melbourne, is the independent funding body annually distributing over $15m of federal grants to 220 Australian community based media organisations. Campaign disputes Batchelor reportedly, \\"helped organise and distribute bogus how-to-vote cards for the Nuclear Disarmament Party\\" (sic) during the 1985 Nunawading by- election. The voting cards appeared to represent the voting preferences of the Nuclear Disarmament Party. Campaigning for nuclear disarmament was popular left-wing politics during the 1980s. Police investigated the matter and Batchelor was not charged with any criminal offence. In 2016, Batchelor was filmed removing a Greens election banner and replacing it with ALP election material in the seat of Batman. It was claimed, Greens election campaigners had blanketed polling booths with their material leaving no space for other campaigners.

The film laboratory managers can charge by the footage or by time used while in lab.  History  In the early days of motion pictures, films were processed by winding on flat racks and then dipping in tanks of solution. As films became longer, such methods proved to be too cumbersome. Processes Exposed motion picture film will be processed according to exact chemical prescriptions at measured temperature as well as over measured time. After processing there is an original, the camera or picture original, in most cases a negative. From it a first sample is exposed on a motion-picture film printer. Again after processing there is a positive ready for inspection by the production representatives, usually by projection in the dark just like one sees a movie in a theatre.

Each of the sea temples was established within eyesight of the next to form a chain along the south- western coast. In addition to Balinese mythology, the temple was significantly influenced by Hinduism. At the base of the rocky island, venomous sea snakes are believed to guard the temple from evil spirits and intruders. The temple is purportedly protected by a giant snake, which was created from Nirartha's selendang (a type of sash) when he established the island.  Restoration  In 1980, the temple's rock face was starting to crumble and the area around and inside the temple started to become dangerous.Pringle, p 192-194 The Japanese government then provided a loan to the Indonesian government of Rp 800 billion (approximately US$130 million1980 exchange rate of US $1 to Rp 6000 from Gordon De Brouwer, Masahiro Kawai.

As a result, over one third of Tanah Lot's \\"rock\\" is actually cleverly disguised artificial rock created during the Japanese-funded and supervised renovation and stabilization program.  Tourism  Sacred water at Tanah Lot temple Entrance tickets cost 20,000 Rupiah for Indonesian nationals (Rp 15,000 for children), but foreigners have to pay three times the price, or Rp 60,000 (Rp 30,000 for children). To reach the temple, visitors must walk through a set of Balinese market-format souvenir shops which cover each side of the path down to the sea. On the mainland clifftops, restaurants have also been provided for tourists.  Location  This tourist attraction is located in Beraban, Kediri, Tabanan, approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) south of Tabanan.

He is regarded as the founder of the English gardens in Germany, which he introduced to the German experts with his writings on garden design. His manner of grouping and choice of plants is still used to an extent in German landscaping today. Career Sckell was trained in the Court Market Garden in Schwetzingen near Mannheim and worked after his apprenticeship in Bruchsal, Paris, and Versailles. From 1773 to 1777, he was in England busying himself with English-style gardening. Upon his return, Sckell redesigned the gardens of Sch√∂nbusch Park in Aschaffenburg for the Prince-Electors of Mainz and Archbishop Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal in the English style, as well as those of Sch√∂ntal Park. Afterwards he was responsible for the beginning of the Schwetzinger Gardens as a scenic park, and along with Benjamin Thompson, was commissioned by Prince Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria in 1789 to begin the Englischer Garten in Munich. In the time following the Englischer Garten, Sckell spent a short time in service of the rulers of Baden, before he was called back in 1803 to Munich, where, as the Director of Royal Gardens, he completed the Englischer Garten. He then transformed the regular garden of Nymphenburg Park into a more scenic arrangement. As a landscape gardener, Sckell was also responsible for beginning the castle gardens at Biebrich and Oppenweiler, and possibly those at Dirmstein as well. Inscription on the Memorial to Ludwig von Sckell in the Englischer Garten, Munich In 1808, Sckell received the title Knight of Sckell, which added the \\"von\\" to his name. He died in 1823 in Munich as a Court Garden Director, and was buried in the Alter S√ºdfriedhof there. A monument in the Englischer Garten was erected in his honor.

Playing as either a right winger or striker, he was part of the Odense team that won the 2002 Danish Cup, and he made his debut for the Danish national team in April 2003. After a successful 2005‚Äì06 season, where he was called up for his second Danish national team game in March 2006, he attracted the interest of Norwegian team Viking FK. He was spotted in Stavanger by a journalist, where he received a contract offer from the Norwegian club. On June 6, 2006, it was reported that Berg had accepted the contract offer.< and the club confirmed the signing three days later. Randers FC However, in the 2007‚Äì08 season, in January, Berg decided to move back to Denmark because he liked the Danish play style better than the style in Norway. He signed a three-year binding contract with the Danish SAS liga club Randers FC. Berg made his first appearance for Randers in the Danish Cup quarter finals where he was in the starting line forming an attack duo with the also newly arrived teammate Marc Nygaard but was forced off the pitch soon after the start whistle due to an injury in his back. However the injury was not serious and Berg was back on the field the next week. Berg scored his first goal for Randers FC on April 19, 2009.

At a young age he started playing adventure games, when they were just text adventures. He wrote his first game, Obsidian, while he was at school and sent it to Artic Computing for consideration. Artic's director, Charles Cecil, loved the game and convinced him to license it to Artic, and then to join Artic as a programmer. At Artic he wrote, together with Adam Waring, Ultima Ratio which was published in 1987 by Firebird. In the same year he got a job at Cecil's Paragon Programming, where games from US publishers were converted to European platforms. When Cecil had left to work for U.S. Gold, Warriner started doing 8-bit programming for games. In 1988 he created Death Stalker, published by Codemasters. In the same year he joined Cascade Games, where he worked on 19 Part One: Boot Camp, Arcade Trivia Quiz, and Arcade Trivia Quiz Question Creator. In 1989 Warriner moved to Bytron Aviation Systems based in Kirmington, Lincolnshire, where he wrote software for the aviation industry, David Sykes was his fellow programmer. In March 1990 Cecil, Sykes, Noirin Carmody and Warriner founded Revolution Software. For their first game he wrote an innovative engine, called Virtual Theatre, which enabled the gameworld to be more active and dynamic than was previously possible. The game's title became Lure of the Temptress and it was published in 1992. It was followed by a string of other critically and commercially successful adventure games, including Beneath a Steel Sky, the Broken Sword series, In Cold Blood and Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado. Beneath a Steel Sky and Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars are often both referred to as one of the best adventures of all time, appearing on numerous \\"top\\" adventure game lists and receiving several awards and nominations. Warriner (with others) received a nomination for Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2004 and for Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - The Director‚Äôs Cut at the British Academy Video Games Awards in 2010. With Steve Ince he began to explore new ideas and in 2006 he founded 720games to publish their own gaming projects. In the same year he presented his game Blocster, a single player puzzle game. Besides his work on new editions of Beneath a Steel Sky and the first two Broken Sword Games (2009/2010), he worked on various games that weren't developed by Revolution, including A Christmas Carol and Sticky Blocks. Warriner is currently working at Shifty Eye Games, and writing a Metroidvania game on the side. Biography Early career In his youth Tony Warriner started playing adventures when they were just text adventures. Games like the original Unix Adventure, Zork and the Level 9 games were rich experiences for him and would inspire his future career. Still at school, he learned how to program and he started to write a game in assembly code. He succeeded to complete a game by himself, failed all his exams in the process, but he managed to get a job with the game. That job was at Artic Computing, a company where Charles Cecil, upcoming co-founder of Revolution, had already been working for a couple of years during his studies. Warriner lived close to where Artic was based (Brandesburton, near Hull) and, about seventeen years old, he had sent in his game for consideration. In the game, Obsidian, the avatar moves around in a jet-pack to fix power terminals in a space station, while picking up items and avoiding the defenses of the station. Cecil, who considered it to be brilliant, convinced him to have it published by Artic. Warriner then came to work for Artic (1985). The cassette tape game was released for the Amstrad CPC in 1986. His next game, which he wrote together with Adam Waring, was Ultima Ratio, a vertical scrolling arcade shoot 'em up, set in space above the earth. Like Obsidian it exhibits colorful rooms that were typical for his early designs. Because Artic was already coming to an end, the game was finished for Telecomsoft and published in 1987 by Firebird. In the same year he got a new job at Paragon Programming, started by Cecil, and at Paragon various games were converted to other platforms. When Cecil went to work for U.S. Gold, Warriner drifted around for some time, doing 8-bit games programming here and there. One of the games he created in this period was Death Stalker. The arcade adventure is set in a mystical world of ghouls, spells and wizards, in which the player must find the lost key of darkness and descend to the deeper dungeons. Death Stalker, with music by David Whittaker, was published by Codemasters in 1988. In 1988 Warriner joined Cascade Games, where he worked on 19 Part One: Boot Camp (1988). Other games he worked on were Arcade Trivia Quiz and Arcade Trivia Quiz Question Creator, published by Zeppelin Games in 1989. In 1989 Warriner moved to Bytron where he wrote aviation software. David Sykes, who would become co-founder of Revolution, was his fellow programmer at Bytron, where they worked on a system to replace the strips of paper that were used in the towers at airports. The system was the first in the world to computerize those and, coming from the 8-bit gaming scene, they had no option but to encode their initials in the messages. Revolution Software Warriner didn't stay long at Bytron, as he was contacted by Cecil in 1989, who wanted to set up his own studio. Together with Sykes and Cecil's then- girlfriend Noirin Carmody they founded Revolution Software (March 1990). Warriner would stay a member (and co-owner) of the company till the present day. He would focus primarily on programming, but he also became involved in design, for which he is credited in various games. In March 1990, in an office located in Hull, he began to work on what would become Revolution's first game, Lure of the Temptress (1992). Warriner designed an innovative engine for the game, called Virtual Theatre, which was in some respects more versatile than the game engines used by LucasArts and Sierra at that time. One of its new features was that it allowed the in-game characters, instead of being static NPCs, to wander around the game world independently of each other, living their own lives and doing their own thing. The game became, critically as well as commercially, one of the many successful games that would follow. The next games he worked on were Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (1996) and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror (1997). The typical Virtual Theatre features shown in Lure of the Temptress were scaled back in Beneath a Steel Sky, as they were hard to design for and more suitable to RPGs. New features were added to Steel Sky though, such as an object-oriented system, a new conversation system and a sophisticated, separate conversation editor. The cinematic Broken Sword games included more scripted events, cutscenes and parallax scrolling, as well as a new user interface and a conversation system with subject icons that didn't reveal what the main character was going to say. Though it was released only a year after the original game, Broken Sword II added more technical advances. The sequel included an Easter egg for the first time in Revolution's games, and a couple of years later Warriner revealed that the port of Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars to the Game Boy Advance would include ‚Äì unlike the PC version - an Easter egg as well. The biggest change in the GBA version is the control interface that replaced the point-and-click method by direct control. The original games used a version of the Virtual Theatre engine, which was updated frequently. He continued to work on all the games that would be published in the next decade. As In Cold Blood (2000) was the first one of the 3D games that would follow, he had to write new functionality to the game engine, and he worked on story design as well. In the same year Gold and Glory: The Road to El Dorado was published, a game that was based on the animated film, The Road to El Dorado. In this period he also worked on Good Cop Bad Cop, an action adventure for which a new in-house engine was developed, but the game, intended for the PS2, wasn't released. After these games the Broken Sword series was continued in real-time 3D with Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon (2003). Unlike some other companies, they had deliberately waited to bring Broken Sword to 3D until they felt that they got the quality they wanted. And the move to 3D was fairly difficult, as many technical issues had to be dealt with that would never surface in a 2D game. Besides for AI programming, Warriner was credited for story, game and section design. For Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon he received together with Cecil, Steve Ince and Neil Richards a nomination for Excellence in Writing at the Game Developers Choice Awards 2004. In 2006 the fourth episode of the series, Broken Sword: The Angel of Death, was released, for which Warriner was credited for additional design. The game allowed the player to choose between point-and-click and direct control. In 2009 and 2010 he was credited for his work on Beneath a Steel Sky - Remastered, Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars - The Director‚Äôs Cut, and Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror - Remastered. He considered the iPhone version as the best one, as the interface brings the player closer to the game by touching the screen. The Directors Cut of Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars includes another Easter egg, showing a room from Beneath a Steel Sky with one of its characters (the robot Joey) and the spaceman from Warriner's first game (Obsidian). For the game he received together with Cecil and Neil Richards a nomination in the category Story at the British Academy Video Games Awards in 2010. After the Director's Cut version of Broken Sword, Warriner started working on a brand new engine, Virtual Theatre version 7, in order to deal with multiple platforms and screen resolutions. The engine is used in Revolution's fifth Broken Sword game, entitled Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse, which was successfully funded in a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign updates included a video in which Warriner and Cecil talked about the game's characters and feedback. In October 2012 he set up a Tumblr blog, called Tony's Revolution Dev Blog. Other projects With Ince he began to explore new ideas and in 2006 he started 720games to publish their own gaming projects. In the same year he presented his game Blocster, a single player puzzle game. Besides working on Revolution's games and Blocster, Warriner has also been working on various games that were (partially) developed by other companies. He worked on Disney's Story Studio: Disney's Mulan (Disney Interactive, Inc., Kids Revolution, 1999). He was also involved in A Christmas Carol (Nintendo DS, Sumo Digital, Ltd., 2009). With Jeff Rollason of AI Factory he created a new follow-up to its puzzle game Move it!. The game, entitled Sticky Blocks, was released in 2011. Personal life Warriner (Malton, October 19, 1968) is married to artist Tanya Riarey. His daughter, Ella, is credited in Sticky Blocks and The Director's Cut. Professionally, he is highly interested in the latest hardware and software developments. His dream setup (2011) is an iMac with a 2500 x 1600 screen and a massive SSD. Once asked about which of his games he was most proud of, his answer was that it would probably be Beneath a Steel Sky, as it was hard to do with very limited resources, and achieved a minor cult status. Warriner is an active member of Revolution's own forum and has accounts on various social media.

Background In 1830, the English whaling company Samuel Enderby & Sons appointed John Biscoe master of the brig Tula and leader of an expedition to find new seal-hunting grounds in the Southern Ocean. Accompanied by the cutter Lively, the Tula left London and by December had reached the South Shetland Islands. The expedition then sailed further south, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 22 January 1831, before turning east at 60¬∞S. Just over a month later, on 24 February 1831, the expedition sighted bare mountain tops through the ocean ice. Biscoe correctly surmised that they were part of a continent and named the area Enderby Land in honour of his patrons. On 28 February a headland was spotted, which Biscoe named Cape Ann; the mountain atop the headland would later be named Mount Biscoe. Biscoe kept the expedition in the area while he began to chart the coastline, but after a month his and his crews' health were deteriorating. The expedition set sail toward Australia, reaching Hobart, Tasmania in May, but not before two crew members had died from scurvy. The expedition wintered in Hobart before heading back toward the Antarctic. On 15 February 1832 Adelaide Island was discovered, and two days later the Biscoe Islands. A further four days later, on 21 February, more extensive coastline was spotted. Surmising again that he had encountered a continent, Biscoe named the area Graham Land, after First Lord of the Admiralty Sir James Graham. One source suggests John Biscoe had sighted Anvers Island rather than the Antarctic continent and another that the expedition made a landing there. Before heading homeward, Biscoe again began charting the new coastline the expedition had found and by the end of April 1832 he had become the third man (after James Cook and Fabian von Bellingshausen) to circumnavigate the Antarctic continent. On the journey home, one calamity befell the expedition: in July, the Lively was wrecked at the Falkland Islands. The expedition nonetheless returned to London safely by the beginning of 1833. As well as exploring the Antarctic coastline, the expedition had also tried in vain to rediscover the Aurora Islands and Nimrod Islands. These were islands in the Southern Ocean that other mariners had claimed to have found, but eventually, during the twentieth century, they were declared to be phantoms.

A fighter pilot and a strategist, he briefly served at command level in the ISI before controversially promoted as a four-star air officer to command the air force in 2000. In 2001-02, he also commanded and provided the strategy to deploy troops during the military standoff with India. In addition, Air Chief Marshal Mir later went onto facilitate the United States military's war logistics for war operations in Afghanistan. His appointment was cut short when a former PAF Fokker F-27 in which he was a passenger crashed near Kohat, Pakistan. His death has been subject of numerous conspiracy theories with many American authors charging him of having advanced-knowledge on terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. Biography F-6 in Flight: In 1971, Flying Officer Mir flew his F-6 Farmer against the Indian Air Force's MiG-21, shooting down the Indian MiG with his missile. Mushaf Ali Mir was born in Lahore, Punjab in India on 5 March 1947. He hailed from the lower middle class family and was of the Kashmiri descent, that practiced the Shia'a principles of Islam.http://www.paffalcons.com/cas/mushaf-ali-mir.php His father, Farzand Ali Mir, was a calligrapher who died when Mushaf was still young. He attended Govt. Wattan Islamia High School in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.Khawaja Naseer. \\"A jewel of the Walled City\\" Daily Times, 22 February 2003 Upon his matriculation from a local school in Lahore, Mir initially attended the Government College University but joined the Pakistan Air Force in 1966 which directed him to attend the famed Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur, after the second war with India. In 1967, he gained commission in the Pakistan Air Force as a P/Off. in the GD(P) branch. At the PAF Academy, he qualified to fly the F-6 Farmer fighter jet, and was posted to join the No. 25 Squadron Night Strike Eagles in 1970. In 1971, F/Off. Mir successfully flew his F-6 Farmer against the Indian Air Force's MiG-21, and was credited with shooting the Indian Air Force's jet down with his missile. After the war in 1971, Flt-Lt. Mir attended the Air War College where he attained his masters in War studies, and later went on to attend the National Defence University where he graduated with masters in Strategic studies. During this time, he became acquainted with then-Brig. Pervez Musharraf. War and command appointments in the military In the 1970s, Mir joined the Combat Commander's School, first serving as a student before joining its faculty, eventually commanding an Aggressor squadron composing of Dassault Mirage IIIER to act as an Indian IAF's MiG-29M. Wing-Commander Mir was a commanding officer of the No. 33 Wing attached at the Northern Air Command and later took over the command of the Southern Air Command as its AOC. In the 1980s, Gp-Capt. Mir was posted as an air attach√© at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. in United States. He qualified to fly the F-16 Fighting Falcon, for which he received training from the Nellis Air Force Base, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. In 1994‚Äì95, Air- Commodore Mir, as an ACAS (Plans) at Air AHQ, visited Poland to hold discussions to acquire the Russian Su-27 Flanker but returned since the aircraft was not available. In 1995, AVM Mir was appointed as Project-Director of Project Green Flash, aiming to acquire Mirage 2000-V from France, and begin his lobbying to acquire the aircraft after test piloting the fighter jet. In 1996, Air Vice Marshal Mir was appointed as s Project-Director of Project Falcon that was started negotiating with Turkey and Jordan to acquire F-16As/Bs. In 1996-99, Air Vice Marshal Mir took over the command of the Northern Air Command headquartered in Peshawar, and became associated with the ISI, where he aided in providing the aerial support during the civil war in Afghanistan. During this time, Air Vice Marshal Mir was posted as a military adviser to the Saudi Arabian Army and later assumed the short-time command of the Pakistan Armed Forces-Middle East Command before returning to Pakistan for the command appointments. In 1999, Air-Mshl. Mir was appointed as the chairman of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex at Kamra. Chief of Air Staff In 2000, ACM PQ Mehdi's retirement was confirmed by President Rafiq Tarar, and the Pakistan MoD sent potentials list of three-star air officers for the promotion of the four-star rank. At the time of promotion to the four-star appointment, there were six senior air marshals who were in the race which included in seniority: **Air-Mshl. Farooq Qari‚ÄìVice Chief of Air Staff at Air AHQ in Islamabad. **Air-Mshl. Zahid Anis‚ÄìDCAS (Air Operations) at Air AHQ in Islamabad. **Air- Mshl. Qazi Javed Ahmad‚ÄìDCAS (Personnel) at Air AHQ in Islamabad. **Air-Mshl. Pervez Iqbal Mirza‚ÄìAOC Southern Air Command headquartered in Karachi. **Air- Mshl. Riazuddin Shaikh‚ÄìDCAS (Administration) at Air AHQ in Islamabad. **Air- Mshl. Mushaf Ali Mir‚ÄìChairman of Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) in Kamra. Eventually, the race for the appointment for the air chief was rumored between Air Marshal Farooq Qari and Air Marshal Riazuddin. On 13 November 2000, President Rafiq Tarar surprisingly approved the appointment of junior-most Air-Mshl. Mir to be promoted to as the four-star air officer in the air force, and appointed him as the Chief of Air Staff. The surprise promotion and command appointment was said to be at the behest of special and personal requests made by then-Chairman Joint chiefs Gen. Pervez Musharraf.\\"5 Pak Air Marshals to retire on Monday\\" Daily Excelsior, 18 November 2000 This appointment was one of the center of controversies in the Musharraf administration when superseding air officers had sparked off \\"rumblings of resentment\\" at the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) in the country. All five superseding air force generals tendered their resignations to President Tarar despite Chairman Joint chiefs Gen. Musharraf's efforts to have all five air force generals to complete their respected terms. In news media, the appointment was also given a strong criticism when the Gen. Musharraf's clique attempted a damage control exercise by pointing out that supersessions were nothing new in the country's military establishment having happened five times in the Air Force and at least four times in the Army. Despite the agitation and criticism, Air Chief Marshal Mir eventually assumed the command of the air force as its chief on 20 November 2000. After the deadly terrorist attacks in New York in the United States in 2001, ACM Mir successfully negotiated with the United States Air Force of releasing the spare parts and updating the software of the F-16s. During his tenure, the PAF's F-6 aircraft were retired from service, and were transferred to Bangladeshi Air Force. During the military standoff with the Indian Army, ACM Mir placed the air force at war level command, issuing orders for targeting the Indian military posts. In spite of his closeness to President Musharraf, ACM Mir had strongly objected and opposed the Musharraf administration's policy on War on Terror, that he suspected of intelligence blowback and terror organizations that might be finding the foreign support for their operations to spread sectarian violence in the country. Death in the air crash PIA Fokker F27 in flight, a similar but military Fokker F-27 that was involved in crash in 2003. On 20 February 2003, Air Chief Marshal Mushaf Ali Mir boarded on a Fokker F-27 aircraft operated by the Air Force, alongside with his wife and 15 senior air force officers from Chaklala Air Force Base for a routine flight to Northern Air Command based in Kohat, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan to review the U.S. military's war logistics in Afghanistan. The plane lost contact from its military radars at the Northern Air Command and crashed after hitting the highest peak of the mountain at the Tolanj mountain range in Kohat due to an extreme fog and winter temperature. Among the casualties were other high- ranking officials of the Pakistan Air Force, including two Principal Staff Officers ‚Äì Air Vice Marshal Abdul Razzaq, DCAS (Training&Evaluation;) and Air Vice Marshal Saleem Nawaz, DCAS (Administration) ‚Äì and the air crew.\\"Obituary: Dedicated to the Glorious PAF Shaheeds\\" Defence Journal, March 2003 Upon his accidental death, the Pakistan government give him a state funeral, with many foreign dignitaries attending his funeral and was buried in Mominpura cemetery in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. The Air Force Flight Safety and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) ruled out the \\"act of sabotage\\" and termed the incident as an accident. Additional inquiries in 2015 resulted by the air force and civilian investigations, the Government declared the aircraft as faulty, not an act of sabotage. Further military insights revealed at the parliamentary committee noted that the aircraft was in fact faulty as it was earlier identified by first the Navy's inspected team as early as in 1993. The Navy purchased the aircraft for its reconnaissance missions before it was transferred to Army Aviation in 1993, which then transferred the plane to Air Force in 1994, which never reviewed the inspection protocol to assess the performance of the aircraft. Reactions United States: American ambassador to Pakistan Nancy Jo Powell expressed her sorrow and grief over the tragic air crash on behalf of the United States. Iran: Iranian President Syed Mohammad Khatami convened a message to President Pervez Musharraf saying: \\"While expressing condolence and sympathy to Your Excellency as well as the noble people of Pakistan, I pray to Almighty Allah for forgiveness and Divine blessings for the deceased, and patience and fortitude for the survivors.\\" Afghanistan: Afghan President Hamid Karzai sent a cable where he noted: \\"On behalf of the people, government of transitional Islamic state of Afghanistan and on my own behalf, I would like to express deepest sorrow and condolences to Your Excellency and to the families of the victims and to the brotherly people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.\\" India: Indian air chief Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy conveyed sympathies on behalf of the Indian IAF and his own behalf on the sudden and untimely demise of Mushaf Ali Mir. Pakistan: Foreign Minister K.M. Kasuri termed the death of Air Chief Marshal Mushaf Ali Mir a great loss for Pakistan and its military, and he quoted: \\"We have lost one of our great sons and a fine soldier; he was an outstanding soldier and his services to Pakistan will always be remembered.\\" Conspiracy theories 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001. Many American authors have leveled charges on Air Chief Marshal Mir having the advanced knowledge during his time as a spymaster in ISI in 1999. Since the plane crash in 2003, Air Chief Marshal Mir's death has attracted significant amount of attention and has been subject of conspiracy theories in media and literature. According to the Gerald Posner, an American journalist, Mir's death in a plane crash was not an accident but an act of sabotage, which he claimed in his book: \\"Why America Slept: The Failure to Prevent 911.\\", written in 2003. Several American authors of counterterrorism studies have suspected him of having advanced intelligence knowledge on the planning of the terrorist attacks in the United States by al- Qaeda, during his time when Mir was serving in the ISI as its spymaster. Subsequently, Posner and his American colleagues have claimed that Osama bin Laden and other Afghan Arabs had struck a deal with Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) through Mir in 1996 to get protection, arms, and supplies for Al-Qaeda. The meeting was blessed by the Saudi royal family through Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud‚Äî the Saudi intelligence chief. However, after the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, and a reversal of Pakistani and Saudi stances favoring the Afghan Taliban and their allies al-Qaeda, the three Saudi princes associated with the deals died within days, and seven months after that, Mir's plane crashed in Kohat region of Pakistan. Prince Turki bin Faisal, on the other hand, was removed as intelligence chief and sent as Ambassador to United Kingdom during the same time.Johanna McGeary. \\"Confessions of a Terrorist\\" Time Magazine, 31 August 2003 In 2015, the Air Force's Flight Inquiry Board and the CAA dismissed the claims of sabotage when they submitted their year long investigation reports to the Public Accounts Committee of the Pakistan Parliament, citing the poor maintenance of the aircraft. They backed up their evidence when identifying the faulty Fokker F27 Friendship that the Air Force had transferred the plane to Navy but the aircraft was returned to the Air Force due to its faults during its flight. According to the analysis written in 2003 by Najam Sethi, a Pakistani commentator, the claims might have been \\"untrue\\" but the allegations are very explosives directed towards the Pakistani military.

History Valen√ßa origins date back from Roman times. The two existent Roman roads are the proof (the Via IV of Antonine Itinerary XIX, of military use, and the designated per loca mar√≠tima - Itinerary XX -, of commercial use). Also inside the fortified walls a Roman milestone marks the XLII mile of the road connecting Braga to Tui. This stronghold was populated by order of King Sancho I during the 12th century. It was called Contrasta which means \\"village opposed to another\\", Tui (Spain) in this case. King Afonso III changed its name to Valen√ßa in the 13th century. Its historical importance is mainly due to military constraints. It had a decisive role for the defense and integrity of Portugal from the neighbouring Spain. Today the town is peacefully invaded by the Spanish that visit it with commercial and touristic purposes, the Portuguese still use the fortress. Attractions The fortress *The fortress :The most interesting things to visit are mainly inside the fortress that looks down to the Minho River and Galicia. They have been destroyed several times whether it were the Barbarians, the Moors, the armies of Asturias and Leon or even the French troops in the 19th century, they have always been restored and still very well preserved. :Valen√ßa's fortress is a piece of gothic and baroque military architecture. The first walls were built in the 13th century. It was upgraded during the 17th and 18th century forming the present bulwarked system. It is placed on top of two small hills and it is formed by two polygons (the Recinto Magistral and the Coroada) separated by a ditch and with four doors (Coroada, Gaviarra, Fonte da Vila and Sol). The main entrance is Porta do Sol (Sun's door). This door was damaged during the Napoleonic invasions. The old international bridge *The old international bridge :In 1879 Portugal and Spain agreed to construct a bi-functional (road and train) bridge. The bridge was built inspired in Eiffel works. The bridge is still in use although a new bridge was built south of the older one. *Roman milestone :Located inside the fortress this Roman milestone dates back from the 1st century AD. It has the following inscription: :TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS CAESER AUGUSTUS GERMANICUS PONTIFEX MAXIMUS. IMPERATOR V CONSUL III, TRIBUNICIA POTESTATE III. PATER PATRIAE BRACARA XLII. :It marks 42 Roman miles' (62 km) distance on the road from Braga to Tui and the Emperor Claudius ordered its construction when the Via IV of Antonine was rebuilt.

It is the only secondary school in the Silver Lake Regional School District, comprising the towns of Kingston, Plympton and Halifax, Massachusetts. From 1955 to 2004, the Silver Lake Regional School District included the town of Pembroke, Massachusetts. History Named for Silver Lake, which borders the four towns which belonged to the district for most of its history ‚Äì Plympton, Halifax, Pembroke and Kingston - and which is situated near the campus, Silver Lake Regional High School opened on September 19, 1955, attended by students from the towns of Pembroke, Kingston, Plympton, Halifax and Carver in southeastern Massachusetts. The school was constructed for $1.7 million, and originally housed grades 7‚Äì12. Over ten thousand spectators attended the dedication, which was keynoted by Senator Leverett Saltonstall.The Torch (SLHRS yearbook), 1956, p. 77. The original graduating class was 81 students. Beginning with the 1959 school year, Carver left the district, and its students began attending Middleboro High School, before joining the Plymouth-Carver regional school district in 1963. In 1958, the seventh and eighth grades were split off into the former Kingston High School building (which stood behind the current Kingston Police Department headquarters), which became the first Silver Lake Junior High. In 1968, the region built a new junior high school building on Route 27 in Pembroke. After the completion of Route 3 in 1962, the Silver Lake towns ‚Äì as did the South Shore generally - experienced explosive population growth, well into the 1980s. The Silver Lake campus eventually grew too small for the growing populations of the towns ‚Äì their combined population nearly trebled between the founding of the district and 1970 ‚Äì and by 1970, the high school was on split sessions, becoming double sessions by 1974. In 1974 the district began construction on the Silver Lake-Pembroke Campus on Learning Lane in Pembroke. Construction took two years at a cost of $3.7 million (which was funded by Pembroke residents). At the same time, the original Silver Lake- Kingston campus underwent a major addition which added a second gymnasium, new classrooms and a new vocational wing. Silver Lake‚ÄìPembroke was scheduled to open in September 1976, but was delayed until November 1976 due to vandalism and a fire during the summer of 1976. The fire caused the new sprinkler system to flood the building's lower level, and carpeting and sheetrock had to be replaced and repainted. The school eventually housed grades 9‚Äì12 of Pembroke residents, while Kingston, Halifax and Plympton residents continued to attend at the original building. Silver Lake graduated its largest class, of 510 students, in 1981. Attendance peaked in 1980, when enrollment in the high school was 2100 students with just over 1000 students at the junior high. Subsequently, and throughout the 1980s, enrollment declined. In 1991, the region closed the junior high building, and converted the Pembroke campus to the junior high, while the Kingston campus once again became the sole high school campus, housing students from all four towns as it had prior to 1976. Attendance dropped from 2100 in 1980 to 1260 in 1993. Continued overcrowding in the school led Pembroke (with a population by 2000 half again what it was in 1970) to withdraw from the district and form its own independent school district in 2002; its students remained enrolled in Silver Lake until 2004. A new high school was constructed on the site of the original building, which opened in 2004. The school is one of the most expensive standing in Massachusetts and is adjacent to the district's middle school, the Silver Lake Middle School. The 1955 high school building stood until 2005 when it was torn down; however, the original football field, Sirrico Field, remains. The school was cited in Boston magazine as being one of the 2008 fifty top schools in eastern Massachusetts. Athletics The name for the Silver Lake teams is the Lakers. Tony Sirrico, who had taught and coached at Pembroke High School in the 1950s became the first athletic director at Silver Lake. He also coached football and baseball at Silver Lake. In 1955 Silver Lake was a Division III school in the South Shore Conference. In 1966 it moved up to Division II and joined the Old Colony League. In 1986 it moved to Division I. The school has a football program (1980 Division III Super Bowl Champions) and was regionally known for excelling in basketball (in which it won a state title in 1960, coached by future Boston Celtics assistant coach John Killilea ), hockey (in which it reached the Division II Eastern Mass Finals in 1977) and soccer (in which it won a state title in 1988). In 2005, after the withdrawal of the town of Pembroke, Silver Lake began competing in Division II. The Lakers now compete in the Patriot League of southeastern Massachusetts. For most of its existence, Silver Lake's chief rival was Plymouth-Carver High School, until the breakup of Plymouth-Carver into three separate high schools in 1988; thereafter, until the district's demerger, its chief rival was Bridgewater- Raynham Regional High School. The most notable current school rivalries are with Pembroke High School and Duxbury High School.

They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. Albatrosses also produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. While not all scientists believe it is a full species with some retaining it as a subspecies of the wandering albatross, a 2004 study of the mitochondrial DNA of the wandering albatross species complexBurg & Croxall (2004) supported the split. Other studies have shown it to be the most genetically distinct member of the wandering albatross superspecies.Brooke, M. (2004) This may be due to it diverging from their common ancestor before all its relatives, or because it underwent particularly strong genetic drift. Among the major experts, BirdLife International has split this species, Clements has not yet,Clements, J. (2007) and the SACC has a proposal on the table to split it.Remsen Jr., J. V. (2009) Etymology Diomedea refers to Diomedes, whose companions turned to birds.Gotch, A. F. (1995) Description It is practically indistinguishable from the wandering albatross at sea; the Tristan albatross is smaller and has a slightly darker back. The Tristan albatross is ? and has a wingspan of up to . The Tristan albatross also never attains the full white plumage of the wandering albatross, and its bill is about shorter.BirdLife International (2008a) Behavior The Tristan albatross feeds on fish and cephalopods. They breed biennially and will nest in wet heath from in elevation. They are monogamous, and do not start breeding until they are about 10 years old.Double, M. C. (2003) Range and habitat Due to the difficulty in distinguishing them from wandering albatrosses, their distribution at sea is still not fully known, but the use of satellite tracking has shown that they forage widely in the South Atlantic, with males foraging west of the breeding islands towards South America and females to the east towards Africa. There have been sightings near Brazil and also off the coast of Australia. Tristan albatrosses are endemic to the islands of the Tristan da Cunha group and more specifically Gough Island. The majority of the world's population nest on Gough Island, around 1500 pairs. On some years a pair breeds on Inaccessible Island. Conservation They were formerly threatened by introduced species, rats, cats and pigs, but these have now been removed from their breeding islands. However, this resulted in the population of mice, Mus musculus, increasing to the point where they would eat and kill albatross chicks en masse.Wanless, R. M. et al., (7 June 2007) Even though the chicks are huge compared to the mice, they do not know how to defend themselves appropriately. Today the main threat to the species is believed to be long-line fishing and these mice. Recent counts suggest that the population on Gough has decreased by 28% over 46 years, whereas population modelling predicts annual decline rates of 2.9‚Äì5.3%. More recent modelling, conducted over three generations since 1980, suggests a decline equivalent to a >96% reduction in population size over three generations, since declines began. The rate of decline is therefore placed here in the band of 80‚Äì100% over three generations (86 years). Formerly classified as an endangered species by the IUCN,Lee, J. (2008) it was suspected to be more threatened than generally assumed and undergoing a marked decline. Following the evaluation of its status, this was found to be correct, and the Tristan albatross was consequently uplisted to Critically Endangered status in 2008. They have an occurrence range of and a breeding range of . Footnotes References   External links *BirdLife Species Factsheet.

Biography He was born on 28 March 1884 and educated at Rugby School, before entering University College, University of Oxford to study Law. Upon completing his degree, he rejected the family law practice to study Medicine. After qualifying in 1911 and obtaining the FRCS, he turned to pathology and started to publish papers, with a brief interlude as a Red Cross surgeon in World War I. From 1915, he worked as a bacteriologist in charge of the Standards council, Oxford, and became a Fellow of University College. In 1936, he then became Professor of Bacteriology under Howard Florey at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford. During this period, he became involved in the penicillin project where he studied the effects of penicillin against the microbes most troublesome to humans, along with Jena Orr- Ewing.Robert Bud, Discoverers and developers of penicillin (act. 1928‚Äì1950), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, September 2004. He confirmed that penicillin was neither an enzyme, as previously thought, nor an antiseptic that killed them but that the microbes swelled and exploded or died without dividing. Along with his longstanding position as Chairman of the Board of Faculty of Medicine, this prestigious project aided his appointment by King George VI as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford. Some skeptics pointed out his friendship with the Prime Minister of the time, Clement Attlee, whom he met as an undergraduate at University College, as another reason. In 1953 he gave the Rede Lecture at the University of Cambridge on 'The proper study of mankind'. He retired to Devon in 1956. He died on 28 January 1977.

She married Puyi when the latter was the nominal ruler of Manchukuo, a puppet state established by the Empire of Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Biography Li Yuqin was a Han Chinese woman who was born in Changchun to a middle class family from Shandong. Her father, Li Degui was a translator to a local missionary organisation, while her mother, Wang Xiuru, was the owner of a small silk farm in Changchun‚Äôs outskirts. Both sides of Li‚Äôs family served the imperial court, with her paternal great grandmother being the wet nurse to the Tongzhi Emperor‚Äôs daughter and her maternal family being court physicians. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, many people who worked in the imperial court were banished by republican forces to the countryside provinces, which is how the Li family ended up in the commoner class. Li has two brothers and three sisters and had a relatively happy childhood. Li attended Nanling Girls' Academy (Êñ∞‰∫¨ÂçóÂ∂∫Â•≥Â≠êÂÑ™Á¥öÂ≠∏Ê†°) in Changchun, then known as Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo. In February 1943, Li and nine other girl students were taken by their principal Kobayashi and teacher Fujii to a photography studio for portraits. Three weeks later, the school principal and teacher visited Li's home and told her that Manchukuo's emperor Puyi had ordered her to go to the palace to study. She was first taken directly to Yasunori Yoshioka, who thoroughly questioned her. Yoshioka then drove her back to her parents and told them Puyi ordered her to study at the palace. Money was promised to the parents. She was subjected to a medical examination and then taken to Puyi's sister Yunhe and instructed in palace protocol. Li then became a concubine of Puyi and was given the title of Noble Lady Fu (Á¶èË≤¥‰∫∫). She lived a lavish lifestyle and had many servants. Puyi favoured her and despite the fact that he would often have sex with her, she never became pregnant. She was also in charge of the imperial household as Empress Wanrong was an opium addict and was under house arrest for having affairs with Puyi‚Äôs retainers. In 1945 the Manchukuo regime collapsed following the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. Li attempted to flee from Changchun, alongside Puyi, Empress Wanrong and other remaining members of the old Qing court. Empress Wanrong was experiencing significant opium withdrawal symptoms at that time. She, as well as the rest of Puyi's family was evacuated with him by train from Changchun to Dalizigou. From there, however, Puyi continued by plane with only two of his sisters, his brothers, three nephews, his physician and a servant to Mukden, where he was arrested and taken to the Soviet Union.Puyi (Swedish): Jag var kejsare av Kina (I was the emperor of China) (1988) According to Puyi, Li Yuqin was very frightened and begged to be taken with him, when he left from Dalizigou to Mukden, but he assured her that she and Wanrong could reach Japan as well by train. Some documents state that Puyi let the women go by train in the belief that women would be better treated by the military than men. They were shortly arrested by Soviet forces and sent to a prison in Changchun. Empress Wanrong died shortly in the same year before Li was released in 1946 and sent back home. She worked in a textile factory and in a library in Changchun, studying the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. In 1955 she began visiting Puyi in prison. After applying to the Chinese authorities for a divorce, the government responded on her next prison visit by showing her to a room with a double bed and ordered her to reconcile with Puyi, and she said the couple obeyed the order. Li officially divorced Puyi in 1958. She later married a technician named Huang Yugeng (ÈªÉÊØìÂ∫ö), with whom she had two sons. During the Cultural Revolution Li became a target for attack by the Red Guards because she used to be Puyi's concubine. She died on 24 April 2001 at the age of 73 in Changchun after a six-year battle with cirrhosis.

And so the stag decided to move, together with other stags, to this uninhabited territory that began to be known as \\"Terras de Cervaria\\" (Land of the Stags). Many years flew past. Fights, skirmishes, and disasters gradually devastated the colony until only the King Stag was left. According to the legend, when the noblemen from Asturias came down during the Reconquest to conquer what was to become the Condado Portucalense (Portugal), a young noblemen challenged the King Stag to a face-to-face duel. And the old Lord accepted. The duel took place among the trees and weeds on a trenched site. And, so the legend tells, the King Stag swept to victory! He kept the nobleman's flag that turned to be the King's coat of arms. But the Gods deceived the old King. He wouldn't be immortal... Tired of living and ill, the old Lord died in the loneliness of the crags and with him disappeared for good the Terra da Cervaria.\\" But the legend wasn't forgotten, and the coat of arms still bears a golden passant stag in silver armour standing in a green field.

It breeds only on the Pacific slopes of southern Costa Rica and western Panama. The binomial commemorates the German naturalist Alexander von Frantzius. Taxonomy and systematics The fiery- billed aracari is similar to the closely related collared aracari, with which it is sometimes considered conspecific. Frantz's aracari is an alternate name for this species. Description Like other toucans, the fiery-billed aracari is brightly marked and has a large bill. The adult is typically 43 cm long and weighs 250 g. The sexes are alike in appearance, with a black head and chest and dark olive green upperparts, apart from a red rump and upper tail. There is reddish collar on the rear neck. The underparts are bright yellow, with a round black spot in the centre of the breast and a red band across the belly. The thighs are chestnut. The bare facial skin is black, becoming ruddy behind the yellow eye. The upper mandible of the bill is bright orange, the lower mandible is black, and the legs are green. Juvenile fiery-billed aracaris are much duller, with sooty-black head and brownish green upperparts. The red rump and yellow underparts are paler, and the breast spot, belly band and bill pattern are indistinct. It differs from the collared aracari in the orange upper mandible, red belly band, and larger dark breast spot. The call of the fiery-billed aracari is a loud, sharp pseek, or keeseek, similar to that of collared, but more often two-noted. Behaviour Small flocks, usually consisting of up to 10 birds, move through the forest with a rapid direct flight. This species is primarily an arboreal fruit-eater, but will also take insects, lizards, eggs, and other small prey. Reproduction The fiery- billed aracari is a common resident breeder in lowland forests and clearings. The two white eggs are laid in an old woodpecker nest, 6‚Äì30 m high in a tree. Both sexes incubate the eggs for about 16 days, and the toucan chicks remain in the nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and have short bills and specialised pads on their heels to protect them from the rough floor of the nest. They are fed by both parents, assisted by up to three other adults, probably from a previous brood, and fledge after about 6 weeks, with feeding by the adults continuing for several weeks after leaving the nest. The aracaris are unusual for toucans in that they roost socially throughout the year, up to five adults and fledged young of this species sleeping in the same hole with their tails folded over their backs.

Harry Combs \\"lived and breathed the Golden and Jet Ages of aviation\\" according to the governmental U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission, in a 2003 press release. The release stated that Combs saw his first airplane at the age of four-and-a- half and also in his youth was influenced by the book \\"Diary of an Unknown Aviator\\"‚Äîa World War I chronicle by Elliot White Springs. Combs' father, Albert, was shot down twice in World War I, and was said to have warned his son never to set foot in an airplane. Nonetheless, the young Combs paid $2.50 for a ride in a mail plane at the age of 13; then, two years later, inspired by an advertisement for $99 flying lessons, made his way to St. Louis, MO for three hours of flight instruction, soloing immediately thereafter. He graduated from Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School in 1935 with a degree in applied economics.

It has been well-received by music critics.  Background  Following the release of their first album Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot, Sparklehorse embarked on a European tour opening for Radiohead, who praised Sparklehorse as their favorite new band. It was during this tour in 1996 that Mark Linkous suffered a near-fatal overdose that would have long-lasting effects on both his physical and psychological well-being. After mixing antidepressants and alcohol, Linkous passed out in the bathroom of his London hotel room with his legs pinned underneath him, which cut off circulation to his legs. It would be over fourteen hours before the unconscious singer was finally discovered and rushed to the hospital. When paramedics tried to straighten out his legs, Linkous suffered a heart attack and was clinically dead for three minutes before being resuscitated. A series of painful surgeries followed, along with a three-month stay at St Mary's Hospital in London. Initially, Linkous was confined to a wheelchair, which didn't prevent him from performing a number of concerts in 1997. Finally he was fitted with leg braces and began learning how to walk again. In a 2001 interview, Linkous, who battled depression his entire life, admitted that he had no memory of the overdose, and he wasn't sure if it had been intentional or an accident. But five years later, he stated that he didn't believe it was intentional; it was simply the result of \\"being stupid with drugs\\". Linkous' brother told a Richmond, Virginia news outlet in 2010 that he felt it had been an accident brought on by insomnia and other health problems the songwriter was experiencing at the time. Family members noticed that Linkous' recurring bouts with depression became deeper and more prolonged following his overdose. In the midst of his convalescence, Linkous became concerned that brain damage from his near-death experience would affect his ability to write songs again. His friend David Lowery from the band Cracker brought him a guitar, but according to Linkous, \\"it took me a long time to be able to make chords again\\". Eventually, writing began on the songs that would become Good Morning Spider, which, Rolling Stone noted, explored themes of \\"frustration, resignation, wonder and gratitude\\" ‚Äì feelings that swirled in Linkous' mind during his recovery. The album's title came from a sound that Sparklehorse singer-songwriter Mark Linkous once heard from an old pump organ that reminded him of a spider building a web. He was later told about an old folk superstition in which seeing a spider in the morning is an omen for a sad day. One of the first songs written was \\"Saint Mary\\", which was about Linkous' London hospital stay. In another song, \\"Pig\\", the songwriter vented his anger at his physical disability and the desire to have his old body back.  Recording  Good Morning Spider was recorded in Linkous' 16-track home studio set up in a rented house outside Richmond, Virginia. An arsenal of thrift store keyboards and discarded equipment was employed to give the album its distinctive sound. In a 1999 interview, Linkous listed some of his favorite gear: > I have a lot of cheap, little keyboards and this octagon [sic ‚Äì optigan] > thing and this synth module that has a zillion different sounds in it. A lot > of the keyboards I got at thrift stores. I have a little Casio SK-1 that has > a built in sampler. My favorite microphone I found at the landfill. It was > on a CB base station. I've got these wireless intercoms from the '50s from > an auction from a dentist's office. Linkous experimented with songs and sounds on the album; the song \\"Chaos of the Galaxy/Happy Man\\" is notable for its middle section, which consists of nothing but radio static. This was done intentionally by Linkous, who not only wanted the recording to sound like an AM radio station broadcast but also feared that the song was too catchy otherwise and would end up being used by Capitol Records as a radio single. As he deadpanned to the online music blog Swizzle-Stick at the time, \\"'Happy Man' kind of sounds like everything on the radio. Who needs that?\\" Eventually, Linkous was convinced by Eric Drew Feldman to re-record a radio-friendly version of \\"Happy Man\\" without the static at Easley McCain Recording studios in Memphis, Tennessee. Easley was chosen because some of Linkous' favorite artists like Pavement, Cat Power and Guided by Voices had previously recorded there. Vic Chesnutt was scheduled to appear on the album but couldn't make it to the sessions, so Linkous inserted Chesnutt's phone message apology into the song \\"Sunshine\\".  Reception  Good Morning Spider has been well-received by music critics. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club called it \\"a great record, though spotty by design, and it gets better with each successive listen.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  * Mark Linkous ‚Äì vocals, guitar, bass, Wurlitzer, piano, optigan, sampler, vibraphone, harmonium, speak and spell, concertina, percussion, drum machine * Sofia Mitchalitsianos ‚Äì vocals, cello on tracks 2 to 4, 6, 7, 10 and 15 to 17 * Scott Minor ‚Äì drums on tracks 1 and 15, harmonium on track 4 * Paul Watson ‚Äì cornet on track 2 * Melissa Moore ‚Äì violin on tracks 3, 6, 7, 10 and 16 * Johnny Hott ‚Äì drums on track 8, piano on track 5 * Stephen McCarthy ‚Äì pedal steel guitar on track 13 * David Lowery ‚Äì guitar, drum machine on track 5, bass on track 8 * Vic Chesnutt ‚Äì answering voice on track 7  References   External links  * Category:1998 albums Category:Sparklehorse albums Category:Capitol Records albums ","title":"Good Morning Spider"},{"id":"4286445","text":"Colegio Marista de Guaynabo is a private Roman Catholic school in Puerto Rico conducted by the Marist Brothers. It is one of the many Marist schools that take place within 80 countries around the world, being this one the first one to be located in the island of Puerto Rico. History In 1963, a group of families interested in having a catholic education for their boys, expressed their interest to the Archbishop of San Juan, Monsignor Jaime D√°vila for the creation of the school. On September 2, 1963 Hno. David Mediavilla and Hno. Silvio Salicrup, delegates for the Order‚Äôs Superiors, arrived to evaluate the possibilities of making these families‚Äô desires a reality. On November 11, 1963, the news of approval for the foundation of the school arrives. The school had its first settling in the residence of the Architect Jorge Ram√≠rez de Arellano, in Calle J, Garden Hills. In August 1964, Colegio Marista started its educational history as boys only school, with 188 students for the first six grades. School population grew rapidly, accounting for 400 students in 1968. This growth seeded the construction of its new and actual facilities in Alturas de Torrimar, Guaynabo. Today, Colegio Marista has excellent facilities that, along with its religious leaders, faculty and staff, provide education for 1500 boy and girl students. Their education is based on a constructivist and humanist curriculum, updated to meet the needs of current times. The Marist Brothers have a long rich tradition of excellent education around the world; locally, each year graduating students are accepted into the most prestigious colleges and universities in Puerto Rico and in the United States. Most recently, the prestigious school has been awarded with the Iberoamerican Educational Excellence Award. This act, realized in August 2013, also proclaimed the institution as an Honorary Member of the Iberoamerican Council in recognition of the realized pro educational labor throughout the years.

Bill Ruane first met Buffett at a value investing seminar taught by Benjamin Graham at Columbia University in 1950. When Buffett closed his investment partnership in 1969, he advised his clients to invest with Ruane in the Sequoia Fund. In 1970, William J. Ruane and Richard T. Cunniff founded the Sequoia Fund to take on Buffett's former investors... Robert Goldfarb joined the firm in 1971. In The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, Buffett wrote, \\"When I wound up the Buffett Partnership, I asked Bill Ruane if he would set up a fund to handle all of our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. Bill was the only person I recommended to my partners.\\". During his search for a candidate to succeed him as chief investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett said, \\"I'm looking for another Bill Ruane.\\" .

Goldfarb and Poppe responded by saying that their \\"credibility as investors has been damaged by this saga.\\" The Valeant Pharmaceuticals position accounted for over 30% of Sequoia Fund's assets in mid-2015, and declined 87% from a high of $265.52 in August 2015 to $33.43 in March 2016. Over this time period Sequoia fell by 22%, performing worse than 99% of rival funds.. At one point, over 30 percent of the fund's assets was invested in Valeant.

Its common names include brown shrimp, common shrimp, bay shrimp, and sand shrimp, while translation of its French name ' (or its Dutch equivalent ') sometimes leads to the English version grey shrimp. Description chelae of C. crangon from below Adults are typically long, although individuals up to have been recorded. The animals have cryptic colouration, being a sandy brown colour, which can be changed to match the environment. They live in shallow water, which can also be slightly brackish, and feed nocturnally. During the day, they remain buried in the sand to escape predatory birds and fish, with only their antennae protruding. Crangon is classified in the family Crangonidae, and shares the family's characteristic subchelate first pereiopods (where the movable finger closes onto a short projection, rather than a similarly sized fixed finger) and short rostrum. Distribution and ecology C. crangon has a wide range, extending across the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from the White Sea in the north of Russia to the coast of Morocco, including the Baltic Sea, as well as occurring throughout the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Despite its wide range, however, little gene flow occurs across certain natural barriers, such as the Strait of Gibraltar or the Bosphorus. The populations in the western Mediterranean Sea are thought to be the oldest, with the species' spread across the north Atlantic thought to postdate the Pleistocene. Adults live epibenthically (on or near the sea- floor) especially in the shallow waters of estuaries or near the coast. It is generally highly abundant, and has a significant effect on the ecosystems where it lives. Lifecycle Females reach sexual maturity at a length around , while males are mature at . The young hatch from their eggs into planktonic larvae. These pass through five moults before reaching the postlarval stage, when they settle to the sea-floor. Fishery Global capture of C. crangon in tonnes reported by the FAO, 1950‚Äì2010 Based on data sourced from the FishStat database, FAO. Historically, the commercial fishery was accomplished on horseback on both sides of the Dover straits. Over 37,000 t of C. crangon were caught in 1999, with Germany and the Netherlands taking over 80% of this total. As food A bowl of brown shrimp served as a snack The brown shrimp enjoys great popularity in Belgium, the Netherlands, northern Germany, and Denmark. Shrimp in general are known as garnalen in Dutch. It is the basis of the dish tomate-crevettes, where the shrimp are mixed with mayonnaise and served in a hollowed-out uncooked tomato. The shrimp croquette is another Belgian speciality; the shrimp are in the interior of the battered croquette along with b√©chamel sauce. Freshly cooked, unpeeled brown shrimp are often served as a snack accompanying beer, typically a sour ale or Flemish red such as Rodenbach. In Lancashire, England, the brown shrimp is mixed with butter to make potted shrimps, a dish traditionally eaten with bread.

The original was developed by Spellbound, and published by Infogrames, however, the succeeding versions were published by a variety of publishers. The original Airline Tycoon was created for Windows, however, the later Deluxe version was also ported to Linux, Mac OS X, MorphOS, ZETA, iOS and Android. Like other \\"tycoon\\" computer games, the objective of the game is to become a tycoon, and in this case, an \\"Airline Tycoon.\\" This is achieved through the balance of income and expenditures.  Gameplay A simulation computer game where the player acts as manager of an airline, competing against three other tycoons. The names of the four tycoons are: Tina Cortez (Sunshine Airways), Siggi Sorglos (Falcon Lines), Igor Tuppolevsky (Phoenix Travel) and Mario Zucchero (Honey Airlines). The player must keep their aircraft in good shape and equip them at such a level as to keep the customers satisfied, buy new planes (from the expensive Airplane Agency or from Mr Schlauberger at the museum who sells old planes at a much lower cost) and take out bank loans if required. The player must also manage their personnel, plan flights, buy fuel, attend meetings in the airport manager's office and, if there is the time, slip into Rick's caf√© for a quick cup of coffee. The player can also perform sabotages on the other players. The graphics are bright and decidedly tongue in cheek: the tycoon Igor Tuppolevsky has a set of Russian dolls on his desk‚Äîand an open tin of caviar, while Tina Cortez has a picture of a matador and a bull's head. With a network, up to four people can play at once and the game status can be saved (as it can in single-player mode) for longer games.  History   Releases  The original game was released in August 1998 in Germany. It was not released in any English-speaking country; however, there was an official English demo. The first Airline Tycoon title to be released in United States and the United Kingdom was Airline Tycoon First Class. It was published in 2001 by Monte Cristo; however, the publisher decided to remove First Class subtitle from the game box and manuals, though it remained in-game. Features added in First Class include ten brand new missions, multiplayer mode with up to 4 players, new MIDI music, cargo transportation and more. In 2002, Airline Tycoon Evolution, second Airline Tycoon re-release was published by Monte Cristo. The game introduced ten new missions, possibility of buying self-designed aircraft (and possibility of sharing these planes via Internet), possibility of hiring aircraft security agents, five new sabotages and more. In 2003, Spellbound released a third Airline Tycoon addition, named Airline Tycoon Deluxe.

It lasted from March 1 to March 4, when the union called a halt to the strike after most of the workers voluntarily returned to work. The number of striking workers fluctuated throughout the strike, but reached over 16,000 workers at its peak. During the strike, Korail's passenger service was decreased by 60%, on both national and Seoul Subway lines. Freight service was also greatly reduced. The principal issue, which was not resolved during the strike, was Korail's replacement of regular long-term positions with short-term contract positions. The strike was declared illegal by the government after emergency arbitration was imposed, and at least 411 strikers were arrested. 10 of those were indicted on charges of \\"interference with execution of duty,\\" but the rest were released. 2000 union workers were also suspended by Korail during the incident. The female KTX attendants' union, whose members are not employed by Korail but by a subcontractor, continued their walkout.

It is linked by a footbridge to Hambleden Lock, which is on the Berkshire side of the river. It was Grade II listed in 1955 and has now been converted into flats. Alongside the mill is Hambledon Marina which occupies two islands. Along the river frontage to the south-east is the site of a Roman Villa. History A mill at Hambleden is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was held by Queen Matilda and had a rent of 20 shillings/year, as well as a fishery that yielded 1,000 eels annually. Before 1235 the mill was granted to Keynsham Abbey. Alison Uttley described it as \\"The most beautiful place in the whole length of the long Thames valley.\\" The oldest part of the present mill building was built in the late 18th century, possibly incorporating part of an earlier 17th century mill. This now forms the southern end of the building and has three main floors plus an attic, making it the tallest part of the building. This wing has half-hipped gables and plain tiles on the roof. A 19th century addition to the west, two stories high with a slate roof, stretches along the river front. In the late 19th century, a barge, Maid of the Mill, used to make a weekly journey with flour from the mill to Huntley & Palmers biscuit factory in Reading. On her return trip she carried broken biscuits for sale, cheap, to the local villagers. The mill was still in use in the 1950s having been upgraded from the original waterwheel and grinding stones to a water-turbine driving steel rollers in about 1939. It had fallen out of use by the early 1970s, and planning permission for conversion to apartments was granted in 1974. The extensive renovations involved re-cladding in white shiplap boarding, and replacement of its many windows with 20th century casements, sashes and some horizontal sliding sashes in the 18th century attic windows. Next to the mill, away from the river, is Mill House, also a grade II listed building. This was built in around 1770, for use by the mill-owner, with flint walls and a rendered and whitewashed frontage. Locality The mill is adjacent to a series of weirs which stretch across the River Thames, running diagonally across the river, to Hambleden Lock, which is on the western, Berkshire, bank of the river. The weir raises the upstream water level, which both provided the fast flow of water for the original watermill, and maintains a navigable depth of water above the weir. The lock raises or lowers boats travelling up and down the river past the weir. A footbridge follows the line of the weir right across the Thames, allowing pedestrian access between the path alongside Hambleden Mill and the Thames riverside path which runs in both directions on the Berkshire side of the river. The area has been a popular visitor spot for many decades, with large numbers of postcards showing the mill, weir and lock and a popular subject with artists. The two Hambleden Mill Islands lie in the river alongside the mill. The mill-stream that used to funnel water to the water-wheel on the front of the mill creates an island accessed via a bridge. And this, plus another island alongside it are now used by Hambleden Marina for Thames riverboat mooring facilities. To the south-east of the marina a Roman Villa site fronting on to the Thames was identified in 1921 from parchmarks in the grass during a dry summer. In the hot summer of 1975 enough detail of wall outlines appeared to enable a survey of the villa and its ancillary buildings and boundaries, including possible wharves and landing stages along the river frontage. The site was given legal protection as a scheduled monument in 1979. It is thought to be a subsidiary development from the nearby Yewdon Villa. Conservation Area The mill is within the Mill End, Hambleden Conservation Area, first designated in 1982. The conservation area includes both the hamlet of Mill End and the estate of Yewden Manor. The conservation area also falls within the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

History  Haren was first mentioned in the Middle Ages (around 890) in a registry of the Corvey Abbey. Around 1150 the settlement of Neuharen (\\"New Haren\\") was founded, while the nearby Altharen (\\"Old Haren\\") formed around a local castle, belonging to the bishop of Munster, who bought it around 1252 from Duchess Jutta von Ravensberg. At the end of the Thirty Years War Haren was almost completely destroyed, but soon recovered and became a notable trading port at the Ems River. The inhabitants of Haren were in large part tradesmen and sailors, transporting grain and other commodities down the Ems River. During the Napoleonic epoch in 1803 the town was given to the Duke of Arenberg as a compensation for the lands on the other side of the river. However, already in 1810 the town was directly incorporated into the French Empire. At the Congress of Vienna Haren, together with the entire Duchy of Arenberg-Meppen, was assigned to the Kingdom of Hanover, which in turn in 1866 became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and then the German Empire. Following the Franco-Prussian War a large prisoner of war camp was set up in the vicinity. The French prisoners built, among other facilities, the Haren-R√ºtenbrock canal, thanks to which peat started to be produced in the area. Despite all the changes, until 1913 both settlements were directly administered by the church. Only then did the German government take over the administrative area of Meppen, to which Haren belonged. By 1935 there were 205 ships of various sizes registered in Haren. While some of them were mobilised and lost at sea during World War II, Haren remains a notable port of registry for German ships. Altharen and Neuharen were finally united in October 1956 and in December 1965 Haren received city rights.  Polish enclave  Polish servicewoman near Haren At the end of World War II there were over 3 million Polish citizens in Germany, most of them displaced persons (DPs) who got there either as slave labourers, prisoners of German concentration camps or prisoners of war. As the political situation in Communist-controlled Poland was uncertain, the Allied authorities decided to create a Polish enclave in Germany that would serve both as a resettlement camp, local cultural centre and a station from which the DPs could further be dispatched to Poland or various western states. As Haren lay in the occupation zone administered by the Polish I Corps (and more specifically the Polish 1st Armoured Division), it was chosen as the most appropriate centre of a Polish enclave in Germany. On 19 May 1945, the Polish 1st Armoured Division, a unit attached to the British Army moved all of the thousand families of Haren out to surrounding communities. Over 4000 Poles from Labor camps and prisoner-of- war camps in Northern Germany moved into the town. Many of them had been members of the Polish Home Army, men and women, who had fought in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Initially the new Polish enclave was named Lw√≥w, after the city in South-Eastern Poland by then occupied and later annexed by the Soviet Union. However, under Soviet pressure the name was then changed to Maczk√≥w, in honour of General Stanislaw Maczek, the commanding officer of the Armoured Division and the local Allied occupation forces. The streets in the town were renamed to Polish, either honouring various military units (Legion√≥w Str., Artyleryjska Str.) or named after streets in Warsaw (Ujazdowskie Avenue). During the next months, a Polish town with a Polish mayor, a Polish school, a folk high school, a Polish fire brigade and a Polish rectory were established. The latter registered 289 weddings and 101 funerals. 479 Poles have birth certificates showing Maczk√≥w as place of birth. As there were hundreds of thousands of Poles in the area administered by the 1st Armoured Division, \\"Maczk√≥w\\" also served as a cultural centre: newspapers were being published there on a daily basis (Dziennik and Defilada eventually reaching 90 thousand copies), a theatre was opened (led by Leon Schiller) and concert halls were active. Among the most notable events held in the Polish enclave was a 1947 concert by Benjamin Britten and Lord Yehudi Menuhin. In the Autumn of 1946 the Polish forces stationed in North-Western Germany started to be demobilised and ferried back to the United Kingdom. Also the civilian inhabitants started to return to Poland or move to other European states. Eventually by the end of 1948 the town was returned to the original inhabitants (and renamed back to Haren).

It is part of the town Hartheim am Rhein. It has a small bakery, 3 restaurants, and 3 hotels (guesthouses). The village is known for its crops, especially for the asparagus. They also grow onions, potatoes, strawberries and other berries. It is famous as the childhood home of Sybille von Schoenebeck, later to gain fame as author Sybille Bedford, in the 1910s. It has really only come to full prominence in the 21st century with the publication of her final autobiography Quicksands: A Memoir, though it was mentioned in her 1989 Booker Prize- nominated Jigsaw: An Unsentimental Education. History The name Veltkilcha appears in documents in 1160. 1475 there were 10 hearths, i.e. 10 families who have settled around the \\"church on the field\\". During the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48), the village and the church were completely destroyed. In 1690 the reconstruction of the Bergische Whose castle began. It received much of its present form. In 1866 the presence of Whose Berger in Feldkirch ends. Since that time, the castle changed its owners frequently. By 1899, the mayor Heinrich Rinderle was in the possession of the castle. He generously distributed the property to the farmers of the community. In 1960, a comprehensive restoration of the Martin Church was completed. In 1964 Feldkirch celebrated the construction of Wessenberg school. Ten years later, in 1974, the kindergarten St. Martin was founded. In the same year, Feldkirch became part of Hartheim.

Balloch was a property of the Lennox family from the 11th century, and the old castle was built in the 13th century. In the 19th century the estate was purchased by John Buchanan of Ardoch, who demolished the ruins of the old castle and erected the present building. The Tudor Gothic architecture is the work of Robert Lugar. In 1915 Balloch was bought by Glasgow City Corporation, and has been leased by West Dunbartonshire Council since 1975. The estate was designated as a country park in 1980, and since 2002 has been part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. Although the house has been periodically used for visitor facilities and council offices, it is now included on the Buildings at Risk Register. Balloch Castle is a category A listed building, and the estate is included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History The old castle The lands of Balloch were granted to the Lennox family in 1072 by King Malcolm III, forming part of the ancient earldom of Lennox. The earls of Lennox built the original Balloch Castle around 1238, and held it until approximately 1390. Many of their early charters were dated at Balloch. The earls afterwards moved their base to the island of Inchmurrin in Loch Lomond, where the remains of a late 14th-century castle can still be seen. Situated nearer the water than the present day castle, there are no standing remains, the earthworks can still be seen. An irregular mound, approximately , surrounded by a ditch up to across. This site is given statutory protection as a scheduled monument. In the 15th century Balloch, along with the earldom of Lennox, came to the Stewarts of Darnley. It stayed in the Stewart family until 1652 when the 4th Duke of Lennox sold it to John Colquhoun of Luss. Balloch Castle The garden front of Balloch, seen across the parkland The present castle was built as a residence in 1808‚Äì1809 at the order of John Buchanan of Ardoch (1761‚Äì1839), who had bought the estate in 1800. Buchanan was a Glasgow merchant, the son of Thomas Buchanan of Ardoch (died 1789). John Buchanan was involved in his father's hat-making business, and also like his father was a partner in the Ship Bank, Glasgow's oldest banking house, founded in 1749. He represented Dunbartonshire in parliament from 1821‚Äì1826. The architect of the Tudor Gothic building was London-based Robert Lugar, who had designed the nearby Tullichewan Castle in 1792. The building's turrets and crenellations are purely decorative with no defensive value. The lancet windows, tracery, hoodmoulds and blind arrow-slits are all borrowings from earlier building styles. Although an unimaginative designer, at Balloch Lugar helped to introduce the asymmetrical, \\"picturesque\\" form of castellated house into Scotland. The new castle may incorporate stone from the earlier castle, or the fabric of an earlier building on the site. Buchanan established the parkland around the castle, including the planting of ornamental trees and imported shrubs. Ornamental crenellations and blind arrow-slits Later history In 1830, Buchanan purchased the adjacent estate of Boturich, including a ruined castle north of Balloch Castle. He again engaged Robert Lugar to rebuild the castle, which he then occupied, selling Balloch. The latter passed through several owners in the 19th century, including Mr Gibson Stott, who made further improvements to the parks, and the Denniston-Brown family. The estate, comprising , was purchased in 1915 by the Corporation of the City of Glasgow, the predecessor of the current city council, to provide publicly accessible open space. Although still owned by Glasgow City Council, the park and house have been leased to Dunbarton District Council, and its successor West Dunbartonshire Council, since 1975. It was registered as a country park in 1980. The house has been a category A listed building since 1971. The house has periodically been used to provide visitor facilities and offices, with past occupants including the Nature Conservancy Council and the local Countryside Ranger Service. By 2008 the building was in poor condition, and was added to the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland. In January 2014, an application for listed building consent was lodged, to permit repairs to the now-disused structure. In February 2014 West Dunbartonshire Council announced a programme of repairs to preserve the building. Estate Walled garden within the grounds The castle grounds feature two main pleasure gardens, one to the north of the house including rhododendrons and azaleas that reach full bloom in late May and early June. To the south is a walled garden planted with flowers and shrubs, and surrounded by the second area of ornamental planting. Between these two areas, and sweeping down to the loch shore, is an area of grassed parkland with specimen trees. The whole is framed by ornamental and semi-natural woodlands. In 2001, a ¬£2.3-million programme of works sought to restore the castle grounds, including the reopening of lost views and improved woodland management. Funding was provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Scottish Enterprise, as well as the council.

It was a development of the classical NyƒÅya dar≈õana. Other influences on Navya-NyƒÅya were the work of earlier philosophers VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra (900-980 CE) and Udayana (late 10th century). It remained active in India through to the 18th century. Gange≈õa's book TattvacintƒÅma·πái (\\"Thought-Jewel of Reality\\") was written partly in response to ≈örƒ´har≈õa's KhandanakhandakhƒÅdya, a defence of Advaita VedƒÅnta, which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of NyƒÅya theories of thought and language. In his book, Gange≈õa both addressed some of those criticisms and - more important - critically examined the NyƒÅya dar≈õana itself. He held that, while ≈örƒ´har≈õa had failed to successfully challenge the NyƒÅya realist ontology, his and Gange≈õa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of NyƒÅya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise. TattvacintƒÅmani dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, logic, set theory, and especially epistemology, which Gange≈õa examined rigorously, developing and improving the NyƒÅya scheme, and offering examples. The results, especially his analysis of cognition, were taken up and used by other dar≈õanas. Navya-NyƒÅya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the NyƒÅya concepts into four main categories which are (sense-) perception (pratyak≈üa), inference (anumƒÅna), comparison or similarity (upamƒÅna), and testimony (sound or word; ≈õabda). Prof John Vattanky has contributed significantly to the modern understanding of Navya-NyƒÅya.

A soft focus lens deliberately introduces spherical aberration in order to give the appearance of blurring the image while retaining sharp edges; it is not the same as an out-of-focus image, and the effect cannot be achieved simply by defocusing a sharp lens. Soft focus is also the name of the style of photograph produced by such a lens. Photography Picture of a statue taken with a soft focus portrait lens Because soft focus results from what are considered technical flaws, typically spherical and chromatic aberration, many older lenses had soft focus built in as a side effect of their construction. Some lens makers, such as Pinkham-Smith and Busch Nicola Perscheid (see Nicola Perscheid), intentionally designed lenses to take advantage of these flaws and, as color became available, chromatic aberration was less desirable, but well-managed spherical aberration was desirable. Newer lenses are optimized to minimize optical aberrations, but there are lenses such as the Canon EF 135mm lens f/2.8 with Softfocus, Pentax SMC 28mm f2.8 FA Soft Lens, Mamiya 180mm f/4.0 Soft Focus Lens for RZ67 Cameras, and the Lensbaby Velvet 56mm lens, which have adjustable levels of spherical aberration at wide apertures. The effect can be disabled entirely as well, in which case the lens is sharp. In the mid-1930s, Leitz designed a legendary soft-focus lens, the Thambar 90mm f2.2, for the Leica rangefinder cameras. It was made in small numbers, no more than 3000 units. It is a rare collector's item today. The soft focus effect is used as an effect for glamour photography, because the effect eliminates blemishes, and in general produces a dream-like image. The effect of a soft focus lens is sometimes approximated by the use of diffusion filter or other method, such as stretching a nylon stocking over the front of the lens, or smearing petroleum jelly on a clear filter or on the front element or even the back element of the lens itself. The latter is less recommended because successive cleaning always introduces a risk to damage the lens's surface. It can also be approximated with post-processing procedures. Specifically, highlights in an image are blurred, but the bokeh effects of soft focus cannot be reproduced.

His father, Walker Buckner, is an important realist painter in Boston. Buckner is a nephew of new-music pioneer Thomas Buckner and of children's advocate Elizabeth Buckner. As a Brooklyn-based artist, Derek Buckner draws inspiration from the beauty within the seemingly banal settings of suburban houses and intersecting freeways. These scenes are not meant to depict particular areas of the United States but to serve as archetypal representations of American suburban sprawl. It is not only the artist's expressive, elemental brushwork that depicts vital images of the contemporary American landscape, but also his choice of subjects, which emphasize the disquiet of suburban life. Buckner states: > \\".... I am attracted to American productivity-- its fecundity and its excess > in the twenty-first century. It is also by seeing beyond our preconceived > notions of place that I find splendor‚Äîwhether it be tract housing glowing in > the evening sun or the intertwining of concrete freeways in the heat of the > day.\\" Derek Buckner grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

Biography Early life Ashton was born in Calcutta, India on 13 February 1898. Ashton's mother, Victoria Alexandrina Inglis, was the daughter of Sir John Eardley Wilmot Inglis, who commanded the British forces at the Siege of Lucknow, and Julia Selina Thesiger. Ashton was educated at Winchester College; on leaving Winchester in 1916 he joined the Royal Field Artillery and served for the rest of World War I. He was awarded the Military Cross \\"for conspicuous gallantry and skill in leading a section of guns into a forward position near Trones Wood on 27th August, 1918, where, under heavy shell and machine-gun fire, he succeeded in destroying an enemy strong point, thereby greatly facilitating the infantry advance.\\" After the war he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. Cricket career As a cricketer, Ashton was a sound right-hand batsman in the outstanding Cambridge University sides in the years just after the First World War, in which he had been commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery and won the Military Cross, and he played for Essex in the vacations. In both 1921 and 1922 he scored more than 1,000 runs and at the end of the 1922 season, after just three years in first-class cricket, Ashton was averaging more than 46 runs per innings. His most famous exploit, though, was as a member of the amateur side assembled by Archie MacLaren to take on the hitherto-invincible 1921 Australian cricket team at Eastbourne. Bowled out for just 43 runs in the first innings, the so-called \\"England XI\\" were, at 60 for four wickets in their second innings, still 71 behind when Ashton was joined by Aubrey Faulkner. Ashton hit 75 in 72 minutes, Faulkner made 153 and McLaren's side won the match by 28 runs. Ashton was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1922 largely on account of this innings. Ashton was involved in an extraordinary incident during the match against Lancashire. He was bowled, but both bails went up in the air and then returned to their grooves on top of the stumps, meaning that he was not out.Brodribb, Gerald (1995) Next Man In, Souvenir Press: London. . Ashton's three brothers, Gilbert, Percy and Claude, also played first-class cricket; Gilbert, Hubert and Claude captained Cambridge University in the three consecutive seasons from 1921 to 1923. At the end of the 1922 cricket season Ashton joined the Burmah Oil Company, and his appearances thereafter were sporadic. He played for India and for Burma against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side led by Arthur Gilligan that toured India in 1926‚Äì27; he reappeared for several Essex matches in 1927; and there were a handful of first-class games across the 1930s, the last in 1939. Football career Ashton was also an accomplished footballer, playing as an amateur for all his footballing career, which began with the Corinthians and then, during the 1919-20 season, West Bromwich Albion. He made his only appearance in the Football League in May 1925 for Bristol Rovers against Reading. He joined Clapton Orient in August 1926, making five appearances for them during the 1926-27 season, and then joined Gillingham in May 1927 but shortly afterwards retired from football to focus on his cricketing career. Post-cricket and political career Ashton later pursued a different career, first in cricket administration, as president of Essex from 1941, and then in national UK politics. He served as High Sheriff of Essex in 1943 and was then elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Chelmsford at the 1950 general elections and held the seat at three further UK general elections, before retiring in 1964. He was knighted in 1959 and it was as Sir Hubert Ashton that he became MCC president in 1960‚Äì61. Ashton died in South Weald, Essex on 17 June 1979. Personal life In 1927 Ashton married Dorothy Gaitskell, sister of Hugh Gaitskell. They had two sons and two daughters.

During this period, he was appointed as acting governor of Puerto Rico in 1929 and in January 1932, he was appointed Governor by President Herbert Hoover and served through 1933. He was the only non-Puerto Rican appointee of 15 from 1900 to 1952 who could speak Spanish before going there. Early and personal life Beverley was born in Amarillo, Texas to William and Clara (Hendricks) Beverley. He attended local schools and went to college at the University of Texas in Austin. He served in the United States Army during World War I as an artillery officer, serving in France. After completing law school at the University of Texas and starting work as a lawyer, he married Mary Smith Jarmon in 1925. Attorney and political career Beverley was active in Republican Party politics in Texas. Beverley was appointed as Assistant Attorney General of Puerto Rico in 1925, serving until 1927. Beverley spoke Spanish as a second language. In 1927, he was appointed as Attorney General of Puerto Rico, serving until 1932. When appointed as governor of Puerto Rico for periods in 1929 and 1932-1933, he was the only one of fifteen non-Puerto Ricans to serve in that position between 1900 and 1952 who already spoke Spanish. He became close friends with Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who followed him in 1930 as governor, serving until 1932. The two men had a close relationship for the rest of their lives. In Beverley's tenures as governor, he had to deal with a major hurricane in which several people died and there was extensive damage. He also managed through the end of Prohibition on the island. In 1932, during his second period of governor, he provoked controversy by recommending the use of birth control. American Catholics were much more disturbed by this and raised many objections than did Puerto Ricans, who mostly ignored his comments.Truman R. Clark. 1975. Puerto Rico and the United States, 1917-1933, University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 151-154 Soon after taking office, he had to deal with agitation resulting from charges made by Pedro Albizu Campos, president of the Nationalist Party, that Cornelius Rhoads, an American medical researcher with the Rockefeller Foundation, had been working on a United States plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans, based on Rhoads' own letter that became public.Starr, Douglas. \\"Revisiting a 1930s Scandal: AACR to Rename a Prize\\", Science, 25 April 2003. Vol. 300. No. 5619. p. 574-5. He ordered an investigation by the Attorney General Jos√© Ram√≥n Qui√±ones, who found no evidence of wrongdoing by Rhoads of the American health project. On August 11, 1931, Beverley was one of seven people, including five officials, on board a chartered Pan American Airways Sikorsky seaplane flight tour of Puerto Rico, including the wife of then- Governor Teddy Roosevelt. The plane sank on landing, but no one suffered any injuries. The people were all taken off by boats. Following his service as governor, Beverley continued to live and work in Puerto Rico as the head of a large firm. He practiced law and served on numerous commissions and was active in the US Coast Guard reserve, helping lead efforts to protect Puerto Rican waters during World War II. In the 1960s Beverley returned to Austin, Texas. He lived there until his death in 1967.A Guide to the James R.

The band soon began writing original material and changed the band name to Mucky Pup. Over the years, the band went through several lineup changes and musical style changes while gaining minor success in both the USA and Europe. Their breakthrough moment occurred when they won second place in a Bloom County comic strip contest, resulting in the band performing a song featured on a flexi disc packaged with a 1987 Bloom County comic strip compilation. However, their European success, based on strong tours and charting for the 1989 A Boy in a Man's World album, surpassed all recognition achieved in their home country. The band split up in 1995 but reunited from 2009 through 2014 with a rotating lineup of both former and new members with vocalist Chris Milnes being the only constant. History Early years The band initially started as a cover band named Predator. It wasn't long before the band started writing original material and changed their name to Mucky Pup. They released two demo tapes in 1987. The first demo, Live and Mucky, was recorded live. After its release, bassist Scott Dottino left the band. A second demo, Greatest Hits, featuring former Hades member Scott LePage on bass, followed. Together, the two demos sold a combined amount of over 1,200 copies. That same year, the band was featured on a flexi disc in the Bloom County book, Billy and the Boingers Bootleg. This was the result of the band taking second place in a contest held for the Bloom County comic strip. The band, performing as the comic strip characters Billy and the Boingers, recorded \\"U-Stink-But-I-‚ô•-U,\\" to be featured as one of the two songs featured on the flexi disc. Torrid Records The band would go on to play \\"battle of the bands\\" competitions in and around New Jersey. It was during one such event, while playing with the band Trixter at the Paramus, New Jersey roller rink, that a representative from Torrid Records first saw the band. The band was offered a record contract and several weeks later, they signed their first record deal with the independent label. Signing with Torrid brought a distribution deal in Europe with Roadrunner Records' sister label, Roadracer Records. The band's first album, Can't You Take a Joke?, was released in 1988. In 1989, the band released their second album, A Boy in a Man's World. The album featured a re-recorded version of \\"U-Stink-But-I-‚ô•-U\\", for which the band shot their first music video. MTV played the video two times. A Boy In A Man's World also featured cover art by friend and future DC and Marvel comic book artist, Nelson DeCastro, who had previously created T-shirt art for the band as well. Before the recording of A Boy In A Man's World, LePage, who had never been considered an official member of the band, left due to touring conflicts. He was replaced by Dave Neabore. Shortly after the album was released, the band found themselves on their first tour of Europe. Although Mucky Pup never had a hit in the U.S., their European distribution deal, combined with this tour, helped the band attain success in Europe. When the band returned home, Nastasi resigned and helped co-found the band Non-Fiction with former members of Hades. Nastasi stayed with Non-Fiction for a short time before leaving to join Murphy's Law. Nastasi's position in Mucky Pup was filled by band friend Sean Kilkenny. After a year or so, Neabore and Kilkenny left to form the band that would become Dog Eat Dog and Nastasi returned to record with Mucky Pup while simultaneously joining Dog Eat Dog as well. The band's third album, Now, was released in 1990. Now introduced new bass player Marc DeBacker, of Belgium, to the lineup and featured guest appearances by Evan Seinfeld and Billy Graziadei of the band Biohazard, whom Mucky Pup had befriended and regularly used as an opening act. In the past, various clubs had refused to let Biohazard play, thinking that their performances would lead to violence, but Mucky Pup would sneak the band on stage for a few songs before their own set. The band shot a second video, \\"Hippies Hate Water,\\" which MTV never played. The band began playing shows with bands such as Primus, Gwar, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Murphy's Law, Bad Brains, 24-7 Spyz, and Scatterbrain. While Nastasi had returned to record Now, he no longer toured with the band as he was performing with Dog Eat Dog at the same time Mucky Pup was touring. As a result, new guitarist Splatter became the band's live guitarist. Splatter's time with band was brief and it wasn't long before he was replaced by Terry, who would remain their live guitarist until 1992. After the release of Now, Mucky Pup ended their association with Torrid and Roadrunner Records. Century Media Records In 1991, the band signed with Century Media Records and released Act Of Faith in the following year. Once again, the lineup shuffled with DeBacker being replaced by Christopher \\"Junior\\" LaPlante and the addition of Kevin Powers as a keyboard player. Powers had previously played in the local New Jersey band, Articulate Violence. Videos were shot for the songs \\"Freakin' at the Peepshow\\" and \\"Mr. Hand\\", which only received airplay in Europe. Shortly after the recording of the album, Nastasi stepped down from both Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog. It wasn't long before he re-joined the original lineup of Non-Fiction, now calling themselves #9. #9 was in the process of recording their debut when Nastasi accepted a solo record deal with SPV Records. Nastasi named the band Nastasee and recorded two albums, featuring collaborations with members of both Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog. Trim The Fat and Ule Tide were only intended for European release and as a result, the band embarked on four tours of the continent. Before Ule Tide could officially be released, Nastasee was dropped from the label and the album was never officially released outside of promotional and mail order copies. As a result, Nastasi disbanded his band. 1993 saw Mucky Pup take a turn away from humorous pop songs to focus on more aggressive, emotional and angry songs with their fifth release, Lemonade. The album brought yet another lineup change, as John Milnes moved to guitar and Kevin Powers took the drummer's position. It also saw the return of Marc DeBacker on bass. Since his previous run with Mucky Pup, DeBacker had moved on to replace Nastasi on guitar in Dog Eat Dog and had taken part in the recording of the band's second full-length album, Play Games as well as the European tour that preceded it. Once again, Mucky Pup returned to Europe, appearing frequently with Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine with whom the band became good friends. After releasing two albums in as many years with Century Media Records, Mucky Pup ended their association with the label. Mucky Records / SPV Music In 1993, the band released the album Alive & Well under their own imprint, Mucky Records, through SPV Music exclusively in Europe. The album was primarily a collection of live tracks recorded during their 1993 tour of Europe. It also contains a demo version of \\"The Skinheads Broke My Walkman\\" from the Act of Faith album, as well as cover versions of Prince's \\"Darling Nikki\\" and Sade's \\"Nothing Can Come Between Us\\". New additions to the lineup were Eric \\"EVS\\" VanSteenbergh and Glen Cummings, both on guitar. Cummings had previously been a member of both Ludichrist and Scatterbrain and would tour Europe with Mucky Pup, on two occasions, as a part-time member of the band. The band's final album, Five Guys In A Really Hot Garage, was released in Germany in 1995. The final lineup saw John Milnes return to the drums and also featured the additions of Jack \\"Hinge\\" Pitzer, formerly of New Jersey thrash metal band, The Beast, on guitar and Joe Mama on bass. Marc DeBacker had since left the band a second time to return to Belgium and form the band 10,000 Women Man. Bass player Bill Bergmann appeared on two of the songs and was pictured on the album cover. Bergmann would remain the bass player for what would be the last several months of the band's existence. Post-Mucky Pup In 1998, Chris and John Milnes formed a band named Bully with Bill Bergmann & Kevin Powers. Bully was an attempt to continue recording together without the Mucky Pup name which they felt, at the time, had run its course. This lineup recorded a five-song demo consisting of the final original Mucky Pup material but no album ever materialized. The songs were retroactively made Mucky Pup songs when included on the 2012 re-release of Five Guys In A Really Hot Garage and referred to as the Straight Outta' Jersey EP. Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes joined forces with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was a throwback to the early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the hardcore style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The Fun Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded. In 2005, Kevin Powers co-directed the music video for the Bloodhound Gang's song \\"Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss\\", the second single from their Hefty Fine album. In 2013 Bill Bergmann along with Dylan Gadino and Derek Gadino formed Robots and Monsters. Soon after their debut album \\"Down to Ash\\" was recorded they enlisted former bandmate Kevin Powers for drumming duties. Robots and Monsters would go on to release the follow-up Nothing to Fear, Nothing to Fight in 2016. Reunions After their breakup in 1996, Mucky Pup reunited for one night performances on several occasions, each time featuring a different incarnation or combination of previous lineups. In 1999, they reunited as an opening act for their first show ever with Dog Eat Dog. This was followed by five more one-off headlining reunion shows in 2000, 2002 & 2003\\\\. In October, 2008, the band updated their website for the first time in several years. As part of the update, the band announced that they would embark on a European mini-tour in the summer of 2009. The reunited band, consisting of Chris Milnes, John Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Dave Neabore and Kevin Powers, made a United States appearance at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, New Jersey, on April 11, 2009, performing to a sold out crowd. In July, 2009, the band performed at the Rock for People and With Full Force festivals. The band made a second trip to Europe in late August to play a handful of festival dates with bands such as Municipal Waste, Gorefest, Flotsam and Jetsam, Sodom and Martyr, before ending the tour with a string of dates with Superbutt. The European tour dates featured the lineup of Chris Milnes, Dan Nastasi, Mark DeBacker and Kevin Powers performing songs voted on, via the internet, by their fans. The band returned to Mexicali Live on December 11 to perform their final show of 2009. The show was a release party for Live At Mexicali 2009, a DVD and CD recording of the show held at the same location, the previous April. Towards the end of Mucky Pup's set, the original lineup of Dog Eat Dog reunited onstage to perform two songs. Mucky Pup continued to perform in 2010 starting with a performance at The Saint, a nightclub located in Asbury Park, New Jersey, on January 16. On May 1, 2010, the band performed at a small benefit show held in honor of Marc DiNardo, a Jersey City Emergency Services Unit Police Officer, and longtime fan of the band, who was killed in the line of duty in July, 2009. Mucky Pup made its return to Europe during the summer of 2010 for several festival and club dates. The most notable appearance of the tour was on June 27 at the Graspop Metal Meeting in Dessel, Belgium where the band appeared alongside acts such as Killswitch Engage, Amon Amarth and Kiss. The band returned for a third performance at Mexicali Live in Teaneck, New Jersey on November 24, 2010 with Murphy's Law as an opening act. On February 27, 2011, Mucky Pup appeared as an opening act for D.R.I. at Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. A short tour of the Netherlands and Belgium followed in the first week of June, 2011 and featured the lineup of Chris Milnes, Kevin Powers, Mark DeBacker and Sean Kilkenny. On June 24, 2011, Mucky Pup performed on the first day of the three-day East Coast Tsunami Fest in Reading, Pennsylvania where they shared the stage with several bands such as Skarhead, Murphy's Law and Left√∂ver Crack. The band returned to Mexicali Live on November 25, 2011 as an opening act for Assault, a band featuring John Connor of Dog Eat Dog and Nelson Decastro within its lineup. Mucky Pup performed its first show of 2012 at The Blue Room in Secaucus, New Jersey on February 10 and featured the line up of Chris Milnes, Dave Neabore, Kevin Powers and Sean Kilkenny. The show served as a warm-up show for a tour of Europe scheduled to run from mid-February through early March and featuring the previous year's European lineup of Chris Milnes, Kevin Powers, Mark DeBacker and Sean Kilkenny. The band returned to The Blue Room on November 27, 2013 with the five-piece lineup of Chris Milnes, Dave Neabore, Dan Nastasi, Sean Kilkenny and Matt DeSomma. On March 14, 2014, Mucky Pup performed with D.R.I. once again at the Studio at Webster Hall in New York City. Both bands performed the following night as well at Mexical Live in Teaneck, New Jersey. Both nights featured the five-piece lineup of Chris Milnes, Dave Neabore, Dan Nastasi, Sean Kilkenny and John Milnes. The band ceased performing again after these two 2014 shows and their official website shut down.

One of the most prominent architects of the period between the first and second World Wars, he is best known for his 1931 Shell- Haus in Berlin. Life and career Born in Aachen, Fahrenkamp came to D√ºsseldorf to work in the office of Wilhelm Kreis from 1909 to 1912. He became an assistant, then professor, at the D√ºsseldorf Academy of Art. His work in the 1920s and early 1930s was an integration of progressive Neues Bauen‚Äîsimplified forms, flat roofs, repeated window patterns‚Äîwith features of traditional styles. The Shell-Haus is widely considered Fahrenkamp's masterpiece, and one of the most significant office block designs of the Weimar Republic. It did escape criticism, however: One of the only times Adolf Hitler inveighed against a specific building in Berlin, as opposed to modern urban architecture in general, was when he told Fahrenkamp, \\"You're the man who committed the crime of the Shell Building.\\" Despite this, Fahrenkamp received Nazi commissions for exhibition buildings, and had dealings with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels; Hermann G√∂ring, the head of the Luftwaffe and the Four Year Plan; and Albert Speer, Hitler's favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments and War Production. When Fahrenkamp was \\"de- Nazified\\" after the war, he remained active as an architect but withdrew from public life. He died on May 24, 1966, leaving behind a wife and two daughters.

It is normally used when there is a recurring need for expendable goods. Blanket orders are often used when a customer buys large quantities and has obtained special discounts. Based on the blanket order, sales orders ('blanket releases' or 'release orders') and invoice items can be created as needed until the contract is fulfilled, the end of the order period is reached or a pre-determined maximum order value is reached. Benefits Issuing a blanket order allows a customer not to hold more stock than necessary at any time, and avoids the administrative expense of processing frequent purchase orders, while favoring discount pricing through volume commitments or price breaks. On the supplier's side, a blanket order may provide the benefit of guaranteeing ongoing business and also help suppliers better predict future cash flows and orders. A blanket order is set at a fixed priced contract for a period of time. The buyer looks for the best pricing among competing supplier bids. After the best one is chosen, the prices of goods are fixed, and also quantities of each product are given to the supplier to prepare stock for on requested delivery. Forecasted quantity is provided by the buyer as full usage quantity recorded historically a few years or as needed for quantitative analysis. The supplier may give a condition of quantity to supply for this [contract]. For example, 80% of the forecast quantity must be bought at the end of the contract, which may be one or two years. The blanket order will charge the delayed delivery if the supplier could not supply the products in the contract on time. Anyway, since the supplier has already kept the stock for ready delivery for the first year or agreed period, if the buyer could not fulfill the contract's conditions, such as \\"must buy 80% of forecast quantity within a year,\\" the contract may be extended, or the delay charge could be no more, or no other charges requested by the buyer. Realistically, at the end of the blanket order contract, the buyer would not buy at forecasted quantity as agreed in the contract say, 80% of the demand sent to the supplier. The buyer will also allow the supplier to sell the products in the contract to reduce the quantity. The supplier also has to talk and inform the buyer about the quantities of goods kept in order that the buyer could know the status of the stock. Before the buyer issuing the purchase order to the supplier, the buyer must ask the supplier first about stock availability to avoid the problem from no stock availability. Blanket orders or call-off orders may also be used for ordering services, for example for maintenance and repair services. In these cases, the benefits associated with stock-holding do not arise but the call-off order may allow emergency repairs or on-call maintenance to be arranged easily at guaranteed rates. Difficulties The most difficult part of having a contract is determining the forecast quantity arranged by the user of the product. As the forecast quantity can be difficult to get, the supplier must be aware of the quantity to keep in stock. An easy way to do this is to discuss with the buyer what quantity to keep in stock. For example, they might keep only 20% in stock in the first 6 months, so that the supplier and the buyer are able to review the quantity and adjust it appropriately. This reduces the stock burden of the supplier during the contract period and might help the buyer at the end of the contract if the stock does not move as quickly as anticipated. The contract might be extended year after year, but it can be adjusted each time as more relevant forecasting history will predicate the need to decrease or increase stock requirements. Alternatively, some companies may utilize forecasted information via a material requirements planning system to determine appropriate stock quantities throughout the product's life cycle.

The rind is affixed to the top of the square-section main shaft or spindle and supports the entire weight of the runner stone, which can be as much as several tons. The face of a runner stone usually has a carved depression, called the \\"Spanish cross\\", to accommodate the millrind. The rind is necessary because the grain is fed through the runner stone's central hole, so the spindle cannot be inserted through it like a cartwheel on an axle. Mechanism A later refinement, replacing the cross, was to mount a mace onto the spindle, which fitted into a gimbal let into the runner stone. The device allowed the runner stone to move in two planes and thus follow the nether (stationary) stone more closely, but great care had to be taken to ensure that its weight was properly balanced. The separation of the nether stone from the runner, controlling the fineness of the grind, was adjusted by the tenter mechanism: a screw jack to raise or lower the bearing carrying the base of spindle. In heraldry The millrind occasionally appears as a charge in heraldry, in which it is often known by the French name fer-de-moline (\\"iron of a mill\\"). Like real millrinds, the fer-de-moline is highly variable in form. The 16th century writer Bossewell characterized it as a symbol fit for judges and magistrates, who keep men on a straight course just as a millrind does with a runner stone. However it is more often found in canting arms of families with names such as Miller, Milne and Mills. Another charge based on the millrind is the cross moline, which takes the form of a cross with bifurcated ends (sometimes with a pierced centre and sometimes without). In early blazons the term fer-de-moline often refers to the cross moline.

A majority of the insurgents were foreigners. They prevailed upon American minister John L. Stevens to call in the U.S. Marines to protect United States interests, an action that effectively buttressed the rebellion. The revolutionaries established the Republic of Hawaii, but their ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which occurred in 1898. The 1993 Apology Resolution by the U.S. Congress concedes that \\"the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and [...] the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum\\". Debates regarding the event play an important role in the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.  Background  The Kamehameha Dynasty was the reigning monarchy of the Hawaiian Kingdom, beginning with its founding by Kamehameha I in 1795, until the death of Kamehameha V in 1872 and Lunalilo in 1874. On July 6, 1846, U.S. Secretary of State John C. Calhoun, on behalf of President Tyler, formally recognized Hawaii's independence under the reign of Kamehameha III. As a result of the recognition of Hawaiian independence, the Hawaiian Kingdom entered into treaties with the major nations of the world and established over ninety legations and consulates in multiple seaports and cities. The kingdom would continue for another 21 years until its overthrow in 1893 with the fall of the House of KalƒÅkaua.  Sugar reciprocity  Sugar had been a major export from Hawaii since Captain James Cook arrived in 1778. The first permanent plantation in the islands was on Kauai in 1835. William Hooper leased 980 acres (4 km¬≤) of land from Kamehameha III and began growing sugar cane. Within thirty years there would be plantations on four of the main islands. Sugar had completely altered Hawaii's economy. The influence of the United States in Hawaiian government began with American-born plantation owners advocating for fair representation in the Kingdom's politics, owing to the significant tax contributions made from the plantations to both the Royal family and national economy. This was driven by missionary religion and the economics of the sugar industry. Pressure from these foreign born politicians was being felt by the King and chiefs with demands of land tenure. After a five month occupation by the British in 1843, Kamehameha III relented to the foreign advisors to private land demands with the Great MƒÅhele, distributing the lands as pushed on heavily by the missionaries, including Gerrit P. Judd. During the 1850s, the U.S. import tariff on sugar from Hawaii was much higher than the import tariffs Hawaiians were charging the U.S., and Kamehameha III sought reciprocity. The monarch wished to lower the tariffs being paid out to the U.S. while still maintaining the Kingdom's sovereignty and making Hawaiian sugar competitive with other foreign markets. In 1854 Kamehameha III proposed a policy of reciprocity between the countries but the proposal died in the U.S. Senate. Charles Reed Bishop, Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hawaii) As early as 1873, a United States military commission recommended attempting to obtain Ford Island in exchange for the tax-free importation of sugar to the U.S. Major General John Schofield, U.S. commander of the military division of the Pacific, and Brevet Brigadier General Burton S. Alexander arrived in Hawaii to ascertain its defensive capabilities. United States control of Hawaii was considered vital for the defense of the west coast of the United States, and they were especially interested in Pu'uloa, Pearl Harbor. The sale of one of Hawaii's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop, a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family, had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and owned a country home near Pu'uloa. He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs, although his wife, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands. As monarch, William Charles Lunalilo, was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians. Many islanders thought that all the islands, rather than just Pearl Harbor, might be lost and opposed any cession of land. By November 1873, Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking, against his doctor's advice; his health declined swiftly, and he died on February 3, 1874. Lunalilo left no heirs. The legislature was empowered by the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David KalƒÅkaua as the next monarch. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. KalƒÅkaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravention of the traditions of the Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('ƒÄina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale to anyone. In 1874 through 1875, KalƒÅkaua traveled to the United States for a state visit to Washington DC to help gain support for a new treaty. Congress agreed to the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 for seven years in exchange for Ford Island. After the treaty, sugar production expanded from of farm land to in 1891. At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.  Rebellion of 1887 and the Bayonet Constitution  Lorrin Thurston, Minister of the Interior (Hawaii) On January 20, 1887, the United States began leasing Pearl Harbor. Shortly afterwards, a group of mostly non-Hawaiians calling themselves the Hawaiian Patriotic League began the Rebellion of 1887. They drafted their own constitution on July 6, 1887. The new constitution was written by Lorrin Thurston, the Hawaiian Minister of the Interior who used the Hawaiian militia as threat against KalƒÅkaua. KalƒÅkaua was forced under threat of assassination to dismiss his cabinet ministers and sign a new constitution which greatly lessened his power. It would become known as the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" due to the threat of force used. The Bayonet Constitution allowed the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but had stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature. Eligibility to vote for the House of Nobles was also altered, stipulating that both candidates and voters were now required to own property valuing at least three thousand dollars, or have an annual income of no less than six hundred dollars. This resulted in disenfranchising two thirds of the native Hawaiians as well as other ethnic groups who had previously held the right to vote but were no longer able to meet the new voting requirements. This new constitution benefited the white, foreign plantation owners. With the legislature now responsible for naturalizing citizens, Americans and Europeans could retain their home country citizenship and vote as citizens of the kingdom. Along with voting privileges, Americans could now run for office and still retain their United States citizenship, something not afforded in any other nation of the world and even allowed Americans to vote without becoming naturalized. Asian immigrants were completely shut out and were no longer able to acquire citizenship or vote at all. At the time of the Bayonet Constitution Grover Cleveland was president, and his secretary of state Thomas F. Bayard sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, \\"the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.\\" In July 1889, there was a small scale rebellion, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved his action. Merrill's replacement, minister John L. Stevens, read those official instructions, and followed them in his controversial actions of 1893.  Wilcox Rebellion of 1888   ªIolani Barracks, 2007 The Wilcox Rebellion of 1888 was a plot to overthrow King David KalƒÅkaua, king of Hawaii, and replace him with his sister in a coup d'√©tat in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king after the 1887 constitution. KalƒÅkaua's sister, Princess Lili ªuokalani and his wife, Queen Kapiolani, returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain. In October 1887, Robert William Wilcox, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, returned to Hawaii. The funding had stopped for his study program when the new constitution was signed. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Lili ªuokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King KalƒÅkaua to replace him with his sister, Lili ªuokalani. They had 300 Hawaiian conspirators hidden in  ªIolani Barracks and an alliance with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt would have been initiated. No one was prosecuted but Wilcox was exiled. So on February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife. Princess Lili ªuokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers outright.  Lili ªuokalani attempts to re-write Constitution  In November 1889, KalƒÅkaua traveled to San Francisco for his health, staying at the Palace Hotel. He died there on January 20, 1891. His sister Lili ªuokalani assumed the throne in the middle of an economic crisis. The McKinley Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian advantage gained via the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. Many Hawaii businesses and citizens felt pressure from the loss of revenue; in response Lili ªuokalani proposed a lottery system to raise money for her government. Also proposed was a controversial opium licensing bill. Her ministers, and closest friends, were all opposed to this plan; they unsuccessfully tried to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis. Lili ªuokalani's chief desire was to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Bayonet Constitution and promulgating a new one, an idea that seems to have been broadly supported by the Hawaiian population.Russ, The Hawaiian Revolution, p. 67: \\"She ... defended her act[ions] by showing that, out of a possible 9,500 native voters in 1892, 6,500 asked for a new Constitution.\\" The 1893 Constitution would have increased suffrage by reducing some property requirements, and eliminated the voting privileges extended to European and American residents. It would have disenfranchised many resident European and American businessmen who were not citizens of Hawaii. The Queen toured several of the islands on horseback, talking to the people about her ideas and receiving overwhelming support, including a lengthy petition in support of a new constitution. However, when the Queen informed her cabinet of her plans, they withheld their support due to an understanding of what her opponents' likely response to these plans would be.Daws, Shoal of Time, p271: The Queen's new cabinet \\"had been in office less than a week, and whatever they thought about the need for a new constitution... they knew enough about the temper of the queen's opponents to realize that they would endure the chance to challenge her, and no minister of the crown could look forward... to that confrontation.\\" Though there were threats to Hawaii's sovereignty throughout the Kingdom's history, it was not until the signing of the Bayonet Constitution in 1887 that this threat began to be realized. The precipitating event leading to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom on January 17, 1893, was the attempt by Queen Lili ªuokalani to promulgate a new constitution that would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature, where Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power. The stated goals of the conspirators, who were non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects (five United States nationals, one English national, and one German national) were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States. From Kuykendall, p. 587-588: \\"W.D. Alexander (History of Later Years of the Hawaiian Monarchy and the Revolution of 1893, p. 37) gives the following as the wording of Thurston's motion [to launch the coup]: 'That preliminary steps be taken at once to form and declare a Provisional Government with a view to annexation to the United States.' Thurston later wrote that his motion was 'substantially as follows: \\"I move that it is the sense of this meeting that the solution of the present situation is annexation to the United States.\\"'(Memoirs, p. 250) Lt. Lucien Young (The Boston at Hawaii, p. 175) gives the following version of the motion: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that in view of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, the proper course to pursue is to abolish the monarchy and apply for annexation to the United States.'\\"  Overthrow  Queen Lili ªuokalani The overthrow of the monarchy was started by newspaper publisher Lorrin Thurston, a Hawaiian subject and former Minister of the Interior who was the grandson of American missionaries, and formally led by the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, an American lawyer. They derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaii and other supporters of the Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Most of the leaders of the Committee of Safety that deposed the queen were United States and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects. They included legislators, government officers, and a Supreme Court Justice of the Hawaiian Kingdom. On January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles B. Wilson was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned overthrow. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by Attorney General Arthur P. Peterson and the Queen's cabinet, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard, Samuel Nowlein, had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen. The events began on January 17, 1893, when John Good, a revolutionist, shot Leialoha, a native policeman who was trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Committee of Safety led by Lorrin Thurston. The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the overthrow before it could begin. The Committee of Safety initiated the overthrow by organizing approximately 1,500 armed local (non-native) men, under their leadership, intending to depose Queen Lili ªuokalani. The forces garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from  ªIolani Palace and waited for the Queen's response. As these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu.The Morgan Report, p808‚Äì809, \\"At the request of many citizens, whose wives and families were helpless and in terror of an expected uprising of the mob, which would burn and destroy, a request was made and signed by all of the committee, addressed to Minister Stevens, that troops might be landed to protect houses and private property. On January 17, 1893, the Chairman of the Committee of Safety, Henry E. Cooper, addressed a crowd assembled in front of  ªIolani Palace (the official royal residence) and read aloud a proclamation that formally deposed Queen Lili ªuokalani, abolished the Hawaiian monarchy, and established a Provisional Government of Hawaii under President Sanford B. Dole.  United States involvement  John L. Stevens, a United States diplomat, supported the new government in Hawaii with a small Marine detachment. USS Boston President Harrison's Secretary of State John W. Foster in 1892-1894 actively worked for the annexation of the independent Republic of Hawaii. Pro-American business interests had overthrown the Queen when she rejected constitutional limits on her powers. The new government realized that Hawaii was too small and militarily weak to survive in a world of aggressive imperialism, especially on the part of Japan. It was eager for American annexation. Foster believed Hawaii was vital to American interests in the Pacific.Michael J. Devine, \\"John W. Foster and the Struggle for the Annexation of Hawaii.\\" Pacific Historical Review 46.1 (1977): 29-50 online. The annexation program was coordinated by the chief American diplomat on the scene John L. Stevens. He sent in a Marine detachment after the Queen was deposed to support the new government and prevent a vacuum that might open the way for Japan.William Michael Morgan, \\"The anti-Japanese origins of the Hawaiian Annexation treaty of 1897.\\" Diplomatic History 6.1 (1982): 23-44.Online Advised about supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and propertyKinzer, S. (2006) America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq. p. 30. [Minister Stevens] \\"certainly overstepped his authority when he brought troops ashore, especially since he knew that the 'general alarm and terror' of which the Committee of Safety had complained was a fiction.\\" by the Committee of Safety, Stevens obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the USS Boston and 162 sailors to land on Oahu under orders of neutrality and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. The deposed Queen was kept in  ªIolani Palace under house arrest. The American sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively. The Queen never had an army, the local police did not support her, and no one mobilized any pro-royalist forces. Historian William Russ states, \\"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\\" Due to the Queen's desire \\"to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life\\" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a provisional government. According to the Queen's Book, her friend and minister Walker \\"came and told me that he had come on a painful duty, that the opposition party had requested that I should abdicate.\\" After consulting with her ministers, including Walker, the Queen concluded that \\"since the troops of the United States had been landed to support the revolutionists, by the order of the American minister, it would be impossible for us to make any resistance\\". Despite repeated claims that the overthrow was \\"bloodless\\", the Queen's Book notes that Lili ªuokalani received \\"friends [who] expressed their sympathy in person; amongst these Mrs. J. S. Walker, who had lost her husband by the treatment he received from the hands of the insurgents. He was one of many who from persecution had succumbed to death.\\" Immediate annexation was prevented by President Grover Cleveland who told Congress: > ... the military demonstration upon the soil of Honolulu was of itself an > act of war; unless made either with the consent of the government of Hawaii > or for the bona fide purpose of protecting the imperiled lives and property > of citizens of the United States. But there is no pretense of any such > consent on the part of the government of the queen ... the existing > government, instead of requesting the presence of an armed force, protested > against it. There is as little basis for the pretense that forces were > landed for the security of American life and property. If so, they would > have been stationed in the vicinity of such property and so as to protect > it, instead of at a distance and so as to command the Hawaiian Government > Building and palace ... When these armed men were landed, the city of > Honolulu was in its customary orderly and peaceful condition ... The Republic of Hawaii was nonetheless declared in 1894 by the same parties which had established the provisional government. Among them were Lorrin A. Thurston, a drafter of the Bayonet Constitution. The Committee of Safety asked Sanford Dole to become President of the forcibly instated Republic. He agreed, and became President on July 4, 1894.  Aftermath  December 19, 1898 letter A provisional government was set up with the strong support of the Honolulu Rifles, a militia group which had defended the system of government promulgated by the Bayonet Constitution against the Wilcox rebellion of 1889. The Queen's statement yielding authority, on January 17, 1893, protested against the overthrow: On December 19, 1898 the queen would amend the declaration with the \\"Memorial of Queen Liliuokalani in relation to the Crown lands of Hawaii\\", further protesting the overthrow and loss of property.  Response   United States  Newly inaugurated President Grover Cleveland called for an investigation into the overthrow. This investigation was conducted by former Congressman James Henderson Blount. Blount concluded in his report on July 17, 1893, \\"United States diplomatic and military representatives had abused their authority and were responsible for the change in government.\\" Minister Stevens was recalled, and the military commander of forces in Hawai ªi was forced to resign his commission. President Cleveland stated, \\"Substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people requires we should endeavor to repair the monarchy.\\" Cleveland further stated in his 1893 State of the Union Address that, \\"Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our Government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing us and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention.\\" The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress on December 18, 1893, after the Queen refused to accept amnesty for the traitors as a condition of reinstatement. Hawaii President Sanford Dole was presented a demand for reinstatement by Minister Willis, who had not realized Cleveland had already sent the matter to Congress‚ÄîDole flatly refused Cleveland's demands to reinstate the Queen. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator John Tyler Morgan (D-Alabama) and composed mostly of senators in favor of annexation, initiated their own investigation to discredit Blount's earlier report, using pro- annexationist affidavits from Hawaii, and testimony provided to the U.S. Senate in Washington, D.C.

In 1993, the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Congress passed a resolution, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, offering an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for its involvement in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The law is known as the Apology Resolution, and represents one of the few times that the United States government has formally apologized for its actions.  International  Every government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii, except for the United Kingdom, recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow via their consulates. Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Imperial Germany, Sweden, Spain, Imperial Japan,During the overthrow, the Japanese Imperial Navy gunboat Naniwa was docked at Pearl Harbor. The gunboat's commander, Heihachiro Togo, who later commanded the Japanese battleship fleet at Tsushima, refused to accede to the Provisional Government's demands that he strike the colors of the Kingdom, but later lowered the colors on order of the Japanese Government. Along with every other international legations in Honolulu, the Japanese Consulate-General, Suburo Fujii, quickly recognized the Provisional Government as the \\"de facto\\" legitimate successor to the monarchy.

When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate de facto recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November 1894. The provisional government, with all its faults, had major difficulties in obtaining recognition, especially from Cleveland, and it was not considered likely that the republic would have any foreign problems. Recognition albeit de facto came about even more quickly than it had in 1893, for at least there was no question of a overthrow having taken place or of the government's control of the domestic situation.  Hawaiian counter-revolution  A four-day uprising between January 6 and 9, 1895, began with an attempted coup d'√©tat to restore the monarchy, and included battles between Royalists and the republican rebels. Later, after a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds after the attempted rebellion in 1895, Queen Lili ªuokalani was placed under arrest, tried by a military tribunal of the Republic of Hawai ªi, convicted of misprision of treason and imprisoned in her own home. On January 24, Lili ªuokalani abdicated, formally ending the Hawaiian monarchy.  Republic, United States annexation, United States Territory  The K≈´ ªƒì Petitions. Several pro-royalist groups submitted petitions against annexation in 1897. In 1900 those groups disbanded and formed the Hawaiian Independent Party, under the leadership of Robert Wilcox, the first congressional representative from the Territory of Hawaii The Committee of Safety declared Sanford Dole to be President of the new Provisional Government of the Kingdom of Hawai ªi on January 17, 1893, removing only the Queen, her cabinet, and her marshal from office. On July 4, 1894, the Republic of Hawai ªi was proclaimed. Dole was president of both governments. As a republic, it was the intention of the government to campaign for annexation with the United States. The rationale behind annexation included a strong economic component‚ÄîHawaiian goods and services exported to the mainland would not be subject to United States tariffs, and would benefit from domestic bounties, if Hawaii was part of the United States. In 1897, William McKinley succeeded Cleveland as United States president. A year later he signed the Newlands Resolution, which provided for the annexation of Hawaii on July 7, 1898. The formal ceremony marking the annexation was held at Iolani Palace on August 12, 1898. Almost no Native Hawaiians attended, and those few who were on the streets wore royalist ilima blossoms in their hats or hair, and, on their breasts Hawaiian flags with the motto: Kuu Hae Aloha (\\"my beloved flag\\"). Most of the 40,000 Native Hawaiians, including Lili ªuokalani and the royal family, shuttered themselves in their homes, protesting against what they considered an illegal transaction. \\"When the news of Annexation came it was bitterer than death to me\\", Lili ªuokalani's niece, Princess Ka ªiulani, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"It was bad enough to lose the throne, but infinitely worse to have the flag go down.\\" The Hawaiian flag was lowered for the last time while the Royal Hawaiian Band played the Hawaiian national anthem, Hawai ªi Pono ªƒ´. The Hawaiian Islands, together with the distant Palmyra Island and Stewart Islands, became the Territory of Hawaii, a United States organized incorporated territory, with a new government established on February 22, 1900. Sanford Dole was appointed as the first governor.  ªIolani Palace served as the capitol of the Hawaiian government until 1969.

Safe conduct is only granted in exceptional circumstances. It may be given to an enemy to allow retreat under surrender terms, or for a meeting to negotiate; to a stateless person; or to somebody who for some reason would normally not be able to pass. A vanquished enemy can also be given, or offered quarter, i.e. be spared, be promised or guaranteed mercy. The term 'safe conduct' is also used to mean the document authorizing this security. In Islamic law, safe conduct or pledge of safety (amƒÅn) can be granted to foreigners or dhimmi residents (musta'min) while they travel or reside in Islamic-ruled lands. In the early Middle Ages, during some periods of Islamic control of the Holy Land, Christian pilgrims could request letters of safe conduct from a Muslim ruler allowing them to pass through their lands to Jerusalem. An example of safe conduct in the 20th century was Lenin's \\"sealed train\\": a citizen of Russia, a country at war with Germany, Lenin was permitted to travel from his exile in Switzerland through Germany, without stopping, to return to Russia.

It was recognised as a country park in 1980, and it is the only country park in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, Scotland's first national park. Balloch Country Park features nature trails, guided walks, a walled garden, and picnic lawns with views of the Loch. It was originally developed in the early 19th century by John Buchanan, a partner in the Glasgow and Ship Bank, and the gardens were significantly improved by the Dennistoun-Browns, who bought the estate in 1851. Buchanan also built Balloch Castle, which now serves as the park's visitors' center. Balloch Castle Balloch Castle was built in the Scottish baronial style as a residence in 1808 by the architect Robert Lugar at the order of John Buchanan of Ardoch. The new castle used stone from an earlier castle built near the current site by the Earl of Lennox in 1238 and occupied by the Lennox family until approximately 1390. Situated nearer the water than the present day castle, the only remnant of the original structure is a mound that once formed the moat. This site is given statutory protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The current castle used to serve visitors centre and the headquarters of the Countryside Ranger Service in the park, but now lies derelict. The castle grounds offers a car park and walled garden with trees and shrubs, including the rhododendrons and azaleas that reach full bloom in late May and early June. Events Balloch Park is host to the annual Loch Lomond Highland games each summer. Events such as caber tossing and typical Scottish cuisine attract many visitors. In June 1991 Scottish folk-rock band Runrig played to an audience of 40,000. Oasis played a gig to 80,000 people over two nights in the summer of 1996, as did R.E.M. in 2005. BBC Radio 1 roadshow used the park as a location for annual live shows in the 90's with Travis, Skunk Anansie, Billie Piper and Jason Donovan playing. In August 2007 the first Live at Loch Lomond music festival took place in the grounds of the park. The second Live At Loch Lomond was also a success generating respect from the crowd.

It is located between Stowey and Clutton, in the civil parish of Stowey in the English county of Somerset. The farm house is 18th century and the surrounding land includes neutral grassland, wildflower meadows and woodlands with splendid views. Much of Folly Farm is designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Some of the land has never been ploughed. The SSSI comprises two adjacent areas, the meadows (19.36 hectares) and Dowlings Wood (9 hectares). It is also a Local Nature Reserve. It can be found near Bishop Sutton in the Chew Valley, just off the A368. The site is situated on a curved ridge of land on neutral soils derived from the underlying Keuper Marl. The soil is of the Icknield Association with dark brown, moist but moderately well-drained clay. The nature reserve includes the Folly Oak which is over 400 years old. Wildlife It attracts a wide range of birds including marsh tit (Parus palustris), buzzard (Buteo buteo) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The pasture is of a kind now rare in the area. In summer the site has a wide variety of flowers such as betony (Stachys), oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) and heath spotted orchid (Orchidaceae). In late summer, it is covered with drifts of black knapweed (Centaurea) and devil's bit scabious (scabiosa). Many butterflies can be seen throughout the summer, including marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurina), ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus), gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea). A number of scarce species of fly are listed from the site in Gibbs (2002). The cranefly Atypophthalmus inustus was recorded in Folly Wood in 2001 and the cranefly Ormosia bicornis was found in both Folly Wood and Dowlings Wood in 2000‚Äì2001. Prior to these records there had been no previous published records from the county of Somerset. The fungus gnats Keroplatus testaceus, Macrocera pusilla, Megophthalmidia crassicornis, Exechiopsis dumitrescae and Exechiopsis membranacea have all been recorded, the first four in 2000 in Dowlings Wood, and the last at Folly Wood in 2001. Other species recorded at Dowlings Wood in 2000 were Platypalpus mikii, a member of the family Hybotidae, and the hoverfly Volucella inflata, while the soldierfly Oxycera pardalina was recorded from Folly Wood in 2001. Finally, the picture-winged fly Herina palustris and the hoverflies Criorhina ranunculi and Orthonevra brevicornis were recorded at Folly Farm in 1999.Natural England SSSI citation sheet Folly Farm Centre The site was purchased from the Strachey family who were lords of the manor of the nearby Sutton Court in 1987. Avon Wildlife Trust opened Folly Farm Centre as an education venue in May 2008. The insulation in the centre's roofs is provided by sheep's wool. It also has a solar panel, a biomass boiler fired by wood pellets and a willow sewage treatment area.

They made news only on the night of January 26, when they kidnapped Springfield, Missouri police officer Thomas Persell.Persell had watched their car slowly cruising the downtown area and suspected an imminent car theft. He stopped them on a bridge, which made Barrow suspect that more police were lying in wait on the other side. They released him unharmed six hours later and fifty miles away, but kept his Russian-made, custom-grip gun, which was next seen in the roll of photographs recovered at Joplin, in one picture hooked over the hood ornament of their latest stolen V-8, in another tucked into Barrow's waistband as Parker holds a shotgun on him and reaches to take it. \\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde\\"; Guinn pp.157-59; O'Brien, Mike. \\"Book follows bloody trail of Bonnie, Clyde across Ozarks,\\" Springfield News-Leader, January 4, 2004.

They saw how their pictures came out at the same time as thousands of newspaper readers: in April the rolls of film were captured by police, developed, and published. The playful pictures brought unintended consequences, particularly one of Bonnie Parker squinting defiantly at the camera, her foot planted on the bumper of a stolen car, a gun at her outthrust hip and a cigar hanging from her mouth.Though Parker's pose for this snapshot was a comic exaggeration of every gun-moll clich√© she could think of, the newspapers selected it to represent the \\"Bonnie Parker\\" for whom alert readers should be on the lookout. The picture shocked and titillated the public and branded Parker for the rest of her life and beyond as \\"Barrow's cigar-smoking gun girl.\\" Inspired, crime magazines and newspapers across the country fleshed out the cartoon characterization of Parker to such a distorted degree that a year later, in April 1934, when their last kidnap victim asked her, \\"What shall I tell [the papers], Bonnie?\\" she chose to say, \\"Tell them I don't smoke cigars.\\" (On page 39 of Ted Hinton's 1977 as-told-to memoir Ambush is the revelation that Parker actually was holding a rose in her teeth, and that the Joplin Globes art department had painted in a cigar.)

The three returned to Dallas on March 24 or 25 and learned that on March 23, Clyde's older brother Buck had been pardoned from Huntsville penitentiary. On the night of March 25 they surprised Buck and his wife Blanche at Blanche's mother's home and persuaded Buck to vacation with them in strategically located Joplin, Missouri.Barrow pp. 24-35. Joplin's location, only a few miles from three state lines, made it a convenient base for criminals in the days before interstate police cooperation was common. Barrow was familiar with the area. In November he and West Dallas associates Frank Hardy and Hollis Hale had robbed the bank at Oronogo, a farm crossroads near Joplin, of a few dollars. At another area bank the three burst in, ready to rob, only to be told by the lone clerk that the bank had failed weeks earlier. Disillusioned, Hardy and Hale ditched Bonnie and Clyde outside Carthage, north of Joplin, in early December. Guinn pp. 141-43. The Barrow Gang marked Christmas Eve back in Dallas with their families, and that night they headed out with a new helper, W.D. Jones.

Harryman. The Officer Down Memorial Page and motor detective Harry McGinnisDetective Harry McGinnis. The Officer Down Memorial Page were killed by shotgun.The Joplin shootout is a Rashomon of conflicting stories. Ramsey at pp. 105 and 107 cites research by James Knight to state that Clyde Barrow killed both officers. Clyde was using a shotgun, as was Buck in the versions that include Buck firing at all. Phillips states that Jones used a shotgun. Officer Kahler said that Jones fired a machine gun directly at him; the blast took off part of the side of the house toward which Kahler was running, Kahler p. 21; however, Phillips says it was Clyde who \\"stepped calmly through the garage doors\\", crouched at the corner of the building and shot at Kahler with a shotgun, hitting the nearby house. Jones, of course, told police he didn't shoot anything at all. Though Officer Grammer, Lt. Kahler's partner, later told the Joplin Globe that he glimpsed W.D. Jones and \\"a woman\\" firing from the upstairs windows, and Parker told family that she \\"fired a shot\\" from upstairs (Barrow pp. 51-2), no other eyewitness testimony supports this and Officer Grammer did not mention it at either coroner's inquest the following day. Phillips p. 128, Guinn p. 398. Police estimated that this shootout lasted about one minute, from first shot to last.Kahler p. 21. The most serious injury to the Barrows was to W.D. Jones. He was struck in the left side, possibly by a shot fired through the garage's glass window by Detective McGinnis or through the still-open garage door by Officer Harryman's only fired round,Guinn p. 169. though Officer Kahler of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, recalling the battle in 1980, said that he himself shot Jones below the right shoulder blade, many seconds after the two fatally wounded officers were down.Kahler pp. 21-2. The Barrows fled westward; they stopped once at a gas station for aspirin and rubbing alcohol. They moved Jones into the front seat and wrapped him in the blanket that usually covered the guns; Parker pried open his wound with knitting needles and poured rubbing alcohol into it.Kahler p. 21. Describing the aftermath of the Dexfield Park shootout, Jones told Playboy, \\"I reckon most folks find it hard to believe we never went to no doctor, but that's a fact. We stole a few doctors' bags out of cars and used that medicine. And we bought alcohol and salves at drugstores. But we couldn't risk going to a doctor and getting turned in.\\" In the Texas Panhandle, somewhere near Shamrock or Amarillo, they pulled over to examine their wounds. \\"Clyde wrapped an elm branch in gauze and pushed it through the hole in my side and out my back. The bullet had gone clean through me so we knew it would heal.\\"\\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde.\\" Descriptions of the Joplin shootout: Barrow pp. 50-58, footnotes pp. 243-46; Guinn pp. 166-69; Kahler pp.19-25; Phillips pp. 127-30; Ramsey pp. 100-15; U.S. Bureau of Investigation, memo describing Joplin events, May 27, 1933, FBI file 26-4114 Section 1 pp. 208-13. The unexpected viciousness of the apartment dwellers' response, the haul of weaponry recovered,The guns the Barrows left behind had been stolen from a National Guard armory and included a Browning Automatic Rifle, a kind of gun the local police didn't recognize, either because the make was unfamiliar to them (Guinn p. 172) or because it was an early Barrow scattergun. Bonnie and Clyde's Hideout and especially the rolls of film they left behind made the Barrow Gang suddenly wanted and recognizable far beyond Texas. In their immediate descriptions of the gun battle the police officers remembered only two shooters, whom they named as Clyde and Buck Barrow; no witness remembered a third man. Jones was never correctly identified while he was with Clyde Barrow; when he had to introduce himself during his time with the Barrows he used the name \\"Jack Sherman.\\"This was the same alias Ralph Fults used when he and Bonnie Parker were arrested in April 1932. \\"Mule Theft Charged to Man and Woman.\\" Unknown newspaper, April 21, 1932.

This note passes on a confidential tip given by a prisoner to a Dallas detective. Two months later during her interrogation in the Platte City jail, Blanche, though in hysterics, had the presence of mind to tell interrogating officers that the third man with them called himself Jack Sherman, and suggested his name might be Hubert Bleigh. This caused problems for the real Hubert Bleigh, a petty criminal from Oklahoma some of the Barrows may have known slightly. Barrow p. 288, fn.6. Ruston, Louisiana Two weeks later on April 27, in the middle of a car theft in Ruston, Louisiana, still not recovered from his Joplin wounds and perhaps tired of the constant bickering in the car as well as afraid for his life, Jones disappeared from the gang. (A fictionalized version of the Ruston car theft and subsequent kidnapping is the Gene Wilder-Evans Evans segment in Bonnie and Clyde.) According to his statement to Dallas police November 18, \\"[T]hey [the Barrow brothers] put me out of the car to steal a Chevrolet automobile for them. I saw this was my chance to escape and I jumped in this car and made my getaway and came back to Dallas, Texas.\\" The car he stole in Ruston was found 130 miles away, at the edge of the Mississippi River, in the eastern Arkansas railroad town of McGehee.Barrow p. 61, Ramsey pp. 115-17, Guinn pp. 177-80. Clyde didn't want to believe that the docile W.D. had deliberately abandoned the gang, but to Buck it was obvious, and a relief, that \\"the kid\\" had.Barrow p. 87, Guinn p. 189. Jones made his way back to Dallas and spoke with Mrs. Barrow at least once while he was there.Jones confession. In late May the gang sent Blanche to Dallas to bring money and news to the families; Barrow instructed her to bring Jones with her to their rendezvous. When Blanche passed this request on, both mothers were polite, but demurred; Mrs. Barrow told Blanche faintly that \\"she did not know if he wanted to go with Clyde or not\\"; LC and Mrs. Parker at least pretended to try to find him. Barrow arranged at least one more meeting, expressly asking his mother to find and return Jones then, but to no avail. Finally he and Parker drove into Dallas and picked him up themselves, on June 8 or 9.Barrow pp. 76, 87, 93-94; Jones confession; Guinn pp. 189, 402 footnotes to 189. In his statement to Dallas police Jones said, \\"[A]bout two o'clock in the afternoon.... I was walking along the road intending to go down to the lake and to go to a dance at the Five Point Dancehall that night. Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow drove up from behind me and stopped. They were in a V8 Coupe....They spoke to me and told me to get in the car and I got in. They asked me if I wanted to go with them, and I told them I did not, and Clyde said I was going anyway, and I did.\\"Jones confession. If Jones and Henry Methvin are to be believed, Barrow continued this technique of simply intimidating his strayed accomplices back into the fold. Methvin testified at his 1935 trial to a similar incident: in February 1934 Clyde and Bonnie snatched him up from a sawmill where he had started working. \\"Well he asked me, told me to get in the car with him. I got in the car. I told him I had rather stay there and work..... He said to come with me, and after we left there he said if I ever tried to leave him he would kill me, or find out where my people lived, he might kill them.\\" Methvin v. Oklahoma (selection), p. 35. After this, even when the five-person gang had two cars, \\"Clyde always wanted W.D. to be in the car with him.\\"Barrow p. 104. Wellington, Texas On the night of June 10, racing to meet Buck and Blanche in Oklahoma, Barrow was traveling too fast to notice a detour sign at the bridge over the Salt Fork of the Red River outside Wellington, Texas. \\"Suddenly the road disappeared.\\"Phillips p. 135. The car sailed into the air, turning over as it went, and crashed into the dry riverbed, rolling several times and coming to rest on its side. Battery acid poured onto Bonnie Parker, eating away the flesh of her right leg as she screamed and struggled. A farm family came to their aid, but quickly contacted police; \\"Bonnie told me I fired a shotgun there which wounded a woman in the hand.\\"Jones confession. In some retellings of this story Jones shot the woman's hand off. In reality, by lucky accident, only one of her fingers was nicked. But she was holding her baby, whose head was grazed by a flying piece of window screen. Guinn p. 194. Barrow and Jones kidnapped the responding officers, Sheriff George Corry and Marshal Paul Hardy, to make their escape.Descriptions of the Wellington incident: Phillips 135-37, Guinn 191-6, Barrow pp. 262-3. The Texas Historical Commission's marker at the crash site, erected in 1975 but perhaps relying on the 1933 newspaper reports, names Buck Barrow as the man with Clyde and Bonnie. \\"The Red River Plunge of Bonnie and Clyde.\\" The Historical Marker Database \\"Bonnie never got over that burn. Even after it healed over, her leg was drawn under her. She had to just hop or hobble along.\\"\\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde,\\" Phillips p. 161, Guinn p. 207. Barrow, who limped himself,He had amputated his left big toe and part of the second in Eastham prison farm in January 1932 (Guinn pp. 80-1, \\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde\\") and in photographs of him he very visibly favors that foot. Pain from his foot may be the reason he preferred to drive barefoot, as witnesses to the Commerce, Oklahoma shootings noted (Milner p. 128), or in his stocking feet. accommodated the new delays, expenses and detours her disability created in his life without hesitation, and while she healed he or Jones carried her wherever she needed to go. The gang holed up in a tourist cabin in Fort Smith, Arkansas, tending Parker, unable to move on until she recovered ‚Äî or died ‚Äî from her catastrophic injury. \\"She'd been burned so bad none of us thought she was gonna live. The hide on her right leg was gone, from her hip down to her ankle. I could see the bone at places.\\" During this time Barrow's love for Parker drove him to put his own life on the line several times to try to help her.Guinn pp. 196-99, Barrow pp. 98-101. Fayetteville, Arkansas With Barrow's attention focused on Parker, the problem of acquiring food and rent money fell to Buck and Jones. On June 23, as the two were fleeing the scene of a clumsy grocery store robbery fifty miles away in Fayetteville, they crested a hill on Highway 71 and smashed into the back of a slower moving vehicle. The driver climbed out of his car and grabbed two rocks; the Barrows jumped out of their car, Buck with a shotgun and Jones with a BAR. Town Marshal Henry HumphreyTown Marshal Henry Humphrey. The Officer Down Memorial Page of Alma and Crawford County Deputy Sheriff Ansel M. \\"Red\\" Salyers were also on Highway 71, driving toward Fayetteville to investigate the grocery store robbery. In the opposite lane the first car passed them ‚Äî they waved to the driver, whom they knew ‚Äî then seconds later came the speeding V-8. They heard the crash and turned around, and at the scene they recognized the V-8's Kansas plate. As Marshal Humphrey drew his gun and got out of the car, Buck shot him in the chest. Jones fired a round from the BAR at Salyers. Salyers ducked behind his car and fired back with a rifle, then as Jones fumbled to reload he dashed toward a farmhouse. Buck's shotgun had jammed; he ran to Salyers's car, yelling to Jones to get Humphrey's pistol. From the farmhouse a hundred yards away, Salyers took aim and managed to shoot off two of Jones's fingertips as the robbers careered away in his automobile. A few miles from Fort Smith Buck and Jones hijacked a couple's car at gunpoint, then realized the roads into Fort Smith were blocked. The car was found abandoned in the mountains.\\"Hot On Trail of 2 Desperadoes.\\" Associated Press. Unknown newspaper, June 24, 1933. Bonnie and Clyde Joplin Shootout Documents p. 151. Joplin, Missouri Police Department They staggered in the door of the tourist cabin ten hours after they had left. The Barrow Gang packed up what they could and decamped.Descriptions of the events of June 23: Guinn 199-205, Ramsey pp. 142-50, Phillips pp. 138-9. A drawing of the area noting the murder location and the escape route is reproduced at Barrow p. 102. The next month, Deputy Salyers drove 500 miles to a hospital in Perry, Iowa, to get a final statement from the dying Buck Barrow. Barrow admitted to Salyers that he had murdered Marshal Humphrey, and that he and the man with him ‚Äî who he finally confessed was \\"Jack Sherman\\"‚Äî had been shooting to kill them both.FBI file 26-4114 Section 1 p. 312. Officer Humphrey's pistol was found in the Barrows' debris at Dexfield Park.Guinn p. 229. In November, Jones told police that he had been stunned in the car crash and his memory of any ensuing action was hazy, but he was confident that only Buck was shooting. He did remember standing in the highway looking for a gold ring he had lost. However, the following February at the harboring trial, Jones read a statement in which he said both he and Buck had killed Humphrey.Phillips p. 344 fn.28. Platte City and Dexfield Park Always proud of their arsenal, the Barrow gang \\"shot\\" it for a posterity they could not have imagined. The cut-down shotgun is one of Barrow's \\"whippit\\" guns.\\"It had a one-inch rubber band he'd cut out of a car- tire inner tube attached to the cutoff stock. He'd slip his arm through the band and when he put his coat on, you'd never know the gun was there. The rubber band would give when he snatched it up to fire.\\" \\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde.\\" The pistol decorating the hood ornament is Officer Persell's. On July 20 around 1:00 a.m, thirteen lawmen led by Sheriff Holt Coffey,To avoid a trial, Blanche Barrow pled guilty to assault with intent to kill Sheriff Coffey, with whom she later became affectionate friends. Barrow pp. 144, 155. protecting themselves from expected machine gun fire with metal shields, advanced on the double cabin at the Red Crown Tourist Court in Platte City, Missouri. In the ensuing firefight Buck Barrow was shot in the head as he and Blanche ran to get inside the garage. Jones had started the V8's engine but was afraid to open the garage door, then was afraid to help Blanche drag Buck inside. As they flew toward the highway Blanche was partly blinded by shards of glass from the car's exploding windows. Clyde drove them north two hundred miles, running for a long time on flats, then rims, the floor of the car sloshing with Buck's blood. State and federal agents tracked them north following reports of blood-soaked and burned clothes and bandages in fields and on the sides of the road. The Barrow Gang finally hid in a brake of trees at the edge of an abandoned amusement park outside Dexter, Iowa. They attempted to leave the park the next day but, helplessly, returned: Buck's injuries were too severe.Descriptions of the Platte City ambush: Barrow pp. 109-22, 271-78; Phillips pp. 140-5; Guinn pp. 211-19; U.S. Bureau of Investigation memo describing Platte City and Dexfield Park events, August 17, 1933, FBI file 26-4114 Section 1 pp. 300-25. During the night of July 24 nearly one hundred law officers, National Guardsmen and interested, armed, mostly deputized citizens ‚Äî some with datesPhillips p. 150. ‚Äî crept up to the edges of the field, and as the sun rose a new shootout began. Parker, Barrow and Jones were badly wounded. Buck, unable to run, was shot six more times, and he and Blanche, who would not leave him, were captured.Barrow pp.130-36. \\"Half stumbling, half swimming,\\" Jones dragged and carried Parker a mile and a half while Barrow fought away the last of the posse. Bonnie told her sister that as she and W.D. hid in the brush, their wounds dripping blood, they heard distant gunfire and then a long silence. Bonnie began to weep and to wish they had a gun with them, so she could die with Clyde. But at last, Barrow crawled out of the woods.Parker p. 140. Billie Parker Moon wrote that her sister and Clyde had a suicide pact. Barrow p. 285, fn.21, citing unpublished Moon manuscript Bonnie, Clyde and Me, p. 11. Gesturing with an empty pistol he commandeered a car from a farmer and the trio escaped.Descriptions of the Dexfield Park ambush: Barrow pp. 122-36, Guinn 220-27, Phillips 150-56, Ramsey 164-86, \\"Riding with Bonnie and Clyde,\\" U.S. Bureau of Investigation memo pp. 300-25. They kept driving. Throughout August they plied the back roads from Nebraska to Minnesota to Mississippi, pausing in only the smallest towns to steal fresh cars and money for gas and food. They slept in the cars, parked in remote fields or woods or in ravines;Parker p. 142. the following winter, Barrow observed that he had not slept in a bed or even changed his clothes since his brother Buck was killed.Mullen, James. \\"I Framed Raymond Hamilton's Prison Break!\\" Startling Detective Adventures. November 1935, vol. XV, no. 88. Methvin Online Four months later, about two weeks before they themselves were killed, he and Parker did lie down for a moment on a bed at Henry Methvin's brother's home, just to feel it. The bed had been handcrafted by Henry Methvin's father Ivy, a skilled furniture maker. Guinn p. 320. Near the end of the month Barrow and Jones rebuilt the gang's security by robbing the armory at Plattville, Illinois of more BARs, handguns and ammunition.Guinn p. 235; they robbed this armory on August 20. They had robbed the same armory months earlier, with Buck. Jones was as loyal a subordinate as Clyde and Bonnie could have hoped for, but he did not want to accompany them into death or even any farther into pain and fear. They were aware that Jones wanted to leave them.Jones told Dallas police that on Christmas Day 1932, as they prowled the streets of Temple, Texas looking at parked cars, he told Barrow he wanted to go home. After the murder of Deputy Davis in January the three spent a merry vacation in the hills together, but when Buck and Blanche joined them the group chemistry changed. He kept his plans to leave to himself, and vanished in Ruston as soon as he was well enough to go. Once back in Dallas he made himself scarce: it was apparent to Blanche Barrow that Mrs. Barrow, Mrs. Parker and LC were protecting him there, and according to his confession he had to be kidnapped back into the gang. At Dexfield, Blanche and Buck encouraged him to escape while he was still unknown (Barrow pp. 126-7). Nevertheless, Jones stayed until Barrow and Parker were well enough to take care of themselves without help before leaving. \\"I left Clyde and Bonnie after they was healed up enough to get by without me.... I'd had enough blood and hell.\\" According to Barrow family members, the three made their way back to West Dallas and split up there on September 7.Guinn p. 235. This may have been the story Clyde and Bonnie told. According to W.D. Jones, they were forty miles outside of Clarksdale, Mississippi on the night in early September when he saw a way to escape. They had just stolen a new car and Barrow had given him $2.12 to fill its tank. Jones put in a few gallons, then drove ahead as if to find a secluded place to stop and change cars. But when he was out of Barrow's sight he turned down a country road, turned off the car's headlights, and sped up. After a few miles he left the car and fled for his mother's home in Houston. Arrest and sentence Jones kept a low profile after his return to Houston, picking cotton and digging vegetables on area farms to support himself, but on November 16 he was arrested without incident in Houston by Dallas County deputies Bob Alcorn and Ed Caster, who drove him to the Dallas County jail.Hinton p. 100. An acquaintance in Houston had identified him to police as the mystery Barrow accomplice. It is possible that Barrow coached Jones on what to say if he was ever arrested,Guinn p. 235, citing Marie Barrow Scoma. or that the two of them agreed on a basic theme for Jones's official story: that Clyde, Bonnie and Buck had done all shooting and robbing and that W.D., a minor child, was an unwilling member of the gang, forced to ride with them at gunpoint, unconscious with fear or trauma most of the time, and chained to trees and car bumpers at night. Jones may or may not have had Barrow's blessing to blame every serious transgression on those who had nothing to lose, but on November 18, 1933, he relayed to Dallas police just such a story.If Barrow did give Jones permission to take this tack, it was kind of him, as well as shrewd ‚Äî Jones's statement that Barrow killed Doyle Johnson freed Frank Hardy ‚Äî but it didn't play well socially. Jones was labeled \\"the Barrow stool pigeon\\" in the Dallas press; from jail in 1934 Blanche Barrow wrote scornfully, \\"Guess the poor little innocent thing is free. He should be in his mother's arms with a diaper on.\\" Barrow p. 164. Dallas possession of an important Barrow Gang member was an ace up the sleeve for the politically ambitious Sheriff Schmid, who kept Jones a secret for ten days, perhaps hoping Clyde Barrow would try to storm the jail and break Jones out. Jones for his part insisted that he was grateful to be safely behind bars.\\"Prisoner Says Barrows Killed At Least 6 Men.\\" Associated Press. Unknown newspaper, November 25, 1933. Bonnie and Clyde Joplin Shootout Documents p. 72; Hinton pp. 100-02. On the night of November 22 the sheriff and his deputies Alcorn, Caster and Hinton bungled an ambush of Barrow and Parker in Sowers, Texas, on the outskirts of Dallas.Hinton pp. 100-05, Ramsey pp. 193-95, FBI file 26-4114 Section Sub A p. 54. The Dallas press jeered loudly ‚Äî even the newsboys hawked the story as \\"Sheriff escapes from Clyde Barrow!\\"Phillips p. 348 fn.28, citing Hamilton, Floyd (1938). Public Enemy No. 1, p. 15; \\"Clyde Barrow and Wife, Wounded, Escape Trap and Flee Hail of Bullets.\\" The Dallas Morning News, November 23, 1933. NewsBank, Inc. ‚Äî until Schmid put W.D.

NewsBank, Inc. Jones and the sheriff agreed that he would be tried as an accessory to Clyde Barrow's January 6 murder in Dallas of Deputy Davis, which would protect him against extradition to Arkansas for the June 23 shootout on Highway 71 in which Marshal Humphrey was killed. \\"They tried me for killing a sheriff's man at Dallas,\\" Jones told Playboy in 1968. \\"Clyde done it, but I was glad to take the rap. Arkansas wanted to extradite me, and I sure didn't want to go to no Arkansas prison. I figure now that if Arkansas had got me, one of them skeletons they've dug up there might have been me.\\" Jones was in the Dallas County jail on the morning of May 23, 1934, when Barrow and Parker were ambushed and killed on the Sailes-Gibsland road in north Louisiana. When reporters crowded in to tell him the news, he said, \\"I admit that I am relieved,\\" and shook his head.Milner p. 145. At his trial the following October all state witnesses recommended against the death penalty. Jones was convicted of a crime codified in 1931, \\"murder without malice.\\"Barrow p. 164.

Deacon Jones in 1973 Jones lived the rest of his life in Houston, for many years next door to his mother. He married, but his wife died in the mid-1960s. He became addicted to pain-killing drugs.He was partial to paregoric mixed with Jack Daniel's whiskey. In the last year of his life he spent several months in federal prison for possession of 3,000 barbiturates; his supplier had turned him in.

Bonnie and Clyde's Hideout He was buried on August 22 at Brookside Memorial Park in Houston. Date of birth Marie Barrow, born in 1918, remembered Jones as being the same age as her brother LC, who was born in 1913, and that therefore he was not a minor in 1933. She may have confused Jones's birthday with Ray Hamilton's, May 21, 1913. In 1950 Jones filled out Social Security forms stating that he was born May 12, 1916,Jones's Social Security card application. Bonnie and Clyde's Hideout the same date he gave Dallas police in his November 1933 confession;Jones confession; Beaumont mugshot notation, FBI file 26-4114 Section Sub A p. 55. The notation, written in pen, amends his age to 16 in 1931. in 1968 he told Playboy he was 16 on Christmas Eve 1932 and that Clyde Barrow was seven years older than he. A news article noting an arrest in September 1973 gives his age as 59.\\"Jones sentenced.\\" The Houston Chronicle, September 14, 1973. Transcribed, Ringgold County IA GenWeb Project His death certificate gives his age as 58 and lists his birthday as May 15.Jones's death certificate. Bonnie and Clyde's Hideout Since he filled out his Social Security forms himself, while a relative filled out his death certificate, it would be safe to assume that his birthday is May 12 ‚Äî however, May 15, 1916 is the date on his gravestone..(NOTE added February 2015) ‚Äî According to the 1920 federal census of Van Zandt County, Texas, J.Z.

The institution is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. History Marymount California University was established in 1968 by the RHSM as Marymount Palos Verdes College. It was split from the original Marymount College in Westwood, Los Angeles; this Marymount later merged with St. Joseph's College and then Loyola University to form Loyola Marymount University. At the time, the college was a two-year institution of higher education. In 1975, responsibility for the College was transferred to a lay board of trustees. In 1986, the college changed its name from Marymount Palos Verdes College to Marymount College. In summer 2011, Marymount opened its Waterfront Campus in downtown San Pedro, Los Angeles. In spring 2013, Marymount changed its name from Marymount College to Marymount California University to reflect \\"an ongoing transformation of the 45-year-old institution of higher education to a multi-campus institution offering undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\\" In fall 2013, Marymount opened its Lakeside Campus in the community of Lucerne in rural Lake County, in Northern California. In February 2018, the university appointed trustee Brian Marcotte its new president. It was not immediately clear why the previous president, Lucas Lamadrid, left the position although the local newspaper Daily Breeze reported \\"allegations of inappropriate behavior, exorbitant spending and discriminatory conduct.\\" Campuses The Oceanview Campus encompasses 26-acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island in Rancho Palos Verdes. Residential Community include The Villas located in adjacent San Pedro, a community of fully furnished, two-story townhomes that can accommodate 400 students and staff.

When the institution expanded to the United States, its members founded a series of parochial schools, called the RSHM Network of Schools, with the name \\"Marymount\\". United States New York Of the American colleges founded by RSHM, Marymount College, Tarrytown, was founded first, on December 8, 1907, founded by Johanna Butler. Marymount School, a women's Catholic high school in Manhattan, was founded in 1926. In 1936, an extension of Marymount College, Tarrytown, was formed in Manhattan. It later became the co-educational college now known as Marymount Manhattan College. The original Marymount College, Tarrytown, was consolidated with Fordham University. In fall 2005, Fordham University announced that it would close the college in June 2007. Thus, the last graduating Marymount class was the Class of 2007. In August 2007, Fordham announced, to the disappointment of many alumnae, that it would sell the Marymount campus. The University indicated that the unjustifiable and disproportionate cost of campus maintenance was the reason for closure, and that the University had already expended more on the maintenance and repair of the campus than it was even likely to recoup from its sale. On February 17, 2008, Fordham announced the sale of the campus for $27 million to EF Education, a chain of private language-instruction schools. California In 1923, Marymount School of Los Angeles was founded. An extension site was founded at Palos Verdes, which exists to this day as Marymount California University. Other California schools were established at Santa Barbara, Studio City, Montebello and San Jose. The four year tract of Marymount College of Los Angeles merged with the Jesuit Loyola University in 1973 and currently exists as Loyola Marymount University. Marymount High School in Los Angeles also traces its roots to the Marymount School of Los Angeles Virginia In 1950, Marymount College of Virginia was founded in Arlington. The College became co-educational in 1972 and gained its University status in 1986. It currently exists as Marymount University. Florida In 1962, Marymount College of Boca Raton was founded. By 1971, the college had entered a transitional period; in 1974, Marymount College of Boca Raton became the College of Boca Raton. The college gained university standing under the name Lynn University in 1991. Other Other secondary schools and junior colleges were founded in Ferguson and Florissant, Missouri, and Rolling Meadows, Illinois. Colombia There are three Marymount Schools in Colombia located in the cities of Medellin, Bogota and Barranquilla. Marymount School (Colegio Marymount or Fundaci√≥n Nuevo Marymount) is located in Bogota and is considered amongst the best schools in the city. It is a bilingual and Catholic school that seeks to provide an integral education for women. It has offered the International Baccalaureate since 2007. France Marymount School in Paris, France, is the oldest international school in Paris and is part of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary network of Marymount schools. The history of Marymount Paris can be traced back to 1846 when Father Jean Gailhac founded an order of Sisters in B√©ziers in the south of France. The objective, considered a progressive idea at that time, was the education of young women. Schools eventually opened in Portugal, England, Ireland and the United States. Italy Marymount International School Rome is a private Catholic co-educational school catering to students from Early Childhood (age 3) to Grade 12 located in Rome, Italy. It operates on the American school system but also offers the International Baccalaureate diploma program for its Grade 11 and Grade 12 students, as well as the Italian Esami di Stato (state exams) for the Terza Media (8th grade). It is considered one of the best international schools in Italy.

Other works include the ¬´Di√°logu pol√≠ticu¬ª (Politician Dialogue), the fables ¬´Dido y Eneas¬ª (Dido and Aeneas) and ¬´Hero y Lleandro¬ª (Hero and Leander) and the entremeses ¬´L'ensalmador¬ª (The Healer, ¬´L'alcalde¬ª (The Mayor) and ¬´Los alcaldes¬ª (The Mayors). Life Ant√≥n Gonz√°lez Reguera was born in the first years of the 17th century (in 1605 according to Carlos Gonz√°lez de Posada) in Llorgozana (Carre√±o), in a fidalgo family. He was called Ant√≥n de Marirreguera because of his mother, Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez Reguera. It is supposed that his father was named Pedro √Ålvarez Hevia and that he died early. Being without a father and starting religious studies, he took the family name from his mother, following the tradition (which would explain why in some documents he appears as Antonio √Ålvarez). He studied Latin, Humanities and Theology in the University of Oviedo, he became a priest in 1631 and took charge of some parishes in Carre√±o. In the fidalgo census of this municipality he is called Antonio Gonz√°lez Reguera, priest of Priendes between 1640 and 1644. In 1645 he appears as the priest of Albandi, but with the name of Antonio Gonz√°lez Mo√±iz, taking the second family name from his uncle Xoan Mo√±iz who was the precedent priest in this parish. In Albandi documents he continues to appear as the parish priest until 1661, when he is relieved by his nephew Xuan Rodr√≠guez Reguera. He does not appear in the fidalgo census of 1662, so it is supposed that he died between 1661 and 1662. Works Ant√≥n de Marirreguera had been known as a writer since his days at university and his works became very popular when he was alive. However, most of them are lost today. According to Gonz√°lez Posada, Ant√≥n de Marirreguera himself asked his nephew to burn some of his papers just before his death, because he did not want it to be said that a priest \\"amused himself doing this sort of thing\\". Some titles of his lost works are known, for example ¬´Los impuestos¬ª (The taxes), ¬´Padrenuesu¬ª (Holy Lord), ¬´Razonamientu ente Xuan Mo√±iz y Pero Suare¬ª (Argument between Xuan Mo√±iz and Pero Suare) and ¬´D√©cimes¬ª (D√©cimas). ¬´P√≠ramo y Tisbe¬ª could also be added, but the assignation of the version collected by Xos√© Caveda y Nava is in doubt. The first edition of his works was made by Gonz√°lez Posada, who published the ¬´Pleitu ente Uvi√©u y M√©rida¬ª and the first octave of ¬´Dido y Eneas¬ª in Memorias Hist√≥ricas del Principado de Asturias y Obispado de Oviedo (Historical Memories of the Asturian Principality and the Oviedo Diocese) of 1794. Later, Xos√© Caveda y Nava included these two poems in his Colecci√≥n de poes√≠as en dialecto asturiano (Collection of Poems in Asturian Dialect) in 1839, adding ¬´Hero y Lleandro¬ª, ¬´P√≠ramo y Tisbe¬ª, ¬´Di√°logu pol√≠ticu¬ª and ¬´L'ensalmador¬ª. The most complete edition is Xulio Viejo's 1997 one, titled ¬´F√°bules, Teatru y Romances¬ª (Fables, Theater and Romances). In his introduction, he disputes the assignation to Marirreguera of the fable called \\"P√≠ramo y Tisbe\\", collected by Caveda. Xulio Viejo thinks it is possible that this work had been written by Benito de l'Auxa, although it is known that Marirreguera had written another one with the same title. In May 2000, the Selmana de les Lletres asturianes (Week of Asturian Letters) was dedicated to Ant√≥n de Marirreguera and his work. With this motive, an adaptation of ¬´L'ensalmador¬ª was performed, arranged by Lluis Ant√≥n Gonz√°lez and directed by Xulio Vixil. References * Garc√≠a, Ant√≥n (1994).

A more recent invention is glass-ceramic- to-metal seals. Properties Glass-ceramics are polycrystalline ceramic materials prepared by the controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally silicates. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat- treatment schedule adopted, glass-ceramics can be prepared with tailored thermal expansion characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing to a variety of different metals, ranging from low expansion tungsten (W) or molybdenum (Mo) to high expansion stainless steels and nickel-based superalloys. Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer superior properties over their glass equivalents including more refractory behaviour, in addition to their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as vacuum interrupter envelopes and pyrotechnic actuators, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with glass-to-metal seals is required, including solid oxide fuel cells. Process In the formation of a glass-ceramic-to-metal seal, the parts to be joined are first heated, normally under inert atmosphere, in order to melt the glass and allow it to wet and flow into the metal parts, in much the same way as when preparing a more conventional glass-to-metal seal. The temperature is then normally reduced into a temperature regime where many microscopic nuclei are formed in the glass. The temperature is then raised again into a regime where the major crystalline phases can form and grow to create the polycrystalline ceramic material with thermal expansion characteristics matched to that of the particular metal parts.  Examples  The white opaque \\"glue\\" between the panel and the funnel of a colour TV cathode ray tube is a devitrified solder glass based on the system --. While this is a glass- ceramic-to-glass seal, the basic patent of S.A. Claypoole considers glass- ceramic-to-metal seals as well.

George Donald, another University of Aberdeen student, wrote music for the 1954 Student Show, but did not take part in it.

(He later had to revert in public to his formal first name \\"James\\" in order to join the actors' union Equity, because there was already a Glaswegian comic using the professional name Jimmy Logan.)

Aberdeen University, Special Libraries and Archives MS 3620/1/186/1 But it was after the 1968 student show Running Riot ‚Äì which the four men wrote, composed, produced and directed ‚Äì that the idea of putting on a show of their own at the Edinburgh Festival was first mooted. Jimmy Logan directed \\"Scotland the What?\\" from 1969 until his death in 1993. The trio first appeared under the banner of \\"Scotland the What?\\" at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1969. They became a 'hot ticket' when Neville Garden from the Scottish Daily Express newspaper wrote a favourable review. They described themselves at the outset as \\"three semi-literate Scots taking an irreverent look at their country's institutions,\\" and for the following 26 years (14 years with the same Stage Manager, Peter Garland) the trio proceeded to do just that. Prior to each show, they had a handshaking ritual at the side of the stage which continued until their final performance, which was at His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen on 25 November 1995. The trio were awarded MBEs in 1995, having already received honorary degrees from Aberdeen University in 1994. The trio played to sell-out audiences in their home city of Aberdeen and in locations throughout the world. The sketches and songs which they performed were largely based in the local dialect of the North-east of Scotland known as the Doric. They were often set in a fictional Aberdeenshire village called \\"Auchterturra\\". After the death of Jimmy Logan in 1993, the on stage trio were then directed by Alan Franchi, who had previously directed their shows for Grampian Television. Legacy On 25 April 2007, Aberdeen City Council approved a motion by Councillor Ramsay Milne to award the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen to the trio for \\"their services to the Fine Arts, the Doric language and North East of Scotland culture; promotion of the City and, above all, for makin' a'body laugh.\\" The conferral took place on 20 April 2008 at His Majesty's Theatre. An Early Day Motion tabled at the House of Commons by Malcolm Bruce MP asked that \\"That this House congratulates Scotland the What?, comprising Buff Hardie, Stephen Robertson and George Donald, on receiving the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen and thanks them for 50 years of entertainment and the promotion of Aberdeen, the Doric dialect and the distinctive character of North East country and city folk and, to quote the official citation, above all, for 'makin a'body laugh'.\\" As at 8 May 2008 it had 23 signatures.

Oppenheim was son of a Jewish family of bankers in Frankfurt and studied law in G√∂ttingen, Heidelberg and Berlin. In Berlin he could not reach a postdoctoral lecturer qualification because of his Jewish origin, so he became a private lecturer (Privatdozent) for political science and international law in Heidelberg. But his inclinations to journalism soon won the upper hand, and, his living assured by his family, he gave up teaching. Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie. He was very much taken by the questions surrounding the movements of 1848. His feeble attempts at practical politics nevertheless foundered and left him more and more to make himself known through his pen and his theories. He spoke at the agitated mass meeting at Unter den Zelten where the legislature's petition to the king regarding the wishes of the people was discussed. He became one of the chief editors, with Arnold Ruge and Eduard Meyen, of ‚ÄúDie Reform‚Äù (The Reform) which soon came under the oversight of several democratic groups. Among his other co-workers on this paper were Mikhail Bakunin, Karl Heinzen and Georg Herwegh. Oppenheim sought a seat in the National Assembly. He thought it sufficient to refer to his writings in ‚ÄúDie Reform‚Äù where he developed his premise ‚Äúthat only with freedom did the people become mature enough for freedom,‚Äù but the people of Berlin had no patience with a candidate who campaigned only with his pen. This experience convinced him even more he that he was suited to a writing career, as he did not seem suited to speaking. He went to Baden and, looking for secrets, broke into the private files of the departed archduke. Lorenzo Brentano, the leader of the provisional government, put him in charge of the government newspaper, the ‚ÄúKarlsruher Zeitung‚Äù. When a schism broke out between Brentano's moderates and Gustav Struve's terrorists, Oppenheim worked for the latter, and was dismissed from the newspaper when they failed. He then traveled to Switzerland, France, the Netherlands and England. He returned in 1850 and continued to publish works on democratic ideas. He denounced the democrats for the victories of the Reaction, but thought the latter were ultimately to blame because they turned to raw despotic power rather than continuing with their phony constitutionalism. In 1861 Oppenheim joined the German Progress Party and edited the Yearbook for Politics and Literature which was banned soon afterwards. He also became a member of the Congress of German Economists, as he was known as an excellent economist and supporter of free trade. He also paid attention to social matters. The occurrences of 1866 worked a great transformation in Oppenheim. He greeted the new order with joy while other liberals were more skeptical. Oppenheim joined the National Liberals and supported Bismarck's strategy for national unification. He wrote two flyers for the elections, one of which only saw limited distribution since the leaders saw it as too radical. After 1870, for the first time he directly discussed practical questions, writing on poor laws and economics. He was also critical of ‚Äúfanciful thinkers about the future among the teachers in the universities.‚Äù In 1874, he was elected Member of the Reichstag representing Reu√ü √§. L. and took his seat as an expert on the 1869 changes to commercial regulations. In 1877 he lost his seat to a social democrat. In reaction to Bismarck‚Äôs protectionist policy he split with his party in 1880. Oppenheim‚Äôs philosophical work is concentrated on parliamentarism the idea of common welfare. He coined the phrase ‚Äúlectern socialism‚Äù (German \\"Kathedersozialismus\\"). See also * Right Hegelians Notes  References  *Carl Schurz. New York: The McClure Company, 1907.

Jordan, widow of Lieutenant Jordan; commissioned on 17 December 1943, Lieutenant Commander F. C. Billing in command. Service history After shakedown, Jordan arrived New York in mid-March 1944 for duty as convoy escort. She sailed on 17 April with a convoy bound for Gibraltar, arriving there on 1 May with transports carrying vital cargo for the operations in the Mediterranean area. She returned to New York later that month and made one more European voyage in June before beginning duty as a training ship. During July and August, she engaged in training exercises at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and arrived Port Everglades, Florida, on 17 September to commence experimental exercises in that area. After a yard period at Charleston Navy Yard, Jordan resumed sound experiments out of Port Everglades in early 1945. During May, she was deployed on another cruise to the Mediterranean as convoy escort, returning to New York on 10 June. She engaged in submarine operations out of New London, Connecticut, and training exercises in Cuba, throughout the summer. It was through these experiments that new technological advancements in anti-submarine warfare were adopted, leading to a more powerful navy and a shorter war. While on a training mission on 18 September, Jordan collided with a merchant vessel, SS John Sherman, necessitating immediate repairs. She arrived Charleston on 4 October and remained there until she decommissioned on 19 December 1945. The ship was scrapped in 1947.

Career Werzowa is well known for having composed and produced the Intel \\"Bong,\\" which is allegedly broadcast somewhere in the world once every five minutes. Since its conception in 1994, he has re- arranged it to keep it current, most recently in 2015, when he composed the mashup of the Intel \\"Bong\\" mnemonic and Beethoven's 5th Symphony to create \\"Symphony in Blue\\", the anthem for Intel's Experience Amazing campaign which premiered during Super Bowl 50. Besides audio branding, Werzowa also composes music for feature films. Most recently, he scored the documentary, Author: The JT LeRoy Story, which was written and directed by Jeff Feuerzeig and is the only film on this subject thus far to receive American and European theatrical distribution, it premiered in United States theaters in September 2016. Previously, Werzowa has scored the main themes to Eraser (starring Arnold Schwarzenegger),Taking Lives (starring Angelina Jolie), The Hunted, Yippee and The Devil and Daniel Johnston, which received a Sundance Film Festival award. He also earned a music credit on Steven Spielberg's Minority Report and in 2008 he worked on 8: Person to Person, which was directed by Wim Wenders. Werzowa also composed the Nova theme. In 2014, Music Beyond, the production music library founded by Werzowa in 2005, was acquired by BMG. Werzowa now serves in a consultant capacity at both BMG and Beyond. In 2016, Werzowa launched HealthTunes.org, a free music/sound streaming platform that offers academically and scientifically researched Health Music and evidence-based clinical reference.

The station is operated as part of the statewide Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) television network. History The station signed on the air on January 1, 1968, as WDCO-TV. It was originally broadcast on UHF channel 15. In 1990, the station moved its signal to UHF channel 29 in order to avoid interference with a U.S. Department of Defense early warning ballistic missile detection facility that was located at Robins Air Force Base; it was the only instance prior to 2009 digital transition in which one of GPB's television stations changed the channel frequencies. WMUM-TV was the tenth and last PBS member station established in the state of Georgia, as well as the last television station to be built and signed on by GPB. In the summer of 2006, the station changed its call letters to WMUM-TV, in reference to the Macon-based Mercer University, reflecting the university's involvement in GPB's television and radio operations in the Macon market.RabbitEars TV Query for WMUM Digital television Analog-to-digital conversion WMUM-TV signed on its digital signal on VHF channel 7 in April 2008, which was followed by the discontinuation of regular programs on its analog signal over UHF channel 29.

His many works included treatises on fields ranging from anatomy to music. He created the earliest practical illustrated guide for shell collectors in 1681, for which he is considered a founder of conchology. He also published a study of lacquer that has been of lasting value since his death. Life Flea drawn by Buonanni (1691). Sea shells from Recreatione dell'occhio e della mente French translation of Trattato sopra la vernice Bonanni was born in Rome in 1638, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1654, when he was still 17 years old. After his novitiate, in 1656 he was sent to study at the Society's noted Roman College. There he became a pupil of the German scientist, Athanasius Kircher. While a student there, he undertook the manufacturing of microscopic lenses. He used his lenses to create his own microscope and to develop scientific studies of a number of specimens. He also became a skilled copper plate engraver. From Rome, Bonanni was sent to teach in the Jesuit Colleges of Orvieto and Ancona. Upon Kircher's resignation of the post of Professor of Mathematics at the Roman College, Bonanni was chosen to succeed him. After Kircher's death in 1698, Bonanni was appointed curator of the well-known cabinet of curiosities (collection of antiquities) gathered by Kircher and installed in the Roman College. He published a catalogue of the collection in 1709, titled Mus√¶um Kicherianum. Bonanni followed Aristotle in believing in theories of spontaneous generation. In critiquing the experimental work of Francesco Redi, Bonanni defended the Aristotelian view. Though he raised important questions‚Äîsuch as whether viewers through a microscope tended to see what they expected, rather than what was there‚Äîlater writers tended to discount Bonanni as support for Aristotelianism waned. Nonetheless, in early writing about the nature and origins of fossils, Bonanni admitted doubts about whether theories of transport could account for the numbers and distribution of fossils. He later speculated that fossils could be divided into two groups‚Äîthe remains of organisms, and the \\"products of natural powers.\\" Such interpretations were consistent with the new and challenging idea that the earth must have undergone \\"extraordinary alterations\\" to explain the diversity of types and locations of fossils.  Conchology  Bonanni created the earliest practical illustrated guide for shell collectors, Recreatione dell'occhio e della mente (1681). The two-volume guide was the first treatise devoted entirely to molluscs and included numerous engravings. Bonanni's work is significant for his careful attempts to precisely describe shell morphology. Unfortunately, due to the printing and engraving process, the spirals shown on the shells were reversed from dextral to sinistral, a mirror image problem that later books avoided. Zoological taxonomies of the time were based on visual characteristics, and Bonanni paid special attention to both form and color, and showed details (sometimes fanciful) of the creatures inside the shells. Although his work predated the adoption of Linnaeus' system of binomial nomenclature (genus + species), Bonanni laid the foundation for the new discipline of conchology. Several later Linnaean names were based on Bonanni's work, including the name of the class Bivalvia, which he introduced.  Lacquer  Among other topics, Bonanni wrote of the ingredients craftsmen in China used to make the lacquer they used on porcelain, a popular import item for Europe at the time. Like other researchers of the day, he went on to experiment with various recipes to recreate the lacquer used on porcelain and furniture. In 1720, Bonanni published his studies in Trattato sopra la vernice detta communemente cinese (1720), or Treatise on the Varnish commonly called Chinese. This work was republished repeatedly over the next century in several languages, and was re-issued in 1994 in its original Italian version. Scientific work Bonanni made excellent observations, which are embodied in several works: * Ricreatione dell' occhio e della mente. Bonanni was a shell collector and was the author of the first book devoted solely to seashells, published in Rome in 1681. Several later Linnaean names were based on his illustrations. * Observationes circa Viventia, quae in Rebus non Viventibus Using a three lens microscope, in this work published in 1691 Bonanni tried to show that spontaneous generation was possible in animals \\"without blood and a heart\\", in contradiction of Francesco Redi‚Äôs experimental work. The compilation of knowledge and quality of the illustrations made this an important work. * Numismata Pontificum Romanorum A two-volume study started in 1696 and completed in 1702 of the coins issued by the papacy over the centuries. * Mus√¶um Kircherianum, sive Musaeum a P.

He currently works as the Head Coach at Israeli club Maccabi Netanya. Playing career Club Atteveld played for Haarlem before moving to England to join Everton. He made his debut for Everton on 2 December 1989 against Coventry City, in a 2‚Äì0 home win. During his career at Everton, he made 41 league appearances from the outset and a further 10 as a substitute, scoring only one goal. Atteveld is one of seven Dutchmen to have played for Everton, the others being Andy van der Meyde, Sander Westerveld, Johnny Heitinga, Royston Drenthe, Davy Klaassen and Maarten Stekelenburg. Atteveld was one of the first foreigners to get a regular first-team place in the Everton squad although he struggled to make a name of himself in the English game. Atteveld is remembered by Evertonians for stripping during an end of season lap of honour and throwing his kit into the crowd. He joined West Ham United on loan, and became the first Dutch player in the club's history when he made played his only league game for the club on 22 February 1992, a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday. He made two FA Cup appearances for the club, for the Fifth Round games against Sunderland on 15 February and 26 February.

He qualified for the play-offs for European football, only to miss out going into Europe by 2 draws in the encounter with FC Utrecht. However, due to struggles within the board after the placement of a new technical director, he was sacked on 7 October 2008. On 17 April 2009, he replaced Andr√© Wetzel as the new ADO Den Haag manager/technical director. Atteveld managed to keep ADO Den Haag in the Dutch Premier league with scoring 12 goals in the last 4 games of that season. The following season, Atteveld now replaced Wetzel as Technical Director to finish the season. In that summer Atteveld refused to continue in his present role and therefore left the club on mutual terms in the summer of 2010. In February 2011 he moved abroad to coach Cypriot outfit AEL Limassol on an interim basis Trainer Atteveld tekent contract bij AEL Limassol - Voetbal International . AEL Limassol reached the play-offs under Atteveld. He mainly played with youngsters due to non salary payment of 1st team regulars. This working with the AEL youngsters resulted in Atteveld taking the Academy Director role the following seasons to come. As an Academy Director Atteveld introduced a successful playing style all throughout the club. 300% increase in National Team players was the result of this approach. Up until today, his philosophy and structure are still used within the club. Atteveld later went on to supervise as Senior Academy consultant at FC Banants Yerevan in Armenia before moving to Kazakhstan in 2013. In Kazakhstan Atteveld was Academy Director for the U14 until U19 teams. During this time the Kazakh outfit, FC Kairat Almaty, broke all records regarding championships. Many players of the academy broke into the National Team of Kazakhstan. In 2013-2014 season, 3 teams of the Academy became champions of Kazakhstan. In 2014-2015 4 teams took the championship, only to be improved by 5 championship winning teams in 2015-2016. A record set for Kazakhstan by any club, and up until today FC Kairat Almaty still holds this record. At the beginning of the season 2016-2017 Atteveld was offered the role of Head Coach of FC Kairat Almaty B team, operating in Div. 2. 'Voetbal in Kazachstan zit in de lift' - NOS Atteveld kindly declined for this position and went on to introduce his own Academy, the Dutch Total Football Academy in Almaty. A call from Maccabi Tel Aviv FC in Israel to strengthen their setup ended this private academy adventure early on. In Israel, at the biggest club of Israel - Maccabi Tel Aviv FC, Atteveld arrived in Sept. 2016 to take charge of the football development of the older Academy coaches & players for the U16, U17 and U19 teams. As a Performance Director, Atteveld introduced, among other things, the concept of Elite training for contract players within the academy while setting out an individual program for every player. Atteveld was tasked with leading a team in Div. 2 with prospects loaned from Maccabi Tel Aviv FC . The club, named Beitar Tel Aviv Bat Yam is operating in the 2nd division and presently the youngest team in this league (average age 20yrs). Now in 7th position, before the coronavirus brought a stop to the league. Teams within the positions 1-8 will qualify for the promotion play-offs at the end of the season. With 2 games to go before the regular season will end, Atteveld and Beitar Tel Aviv Bat Yam are in a perfect position to reach the promotion play- offs. During the winter break some players did moved to the IPL, with more on the cards for the next season.

Such an operation is then known as the Poisson bracket of the Poisson ring. Many important operations and results of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics may be formulated in terms of the Poisson bracket and, hence, apply to Poisson algebras as well. This observation is important in studying the classical limit of quantum mechanics‚Äîthe non-commutative algebra of operators on a Hilbert space has the Poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold as a singular limit, and properties of the non-commutative algebra pass over to corresponding properties of the Poisson algebra. Definition The Poisson bracket must satisfy the identities * [f,g] = -[g,f] (skew symmetry) * [f + g, h] = [f,h] + [g,h] (distributivity) * [fg,h] = f[g,h] + [f,h]g (derivation) * [f,[g,h + [g,[h,f + [h,[f,g = 0 (Jacobi identity) for all f,g,h in the ring. A Poisson algebra is a Poisson ring that is also an algebra over a field. In this case, add the extra requirement :[sf,g] = s[f,g] for all scalars s. For each g in a Poisson ring A, the operation ad_g defined as ad_g(f) = [f,g] is a derivation. If the set \\\\\\\\{ ad_g  g \\\\in A \\\\\\\\} generates the set of derivations of A, then A is said to be non-degenerate. If a non-degenerate Poisson ring is isomorphic as a commutative ring to the algebra of smooth functions on a manifold M, then M must be a symplectic manifold and [\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot] is the Poisson bracket defined by the symplectic form.

He is also A&R; for the record label Nesola, a joint venture with, among others, his wife Joy Denalane. Biography Origins Max Herre grew up in Stuttgart. After hearing the 90s German hip-hop group Advanced Chemistry Herre decided to create hip-hop himself in German. He started his first band, Seedless Jam, when he was 15, and his first hip-hop project, Agit Jazz, four years later with music producer Philippe A. Kayser (Don Philippe). In order to perform their music live, they formed the band Maximilian und sein Freundeskreis in 1993 with another producer, DJ Friction (Martin Welzer). In the same year, Herre also founded the hip-hop group Kolchose with other Stuttgart artists. Freundeskreis Herre, Philippe, and Welzer signed with the label Four Music (founded by German rap pioneers Die Fantastischen Vier) in 1997, and soon after made a musical and commercial breakthrough with the single A-N-N-A. The song has sold more than 250,000 copies. Freundeskreis's debut album, Die Quadratur des Kreises, has sold more than 170,000 copies. In 1999, their second album, Esperanto sold more than 300,000 copies. Their live double-album, En Directo der FK Allstars, was recorded in the same year. Although Freundeskreis seemed to have performed its last concerts in 2000, the band re-appeared in 2007 at different festivals, including the festival MTV Hip-Hop Open in Stuttgart, where they celebrated the 10th anniversary of the band's founding. FK- Allstars Max Herre also founded the FK-Allstars, a collaboration of 15 musical artists, including Gentleman, Afrob, S√©kou, Joy Denalane and Brooke Russell. In 2000 they performed at some of central Europe's biggest music festivals, i.e. Rock im Park, Rock am Ring and Splash. Herre left the group after the tour. Music producer Herre retreated from public life after the birth of his first son in 2001, and concentrated on producing Mami, the debut album of his wife, Joy Denalane. Mami reached the Top-10 in Germany, and received three nominations for the German music award, the Echo. In August 2006 the second album of Joy Denalane's produced by Herre--Born and Raised-- was released on the label Four Music. Solo career In September 2004, Herre released his debut eponymous solo album, Max Herre, a collection of songs in a variety of genres in addition to hip hop, including soul, reggae, and rock. The album was a commercial success. In April 2006 Herre, Joy Denalane, G√∂tz Gottschalk and Sophie Raml formed a new record label they named Nesola. Ein Geschenkter Tag--Herre's second solo album--appeared in 2009. In 2012, Herre's third albumHallo Welt! was published. In 2013, Herre became the third German hip-hop artist to be included in the German version of the MTV- Unplugged album series, titling his MTV Unplugged Kahedi Radio Show. For the album he won the 2014 Echo Award for hip-hop performer of the year. The album reached gold two weeks after being released and soon after platinum. In November 2019, after a six year break, his fifth solo album Athen was released. Personal life He is married to singer Joy Denalane, with whom he has two sons. Herre and Denalane separated in October 2007. In March 2011, they showed up at different events together and have stated that they are back together again.

Career He was originally drafted by the Montreal Expos in . He missed the Cardinals playoff run after tearing a ligament in his right elbow, and required reconstructive surgery. In , he signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and was placed on the Durham Bulls minor league roster, but did not play a game that season while recovering from Tommy John surgery. On December 22, 2006, he re-signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, where he became their closer. Reyes finished the year with 26 saves in 30 chances. Notably, his only blown saves came against the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Boston Red Sox. On April 10, 2008, Reyes got into a fight at a bar in South Tampa and was tasered twice by a police officer. This had little effect on his ability to throw, as the very next night he got the win for the Rays against the Orioles. Reyes was designated for assignment on August 9, 2008, and became a free agent on August 18 after refusing an assignment to the minors. He signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets two days later, and was called up to the team when rosters expanded in September. He was released on September 18, 2008, without making any appearances.

Its population is approximately . The Khodoriv Train Station. The city was first mentioned in 1394. In many historic documents it is referred to as Khodoriv-stav. In many documents it is named Khodoriv-stav. It is connected with a male name Fedir and the situation of the town above a big lake. In the 15th century, Khodoriv was granted city status and a coat of arms. Khodoriv was one of the major industrial hubs in Zhydachiv Raion and Lviv Oblast, with more than 10 manufacturing and other plants including the Sugar Plant and the Plant of Manufacturing Polygraph Machines. Within the city, there are three secondary education schools and two colleges. The city also has some monuments of architecture, including the St. Michael's Church. In addition, new church will rise in early 2000s, designed by Oleksandr Matviiv. Khodoriv has always been a big railroad hub in the region. The Jewish population of Khodoriv amounted to around 2500 at the beginning of the German occupation of the town in July 1941. Immediately, the Germans and their Ukrainian collaborators robbed and abused Jews and burned down the Great Synagogue. In June 1942, the first Aktion rounded up about 1000 to 1500 Jews. Those who were sick and weak were shot in Khodoriv, others were sent to Belzec where they were immediately murdered. A similar Aktion took place in October, with 350 Jews deported to Belzec to be murdered. After that about 800 Jews were left in the town. In February 1943, the Ukrainian police murdered the rest near the local sugar plant. Only 15 or so of the town's Jews survived, mostly hidden with friends and acquaintances. Ten had been hidden by Henryk Piczek in his cellar for 22 months. The historic wooden synagogue of Chodorow, built in 1652 and featuring a beautifully painted interior, was burned but a model of the ceiling has been reconstructed at the Museum of the Jewish People (Beth Hatefutsoth) in Tel Aviv, Israel.

In particular, it may be translated as \\"(religious) order\\" or \\"spiritual genealogy\\" where one Sufi Master transfers his khilfat to his spiritual descendant. In Urdu, Silsila means saga.  Historical importance  Every tariqa has a silsila. Silsilas originated with the initiation of Sufi orders which dates back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Most silsilas trace their lineage back to his cousin and son-in-law Ali bin Abi Talib such as the Qadiriyyah, the Chishtiyya, the Noorbakhshia and the Suhrawardiyyah orders. However, other silsilas owe their ancestry to other caliphs such as the Naqshbandiyyah order of South Asia is through the Caliph Abu Bakr. Centuries ago, Arabia did not have schools for formal education. Students went to masters who taught them. Upon completion of their study, they received ijazah (permission) which acted as the certification of their education. A graduate then acted as a master having his own students or disciples. This chain of masters was known as Silsila or lineage. Somewhat analogous to the modern situation where degrees are only accepted from recognized universities, the certification of a master having a verifiable chain of masters was the only criteria which accorded legitimacy: \\"Theoretically one can only receive instruction in these practices (talq√Æn) from an authorised teacher of the tariqa, and only after pledging a vow of obedience (bay'ah) to this shaikh. The shaikh gives his disciples permission (ij√¢za) to practice the tariqa: he may also authorise one or more of them to teach it to others, i.e. appoint them as his khal√Æfa. In this way a hierarchically ordered network of teachers may emerge. Each shaikh can show a chain of authorities for the tarekat he teaches, his silsila or spiritual genealogy. Usually the silsila reaches back from one's own teacher up to the Prophet, with whom all tarekats claim to have originated although there have been modifications along the way. A Sufi's silsila is his badge of identity and source of legitimation; it provides him with a list of illustrious predecessors and shows how he is related to other Sufis.\\" Silsila can be of a partial knowledge or a book as well. All Hafiz (memorizers of Quran), Muhaddiths (narrators of Hadiths), Qaries (reciters of Quran with correct accent and pronunciation) are given a chain of credible narrators linking to the Islamic prophet Mohammad. Chain of authority For Muslims, the Chain of Authenticity is an important way to ascertain the validity of a saying of Mohammad (also known as a Hadith). The Chain of Authenticity relates the chain of people who have heard and repeated the saying of Mohammad through the generations, until that particular Hadith was written down (Ali bin Abi Talib said that 'Aisha said that the Prophet Mohammad said‚Ä¶). A similar idea appears in Sufism in regards to the lineage and teachings of Sufi masters and students. This string of master to student is called a silsila, literally meaning ‚Äúchain‚Äù. The focus of the silsila like the Chain of Authenticity is to trace the lineage of a Sufi order to Mohammad through his Companions: Ali bin Abi Talib (the primary link between Sufi orders and Mohammad), Abu Bakr, and Umar (three of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs). When a Sufi order can be traced back to Mohammad through one of the three aforementioned Companions the lineage is called the Silsilat al-Dhahab (dhahab meaning gold) or the ‚ÄúChain of Gold‚Äù (Golden Chain). In early Islamic history, gold was an extremely desired prize and was used for currency, to show wealth and power, and for scientific purposes including medicine. Thus, gold was the most desired commodity in the material world, just as the Golden Chain is the most desired commodity of Sufi orders. When Sufism began in the second century of Islam, according to some experts, it was an individual choice; many Sufis aimed to be more like Muhammad by becoming ascetic and focusing their lives fully on God; more so than the Five Daily Prayers and usual prescripted religious practices. This often included removing oneself from society and other people in general. As Sufism became a greater movement in Islam, individual Sufis began to group together. These groups (also known as orders) were based on a common master. This common master then began spiritual lineage, which is a connection between a Sufi order in which there is a common spiritual heritage based on the master‚Äôs teachings (i.e., ‚Äòpath‚Äô or ‚Äòmethod‚Äô) called tariq or tariqah. As the number of Sufi orders grew, there arose a need for legitimacy of the orders to establish each order was following the teachings of Mohammad directly; thus the idea of the Silsilat al-Dhahab. If a Sufi order is able to trace its student to master lineage back to one of the three major caliphs (and in particular Ali bin Abi Talib) who provide a straight link to Mohammad (because of their Companion status with him) then the order is considered righteous and directly following the teachings of Mohammad. In possessing the Golden Chain, a Sufi order is able to establish their order prominently in the mystical world.  Shia term  Shias use it idiomatically to mean a lineage of authentic Masters. China Among Chinese Muslims, the concept of silsilah has developed into that of a menhuan (Èó®ÂÆ¶): a Chinese-style Sufi order whose leaders trace a lineage chain going back to the order's founder in China (e.g., Ma Laichi or Ma Mingxin), and beyond, toward his teachers in Arabia. Indonesia The term is used as the title of royal family trees and family records of the rulers in the palaces of Java.

Arkansas Scenic Byway 7 is located on the eastern shore of the lake, and provides views of the lake, and also places to stay. DeGray Lake Resort State Park was opened in 1974 to encourage tourism and recreation on DeGray Lake. History Prehistory The documented history of the DeGray area dates back to AD 700 when the area was inhabited by the Caddo Indians. Caddo is believed to be a shortened version of the Indian word ‚Äúkadohadacho,‚Äù which was used to identify the large family of tribes living in southwest Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and northeast Texas. Historians believe there were at least 12 tribes in this confederation that usually settled along streambanks. Hernando de Soto then came and explored this area in 1541, after discovering hot springs. The Caddo Indians' way of life was changed forever when coming in contact with the Spanish explorers; the Indians were introduced to the horse. The Caddo excelled in pottery making and many fine examples of their work are in private collections in the area. The Caddo had formal religious, social, and economic beliefs and believed in an afterlife. Each subtribes had its own chief and village consisting of straw lodges. Their society valued honesty, hospitality, and neighborliness. The Caddo were farmers growing corn, squash, pumpkins and beans and they supplemented their diet by gathering food in the woods (berries, nuts, etc.,) and by hunting and fishing.U.S.ArmyCorpsofEngineersMasterPlan2020 The University of Arkansas has made a survey of known archaeological sites within the reservoir area. Fourteen sites were discovered and investigated. An extensive dig was made at the Powell site, a Temple Mound in Clark County. Many artifacts and significant archaeological data were located. In the 18th century French fur trappers brought trade to the area with their extensive trapping methods. DeGray Lake was in fact named after a French fur trader, DeGraff, who settled this region. Several artifacts have been found near the dam site, and many have been brought to a local university, Henderson State University. Dam construction DeGray Power Plant DeGray lake and dam were authorized by Congress in the River and Harbor Act of 1950. Congress passed the Water Supply Act of 1958, which provided for the inclusion of municipal and industrial water supply as one of the project purposes. Construction on the dam began in 1962 and was completed in 1972 at a cost of $63,800,000. A 40 MW hydraulic turbine and a 28 MW turbine generate electricity for the Southwestern Power Administration of Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma. DeGray dam impounds the waters of the Caddo River to form a flood control lake that covers , and a shoreline of . Many of the long-time residents recall families in the area who were \\"bought out\\" in order to fill area behind the dam. Residents were offered money for their property, so that the lake could be built. The eventual damming of the Caddo River forced many people to move elsewhere in the area. Brick and concrete structures from former homesteads still stand on the bottom of the lake, whereas the remains of others can be found in selected areas near the shoreline. Although recreation plays a major role in every day activity, hydropower makes this lake one of the most efficient and energy producing projects in the South. DeGray Lake holds the distinction as the first ‚Äúpump back capable‚Äù impoundment in the history of the Corps of Engineers. A re- regulation dam forms a 400-acre impoundment directly below the main lake that serves as a storage basin for pump back capable features. During designated times, i.e. drought, the 28,000 KW generator can be reversed pulling water out of the Lower Lake into the main lake to be utilized again for hydropower generation. The 400-acre Lower Lake also serves as an ideal waterfowl refuge. Flora and Fauna Fauna DeGray Lake supports a variety of game and non-game wildlife. Squirrels and rabbits predominate as upland game. Deer, beaver, turkey, raccoon, armadillo, quail, and doves are found in moderate numbers. Very few waterfowl nest along the Caddo River, but the lake will provide a resting stop for migratory birds. A variety of songbirds with other birds, such as hawks, owl, herons, and vultures, are either permanent residents or migrate through the DeGray area. Bald eagles have been sighted on the lake during the winter months. The lake has inundated habitats that once supported deer, squirrel, beaver, and wild turkey. Management of peripheral lands have determined whether these remaining habitats are destroyed either through structural or human invasion. The hardwood forest is unique to the area, and this habitat will be preserved. Cleared lands will be maintained as existing habitat for deer, quail, dove, and rabbits. Large tracts of land, not suited for recreational development, will be set aside to preserve wildlife habitats, both for hunting purposes and the encouragement of non-game species. DeGray Lake, with 13,420 surfaces acres at full power pool has the potential for providing a substantial annual sport fishery. In addition to natural fisheries recruitment from original Caddo River populations, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission initiated a supplemental fish stocking program in 1969. Black bass, catfish, Red-ear, bluegill, crappie, and white bass were stocked followed by stockings of shad for forage supplement. To provide sport fishing variety and to supplement the predator population, exotic species (walleye, northern pike and muskellunge) were also stocked. Fish populations in DeGray Lake are still in the growth period and have not yet reached full potential. However, good bass, bream, and crappie fishing has been realized. Some catches of northern pike have been reported but the fate of the walleye and muskellunge stockings is unknown. Because of their similarity, some of the northern pike reported caught may have actually been muskellunge. Sampling efforts have not indicated that any of the exotic species are reproducing in the lake. Maintenance of the remaining downstream warm-water ecosystem is possible as a result of the multilevel intake structure in the dam. This structure can selectively withdraw water from a vertical range of nearly 60 feet, thereby allowing withdrawals to occur from strata of desired temperature. The 90-acre reregulating pool below most hydroelectric systems. As a result, smallmouth and rock bass, warmouth, red-ear, sunfish, and channel catfish are caught on the lower Caddo River. U.S.ArmyCorpsofEngineersMasterPlan2020 Recreation Opportunities Recreation DeGray lake boasts an impressive selection of recreation opportunities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers owns and operates nine campgrounds, two playgrounds, five swim areas, several miles of biking trails, five miles of hiking trails, as well as eleven boat ramps. Island camping at DeGray is prohibited but is allowed at Lake Ouchita. DeGray Lake offers a variety of day use facilities and locations throughout the project. Pavilions are located at Hwy 7, Lower Lake, Caddo Drive, and Arlie Moore. Each pavilion is unique and has beautiful views of the lake. The pavilions are a great place to have reunions, birthday parties, or any kind of special event. Nestled in a woodland canopy, these areas offer a quiet place to relax and enjoy Mother Nature. USACE also offers a conference hall for rent which is available to rent on a daily basis. DeGray State Park also shares shoreline on the USACE operated lake. The state park offers many recreational opportunities as well. It offers interpretive tours at sunset, guided hikes, and many more interpretive activities. Hunting DeGray Lake WMA boasts some of the best hunting on public land in SW Arkansas. Due to DeGray's diverse fauna population it offers a fun experience for hunters of all levels. All applicable hunting laws are in effect while hunting on DeGray. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission issues licenses and tags for applicable game. Some game DeGray offers to hunt include quail, duck, geese, rabbit, squirrel, bear, turkey, and deer being the most popular. The USACE rangers offer several hunting events during the year for various type of game. Corps of Engineers have Youth Permit Hunt Applications or Mobility-Impaired Waterfowl Hunt Permit Applications at their project office. Hunting is prohibited in all recreation areas and only allowed in designated areas of the WMA. Fishing DeGray Lake is nationally known for its clean, clear water and pristine shoreline. It is also known for its trophy winning hybrid stripers, crappie, largemouth bass, and catfish.Each year, thousands of people come to fish the waters of DeGray Lake. The Caddo River feeds the lake, making it a great habit for fish. The introduction of the crappie season can be heard as the sound of boats flocking to the lake come from near and far. With numerous coves and fishing shelters along the bottom of the lake, catching fish usually isn‚Äôt too difficult a task. Each year, the lake hosts hundreds of fishing tournaments ‚Äìlocal and national. Also Park Rangers and staff have fishing derbies for local children‚Äôs groups and physically challenged children and adults. Fishing guide services and bait shops are also located near the lake as well are two marinas located at DeGray State Park and Iron Mountain. In 2007, AGFC and USACE introduced the Pakistani fly to control hydrilla in DeGray Lake. The \\"Pak\\" fly larvae were supposed to eat the tops off hydrilla plants down to a depth where it would decrease total plant coverage. The architects of this scheme did not foresee several years of drought, which combined with the Pak fly, wiped out DeGray's hydrilla. Largemouth bass recruitment suffered as a result. In an attempt to rejuvenate the lake, AGFC partnered in 2019 with the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff Aquaculture and Fisheries to restore the native vegetation. Local Impact Economic Impact DeGray Lake's impact is important for the local economy of SW Arkansas. Including all entities on DeGray Lake; USACE, DeGray State Park, Iron Mountain Marina, and other private leases DeGray Lake generated as of fiscal year 2016 $23,502,958 in visitor spending within 30 miles of Corps property, $13,089,995 in sales within 30 miles of corps property, and 220 jobs. The money spent by visitors to Corps lakes on trip expenses adds to the local and national economy by supporting jobs and generating income. Visitor spending represents a sizable component of the economy in many communities around DeGray. Public's Impact The benefits offered from DeGray Lake are more than just economic. By providing the public opportunities for active recreation, DeGray lake helps combat one of the most significant of the nation's heathl problems: lack of physical activity. Recreational programs and activites at DeGray also help strengthen family ties and frienships, provide opportunities for children to develop personal skills, giving the public the knowledge to become stewards for nature, and increase water safety. Recreation experiences increase motivation to learn more about the environment; understand and awareness of environmental issues; and sensitivity to the environment.

In his early years he was sometimes credited under other names, including Blind Snooks Eaglin, \\"Lil\\" Snook, Ford Eaglin, Blind Guitar Ferd. His vocal style was reminiscent of that of Ray Charles; in the 1950s, when he was in his late teens, he sometimes billed himself as \\"Little Ray Charles\\". He played a wide range of styles of music within the same concert, album, or even song: blues, rock and roll, jazz, country, and Latin. In his early years, he also played acoustic blues. His ability to play a wide range of songs and make them his own earned him the nickname \\"The Human Jukebox.\\" Eaglin claimed in interviews that his musical repertoire included some 2,500 songs. At live shows, he usually did not prepare set lists and was unpredictable, even to his bandmates. He played songs that came to him on stage, and he also took requests from the audience. Career Childhood Eaglin lost his sight not long after his first birthday, having been stricken with glaucoma, and spent several years in the hospital with other ailments. Around the age of five he received a guitar from his father and taught himself to play by listening to and playing along with the radio. A mischievous youngster, he was given the nickname \\"Snooks\\" after a radio character named Baby Snooks. Early years In 1947, at the age of 11, Eaglin entered a talent contest organized by the radio station WNOE and won it with his performance of \\"Twelfth Street Rag.\\"\\"Snooks Eaglin Interview\\". Blues & Soul Records Magazine, no. 8, March 31, 1996. Three years later, he dropped out of a school for the blind to become a professional musician. In 1952, he joined the Flamingoes, a local seven-piece band started by Allen Toussaint. The Flamingoes did not have a bass player, and according to Eaglin, he played both the guitar and the bass parts simultaneously on his guitar. He stayed with the Flamingoes for several years, until the group disbanded in the mid-1950s. As a solo artist, his recording and touring were inconsistent, and for a man with a career of about 50 years, his discography is rather slim. His first recording was in 1953, playing guitar at a recording session for James \\"Sugar Boy\\" Crawford. The first recordings under his own name were made by Harry Oster, a folklorist from Louisiana State University, who found Eaglin playing in the streets of New Orleans and recorded him in seven sessions between 1958 and 1960. For these recordings, Eaglin played in a folk blues style, accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar, without a band. These recordings were later released by several labels, including Folkways, Folk-Lyric, and Prestige/Bluesville.\\"Snooks Eaglin Story & Discography\\". Blues & Soul Records Magazine, no. 6, September 20, 1995. 1960s and 1970s From 1960 to 1963, Eaglin recorded for Imperial. He played electric guitar in sessions for Imperial, with backup from a band including James Booker on piano and Smokey Johnson on drums. He recorded 26 tracks for Imperial (available on The Complete Imperial Recordings), many of which were songs written by Dave Bartholomew. Unlike the Harry Oster recordings, these works on Imperial are New Orleans R&B; in the style for which he is widely known today. After Imperial, in 1964, he recorded alone at his home with a guitar for the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation; these recordings were released on the album I Blueskvarter 1964: Vol. 3. For the remainder of the 1960s, he apparently made no recordings. His next recorded work was for the Swedish label Sonet in 1971. Another album, Down Yonder, with Ellis Marsalis on piano, was released in 1978.

He was born in New York City and started taking photos underwater at the young age of 12. He started with a Brownie Hawkeye in a rubber anesthesiologist's bag to keep the water out of the camera. He lived with his family in New York City and spent summers in Elberon New Jersey exploring the Atlantic .Nash, Margo. \\"PHOTOGRAPHY; Beneath The Sea, With Fins And Lens\\", The New York Times, June 11, 2000. Accessed September 17, 2013. He later worked as a diver and photographer for the Sandy Hook Marine Laboratories in New Jersey and spent much of his youth in the Caribbean as a teenage dive instructor in the Bahamas where he found his motivation to capture the beauty of the sea and everything in it. His wife is the photographer, Jennifer Hayes. Photography Doubilet's passion for underwater photography is inspired by environmentalism: \\"The desire to make an image that makes people think about, fall in love with, and protect the sea.\\" His goal as a photographer is to \\"redefine photographic boundaries\\" every time he enters the water. \\"We always try to add one more step, one more piece of vision, one more piece of technology. Where technology meets dreams, you make photographs,\\" he explained during a 2011 interview. \\"How can I illustrate this? How can I make this picture something more than what we see, something more exciting and put it on the page that incorporates the poetry, and the environment, and the atmosphere of a place that you're shooting? I think that that's the biggest challenge.\\" In order to capture underwater wildlife, he takes several cameras, lenses and underwater strobes (flash systems) on each of his trips, primarily Nikon digital SLRs with ultra wide angle and Micro (macro) lenses, Sea & Sea strobes and SeaCam housings. Doubilet was one of the pioneers of underwater photography in respect to the split field image technique also called over/under images that include elements both above and below water in a single image, with both rendered in focus. This calls for an ultra wide angle lens used at a small aperture in a housing with a dome (not flat) port. Doubilet graduated from Boston University College of Communication in 1970. He is a member of the Royal Photographic Society. He has shot nearly 70 stories for National Geographic since his first assignment in 1971 about garden eels in the Red Sea. (Some of the articles were written and illustrated jointly with wife and photographic partner Jennifer Hayes, an aquatic biologist and photojournalist specializing in natural history and marine environments). He has authored 12 books to date, including David Doubilet: Water Light Time (Phaidon Press, 2016) which includes images made over the past 25 years. Doubilet's most recently published major assignment - completed with Jennifer Hayes - was a photo shoot in Cuban waters, which was published as Changing Cuba: The Caribbean's Crown Jewels, in the November 2016 issue of the magazine. The locations of other significant assignments over the past few years include the Great Barrier Reef, the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. David Doubilet and Jennifer Hayes live in the small town of Clayton, New York in the Thousand Islands area of the St. Lawrence River, where they co-own a studio and stock photography company, Undersea Images Inc. that was formed in 1999. Doubilet owns a second home in the small coastal town of Dekolder, South Africa. Working as a team they co-produce illustrated articles for National Geographic and others in addition to marketing stock photos and doing speaking engagements. Doubilet is a founding Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers. He has received many awards for his works, such as The Explorers Club's Lowell Thomas Awards and the Lennart Nilsson Award for scientific photography (2001) and others from the BBC, POY, and the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award. in 1999, Doubilet has photographed Coldplay's Blue Room EP artwork.

He is considered the greatest fielder of all time. He played for the South African cricket team between 1992 and 2003. Rhodes was born in Pietermaritzburg, Natal Province, South Africa. Whilst being noted for his quick running as a right- handed batsman, he was especially noted for his defensive fielding, particularly catching, ground fielding, and throwing from his most common position of backward point. A report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showed that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the ninth-highest number of run outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the third-highest success rate. He is regarded as one of the greatest fielders of all time and was the first South African cricketer to take 100 ODI catches. During his career he also played club cricket for the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg and first-class cricket for Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, KwaZulu-Natal, Natal and the Dolphins. Rhodes retired from Test cricket in 2000, and from one day cricket in 2003 after an injury during the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Rhodes also represented South Africa at hockey, and was chosen as part of the 1992 Olympic Games squad to go to Barcelona; however, the squad did not qualify to go to the tournament. He was also called up for trials to play in the 1996 Olympics but was ruled out by a hamstring injury.  Career highlights   Test career  Rhodes made his Test d√©but against India in the first Test of the \\"Friendship Tour\\" at his home ground in Kingsmead, Durban on 13 November 1992, scoring 41 in the first innings and 26 not out in the second. Rhodes scored his first Test century during the first Test of a three match series against Sri Lanka at Moratuwa during the 1993‚Äì1994 season. Batting on the last day, Rhodes scored 101 not out and along with Clive Eksteen salvaged a draw. South Africa went on to win the series 1‚Äì0 by winning the second match and drawing the third. Rhodes announced his retirement from Test match cricket in 2001 in order to allow him to continue playing until the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa. His last Test match was on 6 August 2000 at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo against Sri Lanka. Rhodes made scores of 21 and 54 in the two innings. Sri Lanka went on to win the match by six wickets. He was also well known for hitting reverse sweep and has also hit the first reverse sweep shot which had gone for a six.  ODI career  Rhodes made his One Day International d√©but against Australia in South Africa's opening match of the 1992 Cricket World Cup at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 26 February 1992. Australia batted first, scoring 170, and Rhodes dismissed Craig McDermott via a run out. South Africa scored 171 to win the match by nine wickets; Rhodes was not required to bat. Rhodes shot to fame after South Africa's fifth game of the World Cup, against Pakistan on 8 March 1992 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. South Africa batted first, scoring 211 off 50 overs. Pakistan's innings was reduced to 36 overs because of rain interruptions, with the target revised from 212 to 194 runs. Inzamam-ul-Haq and Pakistan captain Imran Khan resumed the innings when play was restarted. With the score at 135/2 Inzamam, who was at the time on 48, set off for a run but was turned back by Khan. The ball had rolled out towards Rhodes who ran in from backward point, gathered the ball and raced the retreating Inzamam to the wicket. Rhodes, with ball in hand, dived full length to break the stumps and effect the run out. The run out, the subject of a famous photograph by Jim Fenwick, is still considered one of the more spectacular feats of that World Cup and the defining moment of Rhodes' career. Pakistan's innings faltered from then on, eventually finishing on 173/8 with South Africa winning by twenty runs. On 14 November 1993 Rhodes took a world record of five catches, to achieve the most dismissals by a fielder (other than a wicketkeeper) against the West Indies at Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai. Rhodes announced that he planned to retire from One-Day International cricket after the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa. However, his tournament was cut short when he got injured in a match against Kenya. In Kenya's innings, Maurice Odumbe hit the ball in the air toward Rhodes. Rhodes dropped the catch and in the process broke his hand. The South African team's medical staff concluded that it would take four to five weeks to heal, effectively ruling Rhodes out of the rest of the tournament. Rhodes was withdrawn from the squad and replaced by Graeme Smith.  Post-retirement  After retiring from playing cricket Rhodes was employed Standard Bank as an account executive and is also involved with the bank's cricket sponsorship in South Africa. Rhodes is presently working as a fielding coach in the South African national cricket team.Cricinfo ‚Äì Bob was more than a coach to me ‚Äì Rhodes He was the fielding coach for IPL Team Mumbai Indians.now,he is the fielding coach for Kings XI Punjab at 13th season of Indian Premier League.

It is used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Albacete Balompi√©. History The stadium holds 17,524 and was built in 1960. It replaced the ageing Campo del Parque and was inaugurated on 9 September 1960 with a match against Sevilla FC, which attended more than 12,000 people. It had an initial capacity of 10,000. Floodlights were added in 1970 and a cover over the west side in 1979. The lighting towers also were constructed in 1970s. Following promotion to La Primera in 1991, the east side of the ground was developed with the building of a twin-decked cantilevered stand. This took the capacity of the ground up to 14,000 with only half of them being seated places. Further development in 1998 saw the removal of the athletics track, and the building of two open banks of seats at either end of the pitch. The north bank development also included new changing facilities. The pitch was also lowered in 1998 and a new stand was erected on the west side. This resulted in an increased capacity of 17,524. The last reconstruction of the stadium took place in 2017 bankrolled by the new club owner, Skyline International. The changes aimed to modernize the image of the Estadio Carlos Belmonte introducing new stands for VIP guests, press room, changing rooms and tunnels. Matches Spain have played four qualifiers since 1999, and an international friendly, at the ground, never conceding a goal.

Nastasee recorded two albums featuring collaborations with members of Mucky Pup, Dog Eat Dog, Non-Fiction, Hades and Murphy's Law. Origins Dan Nastasi was a founding member and guitarist of Mucky Pup, a Bergenfield, New Jersey hardcore and crossover thrash band formed in 1985. After three years and two albums with the band, Nastasi parted ways with Mucky Pup and spent a brief time as vocalist for the band Non-Fiction. After recording one EP, Nastasi left to fill the guitarist position in Murphy's Law. Nastasi's time in Murphy's Law was brief and Nastasi returned to Mucky Pup to record their third album, Now. Nastasi also joined with former Mucky Pup members, Dave Neabore and Sean Kilkenny, to form Dog Eat Dog with whom he would record the Warrant EP and the All Boro Kings album. Nastasi recorded one more album, Act Of Faith, with Mucky Pup before stepping down from both Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog to focus on running his own business. Trim the Fat Nastasi soon reunited with the original Non-Fiction lineup to form the band named #9. #9 was in the process of recording their debut when Nastasi accepted a solo record deal with SPV Records. Nastasi named the band Nastasee and began recording his first album, Trim The Fat. One song on the album, titled \\"Two Pops,\\" was co-written by Dan Lorenzo, his former #9 bandmate, and was originally intended for use on the #9 album. In 1996, the album was released exclusively in Europe due to the popularity of his previous bands in the continent. Four European tours followed in support of the album. Ule Tide Due to the favorable response that the album received, the label had Nastasee begin work on the followup immediately. In 1998, SPV Records were set to release the second Nastasee album, Ule Tide. While on another European tour with the band Shelter, to support the upcoming Ule Tide album, Nastasi was informed by the label that due to cost cutting and their signing of Mot√∂rhead, SPV Records would be dropping Nastasee and not releasing the Ule Tide album . As a result, Dan Nastasi decided to end the band. Ule Tide was made available through mailorders and promotional copies only. Those copies continue to be circulated through websites such as eBay and Amazon.com. Nastasi's return to Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog Soon after the breakup of the band, Nastasi joined with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates, John Milnes, Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny, to become All Boro Kings. All Boro Kings released one album, Just For The Fun Of It, in Europe. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the EastPak sponsored Resistance Tour. Six years later, the All Boro Kings project also ended. In 2009, Nastasi reunited with Mucky Pup who continue to play shows in the United States and Europe. In 2010, Nastasi and the original lineup of Dog Eat Dog reunited for two shows to commemorate the band's twentieth anniversary. In January, 2011, Nastasi performed three European shows with Dog Eat Dog to fill in for current guitarist, Roger Haemmerli, who was working with his band Henchman at the time.

It subsequently became UD Almer√≠a's home stadium, replacing Estadio Municipal Juan Rojas, with the latter being used by the reserve team. The stadium was expanded from 15,000 to 21,350 after Almer√≠a's promotion to La Liga. Since 2012, the club uses extra seats behind the goals for avoiding the use of the part of the stadium which is the furthest of the pitch. With this configuration, the capacity is reduced to 15,274. Access Located two kilometers near the main railway station of the city and a little further of the centre, the stadium can be accessed through the station or through the bus Line 7, in spite of car access.

It provides municipal services for the 35 Israeli Settlements in the Samarian hills within its jurisdiction with a total population of about 23,600 people. The main offices are located in the Barkan Industrial Park. The Council's logoPicture of the logo with the Bible verse on the bottom is inscribed with Biblical words from Jeremiah 31:5: \\"Again You will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria,\\" reflecting the region's wine industry. The municipal area of the Council spreads across 2,800 square kilometers. Until the fall of 2005 when some of its municipal land was abandoned as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, the Shomron Regional Council had been the largest Israeli regional council in municipal area. In August 2015, Yossi Dagan was elected to position of Chairman of Shomron Regional Council, with 62% of the vote. Geography The municipal area of the Council spreads across 2,800 square kilometers, which corresponds to about 10 percent of the area of the State of Israel within the Green Line. In municipal area, Shomron Regional Council is among the largest Israeli authorities.

Ltd. and aired from to . Spielban's footage was used for Saban‚Äôs live-action series, VR Troopers. For distribution purposes, TOEI Entertainment refers to this television series as Spielvan. Plot The Waller Empire destroys the planet Clin in search of water for its deity. Two Clinian children, Spielban and Diana, escape to Earth aboard the Grand Nasca. The two grow up during the long journey and don High Tech Crystal Suits to defeat the Waller who have come to Earth in search of more water. Spielban must avenge his dead mother Anna and his homeworld, and find his missing father Ben and older sister Helen. Unknown to Spielban at the start of the series his father and sister have been made members of the Waller against their will. Characters Grand Nasca crew Diana Lady Diana (unmasked) Spielban's group is based on the super dimensional mothership Grand Nasca, the source of Spielban and Diana's armor and vehicles. Diana also pilots it to see above the battlefield while Spielban is in Gaios. Its projectile weapons are Nasca Missiles and Nasca Rockets. It also transforms into the Big Bang Cannon, a bazooka-type weapon that Spielban can use. It can also go into \\"Combat Formation\\", where it becomes a giant robot that performs the \\"Nasca Hyper Crush\\" where it stomps General Deathzero's tank vehicles, shoot beams from its eyes (the Excel Beam), and uses \\"Knuckle Bomber\\", where it punches General Deathzero's fighter planes in mid-air. * : Anna and Ben's younger son and Helen's younger brother. A 20-year-old man from the planet Clin, he assumed the alias of while on Earth. When he shouts \\"Kesshou!\\" (\\"Crystallize\\"), the Grand Nasca showers \\"Clin Metal Super Corpuscles\\" upon him, which crystallize to form the silver, black and red suit around his body in 10 microseconds. Spielban's primary weapon is a sword which then becomes the Twin Blade, a double-edged laser lance used to destroy the mechanoids and lifeforms with his \\"Arc Impulse\\" attack. * : Marine's only daughter. She is 18 years old and Spielban's partner and girlfriend fighting as by performing the same techniques as Spielban to activate her own white and red suit. When she shouts \\"Kesshou!\\" (\\"Crystallize\\"), the Grand Nasca showers \\"Clin Metal Super Corpuscles\\" upon her, which crystallize to form the white red suit around her body in 10 microseconds. Like Spielban, Diana is quite capable in a fight both in and out of uniform and carries with her the Lady Sniper which acts as her own personal weapon. She primarily serves as a backup for Spielban when they battle the mechanoids or when the Waller send out assault vehicles. There have been times when the Waller have turned their attention towards her once they recognized how much of a threat to them she can be. A running gag on the show was that she would use her charm and sex appeal on the Kinclons, distracting them from their duties while she made her move. Another gag is that she sometimes uses her rear end to attack the Kinclons, which apparently knocks them out cold. * : Anna and Ben's daughter and Spielban's older sister is 22 and was captured by the Waller Empire when she was only a child. She was forced to witness Waller turning her father into Dr. Bio. Later, Dr. Bio was instructed to do the very same to her as well, converting her into with a secondary persona that activates via remote control. Helen is constantly kept away from her brother fearing she would turn into Hellvira and kill him. When trying to stop Spielban and Diana from killing Dr. Bio her secret as Hellvira is revealed as well as revealing Dr. Bio's identity as Speilban's father. After Pandora's trap almost kills her, Bio places the comatose Helen in a protective tube. When Diana learns that Helen survived, she and Spielban save her, as Dr. Bio destroys the remote control, deactivating the Hellvira persona. Soon after, Helen joins her brother in the fight against the Waller as . When she shouts \\"Kesshou!\\" (\\"Crystallize\\"), Helen is equipped with a high-tech crystal armor identical to Diana's and is and armed with the double- sided Helen Cutter. =Arsenal= * Super Dimensional Tank Gaios: A small tank-like vehicle piloted by Spielban. Armed with Gaios Rockets, Gaios Missiles and a Gaios Laser, it is also able to remove its cockpit and turn into \\"Jet Gaios\\" for aerial combat and \\"Drill Gaios\\" for digging underground. The Jet Gaios fires the Gaios Beam. * Hoverian: A hover-craft vehicle piloted by Spielban which turns into a motorcycle and can fire Hoverian Lasers and perform the Hoverian Rush. Others * Anna: Spielban and Helen's mother chose Spielban and Diana to survive by escaping in the Grand Nasca shortly before the destruction of the Clin mothership. She died but was restored to life in the alternate future timeline in which the Waller Empire never existed. * Marine: Diana's mother who died when the Clin detonated their own mothership but was restored to life in the alternate future timeline in which the Waller Empire never existed. * Space Swordsman Teacher (ep 14 & 31): A hologram generated by the Grand Nasca's computers to train Spielban in swordsmanship. Later trains Helen/Helen Lady in the same capacity. * Daigorou Koyama: Owner of the invention shop \\"Edison\\". He claims to be a genius and comes up with various gadgets that never quite work out. Was once tricked into building a robot for the Waller. * Miwa Koyama: Daigorou's younger sister. She helps out at \\"Edison\\" but is sick of Daigorou's inventions that never sell. Waller Empire The is the antagonistic group in Spielban. From their winged turtle-like mobile fortress called the Waller Castle Gamedeath, they search for water throughout the universe on the notion that they are sustaining the life . * : Originally a giant Starfish that needs vast amounts of water to survive, Pandora is the leader of Waller who conceived the Waller deity to establish her Empire while instilling fear in her subordinates. In the two-part series finale, after her other followers have died, Pandora personally fights Spielban while splitting into the forms of and . Thought to have been destroyed, Pandora endures and reveals herself as Waller's true leader when she reverted Dr. Bio to Ben for his attempted to sabotage the Gamedeath in her absence. Pandora once more splits into her two forms to battle Spielban's group before merging into a more powerful to finish them off. But Ben injects Pandora with a virus that is harming her at a cellular level, allowing Spielban to kill her as she reverts to her natural form. * : He claims to be a descendant of Waller, which therefore makes him a relative of Pandora. He was summoned from the 23rd century, by a talking gerbil created by Dr. Bio's experiments, from the life of a street beggar to help Pandora in the present. The gerbil told him that his life as a beggar was caused by Spielban. Though he treats his followers and allies as somewhat disposable, he remains eternally loyal to his Queen. Guillotine kept the talking gerbil for a pet, who is later left to Pandora, after he is rifted and destroyed. He dislikes Youki from the start, sensing that this new general will betray the Waller. Guillotine is dressed similarly to a rebel biker. He falls into a dimensional rift and returns as a ghost. As a ghostly form he invades the Grand Nasca and attempts to torture Helen. In this form his right arm has been replaced by a small, living, snake-like monster, which he could launch at the heroes. He was eventually destroyed by Spielban with the help of the Grand Nasca's energy. His gerbil was later contained and destroyed by Dr. Ben during the finale. * : Leader of Waller's Battle Mechanoids he is a black-armored android who is programmed with a knowledge of all tactics. He can transform into the Deathzero Torpedo, a black headed missile that is launched from a catapult. He transforms into this form twice during the series (Episodes 24 and 42), which coincidentally were the only two times he battled Spielban himself. It was strongly hinted that Deathzero was attracted to Diana. He later challenges Spielban to a second battle (both inside and outside of his tank), now having become/been promoted to Super General and powered with a 10,000 volt cylinder given to him by Pandora. He is destroyed by Spielban soon afterwards, with Spielban using his Arc Impulse. * : Formerly Spielban's father Doctor Ben, he was captured by Deathzero and converted into an inhuman being to save the Waller Empire as leader of the Biohumans and Battle- Lifeforms he creates with Lifeform Modification Surgery. He was also protective of Helen and constantly watched over her like a father would. Bio can unleash vine-like appendages from his arms and wields a giant sword in battle. In his first and only battle against Spielban he mutated and ended up in a Bioroid monster form, Bioroid Bio (ep 21 & 30). Bioroid Bio's abilities included transforming into plant life and/or slime and summoning small bee- like creatures and tentacles from his body. In this battle Helen tries to protect, and prevent him from fighting, his son Spielban before she was forcibly transformed into Hellvira to fight too. Pandora sets up an explosive trap to kill Bio, Helen, Diana, and Spielban all at once though, unfortunately for her, all four of them survive. Bio uses his slime morphing ability to pull his daughter and himself to safety. After surviving the battle Bio returns to the Empire and transforms into a floating brain with eyeballs and a spinal cord. Dr. Bio breaks Helen's remote control and is attacked by Deathzero under Pandora's orders. Afterwards Pandora takes away his privilege of moving around freely and imprisons him in a water-filled glass tube. He returns to his Dr. Bio form, with Pandora's efforts, and is reverted to his original human form when he attempted to sabotage the Gamedeath. Weakened as a result, killing the gerbil he created when its attempted to stop him, Ben acquires one of the viruses he developed as Bio and uses it on Pandora while killed in the process. But Ben is restored to life in the alternate future timeline in which the Waller Empire never existed. * : Leader of the Waller's all-female spy army. At one point she tricks the owner of the Edison shop, Daigorou Koyama, into building a prototype for a Battle Mechanoid. She often spies and comes up with cruel plans for the Waller, but is not one for combat. After she interferes with Youki's plan, Pandora angrily turns her into a stone statue for Youki to use as his throne. After Youki's death, the talking gerbil was given this throne for his own. During the finale, it disappears though it was presumably destroyed when the Gamedeath exploded. ** : Rikki's aides and fellow spies in Waller's all-female Spy Army. They assist Rikki in almost every evil scheme she creates and employs against Spielban and Diana. Spielban manages to destroy them both with a single strike of his sword when they tried to attack him during a vulnerable time per Guillotine's orders. Unfortunately for them he had gained a second wind, shocking the Waller. Even if he had not they would have been destroyed anyway, as the daggers exploded during the battle. Guillotine had tricked them into wielding the daggers, having promised them an increase in rank for killing Spielban. Upon being destroyed, they were revealed to be robots as they leave behind mechanical pieces and chunks of metal. * : A new Waller officer and androgynic entity created from the evil hearts of men by the Waller deity's (Pandora's) power. He gathered key members of Japanese society and brainwashed them into joining his own secret society, Mumumu. He uses these brainwashed characters to attack and terrorize the city, as well as Spielban and the heroes. Spielban was able to save the brainwashed masses. Youki can appear and disappear at will, as well as blast lasers from his mouth in battle which he first demonstrates in a fight against Spielban. Not trusted by many of the other officers Youki eventually decides to take over Waller, creating the Youki Battle Mechanoid from the remains of various Battle Mechanoids. Vacuumer destroys Youki's creation and sucks up most of his powers. Afterwards, Pandora kills the weakened Youki with his corpse given a funeral before being sent into the depths of space. * : Waller's mass-produced Battle Machine Soldiers, garbed in black tights with gold stripes, smiling gold masks with red eye slits, and black and gold capes. Some Kinclones attack with capes, some by kicking their detonating heads at Spielban, and some are equipped with blades on their hands. There was also a Kinclone with a robotic head which was revealed upon being struck by Spielban's Twin Blade. This one seemed stronger than the normal Kinclones, but was destroyed by Spielban just the same. =Waller Vehicles= * Waller Battleship Skulljaws: The Waller's transport battleships that resemble giant flying sharks. They are launched from the Gamedeath during battles. * Skulldon: General Deathzero's black tank which splits into the Skulldon Jet (top half) and the Skulldon Cutter (bottom half), a tank armed with a buzzsaw. Skulldon is accompanied by numerous lesser unnamed black tanks and is frequently defeated and knocked around by the Grand Nasca. =Battle Mechanoids= The are under Deathzero's command. * : A Battle Machineman with massive shoulders and hidden weapons such as an electrical laser under its faceplate that was deployed to deal with Spielban and Diana. During the battle Spielban managed to blast off the robot's arms, but the ring on its back remained and was used to bind Spielban. Gathering the strength he had left Spielban broke free and destroyed MechaShoulder with his Arc Impulse. * : A Battle Machineman built following Mecha Shoulder's demise. While investigating the Waller's latest scheme Spielban was lured into a trap/battle against MechaBander. It had multiple arms, including two large hands and an axe-equipped arm. Also included in its arsenal are electrical dischargers in its shoulders. Spielban survived the first encounter against MechaBander, but the two fought once more. This time Spielban had a plan, scanning the robot for a weak spot. He attacked/blasted the device on the robot's head weakening it and disabling the dischargers before ultimately killing it. * : MechaShocker can extend cables from his chest and blast electrical lasers from the cable's tips. MechaShocker has a bazooka hidden in the right hump, next to its face, which he used to blast Spielban. The battle did not last long as Spielban made short of the robot with his Arc Impulse. * : Spielban spotted Helen while out patrolling the city, however his search for her was cut short by the appearance of Mechaputer. Mechaputer had all of Spielban's attacks downloaded into its system. As a result, it could predict Spielban's attacks before he made them, making Mechaputer able to attack, defend and evade as it pleased. Spielban warped the battle to an empty rock quarry when Deathzero's army arrived. Spielban made short work of the jets and retreated from the battle. Helen was then forced to set up a trap for her brother and lured him into another fight with Mechaputer. This time Diana was in battle and Mechaputer had no data on her, so it was brought down and weakened by Diana and Spielban's combined laser attack (the Double Sniper). It was finally destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : A small robotic tank that was assigned to guard the Waller's new underwater lab. Daigorou and a friend were fishing nearby and accidentally snagged MechaNautila. The robot then pulled them both into the aquatic base where they were greeted by the bathing suit-clad Rikki, Gasher, and Shadow. Shortly afterwards the men were released after the Waller femmes fatale flirted with them. Daigorou told Spielban about the underwater paradise, which made him suspect that the Waller may be involved. After discovering the lab Spielban was attacked by Waller's jets and MechaNautila. MechaNautila mercilessly drove over Spielban and then transformed into a full humanoid form. Spielban took a heavy beating but was saved thanks to a recharge from Diana. Spielban used his Arc Impulse on MechaNautila and destroyed it. Nautila seems to come from the marine animal \\"Nautilus\\". * : A machine gun-themed samurai robot equipped with machine gun blasters concealed under his shoulder pads. This robot could also blast a powerful laser from the sphere-like apparatus in his forehead. The Waller's plan this time was to target Diana. Once Diana was isolated at a dam, MechaMajin appeared with the Kinclones to fight her. Diana held her own as long as she could, but MechaMajin was too strong. It broke her Lady Sniper and threw her off the dam. Injured and bleeding, Diana fled into the woods where she came face to face with Helen. Helen treated Diana's wounds but was forced to flee from the Waller's soldiers when they appeared. Both ladies parted ways and Diana once again faced off with MechaMajin, but Spielban came to the rescue this time. He loaned Diana his Laser Sniper to and destroyed MechaMajin with his Arc Impulse. * : A robot originally created by Daigorou. An attractive businesswoman came into the Edison shop and offered him a great sum of money if he would construct a robot for her. Daigorou, infatuated by the mystery woman, was more than happy to accept the job. The woman was really Rikki in disguise and the Waller's plan was to use the goofy inventor's creation to launch a sneak attack on Spielban. He went to work dreaming about the possibilities of fame, fortune, and women. Daigorou finally finished his robot but knock-out gas filled his shop and the Kinclones added their own secret modifications. A party was held to celebrate the robot's creation, but the robot secretly attacked Spielban with a small deadly needle in its finger. Spielban faked his demise as he was wearing protective body armor under his jacket. The robot discarded its creator's logo and changed into its Battle Mechanoid form. Spielban went into battle with it and destroyed it with his Arc Impulse. * : A robotic sniper armed with a laser rifle and a sword. It was also the first Machine Man with the ability to speak. At the beginning of the episode, Spielban came face to face with a mystery man in a cowboy hat and poncho. MechaGunman and Spielban exchanged gunfire, but MechaGunman left the battle and demanded a showdown for later. This was also the first fight which left Spielban injured. Spielban modified his laser sniper and practiced his target shooting on board Grand Nasca. Meanwhile, the Waller examined the data MechaGunman had managed to collect on Spielban. When the two had their second gunfight MechaGunman had new surprises. MechaGunman generated a radar and a red laser shield to deflect Spielban's fire. Diana joined the fight but did not fare much better against the shield. She was quickly defeated, but her fall gave Spielban the motivation to short out the gunman's shield and destroy the robot once and for all. * : A robot based on a freezer and other household appliances. MechaFreezer could use his right arm like a vacuum to attack, as well as a fan-like apparatus built into his chest to blast Spielban and Diana with fierce winds and ice spray. An average family was given the chance to live their lives in comfort and fortune in a futuristic house with a safe filled with money. The youngest son felt something was not quite right about the house but the boy's parents and older siblings began to let greed set in as they became more and more conceited. The boy was a friend of Spielban's, so Spielban personally took a look at the house only to get booted out by the parents. Diana had a different approach, placing a spy camera there disguised a toy, courtesy of the Edison Shop. One night the appliances began to behave strangely. The two heroes charged in to witness the birth of MechaFreezer. Spielban eventually destroyed MechaFreezer with his Arc Impulse. * : A drill- themed robot. The episode began with Spielban on a high speed chase to rescue a bus full of children and a teacher from the Kinclones, but waiting for him was DrillHander. While Spielban engaged the robot in combat, Hoverian was stolen. Deathzero then announced to Spielban that he had a choice to either recover his bike, or save the children from a bomb. Unable to do both, Spielban retreated to the Grand Nasca to formulate a plan to rescue both the bike and the kids. Throughout the episode a narration recaps all the Spielban arsenal in action as well as the two Metal Heroes' training. After training with a holographic swordsman, Spielban finally has a plan. Diana uses her sex appeal to distract the Kinclone guards while Spielban sneaks into the abandoned warehouse. Meanwhile, Deathzero was trying to dismantle the bike to extract any useful information, but had no luck. Spielban finds the hostages, but is ambushed by DrillHander. The bike suddenly springs to life, breaks free of the restraints and aids its master. Spielban kills DrillHander with his Arc Impulse while riding Hoverian. * : A gorilla-themed robot. Bosskong had spikes on his fists, and could launch his fists like flying maces at Spielban and Diana in battle. The Waller took a local camping site hostage; two men made an attempt to escape but were stopped by the robotic primate. The two men were recaptured, restrained, and tortured by the Kinclones. A young boy also tries to escape and is successful. Spielban finds the child and learns about the hostage situation. As Spielban makes his way to the campsite, BossKong is spying on him. He manages to free everyone, but Spielban finds himself in serious trouble against BossKong. Diana comes to the rescue, but her efforts against BossKong don't fare any better. BossKong takes hold of Spielban's sword with its jaws and, to reclaim it, Spielban hops onto the monkey's back, pounding it repeatedly until BossKong overheats. Spielban used his Arc Impulse to destroy BossKong. * : A powerful white robot equipped with a hook and a large blaster pack on its shoulder. Blocker has the ability to detach its arms to attack its opponents. Spielban's friend, a young boy named Nobuo, was playing a motorcycle arcade game. Nobuo was then approached by a stranger who offered him a chance to try out a new arcade game. The game was a trap and Nobuo's mind became trapped inside a virtual world. Spielban follows and has his mind trapped as well. Inside the virtual world, and unable to transform, Spielban went through endless bizarre events during his quest to find Nobuo. Every time Spielban came close to Nobuo and the mysterious man, his location kept changing from the urban city, to rock quarries, to train yards. With each new setting there were simulated people who looked harmless but attacked him without warning, including a pair of white robotic hands. The hands belonged to the robot Blocker. Meanwhile, his real body was transported to a hospital with Diana watching over him. Every injury Spielban sustained in the virtual world, his body also suffered. His body was also in danger as the surgeon treating it was Blocker in disguise. The surgeon attacked Diana, who pleaded Spielban to wake up. After Diana freed him from Blocker's control, Spielban managed to wake up from his virtual nightmare and transform to battle Blocker. He managed to cut off Blocker's arms and kick off its head, but it made no difference and the robot continued to attack. It was finally defeated for good by Spielban's Arc Impulse. Nobuo was saved as well and was eager to play more video games. * : A fire-breathing kangaroo-like robot with a high-jumping ability. Dorbelar could blast laser spheres from its mouth as well as unleash a tiny airplane-like camera from its chest. The camera had the ability to fire lasers as well as spy on targets through its single lens. Spielban fought with this robot by itself, as well as with Hellvira at the same time. Hellvira at this time having been forced to fight against her will. Once Spielban knocked Hellvira down, this robot was destroyed soon afterwards by his Arc Impulse while he rode Hoverian. * : An electricity-themed robot that can attack with electricity. A robotics professor was visiting the Edison shop with his collection of robots. The robots looked more like oversized toys, except for one that was modeled with the appearance (and strength) of a weightlifter, called Samson. Later that night Denzilar used its electric current to take control of the robots, including the robot strongman. Spielban went to look for the missing robots and found them causing havoc throughout the city. While Spielban battled the robots he tried to reason with Samson, but Denzilar gave it more juice to overpower Spielban. While regrouping at the Edison Shop Daigorou told Spielban and Diana that the professor grew depressed and went to find his beloved robots on his own. Spielban then disguised himself as a robot for the Waller to capture, but his plan was complicated when the Kinclones found the inventor snooping around and captured him. Spielban removed his disguise and battled Denzilar while Diana took on Samson. Diana was saved when the professor snipped the wires in Samson's head, disabling it. Denzilar still remained but Spielban transported the battle to a rock quarry where it was destroyed by his Arc Impulse. The professor was then reunited with all of his stolen robots, including Samson. * : A wheel-themed robot that could launch wheel-themed discs and blast lasers from his eyes in battle. The discs he launched matched the theme of the wheels that were on his body. This robot was used, alongside Shadow, Gasher, and Rikki, to help capture a scientist and his android wife. The android wife was destroyed in battle by Sharinder. Sharinder controlled a humvee-like vehicle of his own which he brought out in battle against Spielban and Diana. First Spielban used the power of Hoverian to destroy the humvee. Then Spielban destroyed this robot with his Arc Impulse whilst riding Hoverian. Afterwards, Spielban and Diana helped the scientist and made sure he would arrive safely to his next destination. * : A shaman- like shark-themed robot that had a humanoid and a robotic form. He managed to brainwash a KISS-like rock group into becoming an assassin group for Waller. This robot fought both Spielban and Diana inside a cave which was set as a trap for them. Later in battle Sartan revealed that he could launch the fin- shaped blade on the top of his head at the heroes, which they managed to destroy. When Sartan was destroyed by Spielban with his Arc Impulse, the spell on everyone he had brainwashed was broken. * : A robot that could roll up into a ball and attack. It also had the strength to toss heavy boulders. While on Demon Mountain, Spielban and Diana confronted Godolar during a search for a researcher that was last seen near the location by his kids. It was later revealed that the researcher had been kidnapped by Deathzero and the female spy team after he had discovered the Waller's new base. Godolar had been created to guard the Waller's newly built base on Demon Mountain by killing anyone who dared to even approach the place with his vicious traps and weapons. Diana managed to locate the base and destroy it, while Spielban went into battle with Godolar. In battle, Godolar managed to throw heavy boulders on Spielban and pin him down, as well as blast lasers from his eyes. Spielban managed to escape from being pinned and destroy Godolar with his Arc Impulse. After Godolar and the base were destroyed, and Deathzero and the spies retreated, Spielban and Diana helped the two children and their father re- unite in a safer place at a safer time. =New Battle Mechanoids= The are a stronger series of Battle Mechanoids. * : Guillotine personally supervised Puncher's construction. After the two kunoichi completed their training, Guillotine presented them with brand new kunai. One of Puncher's abilities was to detach its massive claw on its right arm and launch it at the enemy. The claw could operate separately from the main body and held a tight grasp on Spielban during their battle. After Diana broke free from the Kinclones she joined the fight, but sadly her efforts made no difference. Puncher was powerful, but was eventually destroyed by Spielban. * : This robotic creature has a snake tail instead of legs. She was built by Guillotine and Deathzero, who planned to use her as a part of Guillotine's plan against Spielban. Medor could blast arrows from her one, bow-like arm, as well as crack her tail like a whip and bind enemies (like Spielban) with it in battle. Spielban managed to destroy Medor with his Arc Impulse. Spielban figured out later that Medor was not Helen, and that Helen was still alive and out there somewhere for him to find one day. * : A copper-colored bat-themed robot who was sent, alongside Kinclones, to capture an alien couple who crash landed on Earth. The alien travelers story was much like Spielban and Diana's, which had happened years ago. Spielban managed to rescue the female, while the male was successfully captured by the Waller. Karmilar launched and latched his tentacled tongue onto the spaceman, draining him of his blue-colored blood while storing his robotic bat-like body. The blood was then turned into blue-like stones/pearls that were given to Pandora and used as an offering to the Waller deity. As the alien hostages were being taken back Spielban appeared and rescued them, which lead to him and Diana having a battle with Karmilar, Deathzero, and the Kinclones. After the Kinclones had been taken care of, Spielban fought Karmilar, who attacked by biting him on the neck. Though overwhelming at first, Spielban endured and destroyed this robot with his Arc Impulse. * : A disk player-themed robot. This robot helped in the Waller's plot to use CDs, with Pandora's voice, to hypnotize and lure/trap pregnant women into their clutches. The Waller planned to use the babies for their own evil deeds. Diana disguised herself as one of these women and ended up in the same trap as the others before Spielban came to the rescue. After the pregnant women were saved, Spielban and Diana took on the Waller forces and Disk together. Disk could launch/blast discs from his arm/hand in battle, use a giant disc as a shield to reflect attacks made by Spielban and Diana, as well as reflect sunbeams as lasers to blast the heroes. Like many robots before it Disk was eventually destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : This football-themed robot attacked Diana with the help of Hellvira. With an injured leg, Diana could not withstand the combined onslaught of Hellvira and Offside. When Offside removes the football on its head and kicks it towards his opponents, the ball detonates upon impact. Offside used the football on his head and tried to tackle Spielban repeatedly in battle, both to no avail. Offside was destroyed by Spielban, but Diana was left in critical condition. * : A van-themed robot. After Helen failed to harm Spielban, and it was discovered that her transformation remote was no longer working, Kuruman was sent to destroy Spielban and bring back Helen. Kuruman could transform between his Battle Mechanoid form as well as take the form of a regular-looking SUV. In regular form, he can blast lasers from his high beams and could produce a force field- like shield to deflect Spielban's attacks. In battle Spielban managed to blast and destroy this robot's rear-end, which seemed to slow it down long enough to be destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse, which Spielban implemented while riding Hoverian. * : A bee-themed robot, Antom can spray acidic liquid from its mouth that could destroy anything it touched. Antom could also release miniature robotic bees that stung and electrocuted Spielban, Diana Lady, and Helen Lady, attempting to fry their armor's circuits in the process. Antom can also drill its tongue into a building's foundation to cause it to quake and crumble to pieces. He was destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : A walking tree-like robot. He appeared when the Waller Empire's scheme was to turn people/Earthlings into plants. Tsutarla grew from seedlings that the Kinclones were delivering on unmarked trucks across the city. After he grew he went into battle with Spielban, Diana, and Helen. Tsutarla could launch vines from its mouth and fingers. These vines could bind and shock Spielban and the girls. He was eventually killed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : A motorcycle-based robot. Guillotine had infiltrated a biker gang and planned to use them and this robot, to destroy Spielban for him. Biker could transform between his Battle Mechanoid form as well as take the form of a regular-looking motorcycle. Diana's Lady Sniper didn't seem to affect it. Spielban was able to destroy it in battle with his Arc Impulse, which while riding Hoverian. * : A balloon- themed robot. He appeared around Christmas when the Waller Empire's scheme was to use him/his powers to devour the dreams of children. Yumepakkun could release a binding, glowing balloon in battle as well as fire explosive laser spheres. He was eventually destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : He was used during the Waller Empire's scheme to give Earthlings magic mirrors on New Year's Eve that were supposed to make the Earthlings look beautiful. In reality, these mirrors turned people into mummies, through the use of magic from the deity Waller. Shishidon first appeared in the guise of a kimono lion, hence the name. Shishidon is a rollerskate-themed robot who wore rollerskates and resembled a giant rollerskate. He threw explosive parasol umbrellas at Spielban in battle. In battle he could also extend his arms and neck to fit his needs and can blast bladed arrows, mini-missiles and fire from his mouth. He was destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : A red robot with three yellow eyes and a bazooka-type weapon mounted on his right shoulder. Not fully trusting the Youki's plan, Rikki tried to convince Guillotine and Deathzero to use added measures. After Walther appeared, Youki and the Mumumu pulled back and left Walther to destroy the heroes. Spielban, Diana, and Helen combined their laser blasts in order to weaken him. Spielban then destroyed him with his Arc Impulse. * : A brain-themed robot with its brains on its chest. Youki abducted a couple of scientists and drained their knowledge into the robot so that he could steal a device that the couple had developed for the Empire. The device supposedly contained technology that could boost the Waller's technology, as they had nothing like it at the time. Spielban and Diana combined their laser blasts to destroy the robot's brains, which held the transferred knowledge of the scientists. The scientists gained back their stolen knowledge afterwards. It was destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : A scrap-metal robot created by Youki. Its scrapped body seemed to have previously been that of Dreampacker's since it had Dreampacker's right foot, covered with Blocker's head and helmet, Godoilar's body and legs, Sharinder's right arm, Puncher's right arm which was used for a left arm, and Mechaputer's left foot. It attacked only once before it was destroyed by Vacuumer, though it did manage to attack Vacuumer and Deathzero before being reduced back to scrap. * : A heavy-armored fan-themed robot that can suck anyone toward him or blow them away with gusts from his built-in fans. When Youki rebelled against the Waller and took over the Gamedeath, this robot was summoned to deal with him. It sucked up all of Youki's power and destroyed the Youki Battle Mechanoid. Later it was sent to destroy Spielban, Diana, and Helen, with Deathzero and his fleet in tow. Spielban destroyed it with his Arc Impulse, soon after confronting it. * : A green, scaly dragon/lizard-themed robotic creature that was dressed like a samurai warrior. He sought to wield the Legendary Demon Sword. With it, Kumason would become more powerful than Spielban in battle. Eventually, he and Deathzero discovered the \\"fossilized\\" sword, but realized it needed electrical energy (lightning) to recharge its power. The granddaughter of the sword's temple keeper used her energy to turn the sword back into a fossil after Spielban saved her. This distraction and the loss of the sword allowed Spielban to destroy the weakened Kumason with his Arc Impulse. * : A movie camera-themed robot, Movieman was used in Deathzero's plan to make a film. In the movie Deathzero would win Diana and defeat Spielban. In battle Movieman could blast powerful lasers from his camera lens eye and teleport in flashes of light. Movieman could also create translucent decoy images of himself and bind his opponents with movie reel tentacles. Movieman confronted and captured Diana first before going into battle with Spielban and Helen. Movieman eventually had to battle Spielban, Helen, and Diana after Helen rescued her, but it was destroyed by Spielban's Arc Impulse. * : This robot resembles a walrus. Blizzer had the ability to freeze water pipes as well as freeze his opponents with built-in ice-blowers. To keep from being frozen Spielban, Diana, and Helen were given anti-freeze defense on their armor. Spielban tried to reflect Blizzer's attacks back to him, but Blizzer was also equipped with a flamethrower and melted through the ice. Eventually it was destroyed by Spielban with the help of Diana in the Grand Nasca, who managed to freeze him with his own laser long enough for Spielban to use his Arc Impulse to destroy him. =Battle Lifeforms= The are Dr. Bio's monsters created out of organic material. Only a few were produced and near the end of the first half of the series Bio would operate on himself and become a Bio Lifeform. * : The first of three Bio Lifeforms. Guja could metamorph itself into green slime for infiltration as well as morph into a flat starfish-like mass to wrap itself around its victims in order to consume them. After eating a human Guja could assume their identity. Guja was used to break into a museum and after eating and impersonating a guard, a diamond was stolen which Pandora used as an offering to the Waller deity. Dr. Bio later upgraded Guja with the ability to shoot deadly gas. Spielban was almost eaten, but he finally killed Guja with his Arc Impulse. * : A floating spore-like organism that emerged from a rose. While conducting his research by the lake Spielban found a sad little girl. She quickly ran off leaving her backpack behind. The backpack had her address and name which revealed that she was the daughter of a renowned scientist. Spielban returned the backpack, but the scientist and his daughter were being held hostage by the Waller. The scientist was forced to conduct experiments for the Waller while his daughter kept him fed and made it appear to the public that everything was alright. Spielban sneaked in to save them, but Deathzero threatened to kill them and forced Spielban to throw down his gun. The scientist mustered his courage and broke free from the Kinclones clutches which allowed Spielban to attack. Wataja had no body and it was difficult for Spielban to land a decent hit. Spielban destroyed it with his Arc Impulse attack. * : An octopus-based monster and Dr. Bio's final lifeform. Umija was covered in tentacled limbs and was colored bluish grey. Umija was unleashed into the ocean where it would spawn from its arms. Dr. Bio's plan was to infect all the Earthlings with small aquatic parasites causing the infected person enter the ocean where they would turn into fish people. Spielban went scuba diving and confronted Umija. He told Diana what was going on and she volunteered herself as bait to lure Umija out of the water. Meanwhile, Spielban stumbled into Bio's hidden mountain lab and demolished it with his land vehicle.

Opened in 1947, the stadium has a capacity of 8,164 seats. Ipurua has been the principal football ground in Eibar since 1947. Numerous simple fields were used before Ipurua became the first enclosed ground. It was inaugurated on 14 September 1947, with a match between SD Eibar and their local rivals CD Elgoibar that was a 0‚Äì2 defeat. History Opening and first years Work began on the central main stand in 1948 and this was finally opened in 1951. Because the ground lies at the bottom of a steep valley, the pitch was prone to flooding and poor drainage. Steps were taken to address this and a new drainage system and pitch levelling was completed in 1959. The ground remained relatively basic throughout the 1960s, but in 1970 the popular preferente end was covered and the roof of the main stand was extended. The first floodlights were also installed in 1970 and they were inaugurated on 14 October 1970 with a match between Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao. During the 1980s Eibar‚Äôs fortunes improved on the field and basic improvements were made to the ground. This included the erection of a basic cover at the western end of the ground. Promotion to Segunda and first expansion In 1989 SD Eibar promoted to Segunda Divisi√≥n, but Ipurua was probably the most basic stadium in the division. Matters were complicated by the fact that the urban area of Eibar had spread westwards and severely restricted space to the north of the ground. The club received funding in 1998 from the local council and Liga de F√∫tbol Profesional and started a project to completely remodel Ipurua. In 1998, the original main stand was demolished and a new, full-length covered stand was constructed. This had a capacity of approximately 2,800, which would be over half of remodelled grounds capacity. In 1999, work started on refurbishing the end stands and in 2001, the narrow north terrace was roofed and 4 rows of seats were installed. Work was completed with the installation of a new drainage system and pitch. Promotion to La Liga and second expansion In 2014, following SD Eibar's promotion to La Liga, a project to redevelop the north stand and bring the stadium's capacity up to more than 6,000 seats was approved by the local council.El ayuntamiento de Eibar da luz verde a la ampliaci√≥n de Ipurua (Marca, 13/11/2014 -Spanish-) The fully completed stand was inaugurated on 30 August 2015, for a league match played between the hosts SD Eibar and neighbouring Basque club Athletic Bilbao.La nueva tribuna norte de Ipur√∫a se estrenar√° en el Eibar-Athletic (Marca, 27/08/2015 -Spanish-)Los abonados de la Tribuna Norte han empezado a elegir su localidad en Ipurua (El Diario Vasco, 01/09/2015 -Spanish-) On 9 May 2016, works to demolish and redevelop the east end stand began. The works, completed in January 2017, also provided an underground parking garage, space for the club's museum and the club's official store, new service areas and the possibility of making the adjacent street pedestrian on match days.El lunes arrancan las obras de la Tribuna Este de Ipurua (SD Eibar, 04/05/2016 -Spanish-) As a result, the stadium's capacity was brought up to 7,083 seats. The pitch measures 103 x 65 m. In May 2018, works to demolish and redevelop the west end stand began. The new stand is expected to be finished by August 2019 and will bring the stadium's capacity up to 8,164 seats. Ipurua remains a modern-yet-compact stadium with full UEFA certification, although many visiting La Liga teams have complained that its 7,000 seats are not up to par for a top flight stadium. In September 2018, a supporting barrier in the away fans' section of one stand collapsed under the weight of supporters who had rushed to the front to celebrate a goal for their club Sevilla, resulting in several minor injuries.

The old Turkish name Seto or Shetu means white dragon. It was a cultural act to give this name to a boy, when a family member has dreamed about this white dragon.  As prince  He was appointed by Taspar khagan as lesser khagan in east.  Reign  He was appointed to the throne after resignation of Amrak, by the high council as the legal resolution to the crisis created by his uncle Taspar Qaghan who had bequeathed the title of khagan to his nephew Talopien (son of Muqan Qaghan). This act violated the traditional system of inheritance from oldest brother to youngest brother and oldest son to youngest. Immediately after his appointment, the legal basis of his power was contested by the erstwhile heir Talopien, Jotan, and Tardu. This highly unstable situation quickly became a smoldering civil war, which the Sui Chinese took advantage of in every way possible to weaken the G√∂kt√ºrks. Khagan married Princess Qianjin of Northern Zhou and accepted refugees from the Chen Dynasty, two moves that were undertaken to legitimize his authority. One of the envoys in his wife's escort was the spy/ambassador Zhangsun Sheng. He managed to become a friend of Ishbara, and spent many years with the Turks. His knowledge about the customs and institutions of the Gokturks was of great importance for the Sui Empire. In order to end the civil war Ishbara finally acknowledged the Sui Dynasty as his overlord.In the end Ishbara succeeded in saving the khaganate, albeit at the price of losing his sovereignty. In 587, both Ishbara Qaghan and Apa Qaghan died.  Family  He was married to his uncle's widows Princess Qianjin of Northern Zhou.

He notably played in the Premier League for Arsenal, winning the 1994 UEFA Cup Winner's Cup with them, and in the Football League for Fulham, Wimbledon and Southend United. Beleaguered by a number of serious injuries which cut-short his professional aspirations, he thereafter forged a career in non-league football with clubs such as Woking, Lewes, Grays Athletic, Maidstone United, Croydon Athletic, Dorchester Town and Kingstonian. During his time at Arsenal he made three appearances for the England Under-21 international team. He was a member of the last time Arsenal fielded an all English team in a Premier League game, in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home against Wimbledon on 19 April 1994. Playing career Arsenal Selley joined Arsenal in 1990 as a trainee and won a South East Counties League title medal and Floodlit Cup Winners medal in his first season. He made his first-team debut at the age of eighteen in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Blackburn Rovers in September 1992. Selley played nine games for Arsenal in the 1992‚Äì93 season and fifteen games in the 1993‚Äì94 season. Injuries to several key players gave Selley his most famous appearance for the club, when he was the youngest player on the field in Arsenal's 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final victory over Parma. He had previously been an unused substitute in the 1993 League Cup final and in the 1993 FA Cup Final replay, both games against Sheffield Wednesday, as Arsenal won the Cup double that season. He scored two goals for Arsenal, both coming in the Cup Winners' Cup. His first came against Standard Liege in 1993‚Äì94 and his second against Brondby the following season. In February 1995 Selley broke his leg playing against Leicester City, which forced him out for most of the 1996‚Äì97 season, playing just once under new manager Wenger as a late substitute against Chelsea. Despite reports that he would be a part of Ars√®ne Wenger's new side he was sold to Fulham in 1997 for ¬£500,000, after playing 42 games for Arsenal. Fulham and Wimbledon Unfortunately for him, he broke his leg a second time after playing just three games for Fulham and moved to Wimbledon in July 2000.Dons sign ex-Arsenal duo, BBC Sport However Wimbledon were facing financial difficulties, and a bonus payment clause in his contract meant the club couldn't always afford to play him. Selley started just one game with three substitute appearances for Wimbledon. Southend United In February 2002 he was loaned to Southend United,Southend seal Selley loan, BBC Sport where he enjoyed more success, playing fourteen games in the 2000‚Äì01 season. He went on loan to Southend again in the 2002‚Äì03 season,Selley back at Southend, BBC Sport playing 11 times. In all he played more than 30 times for Southend in all competitions. Woking Selley was released by Wimbledon in May 2003, and signed for Woking where he became an integral member of the team. Despite an injury against Kettering Town in the FA Trophy in 2004 which kept him out for ten games, he featured consistently and earned a reputation as a dead-ball specialist ‚Äì he converted six goals from the spot in the 2003‚Äì04 season and two free kicks. At the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season his form was rather indifferent and it was revealed that he was recovering from a hernia operation. This did not prevent him from playing and he signed another one-year deal to keep him at Woking and provide much needed experience as the club sought a play-off place for promotion from the Conference National to The Football League. He picked up nine yellow cards in his time at Southend United and picked up 10 bookings in his first season at Woking, six the season after that and four in the following season. Injury ruled him out of much of the 2006‚Äì07 season, and he was eventually released by Woking at the end of the season. Further non-League career Following his release from Kingfield Stadium, Selley joined Lewes in July 2007. In September 2007 Sam Jeremiah of St Francis Rangers FC pulled away from Selley at the near post to head in the equaliser in what was eventually a 4‚Äì1 defeat. He then signed non-contract terms for Grays Athletic on 22 November 2007, reportedly wanting first team football. It was revealed that Sutton United manager, Ernie Howe, tried to sign Selley as a player-coach but he proved to be too expensive. Selley left Grays Athletic to join Isthmian League Premier Division side Maidstone United on 7 March 2008, helping them to avoid relegation. He then joined Croydon Athletic in December 2008. Selley's next move was to Conference South club Dorchester Town before his release in January 2010. After his release in January 2010, he signed for Havant & Waterlooville, where he made a good impression. He was released in July 2011. He later signed for Kingstonian. During his time at Kingstonian, he had loan spells at Chertsey Town and Whyteleafe. He ended his playing career in the summer of 2012 and was appointed as the new head coach at Arsenal Soccer Schools Dubai.

Considered a renowned patriot, Kukuljeviƒá was a proponent of Illyrian movement and avid collector of historical documents, primarily those for his work in Croatian historiography and bibliography. Early life Kukuljeviƒá was born in Maru≈°evec near Vara≈ædin. He completed his secondary education in gymnasiums in his hometown and in Zagreb. He went to the Military Academy of Krems. As a student, Kukuljeviƒá started writing in German. In 1833, he joined the army and became an officer in Vienna three years later. He met Ljudevit Gaj and joined the Illyrian movement in 1837. He was ordered to move to Milan in 1840. In 1842, he resigned from his military duties and returned to Croatia, joining the political fight against Magyarization and censorship. He became one of the leaders of the Illyrian movement. Politician Kukuljeviƒá was a member of the People's Party, and was one of its leading members as early as 1843. The political activity of Kukuljeviƒá can be separated into two periods: until 1850 and from 1860 to 1867. The gap from 1851 to 1860 was caused by the absolutism instituted by Minister Bach, which repressed political life in Croatia. In the first period, he was a partisan of the liberation of Croatia from Austria and Hungary, an uncompromising ideologue promoting revolutionary actions to achieve the unity of the South Slavs. Believing that the South Slavs can be delivered and unified only by force of arms, he lobbied among the Croats and Serbs at the Military Frontier. Swayed by his personality, the frontiersmen asked for the freedom and unity of the South Slav peoples in their People's Requests of spring 1848, referring to him as their inspiration. Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski was the first to make a speech in the Croatian language before the Croatian Parliament, on May 2, 1843. The speech daringly promoted the struggle for national liberation, asking for Croatian to become the official language in schools and offices, with its gradual introduction in the public life. He also pointed out the danger of replacing Croatian with other languages. Until then, the language of discourse in the parliament was Latin. The speech caused much agitation. It was not an exception, though. All his speeches in the parliament and at county assemblies staunchly advocated the freedom and independence of Croatia, so they could be published only in Branislav, an illegal Illyrian magazine printed in Belgrade. On Kukuljeviƒá's urging, the parliament passed the decision to make Croatian the official language in 1847. He became the chief judge of the Vara≈ædin County in 1845. During the Revolutions of 1848, Kukuljeviƒá was among the radical democrats. Under his influence, the ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá convened the Croatian Parliament on June 5, 1848, opposing the explicit imperial order. Kukuljeviƒá also initiated the Slavic Congress in Prague. But the revolutions were crushed; imperial oppression set in. Kukuljeviƒá was removed from politics and kept under police surveillance. In the 1850s, his outlook radically changed. The second period of his political activity was the complete opposite of his early anti-Austrian and freedom-loving sentiments. After he became the prefect of Zagreb County in 1861, he was loyal to Vienna, implementing policies targeted against Croatians and the South Slavs and hounding his former friends who remained faithful to their Illyrian ideals. After the Compromise of 1867, he was removed from political positions and retired. He was later again elected to the Sabor. He died in Tuhakovec Castle in Zagorje and was buried in Zagreb. Historian and cultural figure Statue of Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski in Zagreb's Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski Square Despite the sharp turn in his later political career, the early patriotic and historical poems of Kukuljeviƒá had a major influence on the patriotic sentiments among the Croats. He founded the Society for Yugoslavian History, edited the magazine called Arhiv za Povjesnicu jugoslavensku (Archive for Yugoslavian History), and published valuable historical monographs. Kukuljeviƒá's efforts earned him the title of the \\"father of modern Croatian historiography\\"., cited in Kukuljeviƒá collected and published many source texts related to the history of Croatia. He wrote a lexicon with 800 artists' biographies. He is considered a pioneer of Croatian scientific bibliography. In 1850, Kukuljeviƒá took part in the Vienna Literary Agreement. Due to financial problems, Kukuljeviƒá was forced to sell his enormous library, numbering 12,000 volumes, which was acquired by the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences in Zagreb. One of manuscripts from his library is a tragedy, Skanderbeg, written on the basis of Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá's work.

He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart for his actions. Newman was laid down by the Charleston Navy Yard on 8 June 1943; launched on 9 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. J. B. Newman, mother of L. G. Newman AD3; and commissioned on 26 November 1943, Lt. Comdr. W. C. Meyer, USNR, in command. Service history Following shakedown off Bermuda, Newman was assigned transatlantic escort duty. Between 11 February and 29 June 1944, she crossed the ocean six times. On 30 June, at Staten Island, she commenced conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport, reporting for shakedown in Chesapeake Bay as APD-59 on 19 September. At the end of the month she departed Norfolk, Virginia, as flagship of TransDiv 103, and headed for the Pacific. Arriving at Hollandia on 4 November, she escorted supply convoys between that port and Leyte Gulf until 12 December. Then, at Leyte, she embarked troops of the 24th Division and got underway for her first amphibious operation, the 15 December invasion of Mindoro. Landing her troops with the first waves, she turned back to Leyte, then proceeded to New Guinea to prepare for the initial operations of 1945. At Noemfoor, she took on troops of the 158th Regimental Combat Team and proceeded back to the Philippines. On the 11th, two days after the initial invasion of Luzon, she landed her troops on the Lingayen beaches under the cover of naval shore bombardment, then provided gunfire support until retiring to escort a convoy back to Leyte, arriving on 15 January. Assignments to amphibious landings, and their support, now increased as the momentum of the war in the Philippines picked up. On 29 January, she participated in landings at San Felipe, Luzon; on the 30th, on Grande Island in Subic Bay; on 28 February at Puerto Princesa, Palawan; on 10 March at Zamboanga, Mindanao; on 26 March at Talisay, Cebu; and on 17 April at Parang, Mindanao. In May, she shifted to Morotai and in June and July participated in landings in Borneo at Brunei Bay on 10 June, and Balikpapan on 1 July. On 16 July, she departed the East Indies to return to the Philippines, arriving Leyte the 18th and to Legaspi, Luzon, on the 27th, where she conducted training exercises for combat teams until the end of the war. On 29 August, she steamed to Okinawa, embarked units of the 24th Corps, Army Service Command for transportation to Jinsen, Korea. On 8 September, she landed the occupation forces at Jinsen and then commenced escort duty between Jinsen, Taku and the Philippines. On 26 November, she departed the Far East en route to New York. Arriving there on 9 January 1946, she steamed south to Green Cove Springs, Florida, joining the 16th (Inactive) Fleet on 18 February. Later berthed at Orange, Texas, Newman remained a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Navy List in 1964. On 15 August 1966 her hulk was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland.  Awards  Newman earned five battle stars during World War II.

Following the death of his father in 1705, he was styled the Earl of Dalkeith, until he succeeded to the dukedom of Buccleuch, 6February 1732, on the death of his grandmother, who was Duchess of Buccleuch in her own right. At the same time, other titles in the Scottish peerage came his way: Earl of Dalkeith and Baron Scott of Whitchester and Eskdale. His grandfather, the Duke of Monmouth, was the illegitimate son of Charles II who raised a rebellion upon James II and VII's accession to the English, Scottish and Irish thrones, and was beheaded for it. Monmouth's noble titles were consequently forfeit, but in March 1743 two of those titles were restored to his progeny when the House of Lords passed a bill making Buccleuch the 2nd Earl of Doncaster, as well as 2nd Baron Scott of Tindall, both in the English peerage (conferred 22 March 1743).Journals of the House of Lords, vol. 26.  Career  In his youth he attended Eton College. Throughout his adult life Buccleuch associated himself with institutions that promoted learning. He was a freemason, member of the Grand Lodge at a period when scientific interests figured prominently in its pursuits.Carpenter, Audrey T. John Theophilus Desaguliers: A Natural Philosopher, Engineer and Freemason in Newtonian England. London: Continuum International, 2011.

His interest at the court of George I was sufficient for him to be invested as a Knight of the Thistle on 2February 1725. In 1734 he entered the House of Lords when he was elected a Scottish representative peer. In 1740 and 1741, however, he signed protests produced by the opposition, including the November 1741 protest calling for the removal of Sir Robert Walpole from office.Cobbett, William.

It is no surprise that Buccleuch in turn lost the support of the administration at the Scottish peers election of 1741 and consequently failed to be re-elected. He would, nonetheless, return to the House of Lords when he became Earl of Doncaster in 1743.  Personal life  Dalkeith Palace Bowhill House Buccleuch married, firstly, Lady Jane Douglas, daughter of James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry, and Mary Boyle, on 5April 1720 in Earl of Rochester's House, Privy Gardens, Whitehall. They had two sons (Francis and Charles) and three daughters.\\"Buccleuch, Duke of.\\" Cracroft's Peerage. Heraldic, n.d. Web. 7 July 2014. Lady Jane died in 1729 and is buried at Dalkeith Castle. He married, secondly, Alice Powell, daughter of Joseph Powell, on 4September 1744 in St. George's Chapel, Mayfair, London, England. Both his sons predeceased him, so he was succeeded by his grandson Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, the son of Francis. According to his will, he had six other children by Sarah Atkinson. He also appears to have had a son and three daughters by Elizabeth Jenkins. He possessed several estates, some in Scotland and others in England. These included, in Scotland, Dalkeith Palace and Bowhill House (which he bought for his son Charles in 1747), and in England, Spalding in Lincolnshire, Langley in Berkshire and Hall Place at Hurley. Buccleuch was buried on 26 April 1751 in Eton College Chapel. Lady Louisa Stuart called him \\"a man of mean understanding and meaner habits\\", and added that after his first wife's death \\"he plunged into such low amours, and lived so entirely with the lowest company, that his person was scarcely known to his equals, and his character fell into utter contempt.\\" Though a distant kinswoman by marriage and therefore privy to family remembrances of Buccleuch, Stuart's judgment must be treated with caution; she had no first-hand knowledge of the man, having not yet been born at the time of his death.

The design of the congregation was based on the spirituality of the Society of Jesus. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet became a separate congregation of pontifical right on May 16, 1877. History In 1834 Most Rev. Joseph Rosati, Bishop of St. Louis, Missouri asked Mother St. John Fontbonne, the superior of the Sisters of St. Joseph at Lyon, to send some sisters to America to undertake instruction of deaf-mute children. Felicite‚Äô Duras, Countess de la Roche Jacquelin, offered to defray expenses. On 17 January 1836 the first six sisters set sail from Le Havre, France on the ship Natchez. After seven weeks at sea, they arrived in New Orleans March 5, where they were met by Bishop Rosati and Rev. John Timon, the later Bishop of Buffalo. Rosati had arranged for them to stay with the Ursuline Sisters in the city and met with them the next day. The sisters enjoyed the hospitality of the Ursulines for two weeks, learning much about life in the United States. The Ursulines told them to disguise their religious habit when going abroad and while traveling to St. Louis as there was anti-Catholic feeling among some residents.\\"History of the St. Louis province\\", Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Louis Province Escorted by Bishop Rosati, the sisters boarded the steamer, the George Collier, traveled up the Mississippi and reached St. Louis on 25 March 1836. Through Holy Week the sisters resided with the Sisters of Charity, who had a hospital near the Cathedral. On April 7, three of the sisters, accompanied by Bishop Rosati and Father Fontbonne, travelled by boat for Cahokia, Illinois, a former French colonial town, where they opened a school for French and Creole settlers at the request of a Vincentian missionary. On September 12, the remaining sisters settled in a log cabin in the village of Carondelet, about five miles south of the city of St. Louis. At the time the sisters arrived at St. Louis, this humble house was occupied by the Sisters of Charity, who cared for a few orphans there who were soon transferred to a new building. Many institutions have been started from the origin of these sisters and continue their good works. St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf, St. Joseph‚Äôs Academy; Fontbonne College, now Fontbonne University, all were founded by the sisters at the convent at Carondelet. In 1847 the first foundation outside St. Louis was made in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, followed shortly by foundations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1851); Hamilton, Ontario (1852); Wheeling, West Virginia (1853); and Canandaigua (1854); Flushing (Brentwood)(1856); Rochester; and Buffalo, all in New York state, which had received many Irish Catholic immigrants. In 1851 Bishop Joseph Cretin went to Carondelet to ask Mother Celestine to send the Sisters of St. Joseph to his new diocese in St. Paul, Minnesota; four sisters reached there by steamboat on 3 November. In 1853 Bishop John McCloskey of Albany, NY requested sisters for Cohoes, New York. On April 15, 1858, one German, one Irish, and two native-born sisters arrived by train in Oswego, New York in the midst of a snowstorm, to establish a school for Catholic immigrants. In 1869 the Flushing community sent three pioneer sisters to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania.Sisters of St. Joseph, Baden, Pennsylvania Because of the rapid growth of the institute and the increasing demand for sisters from all parts of the United States, the superiors of the community called a general chapter in May 1860, to which representatives from every congregational house in America were summoned. Mother St. John Facemaz was elected first superior general for a term of six years. Shortly afterward, she traveled to Rome to present a copy of the Constitution for Vatican approval. In September 1863, Pope Pius IX issued a degree of commendation. Final approbation was received, dated May 16, 1877. This approval established the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet as a congregation of pontifical right, and unified their communities in various dioceses with the mother-house at Carondelet (now part of St. Louis, Missouri).\\"Our History\\", Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet During the Civil War, the order sent nuns to serve as Army nurses. According to Civil War medical historian George Adams, Dorothea Dix, the head of Army nurses distrusted them; her anti-Catholicism undermined her ability to work with Catholic nurses, lay or religious.Barbra Mann Wall, \\"Called to a Mission of Charity: The Sisters of St. Joseph in the Civil War,\\" Nursing History Review (1998) Vol. 6, pp. 85‚Äì113Maher, Mary Denis. To Bind Up the Wounds, LSU Press, 1999, p. 128 In 1910 the congregation divided into four provinces. The Sisters are known for their work in education and health care, and their opposition to the death penalty. Present day The congregation is composed of almost 1,200 vowed sisters who minister in four provinces (Albany, New York; Los Angeles, California; St. Louis, Missouri and St. Paul, Minnesota) and a vice province in Peru. The Congregational Center is located in Sunset Hills, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Saint Louis, Missouri The St. Louis, Missouri Province comprises the houses of the congregation in the Archdioceses of St. Louis and Chicago, and the Dioceses of St. Joseph, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Peoria, Belleville, Alton, Denver, Marquette, Green Bay, Mobile, and the Diocese of Oklahoma. The Sisters of St. Joseph of Savannah were established at Savannah in 1867, in charge of the boys' orphanage, and soon afterward became an independent diocesan congregation. In 1876 the orphanage was transferred to Washington, Georgia, and with it the mother-house of the congregation. In 1912 the Sisters opened an academy for women in Augusta which became Mount Saint Joseph. They eventually moved the mother house to Augusta, Georgia. In 1922 the Sisters voted to incorporate themselves into the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, becoming the Augusta Province and became part of the St. Louis Province in 1961. In St. Louis, Missouri the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet St. Louis sponsor Saint Joseph Institute for the Deaf, Saint Joseph's Academy, Fontbonne University, and Ascension Health; and in Kansas City, Missouri, they sponsor Saint Teresa Academy and Avila University. Administration Center of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet & Consociates, St. Paul Province Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, St. Paul Province In 1851, four Sisters arrived in the village of St. Paul, Minnesota, to establish the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, St. Paul Province. A log cabin became the first site of Saint Joseph's Academy in early November 1851, a day and boarding school for girls. In 1853, in response to the cholera epidemic, the sisters turned the school into the first site of St. Joseph's Hospital, which was also the state of Minnesota's first hospital. The growth of the St. Paul congregation began with the entrance of its first postulants, Ellen Ireland and her cousin Ellen Howard, in the summer of 1858. By then the pattern of response to need had been firmly set with the opening of St. Joseph Academy in St. Paul, Long Prairie Indian Mission, St. Anthony's School in Minneapolis, and St. Joseph Hospital and Cathedral School in St. Paul. Orphans were taken care of in all these institutions. In 2016, the St. Paul Province celebrated its 175th year. Its ministries range from young adult spirituality to immigrant and refugee services.CSJ-St. Paul Through these ministries, St. Paul Sisters and Consociates strive to foster the common good through advocacy, creative arts, education, healthcare, social service, and spirituality. Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Albany Province Four young sisters arrived at the parish of St. Mary‚Äôs in Oswego, New York on April 15, 1858. Soon more sisters joined them and a day school was established, as well as an academy and a home for orphans. The Albany Province (formerly Troy, New York) is formed of the houses established in the Dioceses of Albany and Syracuse, New York. The Albany Province of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet founded and sponsor the College of St. Rose, Albany, New York, named in honor of St. Rose of Lima, the first canonized saint in the Americas. The Provincial House is in Latham, New York.CSJ -Albany Province Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Los Angeles Province Los Angeles is the youngest of the four provinces of the Congregation of St. Joseph of Carondelet. Santa Fe bishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, and the newly installed bishop of Tucson, Jean- Baptiste Salpointe, wrote to Carondelet in the late 1860s asking for sisters to establish a school in Tucson, Arizona. Seven Sisters began the long journey to the west in April 1870, traveling on the newly completed transcontinental railroad to San Francisco, by steamer to San Diego, and by covered wagon across the American Desert to Tucson, Arizona. Their first school, the future St. Joseph‚Äôs Academy, opened on June 6, 1870, eleven days after their arrival in Tucson. Ministries spread rapidly from this early beginning with schools opening in Arizona and California. By 1873, the Sisters had opened a school for the Papago Indians at San Xavier del Bac. Within a few years, they were ministering at Fort Yuma, St. Anthony‚Äôs in San Diego, St. Boniface School in Banning, and St. John‚Äôs Mission School in Komatke. When Bishop Salpointe opened St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital in Tucson in 1880, health care became an important part of the Sisters‚Äô ministry. Over the years, the Sisters sponsored and operated hospitals in Arizona, California, Washington, and Idaho until recent developments in health care led them to transfer ownership and sponsorship to a Catholic health system. As the majority of ministries increased in California, Los Angeles was selected as seat of the western province and established in 1903. Academies were established as early as 1882, Mount St. Mary‚Äôs College (now University) was founded in 1925, and Sisters were teaching in parish schools in five states. Work with the deaf, a treasured tradition since the first days in St. Louis, flourished for many years in Oakland and San Francisco. In 1925, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Lewiston, Idaho, joined the Carondelet congregation. In 2011, the Sisters of the Vice Province of Japan joined the Los Angeles Province as a region. From the first days in Arizona, education and health care merged naturally into other forms of care of the dear neighbor. Over the years, and especially after Vatican II, the Sisters‚Äô work has expanded and diversified, including parish service, adult education, spiritual direction and retreat work, direct service of the poor, and justice activities. In July 2017, the Hawaii Vice Province, erected in 1956, officially joined the Los Angeles Province. =Sponsored institutions:= Academy of Our Lady of Peace, San Diego; Carondelet High School, Concord, CA; St. Joseph High School, Lakewood, CA (philosophical sponsorship); St. Joseph Joshi Gakuen, Tsu, Japan; St. Mary‚Äôs Academy, Inglewood, CA; Mount St. Mary‚Äôs University, Los Angeles; St. Joseph Center, Venice, CA. =Selected province works:= A Friendly Manor, Alexandria House, Circle the City, Get on the Bus, House of Yahweh, Villa Maria House of Prayer. Peru Vice Province In 1962, the Sisters of St. Joseph responded to the request of Pope John XXIII that religious communities send ten percent of their members as missionaries to Latin America. Governance The superior general and four general councillors, elected every six years by the whole congregation, form the general governing body, assisted by a superior provincial and four provincial councillors in each province. The provincial officers are appointed by the general officers every three years, as are the local superiors of all the provinces. In each provincial house, as in the mother-house, a novitiate is established. The term of postulantship extends from three to six months, the term of novitiate two years, after which annual vows are taken for a period of five years, when perpetual vows are taken. All are received on the same footing, all enjoy the same privileges, and all are subject to the same obedience which assigns duties according to ability, talent, and aptitude. Although an interchange of members of the various provinces is allowed and made use of for general or particular needs, the autonomy of each province is safeguarded. The constitutions, while establishing on a solid basis the idea of a general government, allow no small share of local initiative and carefully provide for local needs. In this way too much centralization or peril to establishments working in accordance with local and special exigencies is guarded against.

Jos√© Duarte Ramalho Ortig√£o () (24 October 1836 ‚Äì 27 September 1915) was a Portuguese writer of the late 19th century and early 20th century. Biography Ortig√£o spent his early years with his maternal grandmother in Porto. He studied law in the University of Coimbra but he did not complete his studies. After returning to his home town, he taught French at a college run by his father. Among his students was E√ßa de Queiroz. In 1862 he dedicated himself to journalism and became a literary critic at the Di√°rio do Porto and contributed to several literary magazines. At this period Romanticism was the dominant trend in Portuguese literature, led by several major writers including Camilo Castelo Branco and Ant√≥nio Augusto Soares de Passos, who influenced Ortig√£o. In the 1870s, a group of students from Coimbra began to promote new ideas in a reaction against romanticism. This group, eventually called the 70s Generation, was to have a major influence on Portuguese literature. As a supporter of romanticism, Ortig√£o became involved in a struggle against them and even fought a duel with Antero de Quental. In spite of this early opposition he afterwards became friendly with some members of the group. It was at this period that he wrote The Mystery of the Sintra Road and created the satirical journal As Farpas, both in collaboration with E√ßa de Queiroz. When Queiroz became a diplomat, initially in Cuba, Ortig√£o continued As Farpas alone. Ortig√£o also worked as a translator. In 1874 he produced a Portuguese translation of the English satirical novel Ginx's Baby by Edward Jenkins. Ramalho Ortig√£o died in Lisbon on 27 September 1915.

Instead, animated shorts of this series aired on the two animation anthology showcases, Cartoon Network's What a Cartoon! and Nickelodeon's Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Summary The original Mina and the Count pilot short, \\"Interlude with a Vampire,\\" premiered on the What a Cartoon! show on Cartoon Network in November 5, 1995, making it the only short to be featured on both creator- guided short projects guided by Fred Seibert. The short was about a seven- year-old girl named Mina Harper (a play on Dracula character Mina Harker) and her encounters with Vlad, a 700-year-old vampire one night while she is sleeping (Vlad had accidentally found her when he was looking for \\"Nina Parker,\\" another reference to the Dracula character). The aforementioned further episodes concerned the vampire, known simply as Vlad the Count, his best friend Mina, her older sister Lucy, school bully Nick, Lucy and Mina's father Mr. Harper, a handful of monsters and Vlad's disapproving servant Igor. Everything seems to occur in a little town in North America where Mina's school and house is, including the Count's castle. Cast and characters * Ashley Johnson ‚Äì Wilhelmina \\"Mina\\" Harper: A 7-year-old girl with thick long red hair in a ponytail and red clothes. She likes to go to school and to play with her toys, and she doesn't get along with her sister Lucy. She meets Vlad one night and they become best friends. At school, Nick the school bully picks on her. The squeamish Martha is probably her only human friend. Mina knows how to cook, but unfortunately for Vlad, doesn't know that vampires find garlic hazardous. * Jeff Bennett ‚Äì Igor: Vlad's Quasimodo-like servant who wears sandals and green clothes and always has a maniacal laugh. He loathes Mina because she turned Vlad into a loving man, though he still tries to do what is best for his master. He hates kisses, hugs, love and everything near to it. In his free time, he likes to watch television. * Mark Hamill ‚Äì Vlad the Count: A 700-year-old immortal vampire with light blue skin and a blue cape and a black suit. In his past, he made a living drinking young women's blood. Thanks to Mina, he represses his evil tendencies. Vlad has many powers, including the abilities to transform into a bat or mist, use telekinesis, and to hypnotize people and animals to do his bidding. He finds comics and toys amusing and is very intelligent. Vlad believes that human food is disgusting. * Michael Bell ‚Äì Mr. Harper: Lucy and Mina's strict yet loving father with black hair. He is unaware that Vlad is a vampire. He initially believes he is a life-size doll with odd body odor. Later, he believes the Count is Mina's violin teacher and has him over for dinner. He is polite, but bemused by the Count's behavior and dismisses him as a \\"crazy European.\\" * Candi Milo ‚Äì Lucille \\"Lucy\\" Harper: Mina's older sister with long blonde hair. She has a boyfriend named Bobby, who doesn't appear much. She also has a crush on Vlad, and Lucy doesn't know that he's a vampire. Lucy doesn't get along with Mina, but deep down she cares about her little sister. Episodes Note: The original pilot aired on What a Cartoon!, and the rest were animated shorts that aired on Oh Yeah! Cartoons.

The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel was a hermaphrodite. The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan. It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as \\"insulting\\" by a national intersex education group. Plot Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey that she won't be cooking a turkey because of Will's, Chandler's, Rachel's and Phoebe's aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach. Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel, who he hated in high school because of her bullying him, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he ‚Äì and Ross ‚Äì founded the \\"I Hate Rachel\\" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status, and that they're having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn't going to marry her. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. Despite being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie. Production It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.Wild, p.226 When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals. Reception As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: \\"Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self- consciousness ‚Äì despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.\\" His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was \\"definitely ... going against type\\"Wild, p.229 and Matt LeBlanc called him \\"really great on the show\\". USA Today rates Will's line \\"Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates\\" one of the best of the episode. The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode \\"ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional\\". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes. Primetime Emmy Award nominations Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.

Towards the end of the 2010s deep learning artificial intelligence has been applied to synthesize images and video that look like humans, without need for human assistance, once the training phase has been completed, whereas the old school 7D-route required massive amounts of human work.  Timeline of human image synthesis  * In 1971 Henri Gouraud made the first CG geometry capture and representation of a human face. Modeling was his wife Sylvie Gouraud. The 3D model was a simple wire-frame model and he applied the Gouraud shader he is most known for to produce the first known representation of human-likeness on computer (view images). * The 1972 short film A Computer Animated Hand by Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke was the first time that computer-generated imagery was used in film to simulate moving human appearance. The film featured a computer simulated hand and face (watch film here). * The 1976 film Futureworld reused parts of A Computer Animated Hand on the big screen. * The 1983 music video for song Musique Non-Stop by German band Kraftwerk aired in 1986. Created by the artist Rebecca Allen, it features non-realistic looking, but clearly recognizable computer simulations of the band members. * The 1994 film The Crow was the first film production to make use of digital compositing of a computer simulated representation of a face onto scenes filmed using a body double. Necessity was the muse as the actor Brandon Lee portraying the protagonist was tragically killed accidentally on-stage. * In 1999 Paul Debevec et al. of USC captured the reflectance field of a human face with their first version of a light stage. They presented their method at the SIGGRAPH 2000 Bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function * In 2003 audience debut of photo realistic human-likenesses in the 2003 films The Matrix Reloaded in the burly brawl sequence where up-to-100 Agent Smiths fight Neo and in The Matrix Revolutions where at the start of the end showdown Agent Smith's cheekbone gets punched in by Neo leaving the digital look-alike unnaturally unhurt.

Bruce Lawmen was scanned using USC light stage 6 in still position and also recorded running there on a treadmill. Many, many digital look-alikes of Bruce are seen running fluently and natural looking at the ending sequence of the TED talk video.

The digital look-alikes were made in conjunction with Sogou. Neither the speech synthesis used nor the gesturing of the digital look-alike anchors were good enough to deceive the watcher to mistake them for real humans imaged with a TV camera. * In September 2018 Google added ‚Äúinvoluntary synthetic pornographic imagery‚Äù to its ban list, allowing anyone to request the search engine block results that falsely depict them as ‚Äúnude or in a sexually explicit situation.‚Äù * In February 2019 Nvidia open sources StyleGAN, a novel generative adversarial network. Right after this Phillip Wang made the website ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com with StyleGAN to demonstrate that unlimited amounts of often photo-realistic looking facial portraits of no-one can be made automatically using a GAN.

(view full film In Event of Moon Disaster at Youtube.com)  Key breakthrough to photorealism: reflectance capture  spherical light stage with multi-camera setup around the sphere suitable for capturing into a 7D reflectance model. In 1999 Paul Debevec et al. of USC did the first known reflectance capture over the human face with their extremely simple light stage. They presented their method and results in SIGGRAPH 2000. Bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF) for human skin likeness requires both BRDF and special case of BTDF where light enters the skin, is transmitted and exits the skin. The scientific breakthrough required finding the subsurface light component (the simulation models are glowing from within slightly) which can be found using knowledge that light that is reflected from the oil-to-air layer retains its polarization and the subsurface light loses its polarization. So equipped only with a movable light source, movable video camera, 2 polarizers and a computer program doing extremely simple math and the last piece required to reach photorealism was acquired. For a believable result both light reflected from skin (BRDF) and within the skin (a special case of BTDF) which together make up the BSDF must be captured and simulated.  Capture  three-dimensional scanner. * The 3D geometry and textures are captured onto a 3D model by a 3D reconstruction method, such as sampling the target by means of 3D scanning with an RGB XYZ scanner such as Arius3d or Cyberware (textures from photos, not pure RGB XYZ scanner), stereophotogrammetrically from synchronized photos or even from enough repeated non-simultaneous photos. Digital sculpting can be used to make up models of the body parts for which data cannot be acquired e.g. parts of the body covered by clothing. * For believable results also the reflectance field must be captured or an approximation must be picked from the libraries to form a 7D reflectance model of the target.  Synthesis  The whole process of making digital look-alikes i.e. characters so lifelike and realistic that they can be passed off as pictures of humans is a very complex task as it requires photorealistically modeling, animating, cross-mapping, and rendering the soft body dynamics of the human appearance. Synthesis with an actor and suitable algorithms is applied using powerful computers. The actor's part in the synthesis is to take care of mimicking human expressions in still picture synthesizing and also human movement in motion picture synthesizing. Algorithms are needed to simulate laws of physics and physiology and to map the models and their appearance, movements and interaction accordingly. Often both physics/physiology based (i.e. skeletal animation) and image-based modeling and rendering are employed in the synthesis part. Hybrid models employing both approaches have shown best results in realism and ease-of-use. Morph target animation reduces the workload by giving higher level control, where different facial expressions are defined as deformations of the model, which facial allows expressions to be tuned intuitively. Morph target animation can then morph the model between different defined facial expressions or body poses without much need for human intervention. Using displacement mapping plays an important part in getting a realistic result with fine detail of skin such as pores and wrinkles as small as 100 ¬µm. Machine learning approach In the late 2010s, machine learning, and more precisely generative adversarial networks (GAN), were used by NVIDIA to produce random yet photorealistic human-like portraits. The system, named StyleGAN, was trained on a database of 70,000 images from the images depository website Flickr. The source code was made public on GitHub in 2019. Outputs of the generator network from random input were made publicly available on a number of websites StyleGAN public showcase website. Similarly, since 2018, deepfake technology has allowed GANs to swap faces between actors; combined with the ability to fake voices, GANs can thus generate fake videos that seem convincing.  Applications  Main applications fall within the domains of stock photography, synthetic datasets, virtual cinematography, computer and video games and covert disinformation attacks. Furthermore, some research suggests that it can have therapeutic effects as \\"psychologists and counselors have also begun using avatars to deliver therapy to clients who have phobias, a history of trauma, addictions, Asperger‚Äôs syndrome or social anxiety.\\" The strong memory imprint and brain activation effects caused by watching a digital look-alike avatar of yourself is dubbed the doppelg√§nger effect. The doppelg√§nger effect can heal when covert disinformation attack is exposed as such to the targets of the attack.  Related issues  The speech synthesis has been verging on being completely indistinguishable from a recording of a real human's voice since the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google. Ability to steal and manipulate other peoples voices raises obvious ethical concerns. At the 2018 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) researchers from Google presented the work 'Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis', which transfers learning from speaker verification to achieve text-to-speech synthesis, that can be made to sound almost like anybody from a speech sample of only 5 seconds (listen).

Analogous to water softener salt, dishwasher salt regenerates ion exchange resins, expelling the therein trapped calcium and magnesium ions that characterize hard water. Dishwater salt granules are larger than those of table salt. The granule size ensures that the salt dissolves slowly, and that fine particles do not block the softener unit. In some countries, especially those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water. Dishwasher salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to regenerate the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit. Unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not contain added anticaking agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may contain added iodine in the form of sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to the dishwasher's water softening unit can damage it. If a dishwasher has a built-in water softener there will be a special compartment inside the dishwasher where the salt is to be added when needed. This salt compartment is separate from the detergent compartment, and generally located at the bottom of the wash cabinet (this is below the bottom basket). On most dishwashers, an automatic sensing system will notify the user when more dishwasher salt is required. If the dishwasher has run out of the salt that regenerates the ion exchange resin that softens the water, and the water supply is \\"hard\\", limescale deposits can appear on all items, but are especially visible on glassware.

It was assembled at the Puerto Cabello shipyard by Engineer Tom√°s Pacanins. First displayed at a military parade in the city of Maracay, the vehicle's existence was meant to send a clear message to neighboring Colombia - which had created several border and political incidents since its victory over Per√∫ in the War of the Putumayo - as was the whole parade. On December 23, 1934, the Tortuga was first revealed to the public, in conjunction with two Italian Ansaldo CV 33 infantry tanks. Characteristics In his \\"Historia de la Artiller√≠a\\" (History of Artillery), Lieutenant Pedro Arturo Oma√±a describes the Tortuga: \\"It was a very flashy armored car - whose external shell gave it a shape similar to a London policeman's hat - but it was hard to manoeuver, with a nearly null ventilation system and nearly null visibility\\" Its shell was mounted on a 6x4 Ford 1934 truck. Its rear wheels were linked by treads, making it a half-tracked vehicle, its designation within the Army being \\"Semi-treaded Armored Recon Vehicle\\". It was armed with a Mark 4B 7 mm machine gun (.303 cal) installed in a dome-shaped rotating turret located on the upper part of the shell.

It was the first SUV to be designed and produced in India. In export market the Sierra was sold as Tata Sport, Tata Telcosport and Tata Grand Telcosport.  History  The Tata Sierra was introduced in 1991 and is the first off-road Sport Utility vehicle produced by the Indian company; in reality the Sierra is the \\"closed\\" version of the Tata Telcoline pick-up originally launched in 1988 from which it takes all the mechanical parts, the front and the internal dashboard. The differences are in the shortened wheelbase at 2.40 meters (compared to the single-cab Telcoline). The Sierra was also one of the first cars for private transport in India and, being built on the Tata platform X2 with side members and crossbars, could be used on every road surface, especially the uneven ones being proposed both rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive with reduced marches. Compared to the Telcoline, soundproofing has been improved, making the interior more comfortable. The body of the Sierra is three-door, similar to that of many Japanese competitors (such as Nissan Terrano, Mitsubishi Pajero and Toyota Land Cruiser Prado), the total length of the body is 4.41 meters, rear-wheel drive or 4WD full-time part-time with grafting system electrically controlled up to 60 km/h, equipped with gearbox on all ratios, self-locking rear differential and front hubs with manual locking/unlocking; the suspensions are the same as those of the Telcoline with an oscillating double trapezoidal front axle and a rear axle with a rigid bridge layout with five pulling arms and coil springs. The engine was the same as the Telcoline: the 2.0-liter (1,948 cc) four-cylinder diesel Peugeot XD88 naturally aspirated manufactured under license by Tata Motors in India with two valves per cylinder and indirect injection with pre-chamber and 63 horsepower. The gearbox is a G76 5-speed manual. The cockpit was available only for four seats. The Sierra will also be the first car produced in India with electric windows, air conditioning, adjustable steering wheel and tachometer. Evolution In April 1998 Tata introduce the new turbocharged version of the Peugeot XD88 2,0 litre diesel engine; the new engine is omologated Euro 2 and have a max output of 87 horsepower. The Sierra, however, unlike the Telcoline is not a great success, neither in India nor in foreign markets, and in 2000 it comes out of production replaced by Tata Safari, larger and more modern and proposed with five doors. The Sierra in Europe In Europe (especially in Spain, France, Germany and Italy), the Sierra was imported from 1994 under the name Tata Sport or Tata Telcosport) in a single version with the 2.0L diesel engine Euro 2 in the rear wheel drive variant, while the 4x4 will be added in April 1998 proposed with the 2.0L turbodiesel. With the introduction of turbodiesel engine the name was changed in Tata Grand Telcosport in more market like Spain. In Italy the Sierra was sold as a Tata Sport in two versions: base and Orciari , the latter exclusive for Italy was made by the Italian designer Orciari and featured an enriched endowment, two- tone bodywork, roof bars and specific interior finishes.

His 1667 treatise, developed around 1630 and known in the original Ge'ez language as the Hatata (Inquiry), has been compared to Ren√© Descartes' Discours de la m√©thode (1637). Many of his ideas predate similar ideas described by European philosophers during the Age of Enlightenment, the latter of whom form the basis of the Western canon, while Yacob remains comparatively obscure to this day. For centuries, Ge'ez texts had been written in Ethiopia. Around 1510, Abba Mikael translated and adapted the Arabic Book of the Wise Philosophers, a collection of sayings from the early Greek Pre-Socratics, Plato, and Aristotle via the neo-Platonic dialogues, also influenced by Arab philosophy and the Ethiopian discussions. Zera Yacob's Inquiry goes further than these former texts, as he argues in following one's natural reasoning instead of believing what one is told by others. He was a contemporary of the female activist Walatta Petros, whose biography was written 1672. Biography 17th-century church in Axum Yacob was born into a farmer family near Aksum in northern Ethiopia, the former capital of Ethiopia under the ancient Kingdom of Aksum. Yacob's name means \\"The Seed of Jacob\\" (\\"Zar\\" is the Ge'ez word for \\"seed\\"). Although his father was poor, he supported Yacob's attendance of traditional schools, where he became acquainted with the Psalms of David and educated in the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian faith. He was denounced before Emperor Susenyos (r. 1607‚Äì1632), who had turned to the Roman Catholic faith and ordered his subjects to follow his own example. Refusing to adopt the Catholic faith, Yacob fled into exile with some gold and the Book of Psalms. On the road to Shewa in the south, he found a cave at the foot of the Tekez√© River and lived in it as a hermit for two years, praying and developing his philosophy. He wrote of his experience, \\"I have learnt more while living alone in a cave than when I was living with scholars. What I wrote in this book is very little; but in my cave I have meditated on many other such things.\\" After the death of the Emperor, Susenyos's son Fasiledes (r. 1632‚Äì1667), a firm adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, took power, expelling the Jesuits, and extirpated the Catholic faith in his kingdom in 1633. Yacob left his cave and settled in Emfraz. He found a patron, a rich merchant named Habta Egziabher (known as Habtu), and married a maid of the family. He refused to live as a monk and stated that \\"the law of Christians which propounds the superiority of monastic life over marriage is false and can‚Äôt come from God.\\" However, he also rejected polygamy because \\"the law of creation orders one man to marry one woman.\\" Yacob became the teacher of Habtu's two sons, and at the request of his patron's son Walda Heywat, Yacob wrote his famous 1667 treatise investigating the light of reason. Philosophical work Yacob is most noted for this ethical philosophy surrounding the principle of harmony. He purported that an action's morality is decided by whether it advances or degrades overall harmony in the world. While he did believe in a deity, whom he referred to as God, he rejected any set of particular religious beliefs. Rather than deriving beliefs from any organized religion, Yacob sought the truth in observing the natural world. In Hatata, Yacob applied the idea of a first cause to produce a proof for the existence of God, thus proposing a cosmological argument in chapter 3 of Hatata: \\"If I say that my father and my mother created me, then I must search for the creator of my parents and of the parents of my parents until they arrive at the first who were not created as we [are] but who came into this world in some other way without being generated.\\" However, the knowability of God does not depend on human intellect, but \\"Our soul has the power of having the concept of God and of seeing him mentally. God did not give this power purposelessly; as he gave the power, so did he give the reality.\\" Yacob put universal-argument against discrimination, predating John Locke by decades, in chapter 6 of Hatata, starting the chapter with: \\"All men are equal in the presence of God; and all are intelligent since they are his creatures; he did not assign one people for life, another for death, one for mercy, another for judgment. Our reason teaches us that this sort of discrimination cannot exist.\\" In chapter 5 of Hatata, he criticizes the religious argument for slavery saying, \\"what the Gospel says on this subject cannot come from God. Likewise the Mohammedans said that it is right to go and buy a man as if he were an animal. But with our intelligence, we understand that this Mohammedan law cannot come from the creator of man who made us equal, like brothers, so that we call our creator our father\\" Little is known of Yacob's later life. However, it is believed that he lived a fulfilled family life in Emfraz, and remained there for the next 25 years. He died there in 1692. Yacob's year of death was recorded by Walda Heywat in an annotation to the Treatise.

Oval Maidan in 1875 History Until the early 20th century the vast expanses of the Oval Maidan, Azad Maidan, Cooperage Ground and Cross Maidan formed the area known as Esplanade. Until the late 20th century the ground was owned and run by the state government and was very poorly maintained. It was frequented by beggars, prostitutes and drug peddlers. Finally, in 1997 the Oval-Cooperage Residents Association (OCRA) was formed as a public charitable trust set up by the residents of the area. OCRA petitioned the Maharashtra government to maintain the Oval maidan. The Maharashtra government did not respond to the petition, leading the group to take it to the Mumbai High Court. The Court ruled in their favour, forcing the government to either maintain the maidan or hand it over to OCRA which it subsequently did. The OCRA then went about fencing the ground and building a jogging course around the periphery. A lane which cut through the diameter of the ground was metalled to facilitate a smoother thoroughfare.

It stars Peter Cushing, Shane Briant and David Prowse. Filmed at Elstree Studios in 1972 but not released until 1974, it was the final chapter in the Hammer Frankenstein saga of films as well as director Fisher's last film. The film was released on UK DVD+Blu-ray on 28 April 2014, with all previously censored scenes restored. Plot Baron Victor Frankenstein (Cushing), having survived the fire at the end of the end of the previous film, is housed at an insane asylum where he has been made a surgeon, and has a number of privileges, as he holds secret information on Adolf Klauss, the asylum's corrupt and perverted director (John Stratton). The Baron, under the alias of Dr. Carl Victor, uses his position to continue his experiments in the creation of man. When Simon Helder (Briant), a young doctor and an admirer of the Baron's work, arrives as an inmate for the crime of ‚ÄòSorcery‚Äô bodysnatching, the Baron is impressed by Helder's talents and takes him under his wing as an apprentice. Together they work on the design for a new creature. Unknown to Simon, however, Frankenstein is acquiring body parts by murdering his patients. The Baron's new experiment is the hulking, ape-like Herr Schneider (Prowse), a homicidal inmate whom he has kept alive after a violent suicide attempt and on whom he has grafted the hands of a recently deceased sculptor (Bernard Lee). Since Frankenstein's hands were badly burned in the fire, the shabby stitch-work was done by Sarah (Madeline Smith), a beautiful mute girl who assists the surgeon, and who is nicknamed \\"Angel\\". Simon tells the Baron that he is a surgeon and the problem is solved. The Baron reveals that Sarah is the daughter of the director and has been mute ever since he tried to rape her. Soon new eyes and a new brain are given to the creature. When the creature ‚Äì lumbering, hirsute and dumb ‚Äì is complete, it becomes bitter and intent on revenge. It ultimately runs mad on a killing spree in the asylum, killing several individuals, including Klauss. Eventually, it is fully overpowered and destroyed by a mob of inmates. Simon is devastated by the loss of life and reports to Frankenstein; however, the Baron feels that it was the best that could happen to such a creature, and is already considering a new experiment with other involuntary donors.

Cushing had long been known throughout his career for his meticulous attention to detail, even in the planned handling and usage of props. For this film, he helped to design the wig that he wore, but years afterward regretted the outcome, and apparently quipped that it made him look like the American stage and screen star Helen Hayes (though he may have actually been referring to the British actress Helen Haye, who Cushing had known and worked with earlier in his career). But Cushing's dedication to his role was never truly dampened, and at age 59, looking somewhat gaunt and fragile, he still insisted upon performing a daring stunt which required him to leap from a tabletop onto the hulking creature's back, spinning wildly in circles to subdue the monster gone amok with a sedative. David Prowse makes his second appearance as a Frankenstein laboratory creation in this film, his first having been in The Horror of Frankenstein. He is the only actor to have played a Hammer Frankenstein's monster more than once. During the DVD commentary session for this movie, Prowse said that his daily transformation into \\"the Monster from Hell\\" went fairly quickly, being able to suit up and pull on the mask in only about 30 minutes ‚Äì whereas his time in the make-up chair for his previous Hammer monster role typically required several tedious hours. Prowse and Cushing later costarred in 1977's Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope as Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin, respectively.  Critical reception  Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell has received a mixed reception from critics. Of the film, The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films wrote: \\"Terence Fisher's haunting, melancholy swansong would be an epitaph for Hammer horror itself.\\" Time Out wrote, \\"Fisher's last film is a disappointment.\\" The film itself performed poorly at the box office. Despite this, the film currently holds an average 3 star rating (6.3/10) on IMDb and has fared better with modern critics. It was released in certain markets as a double feature with another Hammer film, Captain Kronos ‚Äì Vampire Hunter.

He was capped once for England. Temple was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, and came through Everton's junior sides to make his first-team debut at centre-forward on 30 March 1957. He moved to inside forward later that year and linked up well with Dave Hickson, but the partnership was broken up when Temple was called up for his National Service. Harry Catterick moved Temple to the left wing in 1961, and during his first season in this position he scored 10 goals in 17 games. He missed out on a league winner's medal the next season, sidelined by a cartilage operation, but recovered to play in the 1963 FA Charity Shield. Temple scored the late winner in Everton's 3‚Äì2 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday in the 1966 FA Cup Final. In his Everton career he made 272 appearances (one as substitute) scoring 82 goals (72 League, 8 FA Cup and 2 in Europe). Temple was transferred to Preston North End for in 1967 for a ¬£35,000 fee. He made 76 league appearances for Preston, scoring 14 goals. He joined Wigan Athletic for ¬£4,000 in the summer of 1970.

Background Multiple Access, a company incorporated under the Canada Corporations ActR.S.C. 1970, c. C-32 made an offer to acquire the broadcasting assets of Canadian Marconi Limited, which was accepted. Two shareholders of Multiple Access applied to the Ontario courts to have the Ontario Securities Commission commence an action against several directors and officers of the company for insider trading under the Ontario Securities Act.R.S.O. 1970, c. 426 In its defence, the company argued that the provisions of the provincial Act were inoperative under the paramountcy doctrine as it overlapped with insider trading provisions in the Canada Corporations Act. The courts below At first instance, Henry J in Weekly Court held the provincial provisions in question were valid and still in effect. He stated that when a provincial and federal statute have both occupied a field the test that gives rise to the doctrine of paramountcy is whether the two statutes can ‚Äúlive together and operate concurrently‚Äù. The doctrine of paramountcy does not necessarily arise because an individual is subject to prohibition and penalty under both statutes at the same time. The Divisional Court reversed. Morden J, speaking for the Court, held that the constitutional doctrine of paramountcy operates so as to invalidate provincial legislation where it duplicates valid federal legislation in such a way that the two provisions cannot live together and operate concurrently. Where the federal and provincial provisions are virtually identical, are directed to achieving the same policy and creating the same rights and obligations, the duplication attracts the doctrine of paramountcy. On appeal, the Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the Divisional Court ruling. At the Supreme Court of Canada The issues before the Supreme Court were: # whether ss. 100.4 and 100.5 of the Canada Corporations Act are ultra vires Parliament in whole or in part; # whether ss. 113 and 114 of the Securities Act are ultra vires the Legislature of Ontario in whole or in part, and # if both are intra vires, whether ss. 113 and 114 of the Ontario Act are suspended and inoperative by reason of the doctrine of paramountcy. Dickson J, for the majority, held that both Acts were valid, and the doctrine of paramountcy did not apply. Dickson first considered the nature of provisions relating to insider trading, and found that they could fall under either securities law or company law. As that could then fall under either federal or provincial jurisdiction, he noted: Dickson examined the Securities Act using the Lederman approach of judicial review, which states: He found that the Act was valid under the provincial authority over matters of property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. He then considered the federal Act, which he found to be valid under the federal powers relating to trade and commerce as well as peace, order and good government. Dickson then considered whether there was a conflict between the two Acts. He found that there was no conflict. The laws duplicated each other and had the same legislative objective. There is no problem with laws operating concurrently, Dickson argued. Mere duplication without actual conflict or contradiction is not sufficient to invoke the doctrine of paramountcy and render otherwise valid provincial legislation inoperative. Instead, there must be an actual conflict between the laws where compliance with one law will necessarily violate the other. However, any claimant seeking action under the Securities Act will be able to successfully use only one.

December 5, 2009. and Executive Director of the Green Science Policy Institute. Early life Blum was born in Davenport, Iowa, and raised from the age of five on in Chicago by her Orthodox Jewish mother and grandparents. In the early 1960s, she attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Her first climb was in Washington, where she failed to reach the summit of Mount Adams. However, she persevered, climbing throughout her college days. She was rejected from an Afghanistan expedition in 1969, with its leader writing to her, \\"One woman and nine men would seem to me to be unpleasant high on the open ice, not only in excretory situations but in the easy masculine companionship which is so vital a part of the joy of an expedition.\\" In 1970, she requested to join a high altitude expedition, but was told that she was welcome to come as far as the base camp to \\"help with the cooking.\\"http://jwa.org/blog/climb-every-mountain However, she was able to go climbing as part of her research for her senior thesis, which was on the topic of volcanic gases on Oregon's Mount Hood. Blum was graduated from Reed in 1966 and attended MIT and UC Berkeley, where she earned a PhD in biophysical chemistry in 1971. After graduate school, Blum embarked on what she called the \\"endless winter\\" ‚Äì spending more than a year climbing peaks all over the world. Major climbs As deputy leader, Blum was part of the first all-woman team to ascend Alaska's Mount Denali in 1970. She participated in a 1976 expedition up Mount Everest as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition, but did not reach the summit. In 1978, she organized a team of eleven women to climb the tenth highest mountain in the world, Annapurna (I) in Nepal which, until then, had been climbed by only eight people (all men). It was called American Women's Himalayan Expeditions ‚Äì Annapurna. They raised money for the trip in part by selling T-shirts with the slogan \\"A woman's place is on top\\". The first summit team, comprising Vera Komarkova and Irene Miller (now Beardsley) and Sherpas Mingma Tsering and Chewang Ringjing, reached the top at 3:30 p.m. on October 15, 1978. The second summit team, Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz and Vera Watson, died during this climb. After the event, Blum wrote a book about her experience on Annapurna, called Annapurna: A Woman's Place.Blum, Arlene, Annapurna: A Woman's Place (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1980) She led the first expedition to climb Bhrigupanth in the Indian Himalayas, leading a team of Indian and American women. She then attempted what she called the \\"Great Himalayan Traverse\\", a two-thousand-mile journey across the treacherous but beautiful peaks of the Himalayas from Bhutan to India. She crossed the Alps from Yugoslavia to France, bearing her baby Annalise on her back in a backpack. Science policy work As a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1970s, Blum's research contributed to the regulation of two cancer-causing chemicals used as flame retardants on children's sleepwear.CPSC Bans TRIS- Treated Children's Garments Blum taught at Stanford University, Wellesley College, and the University of California, Berkeley. After a long hiatus, Blum returned to science and policy work in 2006‚Äîwhen her daughter started college‚Äîand her memoir Breaking Trail: A Climbing Life () was published. She discovered that the same Tris her research had helped remove from children's pajamas was back in California couches and baby products.The New York Times: Chemical Suspected in Cancer Is in Baby Products In 2007 Blum co-founded the Green Science Policy Institute (GSP)Green Science Policy Institute (GSP) with the goal of bringing scientific research results into policy decisions to protect human health and the environment from toxic chemicals. As executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, Blum and her team have led several successful national and international campaigns against the use of toxic chemicals, particularly halogenated flame retardants. Blum has published articles about science policy in The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Huffington Post, and Science magazine.

Hosted by Peter Pek and Chan Boon Yong, the show is directed by award-winning director Ng Ping Ho of Kopitiam fame. In The Firm, a group of professionals compete in an elimination-style competition to find the next corporate high-flyer. The show attempts to separate the weak from the strong, the under-achievers from the over-achievers and the followers from the leaders. Each week, candidates compete in a series of tasks dealing with different disciplines in business that is imperative to the success of a corporate high-flier. Amongst others, these include branding, promotions, positioning and catering to target markets. The catch phrase used in the show is \\"You're terminated\\". The show premi√®red prime time on ntv7 and Astro channel 7 on 24 June 2007. Although the show initially drew comparisons to Mark Burnett's The Apprentice, it became quite apparent that it is quite different in that there are two corporate leaders who lead each team and decide who gets eliminated when their team fails to win a challenge. In addition, in episode 7, both corporate leaders leave their jobs as mentors to the teams and a new CEO enters the picture. The Firm has reached its second season, which premi√®red on ntv7 and Astro 107 on 2 August 2008. Hosts/Judges The Firm has two corporate leaders, and a CEO, who all judge the candidates at different stages: * Peter Pek: renowned brand guru, writer, columnist, editor, publisher, designer, creative director, public speaker, and head of Malaysia's largest branding agency, Mercatus+. * Chan Boon Yong: entrepreneur and founder of The Carat Club, a diamond retailer. * Tengku Zafrul Aziz: CEO of CIMB Investment Banking. History Season 1 Season one of the Firm premiered on Malaysian television on 24 June 2007, featuring ten aspiring entrepreneurs divided into two teams, Dynamic and Momentum, led by Pek and Chan respectively, vying for a top position in \\"the Firm\\", which turned out to be a job offer in Tune Money, among other prizes. Tengku Zafrul's identity remained undisclosed for the earlier half of the season until the remaining contestants merge in the run-up to the finale. The grand prize fell in the hands of Joel Neoh Eu-Jin, who is now known for pioneering \\"youth entrepreneurship\\". Season 2 Season two premiered on 2 August 2008, in which fourteen aspiring entrepreneurs vie for the position of Assistant CEO in \\"The Firm\\", again divided into two teams ‚Äì Equity and Asset, led by Pek and Chan respectively. Azti Dian Fitri Azmi, a 31-year-old publications manager emerged the winner. She took home a cash prize worth $100,000 and a job contract to work for Tune Money.

The Shelby Cobra concept is a roadster inspired by the original AC Cobra that AC Cars developed in 1961. Development and design Ford's Advanced Product Creation team designed and built the Shelby Cobra concept in five months. The project was led by Manfred Rumpel. Like several other Ford vehicles developed in the early 2000s (such as the GT40 concept, the GT and the fifth-generation Mustang), the Shelby Cobra concept is a modern interpretation of an older vehicle. In the case of the Shelby Cobra, the design is reminiscent of the AC Cobra MkI. The first Cobra featured a large, high-performance Ford Windsor engine inside a small roadster that AC Cars had modified at Shelby's request. Likewise, the Shelby Cobra concept car is small and minimalist, eschewing conveniences found in most modern cars (such as air conditioning, a radio, anti-lock brakes, and even windshield wipers). In a press release to announce the debut of the concept car in 2004, Shelby echoed the aim of the design team: \\"That's the formula [...] It's a massive motor in a tiny, lightweight car.\\" Engine The front of the Shelby Cobra concept. The rear of the Shelby Cobra concept. The Shelby Cobra concept features an all-aluminium, V10 engine, displacing . It is capable of producing at 6,750 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm, making it one of the most powerful engines built by Ford. The engine red-lines at 6,800 rpm, and Ford claims it is capable of reaching , though the car is reportedly electronically limited to only . The double overhead cam cylinder heads and cylinders are fed by port fuel injection and racing-derived velocity stacks that are just visible within the hood scoop. For a low hood line, the throttles are a slide-plate design. The lubrication system is the dry-sump type, which relocates oil from underneath the engine to a remote tank. Chassis The chassis of the Shelby Cobra concept was based on an aluminium chassis used on the GT production car, and modified to suit the concept car's front-mid engine placement. In fact, many parts of the GT were adapted for use in the Cobra, such as the suspension, several components of the frame, and the mounting brackets for the transmission (which is placed in the rear on the Cobra). Despite sharing large portions of its chassis with the Ford GT, the Shelby Cobra concept is almost shorter overall and has a wheelbase shorter than the GT. Body and interior Although the Shelby Cobra concept was aimed to reflect the design of the AC Cobra, the concept is dimensionally very different from the original. However, the design includes many common external features, such as a large grille opening, side vents, and large wheel arches. In line with Carroll Shelby's designs, the concept has a very minimalist look, which is continued in the interior. The concept omits many features common in modern cars, such as air conditioning and a radio. The placement of the transmission in the rear allowed for the driver and passenger seats to be placed closer together, adding to the compactness of the Cobra.

It can be found in all mainland states and territories and yet is regarded as Australia's most under-studied falcon.Debus, S.J.S. & Olsen, J. (2011). Some aspects of the biology of the Black Falcon Falco subniger. Corella 35: 29-36  Description  The information in this section is based on recent descriptions by several authors (notably, Debus & Davies 2012, Debus & Olsen 2011, Morcombe 2002 and Birds in Backyards n.d.).Debus, S.J. S & Davies, J. (2012). Birds of prey of Australia: a field guide (2nd ed). CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, VicMorcombe, M. (2002). Field guide to Australian birds. Steve Parish Publishing, Archerfield, QldBirds in Backyards (n.d.). Black Falcon. Retrieved 19 October 2013 http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Falco-subniger Size (adult, beak to tail): 45 ‚Äì 56 cm (average 50 cm), tail makes up about half the length. Note: Females are larger than males - this is a form of sexual dimorphism. Average weight: 833 g (female) 582 g (male). Wing span: 95 ‚Äì115 cm. Colouration is uniform dark brown to sooty black; juveniles are generally darker than adults; underwing feathers are two-tone (flight feathers slightly paler); adults may have an evident dark stripe below the eye. Occasionally the birds may have a white chin, spots on underwing coverts or bars on undertail coverts. Cere, eye ring and feet are pale grey (or pale blue-grey); eye is dark brown and beak tip is black. Talons are black. Chick is white down. The falcon's body is streamlined with a relatively long tail and slim build. Wings are long and pointed tapering toward wing tip.  Notes on identification  When attempting to identify a flying raptor Debus & Davies recommend concentrating on the bird's silhouette (including shape of wings and proportions), flight style and vocalisations, rather than on details of colouration. Australian falcons can be differentiated from hawks by their toothed upper mandible (with a corresponding notch in their lower mandible) and by their long pointed wings. Brown falcons (Falco berigora) are a common and widespread species in Australia, and they are the most likely to be confused with the black falcon (particularly brown falcon juveniles and black morphs). In fact, Debus & Olsen suggest many observations and behaviour of brown falcons have mistakenly been attributed to the black falcon, due to incorrect identification. The two species differ in the relative length of exposed tarsi (the lower, visible half of the bird's leg) compared with thigh feathers, flight style, wing attitude, and bold underwing barring and tail barring (which appear on the brown falcon only).Debus, S.J.S & Zuccon, A.E.

Lansdowne Editions, Melbourne, Vic  Taxonomy  The black falcon belongs to the family Falconidae, as do the other three falcon species which are found in Australia, the brown falcon, grey falcon (Falco hypoleucos) and peregrine falcon (F. peregrinus). Genetic analysis has revealed that the black falcon may be an early offshoot of the Old World hierofalcons - such as the saker falcon (F. cherrug) and laggar falcon (F. jugger).Wink, M.; Sauer-G√ºrth, H.; Ellis, D. & Kenward, R.

WWGBP, Berlin  Population and threat status  The black falcon is listed by the IUCN as least concern. It is generally considered scarce, uncommon and nomadic but has at least one stronghold in inland Queensland. It is listed as Vulnerable in NSW and Victoria.NSW Government Office of Environment and Heritage (2013). Black Falcon - profile. Retrieved 20 October 2013 http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedSpeciesApp/profile.aspx?id=20269 In 2009 BirdLife International estimated the black falcon's population as between 670 and 6700 mature individuals, with a stable population trend.BirdLife International (2013). Species factsheet: Falco subniger. Retrieved 17 October 2013 http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3616&m;=1  Distribution and habitat  Distribution map showing records of the black falcon. Source: Atlas of Living Australia. The black falcon is widely distributed across mainland Australia, except densely forested areas. The species is only occasionally seen in the southern interior of WA and is sparse in coastal areas of south eastern Australia. BirdLife International also lists occasional, non-breeding vagrants to New Zealand. Total distribution area has been estimated at 5,910,000 km2. The black falcon's habitat is usually in the arid and semi arid zones. It is usually found near watercourses or utilizing patches of isolated trees. It hunts over open wooded grasslands, saltbush plains, bluebush plains and other low vegetation. In arid areas it will hunt over wetlands or near artificial or temporary water bodies ‚Äì areas which tend to attract the most abundant birdlife.  Behaviour and ecology  The black falcon is known to both harass and be harassed by other bird species, including raptors and corvids. It may be found resting on power poles during the day but will not sit on wires.BirdLife Australia (2012). Black Falcon. Retrieved 23 October 2013 from http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/black- falcon  Flight and hunting style  Black falcon in flight The falcon's flight has been described as variable. Generally it flies with relaxed ‚Äòcrow- like‚Äô wingbeats with occasional soaring. It also flies with a stiffer, shorter wingbeat. It glides and soars with slightly drooped or sometimes horizontal wings, carpals forward (wings are stretched out straight when gliding). Tail is normally folded (except when soaring, when it is fanned with notched corners). It often soars for long periods without flapping and catches prey in the air or on the ground. In pursuit of prey it uses powerful, rapid wingbeats. While resting the bird's wing tips are shorter than the tail and legs appear short. The species usually hunts alone but has also been observed hunting cooperatively in pairs and occasionally in larger numbers, when prey is abundant (specifically, when stubble fires yield an abundant prey source. Twelve birds were seen at one such fire near Gundagai, NSW. They have often been observed using contour hunting (over treetops), surprising and taking birds on the wing.Debus, S.J.S & Tsang, L.R. (2011). Notes on Black Falcons Falco subniger breeding near Tamworth, New South Wales. Australian Field Ornithology 28: 13-26 The species preys upon and is sometimes the prey of other raptors.Olsen, J.; Rose, A.B. & Boles, W.E. (2011). Black Falcon taken by Peregrine Falcon. Australian Field Ornithology 28: 133-135  Diet  The black falcon's diet primarily consists of bird species, from finch to cockatoo size but they have also been observed feeding on small mammals (i.e. rabbits, mice and rats), insects and carrion. Avian prey species include: * various pigeons (including crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes and the feral rock dove Columba livia) * Australasian pipit (Anthus novaeseelandiae) * Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) * Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius) * Black-faced Cuckooshrike (Coracina novaehollandiae) * Blue bonnet (Northiella haematogaster) * Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) * Common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) * Eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) * Fairy martin (Petrochelidon ariel) * Galah (Eolophus roseicapillus) * Grey Teal (Anas gracilis) * Honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) * Horsfield's bush lark (Mirafra javanica) * Little buttonquail (Turnix velox) * Little corella (Cacatua sanguinea) * Musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna) * Stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis) * Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) Debus & Zuccon also observed the black falcon hunting turquoise parrot (Neophema pulchella) and apostlebird (Struthidea cinerea), but on these occasions the attacks were unsuccessful.  Breeding  Laying time: between May and November (usually July to September). Clutch size: 1 - 5 (usually 3 or 4). Egg size: 42x32 mm. Incubation: approximately 34 days (by female, possibly by male for short periods). Nestling period: 5.5 ‚Äì 7 weeks. Life span: at least 12 years in the wild, and 20 years in captivity. The black falcon nests in living or dead trees, using the stick nests of corvids or other raptors. It may take over nests occupied by other birds. It appears there may be interspecific competition for nest sites between the black falcon and other raptors and corvids.Debus, S.J.S. & Tsang, L.R. (2011). Notes on Black Falcons Falco subniger breeding near Tamworth, New South Wales. Australian Field Ornithology 28: 13-26 Nest sites may be a limiting factor for black falcons, specifically where there has large-scale vegetation clearing, such as occurred in the sheep-wheat belt of NSW. During breeding season males perform courtship displays such as horizontal figure eights around the nest. The male bring food to the female during incubation and brooding. During the later nestling period both sexes may forage to feed the young. Post-fledging behaviour and development of young falcons appears to be very similar to that of the peregrine falcon, and includes spending time with siblings and parents, and practicing hunting, territorial and courtship behaviours.Barnes, C.P. & Debus, S.J.S. (2012). A snapshot in the post-fledging period of the Black Falcon. Australian Field Ornithology 29: 86‚Äì88  Vocalisations  The most common call is similar to the 'cackle' of the peregrine falcon but is slower and deeper ‚Äì ‚Äògaak-gaar-gaak‚Äô. The guttural call is shorter and more rapid when being attacked or when intruders are nearby ‚Äì ‚Äògak-gak-gak-gak‚Äô. Some authors suggest the bird screams when attacking prey but this attribution could be a result of misidentifications of brown falcons, with other authors contesting that the birds are generally silent during attack. The male also makes a sharp, rather high-pitched ‚Äòeeik..eeik..eeik‚Äô or ‚Äòee-chip‚Ä¶ee-chip‚Äô during courtship displays, and the female has a whine or wail when begging for food or copulating.  Home range, dispersal  The species‚Äô home range is undetermined, but likely to be greater than 100 km2. The species appears to be wide-ranging in the non-breeding season, but is also known to stay in regular non-breeding territories for lengthy periods.  Threats and management  Declining numbers of black falcons is a growing concern, with two states (Victoria and New South Wales) already having listed the species as vulnerable. Several authors have pointed out that population and other ecological data on the species is deficient, and addressing this issue should be a major priority for managers in the future. The primary threats to the species are all anthropogenic. These include clearing of habitat, degradation of habitat by over grazing, collision with vehicles and shooting. Clearing of big, old trees and breeding sites in riparian areas is of particular concern.NSW Scientific Committee (2013). NSW Scientific Committee: Final determination. [Black Falcon]. Retrieved 21 October 2013 from http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/threatenedspecies/BlackFalcVSFD.pdf The species also faces competition from corvids and other raptors over nest sites and possibly prey. Disturbance of nest sites and harassment by other birds (including cockatoos) also appears to impact the falcon's breeding success. Recommendations for ongoing management include monitoring of populations and further research into its biology and ecology. The Office of Environment and Heritage (NSW Government) has identified eight priority actions that aim to help recover the species. These include: protecting and monitoring known nest sites; protecting old stick nests that could make suitable breeding sites for the species; protecting and recruiting large old trees; engaging landholders in the management of habitat; expanding habitat (particularly along riparian areas); research into dietary requirements and awareness raising.NSW Government Office of the Environment and Heritage (n.d.).

She is best known today for her novel Les Malheurs de Sophie (Sophie's misfortunes), intended for children. Life Her father Count Fyodor Rostopchin was lieutenant- general and, later, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Russia. In 1812, he was governor of Moscow during the invasion of the Grande Arm√©e under Napoleon I of France. While facts concerning the origin of the great fire of Moscow are disputed by historians, Sophie Rostopchine's father has been said by some to have organized (despite opposition from the wealthy property-owners in the city) the great fire which forced Napoleon to make a disastrous retreat. In 1814 the Rostopchine family left Imperial Russia for exile, going first to the Duchy of Warsaw, then to the German Confederation and the Italian peninsula and finally in 1817 to France under the Bourbon Restoration. In France, the father established a salon, and his wife and daughter converted to Roman Catholicism from Russian Orthodoxy. It was in her father's salon that Sophie Rostopchine met Eug√®ne Henri Raymond, Count of S√©gur (Fresnes, Seine-et-Marne on 12 February 1798 ‚Äì Ch√¢teau de M√©ry-sur-Oise 15 July 1869), whom she married on 13/14 July 1819. The marriage was largely an unhappy one: her husband was flighty, distant and poor (until being made a Peer of France in 1830), and his infrequent conjugal visits to their ch√¢teau des Nouettes (near L'Aigle, Orne) produced eight children, including Nathalie de S√©gur and the father of the historian Pierre de S√©gur (Eug√®ne de S√©gur is said to have called his wife \\"la m√®re Gigogne\\", or \\"Mother Gigogne\\" in reference to a theatre character of 1602, an enormous woman out of whose skirts a crowd of children appeared).

Although she finds fame and wealth and marries the love of her life, Angel is condemned to a life of isolation and disappointment: critics regard her work as absurd and her closest relationships‚Äîwith her publisher, her husband, and her sister-in-law‚Äîare doomed by the inability of others to conform to her unrealistic view of life.

Biography Fritz Stiedry was born in Vienna in 1883. While still a law student at the University of Vienna, Stiedry's talent for music was noticed by Gustav Mahler, who appointed him his assistant at the Vienna Court Opera in 1907. This was followed by other assistant posts, leading to chief conductorships at the operas of Kassel and Berlin. In 1932 he conducted the world premiere of Kurt Weill's opera Die B√ºrgschaft. Stiedry left Germany when Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, and from 1934 to 1937 was principal conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. He was involved in rehearsals for the premiere of Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony until the premiere was canceled for reasons, in all probability political, that remain controversial. Some claim that Shostakovich felt Stiedry was unable to deal with the symphony's complexities, but others maintain that the real reason was that Communist Party officials pressured the composer to withdraw the work.www.sfsymphony.org In 1937, Stiedry left Leningrad for the United States and the New Friends of Music Orchestra in New York, conducting long-neglected works by Bach, Haydn and Mozart and premiering Schoenberg's Second Chamber Symphony. From 1945 onwards he returned to opera, conducting the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Metropolitan Opera of New York and co-founding the Hunter College Opera Workshop. He died in Z√ºrich, Switzerland in 1968, aged 84. He recorded Haydn's symphonies nos. 67, 80, 99 and 102. His live recording from the Metropolitan Opera of Giuseppe Verdi's La forza del destino (omitting the Act I inn scene, as customary there in the 1950s under Rudolf Bing) has been transferred to CD.

The game is a realistic simulation of the sport table tennis, with the main objective to make the opponent fail to hit the ball. The game features various methods of serving and returning the ball, designed for players to beat their opponent. Players can compete against the game's artificial intelligence, while the game's multiplayer mode lets two players compete in matches, either through local multiplayer or online. Initially developed specifically for the Xbox 360 console, the development team took advantage of the hardware's graphical power, allowing the game to play at a faster pace than with previous hardware. The game was the first to be developed using Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. The game was released for the Xbox 360 in May 2006 and was released for the Wii in October 2007. Its announcement in March 2006 led to confusion and surprise, due to its significantly different style from Rockstar's previous projects. It received generally positive reviews upon release, with praise particularly directed at its simplicity, replayability and detailed visuals. Gameplay Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a realistic simulation of the sport of table tennis. In the game, two players hit a ball back and forth from one another. The goal of the game is to make the opponent fail to return the ball. Players have the ability to challenge a multiplayer partner, either offline or online, or can select to challenge the game's artificial intelligence. Players can select from a roster of eleven characters, which are unlocked as they progress through the game; each character has particular skills in different areas. alt=The player character competing against an opponent in a game of table tennis. The head-up display elements are visible on-screen. The game features two modes: Tournament, which involves players participating against a variety of players in different circuits; and Exhibition, which involves players challenging individual opponents in non-ranked matches. When preparing to serve the ball, players enter a stance. During this stance, players aim the ball, followed by selecting the amount of spin and power to place on the ball, as indicated by the spin meter. Players can also place a level of spin on their ball, curving it in a different direction. After the opponent returns the ball, players have the ability to \\"charge\\" their shots. As the shots are charged, the Focus meter increases; when the meter fills, players enter the Full Focus state, in which their shots are faster and more accurate. Players can also perform soft shots and smashes, respectively decreasing and increasing the speed of the ball, and Focus Shots, high-powered returns that help players counter difficult shots. The Wii port of the game offers three different control schemes: Standard, using the Wii Remote; Sharp Shooter, which uses the Nunchuk's analog control to place the ball; and Control Freak, using the Nunchuk's analog stick to control the player's position.  Development  Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis was developed for the Xbox 360. The development team took advantage of the hardware's graphical power, and found that it allowed them to develop games at a faster pace than with previous hardware. Preliminary work on Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis began in 2005, prior to the announcement of the Xbox 360, which the game was developed for. Rockstar San Diego, the core team behind the game, found that the hardware allowed them to develop games at a faster pace than with the previous hardware. Rockstar president Sam Houser felt that Rockstar San Diego was a suitable developer for the game due to their demonstration of skill in developing advanced engines, particularly early in a console generation, citing Midnight Club: Street Racing and Smuggler's Run (both 2000), which were launch games for the PlayStation 2. Houser also said that, though the game's physics were achievable on the old hardware, the team waited for the possibility to develop for the Xbox 360 due to the \\"different level of production and technology\\" that it allowed. In developing the game's concept, the team was fascinated with concentrating the entire power of a particular hardware into one activity. The game runs off the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), and is the first game to do so. Network programmer John Gierach found the development of the online multiplayer mode challenging, due to the level of realism the development team attempted to create. In addition, the speed and accuracy required for the game was also a challenge for the team, due to the fast pace of the matches. When discussing the possibility of porting the game to the Wii, the team agreed almost immediately, as they felt that the console was a \\"perfect fit\\" for the game. While developing the Wii version, the team particularly considered how to serve all types of players, thus allowing a range of different control schemes. The game was first announced by Rockstar Games on March 3, 2006. Journalists noted the surprised reactions that the announcement caused within the gaming industry, which they owed to the game's significant difference when compared to Rockstar's reputation of developing mature titles. The game was released for the Xbox 360 on May 23, 2006 in North America, and on May 26, 2006 in the PAL region. On July 18, 2007, Rockstar announced that the game would be ported to the Wii, taking advantage of the motion sensing Wii Remote. The Wii version was released on October 17, 2007 in North America, and on October 19, 2007 in the PAL region. Reception The Xbox 360 version of Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the Wii version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the Review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers particularly praised its gameplay, detailed visuals, simplicity, and online multiplayer. In Japan, where the Xbox 360 version was ported and published by Microsoft Game Studios on October 12, 2006, followed by the Wii version, which was published by Spike on April 16, 2009, Famitsu gave the former console version a score of one eight, two sevens, and one eight for a total of 30 out of 40. The technical aspects of the game, such as the graphics and animation, received acclaim. IGN Douglass C. Perry felt that the graphics and motion capture are \\"exceptional\\", and the animation is \\"beautiful\\", as well as praising the stable frame rate. GameSpot Ryan Davis wrote that the characters were designed with \\"phenomenal detail\\", though felt that \\"there's not much else to look at\\". GamesRadar+ Dan Amrich commended the game's player models and lighting effects, stating that they \\"put the hardware to impressive yet playful use\\". Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the visuals improve the gameplay, particularly applauding smaller details such as the player models and ball physics. Many reviewers found the gameplay simple yet effective. Perry of IGN found the gameplay \\"deep and addictive\\", and the controls intuitive. GamesRadar+ Amrich echoed similar remarks, writing that the controls \\"feel accessible without alienating 'serious' sports gamers\\", and Orry of VideoGamer.com called the controls \\"slick\\". Eurogamer Tom Bramwell also praised the game's simplicity. The game's multiplayer mode was commended by many reviewers. GamesRadar+ Amrich felt that the multiplayer mode extended the game's replayability, giving players a reason to return to the game \\"long after [they've] learned the weaknesses\\" of the playable characters. Orry of VideoGamer.com and Bramwell of Eurogamer both named the online multiplayer \\"excellent\\"; the former noted minor lag but wrote that the \\"performance was generally very good\\". When the game was ported to the Wii, the additional Wii Remote controls received positive reactions. IGN Mark Bozon felt that they were an improvement over the original controls, calling it a \\"huge testament to Rockstar's design\\". Eurogamer Ellie Gibson found that the altered controls work \\"perfectly\\", finding them intuitive and \\"easy to grasp\\". GameSpot Davis wrote that the controls \\"work pretty well\\", though he felt that they fail to complement the gameplay. Conversely, Orry of VideoGamer.com felt that the original controls \\"have more depth\\" than those on the Wii. Following its previews at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the game won Best Sports Game from GameSpot, and received a nomination from IGN.

Born in Erfurt, he started performing at the age of 15. His first album Text und Ton was released in 2001. Since then he has released 7 more albums of which the last three, Stadtrandlichter (2014), Neuanfang (2016) and Handgep√§ck I (2018) reached number 1 of the German Top 100. His music is notable for being a mix of hip hop, pop and electronic music and sometimes reggae.  Musical career  Clueso, named after Inspector Clouseau in The Pink Panther, started making music in 1995. In 1998 he got to know his future manager Andreas Welskop and gave up his hairdressing apprenticeship. His first vinyl Cl√ºsolo was released on BMG Ufa the same year. In 1999 he moved to the 10vor10-Studios in Cologne with Welskop. A year later he signed a label contract at Four Music and released Text und Ton in 2001. Around that time he performed with Curfew at the MTV HipHop Open in Stuttgart and at Beats for Life in Cologne. In 2002, Clueso moved back to Erfurt and recorded the Rowdy-Club-Tape 2002. One year later, he started producing his second album Gute Musik, which translates to \\"good music\\" (featuring Blumentopf, Steer M, Tilmann Jarmer, Delhia, Tim Neuhaus and J√ºrgen Kerth), which was finished by 2004. It does not contain any English tracks and concentrates on singing rather than rapping. In 2005, Clueso represented Thuringia in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005, with the song \\"Kein Bock zu gehen\\", placing 7th with 63 points. The same year he was the partner of Start Ab, the \\"biggest non-commercial remix contest in Europe\\". On 19 May 2006, his third album Weit weg was brought out, where also the song Chicago was to be found. In conjunction with the ST√úBAphilharmonie, a Thuringian orchestra, Clueso gave a concert in the Fritz-Club in the former Postbahnhof in Berlin on 3 February 2007, where he performed his songs together with the orchestra and his band in an arrangement for more than 70 instruments. This concert was also released on DVD, entitled Clueso Live or Clueso- Weit weg-Live. In May and June 2007, Clueso was the opening act of Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer's 12-Tour and in the same year he was nominated by 1 live for the 1 live radio listener's award, the 1LIVE Krone, in the category Best Live Act. In September 2007, the single Lala, a song, which was especially recorded for the movie Leroy, was released. On 14 February 2008, Clueso again represented the Federal State of Thuringia in Stefan Raab's Bundesvision Song Contest. With his song Keinen Zentimeter, he came second, only one point behind the winner. On 30 May 2008, his fourth album So sehr dabei and his second single out of it Mitnehm were released. The third single from this album, Niemand an dich denkt, followed in October 2008. In December 2010 Clueso released a book \\"Clueso. Von und √ºber\\" (Clueso. Made By and About).Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf, Berlin 2010, , 160 p. The fifth studio album \\"An und f√ºr sich\\" (\\"In and of itself\\") was released on 25 March 2011. Same year Clueso collaborated with Udo Lindenberg performing the song \\"Cello\\" on the album \\"MTV unplugged ‚Äì Live im Hotel Atlantic\\". The song was released as a single also reaching number 4 in the German charts. After having released number 1 album \\"Stadtrandlichter\\" in 2014, Clueso parted ways with his long- standing band and management team. He wrote his following album about this period of separation and fittingly named it \\"Neuanfang\\" (\\"New Beginning\\").https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/pop/album-der-woche/clueso- veroeffentlicht-neues-album-neuanfang-14500066.html27 October 2016 The album reached number 1 of the German charts.

Although it was the sixth of his major works for stage and television, this psychological study of the confluence of power, allegiance, innocence, and corruption among two brothers and a tramp, became Pinter's first significant commercial success. It premiered at the Arts Theatre Club in London's West End on 27 April 1960 and transferred to the Duchess Theatre the following month, where it ran for 444 performances before departing London for Broadway. In 1963, a film version of the play based on Pinter's unpublished screenplay was directed by Clive Donner. The movie starred Alan Bates as Mick and Donald Pleasence as Davies in their original stage roles, while Robert Shaw replaced Peter Woodthorpe as Aston. First published by both Encore Publishing and Eyre Methuen in 1960, The Caretaker remains one of Pinter's most celebrated and oft-performed plays. Plot summary Act I A night in winter ;[Scene 1] Aston has invited Davies, a homeless man, into his flat after rescuing him from a bar fight (7‚Äì9). Davies comments on the flat and criticises the fact that it is cluttered and badly kept. Aston attempts to find a pair of shoes for Davies but Davies rejects all the offers. Once he turns down a pair that doesn't fit well enough and another that has the wrong colour laces. Early on, Davies reveals to Aston that his real name is not \\"Bernard Jenkins\\", his \\"assumed name\\", but really \\"Mac Davies\\" (19‚Äì20, 25). He claims that his papers validating this fact are in Sidcup and that he must and will return there to retrieve them just as soon as he has a good pair of shoes. Aston and Davies discuss where he will sleep and the problem of the \\"bucket\\" attached to the ceiling to catch dripping rain water from the leaky roof (20‚Äì21) and Davies \\"gets into bed\\" while \\"ASTON sits, poking his [electrical] plug (21). ;[Scene 2]: :The LIGHTS FADE OUT. Darkness. LIGHTS UP. Morning. (21) As Aston dresses for the day, Davies awakes with a start, and Aston informs Davies that he was kept up all night by Davies muttering in his sleep. Davies denies that he made any noise and blames the racket on the neighbours, revealing his fear of foreigners: \\"I tell you what, maybe it were them Blacks\\" (23). Aston informs Davies that he is going out, but invites him to stay if he likes, indicating that he trusts him (23‚Äì24), something unexpected by Davies; for, as soon as Aston does leave the room (27), Davies begins rummaging through Aston's \\"stuff\\" (27‚Äì28) but he is interrupted when Mick, Aston‚Äôs brother, unexpectedly arrives, \\"moves upstage, silently,\\" \\"slides across the room\\" and then suddenly \\"seizes Davies' \\"arm and forces it up his back,\\" in response to which \\"DAVIES screams,\\" and they engage in a minutely choreographed struggle, which Mick wins (28‚Äì29), ending Act One with the \\"Curtain\\" line, \\"What's the game?\\" (29). Act II ;[Scene 1] :A few seconds later Mick demands to know Davies' name, which the latter gives as \\"Jenkins\\" (30), interrogates him about how well he slept the night before (30), wonders whether or not Davies is actually \\"a foreigner\\"‚Äîto which Davies retorts that he \\"was\\" indeed (in Mick's phrase) \\"Born and bred in the British Isles\\" (33)‚Äîgoing on to accuse Davies of being \\"an old robber [‚Ä¶] an old skate\\" who is \\"stinking the place out\\" (35), and spinning a verbal web full of banking jargon designed to confuse Davies, while stating, hyperbolically, that his brother Aston is \\"a number one decorator\\" (36), either an outright lie or self-deceptive wishful thinking on his part. Just as Mick reaches the climactic line of his diatribe geared to put the old tramp off balance‚Äî\\"Who do you bank with?\\" (36), Aston enters with a \\"bag\\" ostensibly for Davies, and the brothers debate how to fix the leaking roof and Davies interrupts to inject the more practical question: \\"What do you do . . . when that bucket's full?\\" (37) and Aston simply says, \\"Empty it\\" (37). The three battle over the \\"bag\\" that Aston has brought Davies, one of the most comic and often-cited Beckettian routines in the play (38‚Äì39). After Mick leaves, and Davies recognises him to be \\"a real joker, that lad\\" (40), they discuss Mick's work in \\"the building trade\\" and Davies ultimately discloses that the bag they have fought over and that he was so determined to hold on to \\"ain't my bag\\" at all (41). Aston offers Davies the job of Caretaker, (42‚Äì43), leading to Davies' various assorted animadversions about the dangers that he faces for \\"going under an assumed name\\" and possibly being found out by anyone who might \\"ring the bell called Caretaker\\" (44). ;[Scene 2] > THE LIGHTS FADE TO BLACKOUT. > THEN UP TO DIM LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW. > A door bangs. > Sound of a key in the door of the room. > DAVIES enters, closes the door, and tries the light switch, on, off, on, > off. It appears to Davies that \\"the damn light's gone now,\\" but, it becomes clear that Mick has sneaked back into the room in the dark and removed the bulb; he starts up \\"the electrolux\\" and scares Davies almost witless before claiming \\"I was just doing some spring cleaning\\" and returning the bulb to its socket (45). After a discussion with Davies about the place being his \\"responsibility\\" and his ambitions to fix it up, Mick also offers Davies the job of \\"caretaker\\" (46‚Äì50), but pushes his luck with Mick when he observes negative things about Aston, like the idea that he \\"doesn't like work\\" or is \\"a bit of a funny bloke\\" for \\"Not liking work\\" (Davies' camouflage of what he really is referring to), leading Mick to observe that Davies is \\"getting hypocritical\\" and \\"too glib\\" (50), and they turn to the absurd details of \\"a small financial agreement\\" relating to Davies' possibly doing \\"a bit of caretaking\\" or \\"looking after the place\\" for Mick (51), and then back to the inevitable call for \\"references\\" and the perpetually necessary trip to Sidcup to get Davies' identity \\"papers\\" (51‚Äì52). ;[Scene 3] :Morning Davies wakes up and complains to Aston about how badly he slept. He blames various aspects of the flat's set up. Aston suggests adjustments but Davies proves to be callous and inflexible. Aston tells the story of how he was checked into a mental hospital and given electric shock therapy, but when he tried to escape from the hospital he was shocked while standing, leaving him with permanent brain damage; he ends by saying, \\"I've often thought of going back and trying to find the man who did that to me. But I want to do something first. I want to build that shed out in the garden\\" (54‚Äì57). Critics regard Aston's monologue, the longest of the play, as the \\"climax\\" of the plot. In dramaturgical terms, what follows is part of the plot's \\"falling action\\". Act III ;[Scene 1] :Two weeks later [‚Ä¶ ]Afternoon. Davies and Mick discuss the flat. Mick relates \\"(ruminatively)\\" in great detail what he would do to redecorate it (60). When asked who \\"would live there,\\" Mick's response \\"My brother and me\\" leads Davies to complain about Aston's inability to be social and just about every other aspect of Aston's behaviour (61‚Äì63). Though initially invited to be a \\"caretaker,\\" first by Aston and then by Mick, he begins to ingratiate himself with Mick, who acts as if he were an unwitting accomplice in Davies' eventual conspiracy to take over and fix up the flat without Aston's involvement (64) an outright betrayal of the brother who actually took him in and attempted to find his \\"belongings\\"; but just then Aston enters and gives Davies yet another pair of shoes which he grudgingly accepts, speaking of \\"going down to Sidcup\\" in order \\"to get\\" his \\"papers\\" again (65‚Äì66). ;[Scene 2] : That night Davies brings up his plan when talking to Aston, whom he insults by throwing back in his face the details of his treatment in the mental institution (66‚Äì67), leading Aston, in a vast understatement, to respond: \\"I . . . I think it's about time you found somewhere else. I don't think we're hitting it off\\" (68). When finally threatened by Davies pointing a knife at him, Aston tells Davies to leave: \\"Get your stuff\\" (69). Davies, outraged, claims that Mick will take his side and kick Aston out instead and leaves in a fury, concluding (mistakenly): \\"Now I know who I can trust\\" (69). ;[Scene 3] :Later Davies reenters with Mick explaining the fight that occurred earlier and complaining still more bitterly about Mick's brother, Aston (70‚Äì71). Eventually, Mick takes Aston's side, beginning with the observation \\"You get a bit out of your depth sometimes, don't you?\\" (71). Mick forces Davies to disclose that his \\"real name\\" is Davies and his \\"assumed name\\" is \\"Jenkins\\" and, after Davies calls Aston \\"nutty\\", Mick appears to take offence at what he terms Davies' \\"impertinent thing to say,\\" concludes, \\"I'm compelled to pay you off for your caretaking work. Here's half a dollar,\\" and stresses his need to turn back to his own \\"business\\" affairs (74). When Aston comes back into the apartment, the brothers face each other,\\" \\"They look at each other. Both are smiling, faintly\\" (75). Using the excuse of having returned for his \\"pipe\\" (given to him earlier through the generosity of Aston), Davies turns to beg Aston to let him stay (75‚Äì77). But Aston rebuffs each of Davies' rationalisations of his past complaints (75‚Äì76). The play ends with a \\"Long silence\\" as Aston, who \\"remains still, his back to him [Davies], at the window, apparently unrelenting as he gazes at his garden and makes no response at all to Davies' futile plea, which is sprinkled with many dots (\\". . .\\") of elliptical hesitations (77‚Äì78). Origins and contexts of the play According to Pinter's biographer, Michael Billington, the playwright frequently discussed details about The Caretaker's origins in relation to images from his own life. Billington notes in his authorised biography that Pinter claims to have written the play while he and his first wife Vivien Merchant were living in Chiswick: According to Billington, Pinter described Mick as the most purely invented character of the three. For the tramp [Davies], however, he felt a certain kinship, writing \\"[The Pinters' life in Chiswick] was a very threadbare existence . . . very . . . I was totally out of work. So I was very close to this old derelict's world, in a way.\\"(Harold Pinter 114‚Äì17). For earlier critics, like Martin Esslin, The Caretaker suggests aspects of the Theatre of the Absurd, described by Esslin in his eponymous book coining that term first published in 1961; according to Esslin, absurdist drama by writers such as Samuel Beckett, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Edward Albee, and others was prominent in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a reaction to chaos witnessed in World War II and the state of the world after the war. Billington observes that \\"The idea that [Davies] can affirm his identity and recover his papers by journeying to Sidcup is perhaps the greatest delusion of all, although one with its source in reality\\"; as \\"Pinter's old Hackney friend Morris Wernick recalls, 'It is undoubtedly true that Harold, with a writer's ear, picked up words and phrases from each of us. He also picked up locales. The Sidcup in The Caretaker comes from the fact that the Royal Artillery HQ was there when I was a National Serviceman and its almost mythical quality as the fount of all permission and record was a source.' To English ears,\\" Billington continues, \\"Sidcup has faintly comic overtones of suburban respectability. For Davies it is a Kentish Eldorado: the place that can solve all the problems about his unresolved identity and uncertain past, present and future\\" (122). About directing a production of The Caretaker at the Roundabout Theatre Company in 2003, David Jones observed: Hickling writes in this review of a production directed by Mark Babych in March 2009: Pinter's own comment on the source of three of his major plays is frequently quoted by critics: Analysis of the characters Aston :When he was younger he was given electric shock therapy that leaves him permanently brain damaged. His efforts to appease the ever-complaining Davies may be seen as an attempt to reach out to others. He desperately seeks a connection in the wrong place and with the wrong people. His main obstacle is his inability to communicate. He is misunderstood by his closest relative, his brother, and thus is completely isolated in his existence. His good-natured attitude makes him vulnerable to exploitation. His dialogue is sparse and often a direct response to something Mick or Davies has said. Aston has dreams of building a shed. The shed to him may represent all the things his life lacks: accomplishment and structure. The shed represents hope for the future. Davies :Davies manufactures the story of his life, lying or sidestepping some details to avoid telling the whole truth about himself. A non-sequitur. He adjusts aspects of the story of his life according to the people he is trying to impress, influence, or manipulate. As Billington points out, \\"When Mick suggests that Davies might have been in the services ‚Äî and even the colonies, Davies retorts: 'I was over there. I was one of the first over there.' He defines himself according to momentary imperatives and other people's suggestions\\" (122). Mick :At times violent and ill-tempered, Mick is ambitious. He talks above Davies' ability to comprehend him. His increasing dissatisfaction with Davies leads to a rapprochement with his brother, Aston; though he appears to have distanced himself from Aston prior to the opening of the play, by the end, they exchange a few words and a faint smile. Early in the play, when he first encounters him, Mick attacks Davies, taking him for an intruder in his brother Aston's abode: an attic room of a run-down house which Mick looks after and in which he enables his brother to live. At first, he is aggressive toward Davies. Later, it may be that by suggesting that Davies could be \\"caretaker\\" of both his house and his brother, Mick is attempting to shift responsibility from himself onto Davies, who hardly seems a viable candidate for such tasks. The disparities between the loftiness of Mick's \\"dreams\\" and needs for immediate results and the mundane realities of Davies's neediness and shifty non-committal nature creates much of the absurdity of the play. Style The language and plot of The Caretaker blends Realism with the Theatre of the Absurd. In the Theatre of the Absurd language is used in a manner that heightens the audience's awareness of the language itself, often through repetition and circumventing dialogue. The play has often been compared to Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett, and other absurdist plays because of its apparent lack of plot and action. The fluidity of the characters is explained by Ronald Knowles as follows: \\"Language, character, and being are here aspects of each other made manifest in speech and silence. Character is no longer the clearly perceived entity underlying clarity of articulation the objectification of a social and moral entelechy but something amorphous and contingent (41). Language One of the keys to understanding Pinter's language is not to rely on the words a character says but to look for the meaning behind the text. The Caretaker is filled with long rants and non-sequiturs, the language is either choppy dialogue full of interruptions or long speeches that are a vocalised train of thought. Although the text is presented in a casual way, there is always a message behind its simplicity. Pinter is often concerned with \\"communication itself, or rather the deliberate evasion of communication\\" (Knowles 43). The play's staccato language and rhythms are musically balanced through strategically placed pauses. Pinter toys with silence, where it is used in the play and what emphasis it places on the words when they are at last spoken. Mode of drama: Tragicomedy The Caretaker is a drama of mixed modes; both tragic and comic, it is a tragicomedy. Elements of comedy appear in the monologues of Davies and Mick, and the characters' interactions at times even approach farce. For instance, the first scene of Act Two, which critics have compared to the hat and shoe sequences in Beckett's Waiting for Godot, is particularly farcical: > ASTON offers the bag to DAVIES. > MICK grabs it. > ASTON takes it. > MICK grabs it. > DAVIES reaches for it. > ASTON takes it. > MICK reaches for it. > ASTON gives it to DAVIES. > MICK grabs it. Pause. (39) Davies' confusion, repetitions, and attempts to deceive both brothers and to play each one off against the other are also farcical. Davies has pretended to be someone else and using an assumed name, \\"Bernard Jenkins\\". But, in response to separate inquiries by Aston and Mick, it appears that Davies' real name is not really \\"Bernard Jenkins\\" but that it is \\"Mac Davies\\" (as Pinter designates him \\"Davies\\" throughout) and that he is actually Welsh and not English, a fact that he is attempting to conceal throughout the play and that motivates him to \\"get down to Sidcup\\", the past location of a British Army Records Office, to get his identity \\"papers\\" (13‚Äì16). The elements of tragedy occur in Aston's climactic monologue about his shock treatments in \\"that place\\" and at the end of the play, though the ending is still somewhat ambiguous: at the very end, it appears that the brothers are turning Davies, an old homeless man, out of what may be his last chance for shelter, mainly because of his (and their) inabilities to adjust socially to one another, or their respective \\"anti- social\\" qualities. Interpretation In his 1960 book review of The Caretaker, fellow English playwright John Arden writes: \\"Taken purely at its face value this play is a study of the unexpected strength of family ties against an intruder.\\"John Arden, book review of The Caretaker, New Theatre Mag. 1.4 (July 1960): 29‚Äì30. As Arden states, family relationships are one of the main thematic concerns of the play. Another prevalent theme is the characters' inability to communicate productively with one another. The play depends more on dialogue than on action; however, though there are fleeting moments in which each of them does seem to reach some understanding with the other, more often, they avoid communicating with one another as a result of their own psychological insecurities and self-concerns. The theme of isolation appears to result from the characters' inability to communicate with one another, and the characters' own insularity seems to exacerbate their difficulty communicating with others. As the characters also engage in deceiving one another and themselves, deception and self-deception are motifs, and certain deceptive phrases and self-deceptive strategies recur as refrains throughout the dialogue. Davies uses an assumed name and has convinced himself that he is really going to resolve his problems relating to his lack of identity papers, even though he appears too lazy to take any such responsibility for his own actions and blames his inaction on everyone but himself. Aston believes that his dream of building a shed will eventually reach fruition, despite his mental disability. Mick believes that his ambitions for a successful career outweigh his responsibility to care for his mentally damaged brother. In the end however all three men are deceiving themselves. Their lives may continue on beyond the end of the play just as they are at the beginning and throughout it. The deceit and isolation in the play lead to a world where time, place, identity, and language are ambiguous and fluid. Production history Premiere On 27 April 1960, the first production of The Caretaker opened at the Arts Theatre, in London, prior to transferring to the West End's Duchess Theatre on 30 May 1960. It starred Donald Pleasence as Davies, Alan Bates as Mick, and Peter Woodthorpe as Aston. The productions received generally strong reviews.See, e.g., T. C. Worsley, \\"Immensely Funny, Disturbing and Moving\\", Financial Times, 28 April 1960: \\"The Caretaker is both a wonderful piece of theatre, immensely funny, rich in observation, and below that level a disturbing and moving experience.\\" Cf. other reviews transcribed in the section on this production on Pinter's official website, HaroldPinter.org.

Brunton was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After creating the short films The Last Pogo (1978), A Trip Around Lake Ontario (1988) and The Mysterious Moon Men of Canada (1989), Genie Award winner for Best Live Action Short), Brunton produced the feature films Roadkill (1989) and Highway 61 (1990) with director Bruce McDonald. Brunton then went on to become the first executive director of The Feature Film Project, an initiative of Norman Jewison's Canadian Film Centre. Encouraging filmmakers to take risks, and giving them complete artistic freedom, from 1991 to 1995 he developed and then executive produced five feature films by first-time directors, producers and writers: Blood & Donuts, Cube, Rude, Shoemaker, and House. While faring poorly at the box office, they garnered generally favorable critical praise, and in two cases launched the healthy careers of two new directors: Clement Virgo with Rude and Vincenzo Natali with Cube. After leaving the Feature Film Project, Brunton became a hired-gun, working as a line producer, producer, and production manager on a variety of feature films and television series including the features Hedwig and the Angry Inch, The Safety of Objects and Foolproof, as well as the television series The Newsroom, Our Hero, Schitt's Creek and Puppets Who Kill. Brunton continues working at a steady pace, most recently producing the TV series Little Mosque on the Prairie, Spun Out and Schitt's Creek. In 2007 he completed the concert DVD Duality of Self featuring mysterious musician Jandek, and in 2013 he released the feature-length documentary The Last Pogo Jumps Again in collaboration with Kire Paputts. He was also in the latest movie How She Move.

His tar and bullet paintings, hair paintings, and various mudworks were exhibited at the Satellite Gallery in Downtown LA in 1986. He also did portraits of serial killer Richard Ramirez. In July 1991, the Los Angeles Times published an editorial about the 'death' of the Downtown Los Angeles loft/art scene and commented on his burgeoning series of misanthropic works. In 1992, he began creating large exorcistic and cathartic figuratives as a method of purification. In October 1999, CNN featured his work as a reference for a news story about the demonic possession of a church in rural France. Placing works in film and TV, the painting \\"Headless Angel\\" was part of the main set design in the 2000-2001 Fox horror/paranormal television series Freakylinks. X-8 contributed inside sleeve artwork (textures taken from mud paintings) and a guitar part on the Collide album Some Kind of Strange.

Its premi√®res in London (1965) and New York (1967) were both directed by Sir Peter Hall. The original Broadway production won the 1967 Tony Award for Best Play. Its 40th-anniversary Broadway production at the Cort Theatre was nominated for a 2008 Tony Award for \\"Best Revival of a Play\\". Set in North London, the play has six characters. Five of these are men who are related to each other: Max, a retired butcher; his brother Sam, a chauffeur; and Max's three sons: Teddy, a philosophy professor in the United States; Lenny, a pimp who only makes discreet references to his \\"occupation\\" and his clientele and flats in the city (London); and Joey, a brute training to become a professional boxer and who works in demolition. There is one woman, Ruth, Teddy's wife. The play concerns Teddy's and Ruth's \\"homecoming,\\" which has distinctly different symbolic and thematic implications. In the initial productions and the film of the same name, Pinter's first wife, Vivien Merchant, played Ruth. Characters *Max, \\"a man of seventy\\" ‚Äì The patriarch of the family. *Lenny, \\"a man in his early thirties\\" ‚Äì Max's son, apparently a pimp. *Sam, \\"a man of sixty-three\\" ‚Äì Max's brother, a chauffeur. *Joey, \\"a man in his middle twenties\\" ‚Äì Max's son, in demolition, training to be a boxer. *Teddy, \\"a man in his middle thirties\\" ‚Äì Max's son, a professor of philosophy in America. *Ruth, \\"a woman in her early thirties\\" ‚Äì Teddy's wife. Setting The setting is an old house in North London during the summer. All of the scenes take place in the same large room, filled with various pieces of furniture. The shape of a square arch, no longer present, is visible. Beyond the room are a hallway and staircase to the upper floor and the front door. Plot After having lived in the United States for several years, Teddy brings his wife, Ruth, home for the first time to meet his working-class family in North London, where he grew up, and which she finds more familiar than their arid academic life in America. The two married in London before moving to the United States. Much sexual tension occurs as Ruth teases Teddy's brothers and father and the men taunt one another in a game of one-upmanship, resulting in Ruth's staying behind with Teddy's relatives as \\"one of the family\\" and Teddy returning home to their three sons in America without her.See John Russell Taylor, \\"Pinter's Game of Happy Families\\", 57‚Äì65 in Lahr, Casebook; cf. Franzblau; Esslin, Pinter the Playwright 141‚Äì61; Gordon, \\"Family Voices: The Homecoming\\", 69‚Äì88 (chap. 4) in Harold Pinter: The Theatre of Power. Act one The play begins in the midst of what becomes an ongoing power struggle between the two more dominant men: the father, Max, and his middle son, Lenny. Max and the other men put down one another, expressing their \\"feelings of resentment,\\" with Max feminising his brother Sam, whom he intimates is homosexual, while, ironically, himself claiming to have himself \\"given birth\\" to his three sons. Teddy arrives with his wife, Ruth. He reveals that he married Ruth in London six years earlier and that the couple subsequently moved to America and had three sons prior to his returning to the family home to introduce her. The couple's mutual discomfort with each other, marked by her restless desire to go out exploring after he has gone to sleep, then followed by her sexually suggestive first-time encounter with her dangerous, and somewhat misogynistic, brother-in-law Lenny, begins to expose problems in the marriage. She strikes a nerve when she calls him \\"Leonard\\"; he tells her that no one, aside from his late mother, has ever done so. After a sexually charged conversation between Lenny and Ruth, Ruth exits. Awakened by their voices, Max comes downstairs. Lenny does not tell Max about Teddy and Ruth's arrival at the house and engages in more verbal sparring with Max. The scene ends in a blackout. When the lights come up the scene has changed to the following morning. Max comes down to make breakfast. When Teddy and Ruth appear and he discovers that they have been there all night without his knowledge, Max is initially enraged, assuming that Ruth is a prostitute. After being told that Ruth and Teddy have married and that she is his daughter-in- law, Max appears to make some effort to reconcile with Teddy. Act two This act opens with the men's ritual of sharing the lighting of cigars, traditionally associated with phallic imagery after lunch. Teddy's cigar goes out prematurely, the symbolism of which is clear.Lahr, Casebook, pp. 47‚Äì48. Max's subsequent sentimental pseudo-reminiscences of family life with his late wife Jessie and their \\"boys\\" and his experiences as a butcher also end abruptly with a cynical twist. After Teddy's marriage to Ruth receives Max's blessing, she relaxes and, focusing their attention on her (\\"Look at me\\"), reveals some details about her previous life before meeting Teddy and how she views America (pp. 68‚Äì69). After Max and his brother exit, Teddy abruptly suggests to Ruth that they return home immediately (p. 70). Apparently, he knows about her past history as \\"a photographic model for the body\\" (p. 73) and about which she reminisces when talking to Lenny alone after Teddy has gone upstairs \\"to pack\\" for their return trip to the United States. When he returns with the suitcases and Ruth's coat, he expresses concern about what else Lenny may have gotten Ruth to reveal. As Teddy looks on, Lenny initiates dancing \\"slowly\\" with Ruth (p. 74). With Teddy, Max, and Joey all looking on, Lenny kisses Ruth and then turns her over to Joey, who asserts that \\"she's wide open\\"; \\"Old Lenny's got a tart in here\\" (p. 74). Joey begins making out with Ruth on the sofa, telling Lenny that she is \\"Just up my street\\" (p. 75). Max asks Teddy if he is \\"going\\" so soon. He tells Teddy, \\"Look, next time you come over, don't forget to let us know beforehand whether you're married or not. I'll always be glad to meet the wife.\\" He says that he knows that Teddy had not told him that he was married because he was \\"ashamed\\" that he had \\"married a woman beneath him\\" (p. 75), just before peering to look at Ruth, who is literally still lying \\"under\\" Joey. Max adds that Teddy doesn't need to be \\"ashamed\\" of Ruth's social status, assuring Teddy that he is a \\"broadminded man\\" (75), and \\"she's a lovely girl. A beautiful woman\\", as well as \\"a mother too. A mother of three.\\" Contrary to the concurrent action, even more ironically, Max observes that Teddy has \\"made a happy woman out of her. It's something to be proud of\\"; right after Max further asserts that Ruth is \\"a woman of quality\\" and \\"a woman of feeling,\\" clasped in their ongoing embrace, Joey and Ruth \\"roll off the sofa on to the floor\\" (p. 76). Suddenly pushing Joey away and standing up, Ruth appears to take command, demanding food and drink, and Joey and Lenny attempt to satisfy her demands (pp. 76‚Äì77). After Ruth questions whether or not his family has read Teddy's \\"critical works\\" ‚Äî a seemingly absurdist non sequitur -- or perhaps just a jibe at her academician spouse -- the answer to which, in either event, is a foregone conclusion ‚Äî Teddy defends his own \\"intellectual equilibrium\\" and professional turf (pp. 77‚Äì78). Ruth and Joey go upstairs for two hours but Joey, who comes down alone without her, complains that Ruth refused to go \\"the whole hog\\" (p. 82). With Ruth still upstairs, Lenny and the others reminisce about Lenny's and Joey's sexual exploits. Lenny, whom the family considers an expert in sexual matters, labels Ruth a \\"tease,\\" to which Teddy replies, \\"Perhaps he hasn't got the right touch\\" (p. 82). Lenny retorts that Joey has \\"had more dolly than you've had cream cakes\\", is \\"irresistible\\" to the ladies, \\"one of the few and far between\\" (p. 82). Lenny relates anecdotes about Joey's sexual prowess with other \\"birds\\" (pp. 82‚Äì84). When Lenny asks Joey, \\"Don't tell me you're satisfied without going the whole hog?\\", Joey tentatively replies that \\"sometimes\\" a man can be \\"happy\\" without \\"going any hog\\" (p. 84). Lenny \\"stares at him\\". Joey seems to be suggesting that Ruth is so good at \\"the game\\" that Lenny ultimately gets the \\"idea [to] take her up with me to Greek Street\\" (p. 88). Max volunteers that Ruth could come to live with the family, suggesting that they \\"should keep her\\" while she works for them part-time as a prostitute. The men discuss this proposal in considerable detail, seemingly half-joking to irritate Teddy and half-serious (pp. 86‚Äì89). Sam declares the whole idea \\"silly\\" and \\"rubbish\\" (p. 86), Teddy adamantly refuses to \\"put\\" anything \\"in the kitty\\", as Max asks (p. 87), and Lenny suggests that Teddy could hand out business cards and refer Americans he knows to Ruth when they visit London, for \\"a little percentage\\" (pp. 89‚Äì90). Teddy does not decline outright but neither does he affirmatively agree to the idea. Teddy also says, in the play's only poignant turn of phrase, \\"She'd get old ... very quickly\\", which concern Max dismisses, citing the new National Health Service. Ruth comes downstairs \\"dressed\\". Teddy is still waiting with his coat on and their packed suitcases (p. 90). Teddy informs her of the family's proposal, without going into explicit detail about their intention to engage her in prostitution, saying euphemistically that she will \\"have to pull [her] weight\\" financially because they are not \\"very well off\\"; then he offers her a choice to stay in London with the family or to return to America with him (pp. 91‚Äì92). Ruth understands exactly what is being proposed and appears very open to the proposal. She inflexibly negotiates her demands, including a three room flat and a maid as the terms of a \\"contract\\" (p. 93) with Lenny, all of which must be finalized in writing with signatures and witnesses, leaving Lenny nonplussed but hapless. Ruth clearly is adept at getting what she wants (pp. 92‚Äì94) and Teddy prepares to return to America without her. Having spoken up a few times earlier to voice his objections, Sam blurts out a long-kept secret about Jessie and Max's friend MacGregor, then \\"croaks and collapses\\" and \\"lies still\\" on the floor (94). Briefly considering the possibility that Sam has \\"dropped dead\\" and become a \\"corpse\\" (p. 94), the others ascertain that he is still breathing (\\"not even dead\\"), dismiss his revelation as the product of \\"a diseased imagination\\", and ignore him thereafter. After a pause, Ruth accepts their proposal: \\"Yes, it sounds like a very attractive idea\\" (p. 94). Teddy focuses on the inconvenience that Sam's unavailability poses for him: \\"I was going to ask him to drive me to London airport\\" (p. 95). Instead, he gets directions to the Underground, before saying goodbye to the others and leaving to return home to his three sons, alone. As he moves towards the front door, Ruth calls Teddy \\"Eddie\\"; after he turns around, she cryptically tells him, \\"Don't become a stranger\\" (p. 96). He goes out the door, leaving his wife with the other four men in the house. The final tableau vivant (pp. 96‚Äì98) depicts Ruth sitting, \\"relaxed in her chair\\", as if on a throne.Interviewed by Campbell Robertson, in \\"In Search of Her Inner Kangaroo Suit\\", The New York Times 24 December 2007, The Arts: E1, 6; accessed 24 December 2007 Eve Best, the actress who played Ruth in the 2007‚Äì08 Cort Theatre reproduction, concludes: \\" 'This woman becomes the queen, and there hasn't been a struggle .... Simply by discovering herself, she has ultimate strength. I love that.' \\" [E6]. Sam lies motionless on the floor; Joey, who has walked over to Ruth, places his head in her lap, which she gently caresses. Lenny, stands looking on and observing. After repeatedly insisting he is not an old man, and getting no reply from Ruth, who remains silent, Max beseeches her, \\"Kiss me\\" ‚Äì the final words of the play. Ruth sits and \\"continues to touch JOEY's head, lightly,\\" while Lenny still \\"stands, watching\\" (p. 98). In this \\"resolution\\" of the play (its d√©nouement), what might happen later remains unresolved. Such lack of plot resolution and other ambiguities are features of most of Pinter's dramas.Merritt, Pinter in Play, pp. 1‚Äì4, 66‚Äì86, and throughout. Symbolism and irony of title In addition to the play being about Teddy's homecoming on a literal level, critics have suggested that, on a metaphoric level, the homecoming is Ruth's. That, symbolically, Ruth comes \\"home\\" to \\"herself\\": she rediscovers her previous identity prior to her marriage to Teddy. Ironically, as she \\"comes home\\" to this family which has been for so long woman-less (motherless, wifeless, etc), she thus abandons her own biological family with Teddy, leaving them now similarly bereft.See Bernard F. Dukore, \\"A Woman's Place\\", and Augusta Walker, \\"Why the Lady Does It\\", pp. 109‚Äì16 and 117‚Äì21 in Lahr, Casebook, respectively. By the end of the play, Ruth appears to have assumed the multiple roles of Jessie, the family's absent wife and mother, the missing woman in their household (\\"mother/wife/whore\\" in terms used by critics), while putting the American family of Ruth and Teddy in a parallel position, thus ironically reversing the situation at the beginning of the play. In that sense, the play recalls Edward's reversal of roles with the silent Matchseller in Pinter's 1959 play A Slight Ache, initially broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and similarly ironic plot and character role-reversals resulting from power struggles throughout many of Pinter's other plays.Merritt, Pinter in Play, p. 101; Batty, About Pinter, pp. 39‚Äì41. For many critics the missing \\"back wall\\" in the \\"large room\\" of the house described by Pinter as \\"removed\\" (p. 21) and by Teddy as \\"knocked [...] down to make an open living area\\" after Jessie's death (p. 37) symbolises the absent female influence.\\"A Designer's Approach: An Interview with John Bury, pp. 27‚Äì35 in Lahr, Casebook.Hannah Davies, The Homecoming, York Theatre Royal (2009), British Theatre Guide, accessed 10 March 2014.See the double-page illustration of the original set for the London production, by John Bury, in the front matter of the Lahrs' Casebook.In Demolition Man, Lahr mentions that the 2007 New York set design is not vast enough to parallel the text's references to its being \\"a large room, extending the width of the stage.\\" In October 2007, as quoted by Lahr, Pinter said that he considers The Homecoming his most \\"muscular\\" play.John Lahr, \\"Demolition Man: Harold Pinter and 'The Homecoming' \\", The New Yorker, 24 December 2007. After Teddy comes home and introduces his London family to his wife, Ruth (pp. 35‚Äì40), Max invites her to remain with them in London; as Teddy puts it to her euphemistically: \\"Ruth ... the family have invited you to stay, for a little while longer. As a ... as a kind of guest\\" (p. 91). Whereas Teddy must return home to his life and family in America (pp. 91‚Äì96) to fulfill his obligations, Ruth agrees to \\"come home\\" (p. 92), by refusing to honor any longer her now defunct obligations as wife and mother, to more than willingly take up her part in the family business (so to speak) as well as succeeding the late Jessie (Max's wife and his sons' mother), filling the gap created by and since the other woman's death (pp. 92-94). On first seeing Ruth, Max believes that his eldest son, Teddy, has brought a \\"filthy scrubber\\" into \\"my house\\", adding, \\"I've never had a whore under this roof before. Ever since your mother died\\" (pp 57-58). A major irony is that Max's apparently-mistaken first assumption becomes more accurate as the family (and the audience) get to \\"know\\" Ruth better (pp. 65‚Äì76). The play makes clear to Teddy's family, even if Teddy refuses to acknowledge it, that Ruth has been, to say the least, increasingly unhappy in married life and in the United States. When her husband insists she is \\"not well\\" (p. 85) and simply needs to \\"rest\\" (p. 71), Teddy is clearly both downplaying and ignoring the cause and extent of her discontent, even depression, draping his words in almost Victorian modesty. However, he ultimately elects to leave without her rather than fight for her. It has not been Teddy's \\"homecoming\\" but that of Ruth. Critical response Often considered to be a highly ambiguous, an enigmatic, and for some even a cryptic play, The Homecoming has been the subject of extensive critical debate since it premiered.See, e.g., Lahr, Casebook; Lahr, \\"Demolition Man\\"; and Merritt, Pinter in Play xvii‚Äìxxvii, and throughout. According to many critics, it exposes issues of sex and power in a realistic yet aesthetically stylised manner. Surveying Pinter's career on the occasion of the 40-anniversary Broadway production of the play at the Cort Theatre in The New Yorker, the critic John Lahr describes the impact of experiencing it: The Homecoming' changed my life. Before the play, I thought words were just vessels of meaning; after it, I saw them as weapons of defence. Before, I thought theatre was about the spoken; after, I understood the eloquence of the unspoken. The position of a chair, the length of a pause, the choice of a gesture, I realised, could convey volumes.\\" Like other contemporary critics familiar with The Homecoming, Ben Brantley praises the play's two-act plot structure, referring to its \\"nigh-perfect form.\\"Ben Brantley, \\"Theater Review: The Homecoming (Cort Theater): You Can Go Home Again, But You'll Pay the Consequences\\", The New York Times 17 December 2007, The Arts: E1, 7, accessed 10 March 2014. In the 1960s, when first encountering the play, its earliest critics complained that, like Pinter's other plays as perceived then, The Homecoming seemed, in their words, \\"plotless,\\" \\"meaningless,\\" and \\"emotionless\\" (lacking character motivation), and they found the play \\"puzzling\\" (their word); later critics argue that the play evokes a multiplicity of potential meanings, leading to multiple interpretations.Susan Merritt Elliott, \\"Critical Responses to the Puzzling World of Pinter\\", Chap. One (1‚Äì42), in \\"Fantasy behind Play: A Study of Emotional Responses to Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, The Caretaker and The Homecoming\\", Diss. Indiana U, 1973, as cited in Merritt, Pinter in Play, pp. 255‚Äì62. In \\"Demolition Man\\", Lahr considers The Homecoming to be The Homecoming directly challenges the place of morals in family life and puts their social value \\"under erasure\\" (in Derridean terminology). Teddy's profession as an academic philosopher, which, he claims, enables him to \\"maintain ... intellectual equilibrium\\" ‚Äî ironically raises basic philosophical questions about the nature of so-called family values and the \\"meaning\\" of \\"love\\" among family members.Lahr, Casebook; Merritt, Pinter in Play, pp. 90, 95‚Äì96, 194‚Äì96. Occasionally, one finds critics of the play, aware of Pinter's reputation for ambiguity, questioning even Teddy's and Ruth's references to the fact of their \\"being married\\"; e.g., Harold Hobson, as cited by Merritt: \\"Hobson's interpretation of Teddy as merely pretending to be Ruth's husband and a professor of philosophy enables him to rationalize the man's behavior toward his wife.\\"Merritt, Pinter in Play 221‚Äì25. Basing her viewpoint on a personal interview with Hobson, Susan Hollis Merritt considers Hobson's review of the first production of the play, entitled \\"Pinter Minus the Moral\\", concluding: \\"although Hobson still describes The Homecoming as Pinter's 'cleverest play,' his judgment against the play's 'moral vacuum,' like his denial of Teddy and Ruth's marriage, suggests his personal distress at the portrayal of marriage and what Pinter has called the characters' misdirected 'love.' \\"Merritt, Pinter in Play, p. 224. To deny that Teddy and Ruth are really married is a common refrain in responses to the play. Aside from their behaviour in the play as well as that of Teddy's family, nothing in the text contradicts the ostensible and putative reality that they are legally married and have three sons. The more outrageous, even horrifying, for the play's original audiences, the words and actions taken by Ruth, Max, and Lenny, the more Teddy protests that they are married, leading some critics to believe that the man doth protest too much. A perceptive reader and viewer of the play would wonder why Teddy would have brought his wife and the mother of his children into such a grotesque menagerie in the first place. Continuing denial of the facts of Teddy's and Ruth's marriage and children may serve critics as a means of expressing their own rejection of what occurs in the play. Knowing Ruth as she slowly reveals herself, it is easier, and likely more comforting, to dismiss the proposition that she had ever been a housewife, much less the mother of three children born during a six year span whom she appears to have no intention of ever seeing again. The notion of a mother willingly, indeed facilely, abandoning her husband, and, especially, her children, to become a prostitute, must have been, especially at that time, almost unprecedented in \\"respectable\\" drama and literature and on the \\"legitimate\\" stage up to that time. Alluding indirectly to this critical pattern, Brantley observes, however, that, in time, the play may appear more realistic and more relevant to the lives of theatre audiences than it may have seemed when they themselves were younger or more naive about the nature of marriage and family life. To those with strong religious values, like Hobson, the play appears, to say the least, immoral or amoral. Yet, to others, its moral value resides in its very questioning of commonly accepted shibboleths about marriage and the family: \\"People who were originally put off by The Homecoming may now find it too close to home. It's a bit like Picasso's shockingly severe painting of Gertrude Stein from 1906, the one he predicted in time would resemble its subject. We may not have thought we saw ourselves in The Homecoming four decades ago. Now it feels like a mirror\\", posited critic Ben Brantley. Other critics, like Lahr in Demolition Man, remind their readers of the strong element of comedy in this play, as in many of Pinter's other plays. Composition history Pinter's home in Ambrose Place, Worthing, where he wrote The Homecoming Pinter wrote The Homecoming in six weeks in 1964 from his home in the Sussex coastal town of Worthing, where, according to theatre critic John Lahr, \\"the magnificent barrenness of the play's North London setting was imagined as he sat at his writing desk overlooking gardens, within earshot of the sea.\\" According to Lahr, Pinter remarked that \\"it kind of wrote itself.\\" Pinter's close friend and former schoolteacher, Joseph Brearley, was visiting Pinter after he had written the play. \\"I gave him the play to read,\\" Pinter recalled. \\"I waited in another room. About two hours later, I heard the front door slam. I thought, Well, here we are. He doesn't like it. About an hour later, the doorbell rang. I answered it. He said, 'I had to get some air.' He said, 'It is your best.' \\" Production history Productions of the play have won major theatre awards. The 1967 New York production received four Tony Awards: the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play (Paul Rogers), the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play (Ian Holm), the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play (Peter Hall), and the Tony Award for Best Play (Alexander H.

Life  He was born in Cologne. After attending a vocational school where he studied civil engineering, he worked in the architectural studios of Heinrich Wiethase, where he was involved in projects for churches and other religious buildings. Beginning in 1872, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna while working in the offices of well-known cathedral architect Friedrich von Schmidt. During 1875‚Äì76, he lived in Italy where he met Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer and the painter Izidor Kr≈°njavi. This meeting led him to consider Croatia as a place to establish his practice. In 1876, he went to ƒêakovo, where he joined Friedrich von Schmidt to complete construction of the Cathedral of St.Peter and St.Paul, begun by architect Carl Roesner, who had died in 1869. That same year, he completed the restoration of St.Mark's Church in Zagreb, where he settled permanently in 1878. He restored and built many structures in a variety of styles, including the Museum of Arts and Crafts, the Zagreb Cathedral, the Mirogoj Cemetery and the Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Kri≈æevci.

It is found throughout North America and can be a pest of ash and lilac.  Appearance  Like other clear wing moths, ash borers have partially transparent wings due to a lack of colored scales on the wings. The body is brown with yellowing striping on the legs and abdomen, and can give the appearance that the ash borer is a paper wasp. Hosts and life cycle Ash borer adults feed on nectar and will lay their eggs in the bark of lilac, ash, and privet, but can attack closely related plants in its range within North America. Larvae feed beneath the bark by chewing into the sapwood. Larval feeding can destroy the tree's phloem, weakening and possibly killing already stressed or very young trees by increasing the potential for wind damage or wilting. Pupae overwinter in the feeding gallery and emerge as adults the following spring. Adults begin to emerge between April and July or 300 to 500 growing degree days above or about one week after full bloom of lilac. Podosesia_syringae2.jpgAdults mating Podosesia_syringae7.jpgLarva Podosesia_syringae6.jpgDamage  Monitoring and treatment  Pheromone traps can be used to monitor for the presence of ash borers. Minimizing tree stress through mulching, watering during drought, and avoiding damage from equipment can reduce the occurrence of damage. In areas where ash borers are present and causing damage, insecticides can be applied to the trunk and branches before larvae chew into the bark. However, insecticides, are not effective once larvae are inside the tree.

Hydrologists often utilize meteorologists and data provided by meteorologists. As an example, a meteorologist might forecast of rain in a specific area, and a hydrologist might then forecast what the specific impact of that rain would be on the local terrain. UNESCO has several programmes and activities in place that deal with the study of natural hazards of hydrometeorological origin and the mitigation of their effects. Among these hazards are the results of natural processes and atmospheric, hydrological, or oceanographic phenomena such as floods, tropical cyclones, drought, and desertification. Many countries have established an operational hydrometeorological capability to assist with forecasting, warning, and informing the public of these developing hazards.  Hydrometeorological forecasting  One of the more significant aspects of hydrometeorology involves predictions about and attempts to mitigate the effects of high precipitation events. There are three primary ways to model meteorological phenomena in weather forecasting, including nowcasting, numerical weather prediction, and statistical techniques. Nowcasting is good for predicting events a few hours out, utilizing observations and live radar data to combine them with numerical weather prediction models. The primary technique used to forecast weather, numerical weather prediction uses mathematical models to account for the atmosphere, ocean, and many other variables when producing forecasts. These forecasts are generally used to predict events days or weeks out. Finally, statistical techniques utilize regressions and other statistical methods to create long-term projections that go out weeks and months at a time. These models allow scientists to visualize how a multitude of different variables interact with one another, and they illustrate one grand picture of how the Earth's climate interacts with itself.  Risk assessment  A major component of hydrometeorology is mitigating the risk associated with flooding and other hydrological threats. First, there has to be knowledge of the possible hydrological threats that are expected within a specific region. After analyzing the possible threats, warning systems are put in place to quickly alert people and communicate to them the identity and magnitude of the threat. Many nations have their own specific regional hydrometeorological centers that communicate threats to the public. Finally, there must be proper response protocols in place to protect the public during a dangerous event.

He called the new appliance \\"bamix\\", a portmanteau of the French \\"battre et mixer\\" (beat and mix). Larger immersion blenders for commercial use are sometimes nicknamed boat motors (popularized by Emeril Lagasse and Alton Brown). Uses include pur√©eing soups and emulsifying sauces. A stick blender comprises an electric motor driving rotating cutting blades at the end of a shaft which can be immersed in the food being blended, inside a housing which can be held by hand. Some can be used while a pan is on the stove. Immersion blenders are distinguished from worktop blenders and food processors that require food to be placed in a special vessel for processing. They are distinguished from hand mixers, which mix but do not chop.

Field guide to the birds of Australia. Penguin Books Ltd., Victoria, Australia. Its plumage varies in colour depending on sex, age and environment with a darker form in humid areas and a lighter form in drier environments. Generally the hobby displays a black cap and mask with a whitish forehead and half-collar. Underparts can be blue-grey or rufous and streaked darker. The cere in adults is a pale yellowish grey, the eye ring is pale blue, the eyes are brown and the feet are dull yellow. Females are larger in size between 34 ‚Äì 35.5 cm and males are generally between 30 ‚Äì 32 cm in length with a wing span between 66 ‚Äì 87 cm. The Australian hobby is easily confused with the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) however the hobby is more slender, with longer and thinner wings, and is a less powerful flyer. Distribution and density of the Australian hobby from occurrence records  Distribution and habitat  Hobbies occur throughout mainland Australia including off shore islands e.g. Lord Howe Island,Bishop, K.

Migrating individuals have also been recorded on the islands of Indonesia and New Guinea.Olsen, J. & Trost, S. (2007). Diurnal Raptors on the island of Sumba, Indonesia, in June/ July and December/January 2001‚Äì2002. Australian Field Ornithology, 24, 158‚Äì166. Hobbies frequent most open habitats including open woodland, water courses and vegetated urban areas but are rarely recorded around cliffs or escarpments.  Diet  The Australian hobby has been recorded preying on avian species including the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). Research suggests they tend to avoid large, dangerous, or agile species that forage close to cover, such as the common myna (Acridotheres tristis). Insectivorous bats and insects including beetles, cicadas, crickets and grasshoppers also form part of the hobby's diet.Olsen, J., Fuentes, E., Rose, A. B. & Trost. S. (2006). Food and hunting of eight breeding raptors near Canberra, 1990‚Äì1994. Australian Field Ornithology, 23, 77-95.  Behaviour   Flight  The hobby is a solitary and aggressive falcon using rapid flickering wing beats, with tail fanned when hovering. It glides on flat or slightly drooped wings with carpals flexed and outerwings swept back. Its flight is often characterised as low and fast, zig-zagging over or between vegetation and open ground. When engaged in territorial defence, hobbies have been observed soaring and circling to ward off other birds of prey e.g. little eagle (Hieraaetus morphnoides). Hobbies have also been observed attacking other perched raptors with steep stoops at vegetation and shallow stoops from behind for airborne raptors.Debus, S. J. S, Ley, A. J., Tremont, S. and Tremont R. (1991). Breeding behaviour and diet of the Australian Hobby Falco longipennis in northern New South Wales. Australian Bird Watcher, 14, 123 ‚Äì 137.  Hunting  The hobby is a widespread and common hunter that often hunts at dusk,Thomas, R., Thomas, S., Andrew, D. McBride, A. (2011). The complete guide to finding the birds of Australia. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Victoria. diurnally and sometimes nocturnally by artificial light. Hobbies have been witnessed catching their prey in mid air, by direct attack from a perch or in fast contour-flying above or between tree canopies. It is acrobatic in the pursuit of prey and attacks fleeing birds in a series of short shallow stoops. They have also been recorded using a concealed approach when attacking shorebird roosts, flying towards them behind the cover of dunes, cliffs or trees.Rogers, D. I., Piersma, T. & Hassell, C.J. (2006). In suburban habitats it can be seen shadowing Australian sparrow hawks when hunting introduced doves. Both species seem to benefit from this relationship as the doves stay in cover when they see the hobby helping the sparrowhawk and don't see the hobby when flushed by the sparrowhawk. Sparrowhawks and hobbies will dog fight with one another so presumably this is not an entirely symbiotic relationship. Roost availability may constrain shorebird distribution: Exploring the energetic costs of roosting and disturbance around a tropical bay. Biological Conservation 133, 225 ‚Äì235 Hobbies have been known to harass larger birds but are not capable of killing them. Research has shown that Australian hobbies have one of the lowest prey- to-predator ratios (i.e., smaller prey relative to their body mass) because of the large number of insects in their diet.  Breeding  Nesting usually occurs any time between August to January where an old stick nest of another large raptor is commandeered. Three to four heavily blotched eggs are laid with incubation taking about 35 days. Successful broods usually comprise two to three young. The fledglings remain dependant for up to three months after which the young disperse or migrate widely. Studies have revealed the extent of the falcon's migration. In one case, a banded fledgling left its natal territory in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, and was recovered 29 days later in Brisbane, Queensland, approximately 1000 km away. Within their nesting territory, hobbies have been recorded using several different perches for activities including, the transfer of food between male and female, for feeding independently and for guarding the nest. Research has shown that brooding is shared by both male and female hobbies. However, feeding of the nestlings after hatching becomes the responsibility of the female. Early on in the nestling period the male hunting rate increases to supplement the female with observations indicating food is brought to the nest every three hours, with a longer break in the middle of the day.  Vocalisations  Research undertaken comparing the vocalisations of Australian falcons, found that two structurally distinct calls were emitted when a male hobby was restrained. This included a wide band harmonic vocalisation and a trill-type vocalisation. The trill-type vocalisation was given sporadically upon initial handling and harmonic vocalisation was assessed as the most common call of the species being used in situations of territorial defence and mobbing.Jurisevic, M. (1998). Comparison of Vocalisations of Australian Falcons and Elanine Kites. EMU, 98, 1-12. Observations of hobbies during breeding identified that two main calls were used by adults. One was a rapid peevish chatter Kee-Kee-Kee- Kee-Kee which was given by the male as he brought prey to the nest area and was given by both sexes in alarm, when mobbing other predatory birds and when selecting and defending the nest. The second call resembled a squeaky chittering and ticking which appears to be used in a social dominance and food possession or food begging context. Juveniles were observed calling in an unslurred chittering whine when begging for food and in a chattering kee-kee- kee... when alarmed, or excited, from the feathering stage. Calls by the Australian hobby are similar, but higher pitched, to the male peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) when arriving at the nest with food. The hobby is also described as having similar ‚Äòalarm‚Äô and contact calls to the Australian kestrel (Falco cenchroides).  Conservation and threats  The Australian hobby is not listed as a threatened species within Australia and is listed as a species of least concern on International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List. It is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Appendix II lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled.Arkive. (2012). Australian hobby (Falco longipennis). Retrieved from: http://www.arkive.org/australian-hobby/falco- longipennis/#src=portletV3api Since dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was introduced to agriculture in 1946, egg shell thickness of some species of falcon including the Australian hobby, was significantly reduced. This led to some decline in local populations through egg breakage during incubation but did not eventuate in widespread population declines for the Australian hobby.Olsen, P., Fuller, P. & Marples, T. G. (1993). Pesticide-related eggshell thinning in Australian Raptors. EMU, 93, 1-11. ). Hobbies are susceptible to the columbid herpesvirus-1 (CoHV-1) infection which causes death by massive splenic and hepatic necrosis. The cause of infection is often attributed to the consumption of rock pigeons (Columbia livia) which carry the disease.Phalen, D. N., Holz, P., Rasmussen, L. and Bayley, C. (2011). Fatal columbid herpesvirus-1 infections in three species of Australian birds of prey. Australian Veterinary Journal, 89, 5, 193-196.

He was a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council from 2001 to 2005, representing the Liberal Party from 2001 to 2004, and serving as an independent from 2004 to 2005, for the seven-member North Metropolitan Region. He is most well known for providing the crucial last vote in order to pass one vote one value legislation abolishing the state's rural gerrymander, which had been stalled in a deadlocked Legislative Council for some years. Cadby had been bound to oppose the legislation as a member of the Liberal Party, but when, in early 2004, he lost preselection to recontest his seat after a challenge from Peter Collier, he quit the party and became an independent. As an independent, he promptly provided the final vote necessary, ensuring the passage of the legislation. However the Liberal Party was aware of Cadby's support of the principle of one vote one value (Electoral Amendment Bill 2001) in November 2001 when Cadby approached Jeremy Buxton, Liberal strategist, stating that he would have great difficulty in speaking out against the Bill when it arrived in the Legislative Council as Cadby believed in the principle of one vote one value. A compromise was reached on his stance with Buxton providing Cadby with a set of general notes that he could use in his speech as a generic view on the value of a vote. This speech was delivered on 28 November 2001. Along with the Liberal member for Ningaloo Rod Sweetman, Alan Cadby offered to serve out his parliamentary term as a Family First Party member. Rod Sweetman's offer was later rejected by that party due to Rod Sweetman supporting a bill for decriminalisation of abortion in 1998. Alan Cadby withdrew his candidature for the Party following the treatment of Rod Sweetman by Family First. Independents have traditionally struggled in the Legislative Council, and facing near-certain defeat, Cadby decided to retire at the 2005 state election.

Commodore Perry and his party landing at Yokohama to meet the Shogun's Commissioners (lithograph, 1855) Early life Heine was born in Dresden, the son of Ferdinand Heine, a comedian engaged at the Dresden Court Theatre. His family connections included composer Richard Wagner, whose father had been a family friend.Shedlock, John South. (1890). Richard Wagner's Letters to His Dresden Friends. pp. x-xi. Heine studied at the Royal Academy of Art in Dresden and in the studio of Julius H√ºbner. Then he continued his artistic studies for three years in Paris. He returned to Dresden getting work as a scene designer for the court theatre and giving painting classes. He fled to New York in 1849, following the suppression of the May Uprising in Dresden in which he participated. In this he was aided by Alexander von Humboldt. Career He set up his artist studio at 515 Broadway, and soon established his reputation as an artist. After meeting the archaeologist and diplomat, Ephraim George Squier, Heine was invited to accompany him, as an artist, on his consular duties to Central America. Proceeding ahead of Squier, he collected and recorded indigenous plants and animals and compiled notes for future publications. Until Squier arrived, Heine stood in as consul, negotiating a commercial agreement between the Central American countries and the United States, which he delivered to Washington. The record of this expedition was published in 1853 as the Wanderbilder aus Zentralamerika. While in Washington, he met President Millard Fillmore and Commodore Matthew Perry, and was selected from among several scores of applicants for the post of official artist to the Perry expedition to Japan. Japan Nominally attached to Perry's expedition as an Acting Master's Mate; he served on the flagship under Sydney Smith Lee. Heine visited Okinawa, the Bonin Islands, Yokohama, Shimoda and Hakodate during 1853 and 1854 (Edo, however, remained closed to the members of the American expedition, and Heine was not to visit the city until 1860, when he returned to Japan as a member of the Prussian Expedition). The sketches he produced of the places he visited and the people he encountered there, together with the daguerreotypes taken by his colleague Eliphalet Brown Jr., formed the basis of an official iconography of the American expedition to Japan which remains an important record of the country as it was before the foreigners arrived in force. Upon his return to New York in 1855 he published several books: a collection of prints entitled Graphic Scenes of the Japan Expedition; 400 sketches which were included in Perry's official report; and his memoirs, Reiss um die Welt nach Japan (Leipzig, 1856). The memoirs were very successful, and were immediately translated into both French and Dutch.

Image:Hakodate 1856.jpg\\"View of Hakodate from Snow Peak\\" looking towards the sea (lithograph, 1856). Further expeditions Going back to Prussia he published a German translation of the report of the Rodgers Expedition sent by the US government to Japan, China and Okhotsk Seas, under the title Die Expedition in dir Seen von China, Japan und Okhotsk (Leipzig, 1858-9) and Japan und Seine Bewohner (Leipzig, 1860). Here he urged the Prussian government to send more expeditions to Asia before the Americans became established there. This was taken up and while in Berlin he received an invitation to join the Eulenberg Expedition as official artist once again, and was simultaneously given a premium to send back reports for a K√∂ln newspaper. During this trip he met up with Mikhail Bakunin in Yokohama, who was in the process of returning to Europe, following his escape from Siberia. Eventually, in 1864, he would published his major work, a voluminous book on travel in the Orient, Eine Weltreise um die n√∂rdliche Hemisphare in Verbindung mit der Ostasiatischen Expedition in den Jahren 1860 und 1861 (Leipzig, two volumes). American Civil War and later life Learning of the outbreak of the American Civil War; the Forty-Eighter returned and volunteered for the Union Army. He joined the 1st Maryland Infantry Regiment before being commissioned a Captain of Topographical Engineers. Serving in the Army of the Potomac, Heine was captured during the Peninsula Campaign and briefly was in Libby Prison before being exchanged. In late 1862 he was arrested and accused of revealing too much information of the Union defenses in his drawings. Also being wounded he was honorably discharged as \\"unfit for service.\\" In 1863 he rejoined the army as Colonel of the 103rd New York Infantry, a regiment made up mainly of German-Americans. Later he commanded a brigade and then a small division in the Army of West Virginia. In 1865 he was made a Brevet Brigadier General but was accused of disobedience and left the army. In the next year he became a U.S. clerk to the Paris and Liverpool consulates. After the establishment of the Hohenzollern Empire in Germany in 1871, he returned to Dresden where he wrote his last book about Japan, Japan, Beitr√§ge zur Kenntnis des Landes und seiner Bewohner (Berlin, 1873‚Äì80).

Her best-known work was her 1698 fairy tale Persinette which was adapted by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 as the story Rapunzel.Jack Zipes, Spells of Enchantment: The Wondrous Fairy Tales of Western Culture, Viking, (1991), pg. 794 She was the daughter of Fran√ßois de Caumont de La Force (eighth son of Marshal de La Force), marquis de Castelmoron and of Marguerite de Vi√ßose. Raised as a Huguenot Protestant, she converted to Catholicism in 1686 and received a pension of 1000 √©cus from Louis XIV. Like other famous women writers of the 17th century, she was named a member of the Academy of the Ricovrati of Padua. Her first novels were in the popular vein of \\"histoires secr√®tes\\", short novels recounting the \\"secret history\\" of a famous person and linking the action generally to an amorous intrigue, such as Histoire secrete de Bourgogne (1694), Histoire secr√®te de Henri IV, roi de Castille (1695), Histoire de Marguerite de Valois, reine de Navarre (1696). She had a long affair with the much younger Charles Briou, finally managing to marry him secretly with the king's permission, but her family and his father intervened to have the marriage annulled.Jack Zipes, The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparolatsa and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 830, In 1697, due to gossip and scandalous rumors about her, the king forced Mademoiselle de La Force to take to the Benedictine abbey of Gercy-en-Brie or risk losing her pension, and it was from here that she wrote her memoirs: Pens√©es chr√©tiennes de d√©funte de Mlle de La Force. She is also well known for participating in the 17th century vogue of contes des f√©es along with Henriette-Julie de Murat, Marie Catherine d'Aulnoy, Marie-Jeanne Lh√©ritier, and Charles Perrault.

It is the site of the landmark Sentech Tower, and is near the suburbs of Auckland Park and Melville. History The suburb of Brixton was first surveyed in 1902 from a portion of the farm Braamfontein. The suburb was named after the Brixton suburb in London with many of the area's streets taking their names from districts in the British capital. The ridge on which the area was developed in the early 20th century offers a panoramic view of most surrounding areas of Johannesburg. Brixton consists of wide, neat streets containing some 980 houses, many of which are traditional semi-detached homes with low set walls. Architecture The suburb possesses several distinctive churches, with one having been built by Sir Herbert Baker and Frank Fleming. A few Brixton houses have been declared provincial heritage sites. The area also features one of the largest cemeteries in Johannesburg. Laid out in 1912, Brixton Cemetery has a historic Hindu crematorium which was organised by Mahatma Gandhi shortly before his departure from South Africa in 1914. The commanding Sentech Tower overlooks the area. Built in 1962, the tower is used for broadcasting television and radio stations across the country. The tower once featured a restaurant at its top, but this was closed in 1982 due to political tensions. Kingston Frost Park The area is also home to the Kingston Frost Park. Originally called the Brixton Park when it was laid out in 1925, the park was renamed the Kingston Frost Park in 1939 in honor of the Johannesburg city councillor, AC Kingston Frost. Visitors to the park are greeted with a tall beacon commemorating those who died in World War I. Gentrification The image of the Brixton Central Business District is still perceived as negative. The area's disheveled High Street stores still lack business investors and parking and entertainment venues remain scarce. Brixton has traditionally been a working class suburb, but has seen an influx of a few professionals in recent years. The area's low property prices and the ridge's panoramic views have attracted new residents to the area although there are many areas that are perceived as dilapidated and overcrowded. There is also an extremely large, ever growing student population which attend the nearby University of the Witwatersrand and University of Johannesburg.

Plot summary Two astronauts explore the moon and come across a space dumpster - when they open it, the evil sorceress Rita Repulsa and her minions Goldar, Squatt, Baboo, and Finster are set free from a 10,000-year captivity. Rita decides to conquer the nearest planet: Earth, and rebuilds her palace on the moon. In the city of Angel Grove, California, five teenagers - Jason Lee Scott, Zack Taylor, Billy Cranston, Trini Kwan and Kimberly Hart - are hanging out at the Angel Grove Youth Center. The guys are working on karate, while the girls are practicing gymnastics. Farkas Bulkmeier and Eugene Skullovitch (a.k.a. \\"Bulk\\" and \\"Skull\\") come to harass them, but end up making fools of themselves. The teens are later sitting down to some fruit shakes from Ernie's Juice Bar when Rita causes an earthquake. In the Command Center, which is located in a desert area, Zordon, the wise wizard who once battled Rita many years ago, tells his robotic assistant, Alpha 5, to find and teleport to him five teenagers to safeguard Earth from Rita's schemes. The teens are then teleported to the Command Center, where Zordon explains the situation and declares them as the first Power Rangers, giving them belt-stored Power Morphers that serve as the key to accessing their power. They refuse to believe or trust him, until Rita sends a team of her Putty Patrollers to attack them. They are soon overpowered by the Putties' numbers, but Jason suggests using their recently acquired Power Morphers. They instantly morph into the Power Rangers for the first time, with Alpha 5 soon informing Zordon that the teens have morphed. Zordon, satisfied after hearing this news, has Alpha 5 then teleport the Rangers to Angel Grove City - Rita has sent down Goldar. A clash between Goldar (who is assisted by a newly sent team of Putty Patrollers) and the Rangers begins as soon as the teleportation is complete. It's not long before Rita has her magic staff enlarge Goldar for a giant-sized attack on the city, but the Rangers, in response, quickly summon the Dinozords and form the Megazord. After a few minutes of an evenly matched battle, the Rangers successfully force Goldar to retreat when the Megazord's Power Sword is summoned. Back at the Command Center, the teens are finally convinced that they can save the world from Rita's evil and so decide to accept Zordon's request under his three conditions: * Not to use their power for personal gain... * Not to escalate a battle unless Rita forces them to do so... * And to keep their identities a secret - no one is to know that they are now Power Rangers. Zordon promises that he will be there to advise them whenever they need his wisdom and guidance.

It contained the same basic story as the released \\"Day of the Dumpster\\", but with several differences. This included actress Audri DuBois in the role of Trini and Bobby Val as Skull, different voice actors for the villains, the local hangout being a bowling alley instead of Ernie's Juice Bar, and Alpha having a different body shape. In its original unaired, unedited form the archetypal Zords are referred to as \\"Droids\\", the Power Morphers referred to as \\"Transmorphers\\" and Zordon was referred to as \\"Zoltar\\". The morphing and teleportation sequences were also different. A second pilot episode was presented in 2007 at the inaugural Power Morphicon convention by Tony Oliver. This featured Thuy Trang as Trini, Jason Narvy as Skull, and Richard Genelle as Ernie, as well as other aspects that made it to the aired series premiere. Scenes from the second pilot would later be used for the episode \\"Big Sisters\\". Re-versioning As part of the 2010 re- versioned broadcast of the series, several visual effects were added to the scenes to produce the effect of new footage being broadcast in addition to some scenes removed. This includes cutting in comic book-referenced graphics similar to the movie Creepshow and adding onomatopoeia words on screen, akin to the 1960s Batman series, or possibly even referencing 1994's Super Sentai incarnation, Ninja Sentai Kakuranger, which was the source material for Season 3 and the special spin-off continuation of the third season, Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers.

The Russian victory ratified for Safavid Iran's cession of their territories in the North Caucasus, South Caucasus and contemporary northern Iran to Russia, comprising the cities of Derbent (southern Dagestan) and Baku and their nearby surrounding lands, as well as the provinces of Gilan, Shirvan, Mazandaran and Astarabad conform the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723). The territories remained in Russian hands for nine and twelve years, when respectively according to the Treaty of Resht of 1732 and the Treaty of Ganja of 1735, they were returned to Iran. Background Before the war, the nominal Russian border was the Terek River. South of that, the Khanates of Dagestan were nominal vassals of Iran. The ultimate cause of the war was Russia's desire to expand to the southeast and the temporary weakness of Iran. At the start of the war, the Iranian capital was under siege. The formal pretext was the grave damage inflicted to the many Russian merchants who inhabited the Safavid Iranian city of Shamakhi. In 1721, rebellious Lezgins, from within the declining Safavid Empire, had sacked and looted the city, killing many of its inhabitants including several Russian merchants. Artemy Volynsky, Russia's ambassador to Safavid Iran reported on the great damage done to the Russian merchants, to then incumbent Tsar Peter the Great (r. 1682‚Äì1725). The report stipulated that the 1721 event was a clear violation of the 1717 Russo-Iranian trade treaty, by which the latter guaranteed to ensure the protection of Russian nationals within the Safavid domains. With Safavid Iran in chaos, and the Safavid ruler in no possible way able to safeguard the provisions of the treaty, Volynsky urged Peter to take advantage of the situation, and to invade Iran, on the pretext of restoring order as an ally of the Safavid king. Indeed, Russia shortly after used the attack on its merchants in Shamakhi as the pretext to launch the war. Preparations Between 1714-20, several Russian sailors had mapped the Caspian Sea. On 15 July 1722, Peter issued a manifesto in several local languages justifying the invasion, drawn up by Dimitrie Cantemir. Peter gathered 22,000 infantry, 9,000 dragoons and 70,000 Cossacks, Tatars and Kalmyks. For transport, he created the Caspian Flotilla at Astrakhan under Fyodor Apraksin. The infantry, artillery and stores were to be shipped by sea to the mouth of the Sulak River while the cavalry went overland from Tsaritsyn and Mozdok. By the time Peter was assembling his forces for the attack, the Safavid state had already entered the final stages of collapse. Campaign All dates old style used in Russian accounts of the time, followed by the new style (N.S.) modern equivalent, 11 days ahead of the Julian calendar. Phase One (1722) The flotilla arrived at the mouth of the Sulak on 27 July 1722 (August 7 N.S.) and Peter, carried ashore by four boatmen, was the first to disembark. There, he learned that some of his cavalry had been defeated by Kumyks and Chechens at Enderey ‚Äî the first time the two peoples had fought. Peter responded with a punitive expedition using Kalmukh troops. He went south and camped at what later became Petrovsk. On August 12 (August 23 N.S.), he made a state entry into Tarki, the capital of the Shamkhalate of Tarki, where the ruler received him as a friend. Next day, he headed south to Derbent, the flotilla following coastwise. He sent envoys to the next major ruler, the Sultan of Utemish.

The mountaineers fought valiantly, but could not withstand the disciplined infantry. Utemish was burned and all the prisoners hanged in revenge for the murder of the envoys. On learning of this, the Khan of Derbent offered Peter the keys to the city in August 23 (September 3 N.S.). Derbent is at a narrow point on the coastal plain and has long been considered the northern gateway to Iran. While in Derbent, he learned that the flotilla had been caught in a storm and most of the supplies lost. Since there was no possibility of resupply this late in the season, he left a strong garrison at Derbent, marched back to the Terek River, took ship to Astrakhan and, on December 13 (December 24 N.S.), made a triumphal entry into Moscow. Phase Two (1722/23) Vakhtang VI of Kartli (central Georgia) was a vassal of Iran and had been their captive for seven years. Given the weakness of Iran, he made an arrangement with Russia. In September 1722, he advanced on Ganja. When the Russians did not join him, he returned to Tbilisi in November. This provocation of Iran led to a disastrous invasion of his country. Before leaving Astrakhan, Peter, on 6 November (17 November N.S.), sent Colonel Shipov and two battalions south to occupy the Iranian city of Rasht at the southwest corner of the Caspian. The locals wanted help against the Afghans but quickly changed their minds. 15000 men were gathered, Shah Tamasp ordered the Russians out (February) and towards the end of March the Russians defeated the Iranians, and had decisively taken the Caspian Sea town. After a long siege on 26 June 1723 (7 July 1723 N.S.) General Matyushkin took the Iranian town of Baku and soon Shirvan to the west and then the three Iranian provinces on the south coast of the Caspian Sea. On September 12 (September 23 N.S.), the Russians and Iranians made a treaty in which the Russians would drive out the Afghans and restore Shah Tahmasp to the throne in return for the cession of Derbent, Baku and the three south coast provinces. Next year, Prince Meshchersky went to Iran but was unable to secure ratification and was almost killed. The war was formally concluded by the 1723 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, which recognized the Russian annexation of the west and south coasts of the Caspian. By the 1724 Treaty of Constantinople, Russia recognized Turkish control of nearly everything west of what they had captured, thereby partitioning Transcaucasia between the two powers. The Russians lost many soldiers to disease. At the same time, Nader Shah restored Iranian power. In 1732, through the Treaty of Resht, Russia withdrew to approximately the current Iranian border. In 1735, as a result of the Treaty of Ganja, Russia withdrew to its former border along the Terek River. Aftermath The war was a costly war for both sides in different measures. Iran had lost swaths of its territories, while Russia had suffered large human losses. The campaign proved costly; of the 61,039 men who took part, 36,663 did not return. Grave damage was inflicted by the Russians on the occupied areas. Thus, in Gilan, one of the consequences of the occupation was the rapid decline of sericulture, as many of those involved in it fled. It took years for the industry to revive. Peter was determined to keep the newly conquered Iranian territories in the Caucasus and northern mainland Iran. However, he was concerned about their safety and thus ordered the fortifications at Derbent and Holy Cross to be strengthened. He was determined to attach Gilan and Mazandaran to Russia. In May 1724, the Tsar wrote to Matiushkin, Russian commander in Rasht, that he should invite \\"Armenians and other Christians, if there are such, to Gilan and Mazandaran and settle them, while Muslims should be very quietly, so that they would not know it, diminished in number as much as possible.\\" In 1732, on the eve of the Russo-Turkish War, the government of Empress Anna Ioannovna, Peter's successor, returned many of the annexed territories to Iran as a part of the Treaty of Resht, to construct an alliance with the Safavids against the Ottoman Empire.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol. II, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 729. By the 1735 Treaty of Ganja, the remaining territories were returned, including Derbent, Baku and Tarki, and Iran was again in full possession of its territories in the North and South Caucasus and in contemporary northern Iran. The Russian troops nevertheless had not evacuated from the Iranian provinces until 1734. As The Cambridge History of Iran adds, \\"perhaps the only long-term consequence was the consciousness on the part of Russia's rulers that their armies had once marched beyond the Caucasus, that the Russian flag had flown over the southern shore of the Caspian Sea.\\" However, the sequel was additionally disastrous for the Georgian rulers who had supported Peter's venture. In eastern Georgia, Vakhtang VI of Kartli lost his throne and sought protection of the Russian court in 1724. In western Georgia, Alexander V of Imereti had to accept an Ottoman suzerainty on more stringent terms. The Ottomans, further, alarmed by the Russian intervention, strengthened their hold along the Caucasian coastline.Allen, W.E.D.

Biography Karppinen won the world titles in 1979 and 1985 and once held the world record in indoor rowing. His style was to row a steady race and finish with a devastating sprint. In the early portions of the race, he would often trail his rivals by several boat length, only to catch them at the race finish. Karppinen and great German sculler Peter-Michael Kolbe had one of the greatest rivalries in the history of the sport. Although Kolbe has more Olympic and World Championship medals than any other single sculler in history, he never won an Olympic gold medal. Twice, in 1976 and 1984, Kolbe had the lead the entire race, only to be passed in the last few meters of the race by Karppinen. Kolbe and Karppinen did not face each other in the 1980 Games because West Germany chose to boycott the games to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Karppinen and Kolbe faced each other one last time at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Karppinen missed making the finals, but won the consolation race for seventh place. Kolbe again won a silver medal being beaten by prodigy Thomas Lange. Karppinen would go on to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics finishing in tenth place. Karppinen and Russia's Vyacheslav Ivanov are the only men to win gold medals in the single scull at three straight Olympics. Besides single sculls, Karppinen also rowed doubles with his younger brother Reima and won a silver medal at the 1981 World Rowing Championships. Currently Karppinen works as a national rowing coach, and also trains his son Juho, and daughter Eeva, who both compete in rowing at the international level.

Publishing history Flesh debuted in 2000 AD's first issue in 1977. The series was set in the age of dinosaurs who were farmed for their meat by cowboys from the future. The series was initially planned by Mills to be in Action, but after that title suffered censorship, Mills held the story back for his next project which eventually became 2000 AD. The strip followed a similar path to Hook Jaw, one of the strips Mills had written in Action, in that it featured humans trying to dominate nature for their own purposes before falling prey to nature itself. Mills's original story's frontier setting was also influenced by Westworld, including tourists treating the dinosaurs as entertainment (coincidentally, Michael Crichton, the author of Westworld, would later go on to write Jurassic Park). Flesh Book 1 ran for the first 19 issues of 2000 AD as well as the 1977 annual, and ending its run that year. While Flesh was popular, the series was not mentioned again until 1978 when Satanus, Book 1's Tyrannosaurus antagonist, appeared in the Judge Dredd story The Cursed Earth. The series was revived and returned with Flesh Book Two in issue 86, which was written by Kelvin Gosnell and primarily drawn by Massimo Belardinelli. The series gained popularity and ran until issue 99. Further books followed in issues 800‚Äì808 and 817‚Äì825, written by Mills and Tony Skinner with art by Carl Critchlow, and issues 973‚Äì979 written by Dan Abnett and Steve White with art by Gary Erskine and Simon Jacob. After a 10-year absence from 2000 AD, Flesh returned in 2007 with \\"Hand of Glory\\", a prequel to the events of Book 1. 4 years later, Book 1's sequel, \\"Texas\\", appeared 2000 AD. This arc remained unfinished and was followed by the sequel \\"Midnight Cowboys\\" in 2012. Flesh again returned in 2013 with \\"Badlanders\\" which featured the return of Book 1 characters set before the conclusion of Book 2. While Flesh Book 1 was published in black-and-white, Book 2 featured colour pages and dinosaurs covered in feathers‚Äînearly 40 years before feathered dinosaurs became commonly accepted.

Netscape, 306 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 2002), is a case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit regarding the enforceability of browse-wrap software licenses. The court held that merely clicking on a download button does not show assent to license terms if those terms were not conspicuous and if it was not explicit to the consumer that clicking meant agreeing to the license. Case The plaintiffs brought suit against Netscape Communications Corporation, alleging the defendant's SmartDownload plug-in invaded the plaintiffs' privacy in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\\"The Original Complaint in Specht v. Netscape and AOL\\", Tech Law Journal, accessed October 1st, 2010 Netscape moved to compel arbitration and to stay court proceedings, arguing that the plaintiffs agreed to arbitration in the End User License Agreement. This means that any disputes, such as an invasion of privacy, would be settled out of court by an arbitrator. The plaintiffs allegedly accepted this EULA when they downloaded the plug-in.Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 306 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 2002). The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York denied Netscape's motion.Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 150 F. Supp. 2d 585 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard the appeal, and affirmed the district court's decision, finding that \\"plaintiffs neither received reasonable notice of the existence of the license terms nor manifested unambiguous assent to those terms before acting on the web page‚Äôs invitation to download the plug-in program\\". Facts * The plaintiffs allege that SmartDownload transmitted to Netscape the URL of the file being downloaded along with a HTTP cookie and a \\"key\\" (similar to a cookie) that would identify the user of the computer. * Five of the six plaintiffs downloaded Netscape Communicator, which consists of Netscape Navigator and other web software, from the Netscape website, and all five of them acknowledge that they clicked \\"Yes\\", indicating assent to the terms of the click-wrap license agreement for Communicator. This is not to be confused with accepting the license agreement for SmartDownload. * When downloading SmartDownload, there was no click-wrap presentation. After downloading the software, there was no further information about the plug-in or the existence of license terms. The reference to license terms was only visible if the plaintiffs scrolled down beyond the Download button. * The SmartDownload license contained a provision requiring disputes related to the agreement to be submitted to arbitration. * Plaintiff Christopher Specht never downloaded or used SmartDownload. He operated a website that provided files for download. He alleged that the defendants intercepted information every time users downloaded files from him using SmartDownload. * The defendants alleged that Specht received a direct benefit under the SmartDownload license agreement‚Äîenough such that he should have to arbitrate his claims pursuant to the license terms. Specht claims that he never received any commission for providing files for download. Decision The crux of the issue is whether or not the plaintiff's agreed to be bound by the defendant's licensing terms when they downloaded the free plug-in, even though the plaintiffs could not have learned of the existence of the terms before downloading. The court found that \\"a reasonably prudent Internet user in circumstances such as these would not have known or learned of the existence of the license terms before responding to defendants‚Äô invitation to download the free software, and that defendants therefore did not provide reasonable notice of the license terms\\". Claims related to SmartDownload are not covered by the license agreement for Netscape Communicator, despite the fact that SmartDownload is meant to enhance the functioning of Communicator. This means that when the plaintiffs clicked through Communicator's license agreement, they were not agreeing to the SmartDownload agreement. Specht was not bound by the SmartDownload agreement as a non-contracting beneficiary because he had no preexisting relationship with the parties, was not an agent of any party, and received no direct benefit from users downloading files from his website. Subsequent history The parties settled the case in a fortuitous manner for Netscape, which was required to stop collecting data and to delete existing data. However, the settlement explicitly denies any violation by Netscape. Because of this, the plaintiffs were unable to collect damages under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.Eric Goldman and Matt Goeden, \\"Specht v.

He also served as interim head coach of the Browns in the final game of the 1977 season. Modzelewski was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993. Early life Growing up in West Natrona, Pennsylvania as one of six children, Modzelewski was a three-sport athlete at Har-Brack High School (now Highlands High School). College career Modzelewski joined his brother, Ed, and played college football at the University of Maryland. Just as he was set to begin his sophomore season, Modzelewski moved into the starting lineup after an injury to the Terrapins' Ray Krouse. He would keep that status for the next three years, winning All-American honors as both a junior and senior, while also capturing the 1952 Outland Trophy. In a 1951 game against the University of North Carolina, Modzelewski paced a defense with 12 solo tackles, while the team held the Tar Heels to just 40 yards of offense. At the end of that season, Maryland was ranked third in the country and knocked off the top-ranked University of Tennessee Volunteers in the Sugar Bowl. Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins took notice of Modzelewski's accomplishments and drafted him in the second round of the 1953 NFL Draft, signing him on April 10. In his two years with the team, Modzelewski showed promise as a rookie, then began having conflicts with Redskins' coach Joe Kuharich in 1954. As a result, Modzelewski signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League, ready to play for former Maryland assistant coach Jack Hennemier. However, after the Redskins filed an injunction to stop the deal, the Stampeders signed an agreement to tear up the contract. Pittsburgh Steelers With Modzelewski unhappy, the Redskins traded him to the Pittsburgh Steelers on March 1, 1955, once again reuniting him with brother Ed, a fullback on the team. The brothers would not play together though, as Ed was traded to the Cleveland Browns as a replacement for retiring Hall of Famer Marion Motley, with whom he won the NFL Championship. Dick was once again traded, this time twice in a four-day span. On April 24, 1956, he was traded to the Detroit Lions, then was dealt three days later to the New York Giants. In an ironic twist, the player the Lions received was Krouse, whose 1950 injury at Maryland had led to Modzelewski's development. New York Giants Over the next eight seasons, the Giants played for the NFL championship six times, but their only victory came during Modzelewski's first season in 1956. Among a colorful group of defenders, Modzelewski's low- key approach often saw him remain in the shadow of these players, but his presence helped the team remain a perennial title contender. Cleveland Browns On March 4, 1964, Modzelewski was traded to the Browns, in exchange for wide receiver Bobby Crespino. Originally expected to be a supplement to starting defensive tackles Jim Kanicki and Frank Parker, Modzelewski was rushed into the lineup following an injury to Parker in the season opener on September 13. Over the course of the season, Modzelewski's veteran leadership helped lead the Browns to their first Eastern Conference title in seven years. In the NFL Championship game on December 27, he joined an aggressive defense in completely shutting down the Baltimore Colts offense, giving the Browns a 27-0 shutout victory. In his final two years as a player, the Browns again reached the title game in 1965, but fell short the following year. During his final campaign, Modzelewski was joined by another brother, Gene, who played one season before fulfilling a military commitment. Coaching career Modzelewski served as a scout for the Browns in 1967, then joined the team's on-field staff the following year as defensive line coach. After two solid years in which the team again reached the NFL Championship game, the Browns' fortunes declined over the next five years, with a then-team-worst 3‚Äì11 record in 1975 forcing head coach Forrest Gregg to make changes. On February 13, 1976, Modzelewski was promoted to defensive coordinator and the team responded with a six-game improvement. Midway through the 1977 season, the Browns had a 5‚Äì2 record and seemed destined for their first playoff berth in five years. However, a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Brian Sipe led to a tailspin that culminated with Gregg's dismissal on December 13. Modzelewski was named interim head coach for the team's final game, a 20‚Äì19 loss to the second-year Seattle Seahawks. As 1978 began, new Browns head coach Sam Rutigliano quickly announced he was eliminating the defensive coordinator position, and offered Modzelewski the job of defensive line coach. Seeing the offer as a demotion, Modzelewski resigned and returned to the New York Giants as their defensive coordinator. That position would last only one season after another wholesale coaching change, but he would resurface as defensive line coach with the Cincinnati Bengals in 1979 under head coach Homer Rice. After first being dismissed with the entire staff one day after the end of the 1979 season, Modzelewski was rehired by Gregg, who had been selected as the Bengals' new head coach. The team struggled to a 6‚Äì10 season in 1980, but then put together a memorable year in 1981, ending with the franchise's first-ever trip to the Super Bowl. Despite a 26‚Äì21 defeat to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XVI, the Bengals returned to the post-season the following year, but lost in the first round of the expanded playoff system. After a disappointing 1983 season, Gregg left to take over his dream job: head coach of the Green Bay Packers, then brought Modzelewski with him to again serve as defensive line coach. Modzelewski eventually served as the team's defensive coordinator, but after four frustrating years, Gregg resigned and Modzelewski landed with the Lions in 1988 as the defensive line tutor. He spent two years in that role until announcing his retirement. Legacy In 1993, Modzelewski was honored for his college football exploits with his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame and in 1986, Dick was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/football/dick-modzelewski/ Dick Modzelewski played and started in 8 NFL championship games. 1956, 1958, 1959, 1961‚Äì1963 with the New York Giants, and 1964 and 1965 with the Cleveland Browns.

The history of uranium prospecting, especially in the Colorado Plateau of North America, has seen several methods of identifying likely ore body locations. The use of radiation detectors, such as Geiger counters and scintillation counter is one such method. Another method widely used relies on knowledge of the geologic history of an area, such as locating a geologic formation known to host ore deposits.  United States  During the early efforts to locate uranium deposits in the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey conducted studies of prospecting through botanical surveys. These studies examined three methods. Each method begins with the identification of an area of interest. This area is then gridded off, which allows the prospector to map samples to specific locations on the ground.  Plant morphology variations  The first method, not widely used in the Colorado Plateau, looks for physiologic and morphologic changes in plants growing in or around ore bodies. A survey of plants in the gridded area is conducted. Comparison of normal growth habits and rates is done with known normal plants, and areas with high rates of change in either physiology or morphology indicate likely spots for further prospecting. This method is time consuming, and is not useful in all areas.  Deep-rooted plants  The second method uses a survey of deep-rooted plants in an area of interest. This works because the plant roots carry uranium to the surface, where it is concentrated in growing areas of the plant. Juniper or saltbrush are usually used, as they are known uranium concentrators. Samples of tree branch tips and leaves are taken from each area in the grid. These samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis. Concentrations of more than 1 part in a million-(> 1 ppm) of uranium indicate likely areas to investigate further, through drilling or digging. This method provides information about likely ore bodies down to a depth of between 50 and 70 feet, and is generally good in areas where mineralized beds form broad flat benches, so that a grid pattern can be used.  Indicator plant species  The third method looks for concentrations of indicator plant species in an area of interest. Some uranium ore bodies contain higher concentrations of certain elements, such as selenium, than the surrounding host rock in which they are found. Certain plants that concentrate these elements act as indicator species for likely ore body locations. Mapping these plants provides information about areas in which further prospecting should be done. For example, in areas such as the Colorado Plateau, various species of Astragalus are selenium concentrators (A. pattersoni, A. preussi, A. thompsonae). Other indicator plants for sulfur and calcium, such as Eriogonum inflatum and Oenothera caespitosa help to identify likely areas also, especially in conjunction with the selenium indicators.  Other regions  In areas outside the Colorado Plateau, such as in South Australia or Saskatchewan, Canada, other plants would naturally be used.

The family contains about 1,600 described species worldwide, most diverse in arid and semiarid regions with sandy soils. The larvae are predators of insect larvae in soil.German wikipedia: Luchsfliegen Plate from Johann Wilhelm Meigen Europ√§ischenZweifl√ºgeligen.Showing the gross features mentioned in the text (figures 5-9) Description Adult Therevidae are small- to medium-sized with a body length of 2.4 to 18 mm and a hairy integument. The coloration ranges from shades of yellow to black, but commonly the background colour is masked by the tomentum. The compound eyes are generally larger in males, which in many species are actually holoptic. Females have well-developed compound eyes, but are clearly dichoptic. There are three ocelli. The antennae are relatively short. The scape is elongated, the pedicel very short, and the first flagellomere is conical and elongated, the apex bearing a compound stylus with one to three segments. The scape and pedicel are pubescent; In contrast to the related and confusingly similar family Asilidae, the labium in the Therevidae is not a piercing, predatory organ, but ends in two fleshy labella adapted to the sucking of liquid foods. Another difference is that, though Therevidae commonly have fluffy setae above the mouthparts, the setae are not stiff bristles like the protective chaetae comprising the mystax of most species of Asilidae. Furthermore, in the Asilidae the depression on the vertex between the eyes, tends to be more obvious than in the Therevidae. The thorax is broad and moderately convex, with long bristles (macrotrichae). The legs are long and slender, with femora and tibiae bearing bristles; the tibiae are without apical spurs and the tarsi are provided with empodia or without the median pretarsal. The wings are well developed, hyaline or opaque, often with pigmentation of the veins located at the termination of the transverse and longitudinal veins. The abdomen is tapered and elongated, typically 3 to 4 times as long as its broadest width when not extended for activities such as oviposition. Eight abdominal segments (uriti) are externally visible. Diagram of wing veins. Longitudinal veins: C: costa; Sc: subcosta; R: radius; M: media; Cu: cubitus; A: anal. Crossveins: h: humeral; r-m: radio-medial; m-m: medial; m-cu: medio-cubital.Cells: d: discal; br: 1st basal; bm: 2nd basal; r1: marginal; r3: 1st submarginal; r4: 2nd submarginal; r5: 1st posterior; m1: 2nd posterior; m2: 3rd posterior; m3: 4th posterior; cup: cell cup The wing venation is relatively complex but without a particular conformation to distinguish the Therevidae from other families of Asiloidea. The radius is divided into four branches, with R 2 +3 undivided. The branch R 4 is long and winding and reaches the costal margin, the branch R 5 terminates on the posterior border, so the second submarginal cell is open at the apex of the wing. The media is divided into four branches, all independent but with M 3 and M 4 convergent. The transverse medial vein closes the discal cell. This has an elongated shape and terminates at the apex with three angles from which the first three branches of media spring. The fourth branch, M 4 (or CuA 1 according to a different interpretation), originates from the apex of the posterior basal discal cell. The cubit and anal converge on a short common branch before reaching the apex. The larva is apodous and eucephalic, cylindrical, very long and thin, and with tapered ends. The integument is smooth, white, or pink. The head capsule is well developed, but narrower than the other regions. Biology Oviposition of Thereva cincta Knowledge of the biology of the Therevidae is limited and fragmented. The lifecycle is usually carried out in a single generation per year, although some European Therevidae have a cycle of two or more years. The overwintering stage is represented by the mature larva. The postembryonic development in known forms, five instars and pupation takes place in the spring. The larvae, like those of other Asiloidea, have an entomophagous diet and they live as predators. They are generally found on dry, sandy soils and dry litter. Larvae also are located in other substrates such as decomposing organic matter and under the bark of trees. Among the prey are the larvae and pupae of Diptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The observation of the behaviour of known forms highlights voracious feeding and agile movements. When exposed to light, the larvae of the Therevidae dig back into the substrate with rapid movements. Adults feed mainly on nectar, honeydew, and pollen, but they occasionally feed on liquid secretions of animal or vegetable origin. They are found in various environments and can be found in streams, meadows, open woodlands, or, like many other Asiloidea, in dry and sandy places or on beaches. At rest, they choose various substrates according to the species: some species rest on the ground, others on rocks, vegetation, or intertidal debris. They are generally diurnal and move in short, quick flights. Although inhabiting semiarid regions, or possibly for that very reason, since that is where prey for their larvae are likely to be plentiful, adults are particularly attracted to water, generally remaining near pools or other sources of moisture. Systematics and phylogeny The family Therevidae is little known and it resembles other many other Brachycera, both in morphology and ethology. The taxonomic history of the Therevidae accordingly has undergone repeated revisions; in the past, many therevids were assigned to other families, and many other Brachycera were assigned to the Therevidae. Since the 1970s however, there has been a great deal of rationalisation of the taxonomy, particularly by Lyneborg and Irwin. Revision of the higher taxa, based on the phylogenetic cladistic relationships between various groups of Asiloidea has led to a better understanding of their ranks and interrelationships. Originally the Therevidae sensu lato, were polyphyletic. It required the reassignment of some subfamilies to other families, together with adjustments to closely related families in the Asiloidea, to establish consistent phylogenetic relationships. The Therevidae now constitute a monophyletic clade that English-speaking dipterologists call the therevoid clade (clade of \\"Terevoidi\\"). This group has not been assigned a ranking at any taxonomic level above the rank of family, but for the present is recognised as a group of families within the superfamily Asiloidea. Therevoid clade Clade showing relationship of Asiloidea At present, over 1, 600 species are known. After taxonomic revisions by Lyneborg (1976) and Winterston et al. (2001), the family is divided into four subfamilies, among which the most representative in size and diffusion is the Therevinae: *Agapophytinae: 12 genera *Phycinae: 13 genera *Therevinae: 84 genera *Xestomyzinae: 12 genera To the 121 living genera are added extinct genera, dating back to the Cenozoic, Dasystethos, Glaesorthactia, Kroeberiella, and Palaeopherocera, in doubt is Helicorhaphe Habitat and distribution The habitat of the Therevidae is more varied than that of other Asiloidea, but as in Asiloidea, preferred ecosystems better suit the larvae, so these insects are more common in thickets of xerophilous plants (garrigue and maquis, in deserts and on sandy beaches. The Therevidae are represented in all zoogeographical regions of the Earth. The Therevinae are present in all continents, with a lower frequency in the eastern region . The Phycinae have spread to the Afrotropical and the Holarctic. The Xestomyzinae are mainly Afrotropical. The Agapophytinae are endemic to the Australasian realm. In Europe, only the subfamilies are represented:- Phycinae, with two genera, and Therevinae, with 15 genera. A total of 98 species are reported, two-thirds of which belong to the genus Thereva.

Key Marco was an archaeological site (8CR48) consisting of a large shell works island next to Marco Island, Florida. A small pond on Key Marco, now known as the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" (8CR49),8CR48 designates the entire Key Marco site, while 8CR49 designates just the pond known at the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" within the Key Marco site.(Widmer:2000:ix) was excavated in 1896 by the Smithsonian Institution's Pepper-Hearst Expedition, led by Frank Hamilton Cushing. Cushing recovered more than 1,000 wooden artifacts from the pond, the largest number of wooden artifacts from any prehistoric archaeological site in the eastern United States. These artifacts are described as some of the finest prehistoric Native American art in North America. The Key Marco materials are principally divided between the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Pennsylvania; the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution; and the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida. The original pond was completely excavated and refilled. It is now covered by a housing subdivision. Excavations of small parts of the site were also conducted in 1965 and 1995. Names The island of Key Marco was composed of shell mounds and other shell works and separate from Marco Island in the 19th century. A late 19th century settlement on the island was called Marco Village. The Olde Marco Inn on the north end of the island was founded in 1887. The name of the settlement on the island was changed to Collier City in 1927. By late in the 20th century Key Marco had been attached to Marco Island and all of the mounds on Key Marco had been leveled and built on. The area is now known as Old Marco Village. One source of confusion in the name is Marion Gilliland's use of \\"Key Marco\\" to refer to all of Marco Island. Another source of confusion arises from the fact that in the 1980s a development company renamed the former Horr's Island as \\"Key Marco\\". Horr's Island was the location of an independently significant archaeological site. It has one of the oldest indigenous burial mounds of the eastern United States, dating to about 1450 BCE; and it was the site of the largest, permanently occupied community of the Archaic period (8000 BCE- 1000 BCE) in the southeastern part of the nation.Brown:31, 36, 38Widmer 2000:xi-x Pepper-Hearst excavation Map of Key Marco, showing the pond known as the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" in blue, the Van Beck excavation of 1964 in gold, and the Widmer excavation of 1995 in brown. Water color painting by Wells Moses Sawyer of a carved and painted mask excavated from the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" The \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\"The name \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" refers to Cushing's proposal that the people of Key Marco had lived on pile dwellings over the water in the pond, based on finding many toppled pilings in the pond.(Widmer 2000:xviii- xix) at Key Marco was a small muck pond, covering less than an acre. The conditions in the muck preserved the wood and other objects, including those made with bone, fiber, gum, rawhide and gut. Objects of stone, shell and pottery were also found in the pond.Brown:27Widmer 1988:49 A great variety of artifacts were found in the pond, including bowls, mortars and pestles, spears, atlatls, cords, ropes, nets, net floats, fishhooks, carved clubs, wooden tablets and plaques, wood ear spools, realistically carved animal heads, carved and painted masks, and a carved wooden feline/human figure (the so-called \\"Key Marco cat\\"). Many of the wooden objects, besides the masks, had been painted. The colors were still vivid when the objects were first removed from the muck. The artifacts were very well preserved due to being buried in the wet conditions.Brown:27 At the time the pond was excavated, techniques for preserving wood and other fragile materials removed from the muck had not been developed. The colors on the painted objects quickly faded, and many objects quickly deteriorated. But, a photographer with the excavation party recorded all the objects soon after they were removed from the pond, thus preserving evidence of their appearance. Watercolors were also prepared by Wells M. Sawyer showing the colors of the painted objects.Brown:29 Dating the finds from the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\" has been a problem. Because of the limited knowledge of the archaeological discipline at the time, no record of the stratification of the objects was kept. They cannot be placed in sequence. There is no sign of European trade goods or influence in the finds. Radiocarbon dating did not exist at the time of excavation. Radiocarbon dating of objects which have been handled and stored away from their original environment for long periods may not be reliable. In the 1960s an attempt to radiocarbon date some objects yielded a date of 1670 AD. A second attempt in 1975 using five different objects yielded dates from 55 AD to 850 AD.Brown:29-30 Van Beck excavation In 1965 Van Beck and Van Beck excavated part of a tall mound about northeast of the \\"Court of the Pile Dwellers\\". Two test pits yielded a large of number of potsherds in distinct strata. The potsherds all belong to the Glades periods II and III. The density of the potsherds indicates that the Key Marco site had a high population density, and presumably political complexity during both Glades period II and III.Widmer 1988:49, 91-2Widmer 2000:x, xvii Widmer excavation In 1995 the Collier County Historical Society commissioned an archaeological salvage project on an undeveloped portion of Key Marco, supervised by archaeologists Randolph J. Widmer and Rebecca Storey, who trained and led a volunteer labor effort, in association with related organizations. They hoped to be able to establish more context for the archaeological site excavated by Cushing. Evidence was found of three platform mound stages, with large houses built on pilings. A stratigraphic analysis found 55 discrete layers, indicated by changes in shell and sand mixture. They found evidence of numerous postholes, which indicated a large structure built on pilings to raise it above the surface of the mound. They found additional evidence of early Glades culture, mostly through pottery remains.Randolph J. Widmer, \\"Key Marco Project\\", University of Houston, 1995 Ethnic affiliation Marco Island was occupied by the Muspa people, corresponding to the Ten Thousand Islands district of the Glades culture as defined in archaeology. Around 1300 AD, pottery and artifact styles in the Muspa area changed to become very similar to those of the Calusa people to the north, indicating a close alliance with or absorption by the Calusa.MacMahon and Marquardt.

Operations The East Prussian Offensive by the Red Army's 3rd Belarusian Front under General Ivan Chernyakhovsky commenced on January 13, 1945 and, with Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front, subsequently cut off East Prussia between January 23 and February 10, 1945. German Grand Admiral Karl D√∂nitz ordered General Admiral Oskar Kummetz, as Naval High Commander, Baltic, and Rear Admiral Konrad Engelhardt, head of the Kriegsmarine's shipping department, to plan and execute the Rettungsaktion (evacuation operation).Koburger, Charles W., Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees, Praeger Publishers, NY, 1989, p.71. D√∂nitz radioed a message to Gdynia in occupied Poland on January 23, 1945, to begin evacuations to ports outside of the Soviet area of operations. The operation was codenamed Hannibal. The flood of military personnel and German civilians eventually turned the operation into one of the largest evacuations by sea in history. Over a period of 15 weeks, somewhere between 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types, including fishing boats and other craft,Williams, David, Wartime Disasters at Sea, Patrick Stephens Limited, Nr Yeovil, UK, 1997, p.225 (figure of 494 merchant vessels); Brustat-Naval, Fritz, Unternehmen Rettung, Koehlers Verlagsgeschellshaft, Herford, Germany, 1985, p.240 (figure of 790 vessels of all types); Koburger, Charles W., Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees, Praeger Publishers, NY, 1989, p.92 (figure of 1,080 merchant vessels). and utilizing Germany's largest remaining naval units, carried between 800,000 and 900,000 German civilians and 350,000 soldiersAndreas Kossert, Damals in Ostpreussen, M√ºnchen, 2008, p.160 across the Baltic Sea to Germany and German-occupied Denmark. Operation Hannibal commenced on January 23, 1945. On January 30, Wilhelm Gustloff, Hansa, and the whaling factory ship Walter Rau left the harbor at Gdynia in occupied Poland, bound for Kiel. Hansa was forced to return to port with mechanical trouble, but the Gustloff, with more than 10,000 civilians and military personnel aboard, continued. She was torpedoed and sunk by the Soviet submarine S-13 off the Pomeranian coast, with possibly as many as 9,500 fatalities. Those on Walter Rau eventually reached Eckernf√∂rde. On February 9, the SS General von Steuben sailed from Pillau with between 3,000 and 4,000 mostly military personnel on board, heading for Swinem√ºnde. She was also sunk by the S-13, just after midnight, with 650 survivors. In early March, a task force composed of the German cruiser Admiral Scheer accompanied by three German destroyers and the Elbing-class torpedo boat were giving cover to a German bridgehead near Wollin. During that operation, naval small craft evacuated over 75,000 soldiers and civilians who had been isolated in that area. They were taken to larger warships and other transports lying offshore. While a number of these transports were sunk, large liners such as SS Deutschland got through and carried up to 11,000 soldiers and civilians each. During the night of April 4‚Äì5, a flotilla of small boats and landing craft evacuated over 30,000 soldiers and civilians from Oxh√∂fter K√§mpe and took them to Hela. It is estimated that nearly 265,000 people were evacuated from Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk) to Hela during the month of April alone. On April 15, another large convoy consisting of four liners and other transports left Hela with over 20,000 soldiers and civilians. On April 16, the Goya was torpedoed and sunk by L-3, with the loss of over 6,000 lives; 183 survived. Evacuees arriving at a western harbor, already occupied by British troops Initially, on his becoming Reich President on May 1, Karl D√∂nitz was determined to continue the war, going so far as to instruct Generaloberst Carl Hilpert that combat troops would have priority in evacuation to Germany from the Courland Pocket. It wasn't until the afternoon of May 6, with British troops practically on his doorstep, that he gave up on that plan.Grier, Howard D., Hitler/Donitz and the Baltic Sea, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 2007, p.201. From May 1 to May 8, over 150,000 people were evacuated from the beaches of Hela. At 21:00 on May 8, 1945, the last day of the war, a convoy consisting of 92 large and small vessels left the Latvian city of LiepƒÅja () with 18,000 soldiers and civilians.Bekker, Cajus, Defeat at Sea, Henry Holt and Co., 1955, p.198. While several hundred of those who had boarded small ships on the last day of the war or after were captured by Soviet MTBs, evacuations to the west continued for at least a week after all such movements were prohibited by the terms of the German surrender.  Shortages  Shortages plagued the Operation with food and medicine being seen as primary issues for the Nazi administration, causing a trend of elderly and very young children to die on board the rescue ships. Other shortages included only a three-week supply of coal remaining for the sea transport tasks and only a ten-day supply for rail transports to move troops to the front, with fuel being at its lowest levels since the war began. Losses In addition to the Goya, Wilhelm Gustloff, and General von Steuben, 158 other merchant vessels were lost during the 15-week course of Operation Hannibal (January 23 ‚Äì May 8, 1945).Koburger, p.107 See also * References Category:Baltic Sea operations of World War II Category:Evacuations Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:Naval battles and operations of the European theatre of World War II Category:January 1945 events Category:February 1945 events Category:March 1945 events Category:April 1945 events Category:May 1945 events ","title":"Operation Hannibal"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",H]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/25.md","filePath":"quotesmag/25.md"}'),D={name:"quotesmag/25.md"},F=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
