It is 5 miles (8 km) to the north east of the city centre and adjacent to Swarcliffe and Seacroft in the LS14 Leeds postcode area. Historically, the area was within the Tadcaster Rural District until 1974. It is today situated in the Leeds City Council ward of Cross Gates & Whinmoor and Leeds East parliamentary constituency. History In November 655 AD (or perhaps in 654, according to one interpretation of the chronology), the Battle of the Winwaed took place around the Whinmoor/Cock Beck/Swarcliffe area, with the Christian King Oswiu of Bernicia's army defeating the pagan army of King Penda of Mercia, although historians admit that few details are available. A road to the south of Whinmoor was later named Penda's Way. In addition, during the First English Civil War, the Battle of Seacroft Moor, 30 March 1643, was fought over the two moors of Winn Moor and Bramham Moor, near Leeds. There is no exact records of Army positions, due to the amount of movement during the battle. As Sir Thomas Fairfax was instructed to capture Tadcaster, the Royalist Northern major- general, Sir William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne planned to intercept the smaller opposition. He sent his Lieutenant-General, Lord George Goring to do so; leading a large force of Horse. Fairfax had a problem, due to having a force made up of mainly clubmen (Locally recruited soldiers) and only three troops of Cavalry; this was going to be a 'wake-up-call' for the Parliamentary forces in the North. He was literally 'thrashed' by Goring, beaten back over the moor, with many casualties. Fairfax escaped with just some of his surviving Horse to Leeds, mainly because of bad communication in the ranks. Fairfax quoted that it was \\"the greatest loss we ever received\\". Crime Crime in Whinmoor has slowly decreased, although there are still reported crimes of drug dealing and car theft. Leeds City Council purchased Whinmoor from the Tadcaster Rural District Council to build homes as an extension of the Seacroft housing development. In the early 1960s the council had planned to build 5,000 dwellings, a small shopping centre and other amenities with a pedestrian link to Seacroft. Work has begun on new homes off A64 near Red Lion public house. Planning for more homes near Wetherby Road and improvements to the Ring Road will see more change in the coming years. Other information The convenience stores at the Whinmoor terminus. Whinmoor is often classed as a part of Seacroft, a name which is used as a catch-all term for extensive council estates of eastern Leeds (also including Swarcliffe). It formerly had a large proportion of council housing, of which most are now privately owned. Until 2010, the area was part of the Elmet constituency. Colin Burgon served as the Member of Parliament for the area for 13 years having defeated the long-serving Conservative MP, Spencer Batiste, in 1997. It now sits within the Leeds East constituency, which includes Cross Gates, Whinmoor, Seacroft, Gipton, Harehills, Killingbeck, Temple Newsam, Halton Moor, Halton, Whitkirk, Colton and Austhorpe.

The Panama, Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group Inc. won a $65 million contract to build the vessel, an 82-car ferry. Grand Manan residents were invited to participate in a contest to name the new vessel, and a panel of local residents reviewed the entries and made the selection. The winning name was the Grand Manan Adventure, and was submitted by Deborah Avery. For submitting the winning entry, she was also awarded a spot for herself and three guests on the vessel's maiden voyage, along with certificates and a plaque.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/florida-company- wins-65m-contract-to-build-grand-manan-ferry-1.800193; http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/tran/2010e0145tr.htm The Adventure is a 281-foot, single-ended roll-on, roll-off ferry that can accommodate 82 cars or 10 full- size tractor trailers in four vehicle lanes, and a maximum of 380 people.

However, the new vessel has been plagued with problems from the outset: *On July 26, 2011, during sea trials in Florida, the ferry overheated due to a pipe failure; subsequent repairs delayed the intended delivery date by several weeks. *On August 15, 2011, four days after its maiden voyage, the ferry began experiencing electrical issues, which manifested themselves in the failure of the bow thrusters, one after the other, following docking. It was returned to service on August 18, but was returned to dry dock on September 11 for 10 days of additional repairs. These repairs were covered by warranty. *On October 5, 2011 (shortly after being returned to service), the ferry experienced further engine problems, forcing it to dock on October 6, 2011. A broken bolt caused problems with one of the cylinders, requiring extensive repairs. It remained out of service until October 25. *On March 31, 2012, the ferry broke down due to a faulty seal and remained out of service for nine days.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new- brunswick/out-of-service-ferry-frustrates-grand-manan-residents-1.1199054; http://country94.ca/news/coastal-transport-calls-ferry-problems-teething- issues *On July 22, 2013, the ferry experienced mechanical difficulties and went out of service.

It returned to service on August 11. On August 11, 2015, the provincial government announced they had a plan to study the chronic problems the vessel had been having, in order to determine their cause. The Department of Transportation and Infrastructure stated they planned to engage an independent team from Newfoundland to assess the situation. Early speculation from locals has focused on how many of the problems have originated on the port side of the vessel. Frustration among the local population has been mounting. When interviewed by the CBC, former MLA Eric Allaby said: \\"there's something dreadfully wrong with some of the mechanics of this ferry.\\" Local resident Tammy Worthen stated that the boat was now \\"affectionately known as the 'Misadventure.'\\" Once the report was released, (a redacted copy is available on the Province of New Brunswick's website), the company announced in August 2016 they were replacing both the engines aboard the vessel, at a cost of $400,000. Former vessels in the fleet include the Grand Manan (1965-2011) and the Lady White Head. Fees Controversy In August 2010, in the period leading up to the New Brunswick provincial election, David Alward, the leader of the New Brunswick provincial Conservative Party pledged to remove the toll on the ferry to Grand Manan if they won the election. Alward claimed that the ferry service was unique in the province in that it charged a toll, and that it was unfair to island residents. He promised that Coastal Transport would be fully subsidized to compensate, and that the schedule would remain the same. These changes, he argued, would make it more attractive for people to work, live, and operate businesses on Grand Manan, and that it would prove a boon for tourism. But the suggestion itself was decried by the incumbent MLA and the Mayor of Grand Manan. Mayor Dennis Greene stated that businesses, council, the tourism sector, and the island's transportation committee were not consulted prior to the announcement. The cost of eliminating the fees was estimated to be $1.7 million.http://stcroixcourier.ca/fullnews.php?view=324 ; http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/grand-manan-voters-question-pc- promise-1.968671 On September 27, 2010, Alward and the Conservatives won the provincial election. The following August, Alward stated that he would keep his election promise to eliminate the fees, and that although it wouldn't happen by the end of 2011, it would by the end of his mandate. Gregg Ryder spoke on the issue in December 2011: \\"There is a reason most ferry operations are associated with government fiscally and legally for subsidies. The population density is not there at this end of the country to the extent it is for B.C. Ferries.\\" He added, \\"Coastal Transport simply collects the fares on behalf of the province. If the province chooses to remove the fares, they are in effect eliminating one of their revenue streams. But many Grand Mananers have long held the view that they pay the only tolls in the province. They reject the comparison with the Princess of Acadia since it is interprovincial, as well as the now-defunct Yarmouth, N.S.-Bar Harbor run. With high fuel and labour costs, very few Canadian ferry operations are sustainable without government subsidy. We are no exception to this.\\" In March 2012 the fees still remained in place. The Village of Grand Manan then held a plebiscite, asking: \\"Should the Council of the Village of Grand Manan ask the Government of New Brunswick to remove the fare to travel on the ferry to and from the mainland?\\" The plebiscite subsequently passed by a narrow margin, 556 for and 511 against, with a voter turnout of 67 per cent. Alward responded by saying: \\"I certainly respect the people of Grand Manan and have full intention to respect our commitments. I do appreciate the decision that the people have made where they are recommending to government to see the ferry fees removed. That is great for the economy of Grand Manan in the long term, and I have full intention to respect their wishes.\\" By September 2012, the fees were still in place and although many politicians expected the Alward government to live up to its promise, they assumed it would be done towards the end of his four-year mandate. In April 2013, Alward's government announced their intention to reduce the amount of ferry crossings by one run daily, and that this would result in savings of $1 million per year. This move was met with a wave of opposition and a petition against it.http://www.gnb.ca/legis/business/pastsessions/57/57-3/order-e/o130620e.pdf p. 8 However, these cuts did not materialize.http://grandmanan.coastaltransport.ca/documents/SchedulePrint- EN.pdf In perhaps his final public remarks on the matter, made during the reopening ceremony of The Algonquin Resort in June 2014, Alward said: \\"I guess we haven't come to a final decision on it. There hadn't been a clean mandate or majority from the community in terms of the support on that. If we look at the ferry when it was built, it was built with a lot more capacity than was really needed and so we looked at changing some of the runs so what the community said at the time is, 'why don't you look at keeping the runs going the way it is because we believe it's important to the economy of the island and also to the movement of people?' So that's where we've been at. We thought that was the most important priority at the time so that's where we have focused. We haven't made a final decision where we're going to land on the other part.\\" That same month, Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claude Williams reiterated that the fares would remain. Many islanders felt that the government had reneged on its promise, and that the matter would become an election issue. The impact of this is unclear, but Alward's mandate ended in 2014 with the fees still in place, and his Conservatives were defeated at the polls by the Liberal Party, led by Brian Gallant.

After a cameo appearance in Mortal Kombat X as an NPC character, Kabal is playable in the latest installment of the franchise, Mortal Kombat 11. He was revealed on a live stream entitled 'Kombat Kast' by the games' developers. Considered one of the most powerful characters in both Mortal Kombat 3 and the 2011 reboot, Kabal has received mostly positive fan and critical reception in this regard, but response to his Fatality finishing moves has been decisively mixed.

Design and gameplay A concept sketch of pre-injury Kabal by John Tobias, originally for Mortal Kombat: Special Forces (2000). This design was carried over into 2005's Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, in which Kabal appeared as a non-player character Kabal was nicknamed \\"Sandman\\" during production of Mortal Kombat 3 before his actual name was determined.Video Games The Ultimate Gaming Magazine 75 (April 1995) page 48; According to Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, Kabal's overall design was inspired by the Tusken Raiders from Star Wars, while the circular lenses of his mask were inspired by 1940s-style aviator goggles. Series co- creator and programmer Ed Boon described such character concepts like Kabal as being \\"very off the cuff.\\" The developers had also been interested at the possibility of introducing a character with a disability into the series. Both of Kabal's Fatalities poked fun at his handicap with him exposing his scarred face and literally scaring his opponents to death, in addition to inflating his opponents' head like a balloon with an air tube from his respirator, causing them to float upward before exploding offscreen. One of only two characters in MK3 featured with a weapon (the other being Stryker), Kabal was originally given wrist-mounted buzzsaw blades as his primary weapon before his familiar hookswords, while Boon cited his favorite comic book character as a youth, Flash, as the inspiration for Kabal's \\"Tornado\\" move, which dizzied opponents and set them up for a free hit. The swords were first included with one of several early concept designs for Baraka during preproduction of Mortal Kombat II,GamePro 58 (May 1994), p.29, 31. and were also used as generic weapons that were packaged with select characters in a line of 4\\" MK action figures produced by Hasbro in December 1994. According to Boon, Kabal was overpowered enough in MK3 in regards to his special moves that the developers had to tone him down in future updates.Kabal's Bio Card - YouTube, October 24, 2006.

A pre-scarred Kabal was to be included in the 2000 spin-off title Mortal Kombat: Special Forces as a boss character, but he was cut from the game after it underwent many last-minute changes due to time constraints exacerbated by the sudden departure of Tobias from Midway. A character concept sketch was made public and the model that later appeared in Shaolin Monks can still be seen in Special Forces, though he was unnamed and was of no special significance to the game's storyline.

Biography Born in Antigua to a wealthy plantation owner, Thomas Oliver graduated from Harvard College in 1753. In 1760 he married Elizabeth Vassall, who was from another family of West Indies plantation owners that had settled in Massachusetts. The Vassalls were also connected by marriage to the politically powerful Phips family. Oliver was active in the militia but did not involve himself in politics. In 1766 he commissioned the mansion to be built by John Nutting (loyalist) now at 33 Elmwood Avenue, Cambridge, later called Elmwood, for his growing family. When the provincial lieutenant governor, Andrew Oliver died in 1774, Oliver was appointed his successor by King George III and his government ministers, who may have believed him to be a brother or other relative of Andrew Oliver. On September 2, 1774, Oliver saw a crowd of four thousand angry citizens entering Cambridge and traveled to Boston to advise General Thomas Gage not to send troops against them. On his return, the crowd, defying the advice of their political leaders, surrounded Oliver's house and forced him to sign a resignation. Oliver fled to Boston, remaining there for over a year. He chaired one meeting of the Massachusetts Council after Gage's departure. When the British troops sailed to Halifax in March 1776, Oliver went with them, going on to England. He was proscribed under the Massachusetts Banishment Act in 1778, and his estate confiscated. The Continental Army had already used his house as a hospital during the Siege of Boston. Oliver's wife died after their flight to England, and he married Harriet Freeman in Antigua in 1781. He had six children by his first wife, and two with his second. He died in Bristol in 1815, and was buried at St Paul's Church, Bristol. The British government continued to recognize him as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts and pay his salary until he died.

In the following year, governments of the Turkish Republic and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus mutually agreed on opening a university called \\"Eastern Mediterranean University\\". Members of the Turkish Republic Council of Higher Education visited the Institute of Higher Technology with the aim of transforming it into a university. In 1986, following the TRNC Assembly's approval of the Statute establishing the North Cyprus Education Foundation and Eastern Mediterranean University (18/86), the Institute of Higher Technology was converted into a state university assuming the name of Eastern Mediterranean University. That the same year, the Faculties of Engineering, Arts and Sciences, Business and Economics and School of Computing and Technology were inaugurated. In 1990, the Faculty of Architecture and School of Tourism and Hospitality were opened. The establishment of Faculty of Law took place in 1996.

The origins of Beeston can be traced back to the medieval period. It remained a small settlement until the latter part of the Victorian era when it became a primarily residential area for people working in Leeds and surrounding industrial areas like Holbeck and Hunslet. At the time of the 2011 Census, Beeston had a population of 22,187 (which included Holbeck). Some parts of the area, around Cross Flatts Park, suffer from relatively high levels of deprivation, while areas to the centre and south are generally considered more affluent. Beeston is home to the Leeds United football club stadium on Elland Road and Hunslet rugby league club. Etymology The name Beeston is first attested in the Domesday Book, in the form Bestone. The name seems to come from Old English *bƒìos 'bent-grass' (L. Agrostis) and t≈´n 'estate, village'. Thus it once meant 'estate characterised by bent-grass'.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Names Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), III 217; cf. The Vocabulary of English Place-Names (√Å-BOX), ed. by David Parsons and Tania Styles with Carole Hough (Nottingham: Centre for Name Studies, 1997), s.v. *bƒìos. The northern area of Beeston, situated on a hillside facing north to the centre of Leeds, came in the nineteenth century to be called Beeston Hill. This area was formerly called Cat Beeston (and variant spellings), a name first attested in 1398 as Catbeston and Cattbeston. The Cat element is also found in a local field-name, Cadtheweit (whose second element comes from Old Norse √æveit, meaning 'clearing'), attested in 1202. The Cat element could come from the Old English word catt ('cat, wild-cat') or from a personal name Cada. Recent scholarship prefers the latter interpretation, in which case Cat Beeston once meant 'Cada's estate characterised by bent-gress', while Cadtheweit meant 'Cada's clearing'. To the west of Beeston lies Beeston Royds, whose name is first attested (as Beyston Royds) in 1633. The royds element comes from the Old English word rod ('clearing').Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017). Another district of Beeston is the Cross Flatts area. This name is first attested in 1636, as Crossflatts and other spellings. The Middle English word flat meant 'piece of level ground, field', but the precise significance of 'cross' is unclear. It is thought to refer to some cross-shaped pattern of field divisions. History The origin of the settlement is likely to be Anglo-Saxon. Beeston is first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, when it had recently been granted to Ilbert de Lacy (1045‚Äì93); in 1066 it had been worth 40 shillings (¬£2), but in 1086 it was considered waste, presumably because of the Harrying of the North.David Thornton, Leeds: A Historical Dictionary of People, Places and Events (Huddersfield: Northern Heritage Publications, 2013), s.v. BEESTON. It was one of the ten 'out-townships' of the Parish of Leeds until the parish was broken up in the 1840s-50s. In the medieval period, Beeston was associated with sheep-farming: the monks of Kirkstall Abbey grazed 240 sheep there. Founding Drax Priory in the 1130s, William Paynel granted it land in Beeston. A small hospital seems to have been founded in the township around 1233, and a chapel dedicated to St Mary the Virgin may also have been founded in the 13th century. The oldest buildings in Beeston today date to the 15th century. Cad Beeston (also Cad-Beeston, Cat Beeston, Cat-Beeston) manor house has been dated by dendrochronology to about 1420, and is a grade II* listed building; recently used as private offices, it is now a private dwelling, with no public access. Parts of Stank Hall Barn, a grade II* listed scheduled ancient monument originally built for the storage of crops, have been dated to between 1448 and 1490. 'By the early 17th century the area had a reputation for manufacturing bone lace', and by the middle of the century, coal-mining was underway in the area. According to David Thornton, > in December 1688 rumours abounded in the town [of Leeds] that an army of > Roman Catholics were ravaging the surrounding area. Ralph Thoresby recorded, > 'Beeston is actually burnt, and only some escaped to bring the doleful > tidings! The drums beat, the bells rang backward, the women shrieked, and > some doleful consternation seized upon all persons ... (B)lessed be God! The > terror disappeared, it being a false alarm, taken from some drunken people.' Between 1740 and 1820, the Leeds-Elland and Dewsbury-Leeds turnpike roads were built through Beeston; nationalised in the 1870s these roads remain as Elland Road and Dewsbury Road respectively. By 1822, Beeston had a population of 1,670. Up until the 19th century, Beeston had been a small mining village situated on a hill overlooking Leeds. However, during the Industrial Revolution, land that had been occupied by open pits, as well as land formerly utilised for farming, was snapped up for high density residential development. By 1872, Beeston is recorded as having a population of 2,547 with 537 houses, a railway station and a post office, and 'by the end of the 19th century Beeston was predominantly a working class community living in back-to-backs'. Beeston was a township and civil parish 1866‚Äì1904, then was absorbed into Holbeck civil parish before this was absorbed into Leeds in 1925. On the night of 14 March and early hours of 15 March 1941, during the Second World War, Leeds received its worst night of German aerial bombing. Beeston had more bombs dropped on it than any other district of the city and although Flaxton Terrace was damaged during the night time air raid, escaped with the less damage than most other areas of Leeds with nearly all the other bombs landing on Cross Flatts Park. In his 2005 poem \\"Shrapnel\\", Tony Harrison, who was in Beeston on the night of the raid, speculates whether this was an act of heroism by the German pilot, a theory that has been explored ever since the raid. Holbeck Cemetery, in Beeston, also features prominently in Harrison's 1985 poem \\"V\\". Beeston was formerly home to card and board game manufacturer Waddingtons, though the factory was vacated in the 1990s, and is now home to Nampak Cartons. In 2006 the district was the setting for much of the film Mischief Night.  Geography and demographics  Looking towards Leeds city centre from Beeston Hill.

South Leeds Stadium at the John Charles Centre for Sport. Beeston is an inner-city area located close to Leeds city centre. Beeston is severed from the areas to the north by the M621 motorway. Beeston is separated from Middleton by Middleton Park and from Cottingley by the Leeds Outer Ring Road. Beeston can be described as three distinct areas. Beeston - Parkside and Cross Flatts area and Beeston Hill are separated by Cross Flatts Park which runs between Dewsbury Road and Town Street: Beeston Hill to the east, and Parkside and Cross Flatts to the west. The distinction between these two areas has probably existed since medieval times when they were two separate manors. Beeston - Elland Road and Millshaw is primarily industrial and centred on Elland Road to the west of the area. =Beeston - Parkside and Cross Flatts area= The Parkside and Cross Flatts area of Beeston, sometimes locally known as Beeston Village, is centred on a shopping centre comprising a Co-operative store and a number of smaller shops. Housing in this part of Beeston is made up of almost equal proportions of late Victorian and early-20th-century terraced housing to the east of Old Lane, and newer semi-detached family and housing association properties to the west. To the south side of Dewsbury Road, there are significant areas of industrial premises. Indicators for health, economic activity and community safety in this area are broadly consistent with averages for the City of Leeds as a whole. =Beeston Hill area= Beeston Hill is largely made up of areas of older Victoria terraces and newer social housing, which comprises around a third of the housing stock in the area. In April 2008, a ¬£93 million PFI scheme to build 700 private and housing association dwellings and regenerate some existing stock was announced. As a particularly deprived area, Beeston Hill along with Holbeck was the beneficiary of Objective 2 European funding. Beeston Hill has a relatively high level of empty housing as well as a number of significant unoccupied commercial premises. Beeston Hill has a significant ethnic minority population, with around 40% of the population from BME Communities. The area suffers from a high level of deprivation, with indicators for health, economic activity and community safety substantially worse than for the City of Leeds as a whole. =Beeston - Elland Road and Millshaw Area= The west of Beeston around Elland Road has significant amounts of industrial estates, with a substantial amount of mainly semi- detached and terraced housing to the western edge of the Parkside and Cross Flatts area.  Transport  Beeston has a mainline railway line running along its western edge along which all services between Leeds and London King's Cross and London St Pancras run. However, there are no stations along it as Beeston station closed to passengers in 1953. Beeston is served by a number of bus services along Dewsbury Road, Elland Road and Town Street. The frequent No 1 bus service, operated by First Leeds largely follows the route of the former Leeds Tramway route 5 through Beeston. Beeston Hill and Beeston is severed from Leeds by the M621 and therefore benefits from very good links with the M621 motorway, as well as the M62, which runs close to Beeston to the south of Morley. There are several taxi companies operating in the Beeston area, while there are proposals to create a park-and-ride site at Elland Road.Development of a Bid to the Local Transport Fund May 2011  Economy  Much of Beeston's traditional heavy industry and fabrication works have closed throughout the last forty years. However, there are substantial areas of industrial and commercial development around Elland Road and to the south of Dewsbury Road and Beeston is surrounded by areas which have become popular with businesses, such as Leeds city centre, Tingley and many of the business districts along the south side of the River Aire.

During the period it was operational, thousands of people were buried there with many in 'guinea graves' with several unrelated people buried in the same plot. The graves were so called for the shared headstones on which a single-line inscription cost one guinea (21 shillings). Henry Rowland Marsden, the Victorian industrialist and former mayor of Leeds, is buried in Holbeck Cemetery where his family grave is marked by a Grade II- listed memorial. The poem \\"V\\" by Tony Harrison, published in 1985, describes a visit to Holbeck Cemetery and his reaction to finding his parents' tombstones vandalised. =Greenhouse= A plaque commemorating the opening of Shaftesbury House, Leeds, 15 December 1938. In 2008 Shaftesbury House, a working men's hostel designed for the council by George C. Robb in 1936, was converted by Citu to the Greenhouse, an eco-friendly housing project. The building had been empty for a number of years and had previously been earmarked for demolition. The development, which includes 172 homes, office space and other facilities, is one of the UK's first low-carbon housing developments and incorporates wind turbines, solar panels and ground source heating as well as energy efficient materials and rainwater and greywater recycling. The development has won a large number of awards, including, in 2011, the Regeneration and Renewal Magazine Regeneration Award for Sustainability, with judges praising the holistic way it addressed sustainability and provides real regeneration benefits to a deprived area.

London bombings Beeston was the focus of press attention following 7 July 2005 London bombings when it was revealed that two of the four bombers had lived in the area. On 12 July, two properties in Beeston were raided by police in connection with the attacks. According to West Yorkshire Police, a significant amount of explosive material was found in the raids and a controlled explosion was carried out at one of the properties. =After- effects= The link between 7 July bombings and Beeston became known several days after the event took place. When news began to emerge of the Beeston link to the attacks, community and religious groups from across Beeston came together to condemn the atrocities. There was a significant pulling together of people across the community with two Beeston Together for Peace marches being held. Each were joined by hundreds of people, some as the procession passed. The second procession ended at Millennium Square in Leeds city centre, uniting with people from other parts of Leeds for an interfaith vigil. =Beeston in the press= Following the London press, Beeston was thrust into the local, regional, national and international press, with journalists from as far away as North America and Japan arriving in the area to cover the reaction to the events of the previous week. The tone of the reporting was mixed, some sympathetic to the area, many even describing Beeston as a 'leafy suburb', whereas others painted a less salubrious picture of Beeston. The Guardian Writing a year after the bombings, a journalist from The Guardian visited Beeston with the aim of going \\"beyond the stereotypical pictures of veiled women and bearded men strolling past dilapidated buildings.\\" The article reported that the community in Beeston had on the whole condemned the attacks. NBC American news network NBC described Beeston as \\"a drab and derelict neighbourhood in Leeds, three hours north of London, where three of the four London suicide bombers were born and raised\\". The article later stated, \\"Beeston, a poor racially mixed community, is lined with small row houses built in another era to house the factory workers who were one of the cornerstones of the British industry. The neighbourhood has long accommodated immigrant communities ‚Äî from Asia in the 1960s to Eastern Europe and Africa today. Reportedly, almost half the households now are on some sort of state assistance.\\"NBC News Los Angeles Times The Los Angeles Times described Beeston as an \\"ethnically mixed, downtrodden suburb\\".

The paper also said \\"It is a poor and racially mixed neighbourhood of back-to-back row houses with a population of just a few thousand where successive waves of immigrants from Asia in the 1960s, and now from East Europe and Africa, have spread a tangled overlay on a cityscape forged in Victorian Britain.

He was created by series programmer Ed Boon as a palette-swapped joke red herring inserted into Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. In order to stir up fan interest in the game, he became a playable character in the follow-up title Mortal Kombat Trilogy. In the games, Rain is from the fictional realm of Edenia like Kitana and Jade, but he does not share his compatriots' allegiance to their homeland and instead opts to serve evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn. He plays his most prominent role in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, where he is revealed to be a demigod and related to the protagonist of the game's storyline. Rain has been playable only in MK: Armageddon and the compilation game Mortal Kombat Trilogy in addition to the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, for which he was a later addition as downloadable content. He has otherwise had minor appearances in the story and training modes of other series releases. General critical reception to the character has been mixed. History and creation Rain makes his first appearance in the Mortal Kombat series in the attract mode of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), in which he attacks Shao Kahn on the Portal stage. Similar to Ermac in the first Mortal Kombat, players attempted to hunt him down to no avail, and speculation regarding his existence was spurred by a cryptic message inserted by the developers that read \\"Rain can be found in the Graveyard\\", in reference to a stage in the game where the character was never actually seen.Mortal Kombat Secrets: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 - MKSecrets.net. Retrieved February 12, 2014. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon explained in 2011 that Rain's conception \\"was me being a jerk, basically.\\" A fan of Prince, Boon's inspiration for the character was the 1984 track Purple Rain, coupled with his jokingly wondering what color palette had not yet been used in the games. By the time Boon had decided to include Rain as a selectable in UMK3, the game was already completed, which caused him to hack into the attract mode to insert a snippet of the character as an unplayable red herring who was a purple palette swap of Scorpion, and created his name from scratch to display in his power bar, thus it is the only one in the game that is not italicized. Rain was made a playable character with his own backstory and distinct set of moves for the home versions of UMK3 and the 1996 home-release compilation title Mortal Kombat Trilogy, the latter which was to actually include another new ninja character, Tremor, a brown palette swap who had been cut during the development process. The noncanonical biography that had been created for him was passed on to Rain instead and included in the game's instruction manual.Mortal Kombat Trilogy - In Development - MKSecrets.net. Retrieved February 22, 2014. Appearances =In video games= As a child, Rain was smuggled away from his homeland of Edenia in the midst of the realm's takeover by Outworld emperor Shao Kahn, while his father stayed behind to perform his duties as general of Edenia's armies, but he was killed and his armies crushed in the invasion. Thousands of years later, during the events of MK Trilogy, Rain resurfaced during Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm prior to the third Mortal Kombat tournament, and was attacked by Kahn's extermination squads; not wanting to suffer at their hand, he elected to turn his back on his homeland and side with Kahn, who trained him as an assassin alongside fellow Edenians Kitana and Jade before enlisting them in the fight against the Earth warriors. However, Kahn's would-be domination of Earthrealm is unsuccessful and Rain is absent from the series until the training mode of Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), where he asks Shujinko to find a dagger belonging to Goro, which he in turn keeps for himself until he is knocked out by Jade. Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006) marks Rain's return as a playable character after a decade, as he is selectable along with the series' then-entire roster. As one of only seventeen characters in the game to receive an official biography, he plays his largest role in the original series continuity by learning of his true Edenian heritage from evil Outworld sorcerer Quan Chi, who informs Rain that he is a direct descendant of Argus, the protector god of Edenia, as well as the half-sibling of the game's protagonist Taven and his brother Daegon, both of whom were favored by their father to assume his mantle of Edenia's protectors.Mortal Kombat Armageddon: Rain - Mortal Kombat Warehouse. Retrieved February 9, 2014. Rain consequently starts to refer to himself as a prince of the realm, as seen in Armageddon's training mode, but he still chooses to independently fight on the side of evil. He confronts Taven in the fictional location of Arctika but is defeated in battle and flees into a portal. His storyline is altered in the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, which makes no mention of his father or siblings, instead describing him as having been orphaned at a young age by Kahn's conquest of Edenia and raised under the protection of Edenian resistance fighters. As he gained a reputation as an exceptional warrior, his level of arrogance followed suit, and when he was refused leadership of the resistance, he betrayed them to their (unidentified) sworn enemy. This caught the attention of Kahn, who offered the power-hungry Rain an army of his own in exchange for his services.Mortal Kombat (2011): Rain biography - Kamidogu.com. Retrieved February 12, 2014. However, in Rain's ending, Kahn had no intention of fulfilling his end of the bargain. Rain therefore kills him in combat and ends up saving Earthrealm in the process, for which he is thanked by Raiden, who also informs him that he is the son of Argus. Rain, consequently drunk with power to which he felt he was entitled, coupled with a sense of superiority from being the offspring of a god, takes over Kahn's armies to rule all realms, starting, to Raiden's horror, with Earthrealm. Rain is not playable in Mortal Kombat X (2015), but appears in the game's story mode. He serves as Mileena's advisor and tries to help her reclaim the Outworld throne from the warlord Kotal Kahn in the midst of a civil war. Rain plans to take the throne for himself when the war is over but is stopped by D'Vorah. He is featured in Tanya's noncanonical arcade ending, in which he and Tanya flee Kotal Kahn's forces in Outworld but are captured. She turns him over to Kahn in exchange for clemency, resulting in Rain being burned at the stake. Rain will return in Mortal Kombat 11 as part of the Kombat Pack 2 DLC. Prior to being announced as downloadable playable fighter, he was initially started out as one of the non-playable klassic trilogy ninjas whom Shang Tsung assumed as for his move list, reusing the assets from Mortal Kombat (2011) rather than the assets from Rain‚Äôs last known kombat appearance in Mortal Kombat X. Design and gameplay Rain as a playable character in the Sega Genesis version of UMK3 Rain was the tenth palette-swapped human ninja character introduced into the Mortal Kombat series. His offense drew on the power of weather as he was able to harness water and lightning, while he shared Reptile's victory pose and the stance for Ermac's Telekinetic Slam for his lightning strike, which caused opponents to bounce into the air and thus set them up for a juggle combo. His roundhouse kick was unique to the series as it sent opponents flying onto the opposite side of the screen, while his Animality turned him into a pygmy elephant that trumpets the skin off his opponent. Bryan Dawson of Prima Games named Rain in MK Trilogy as one of the series' \\"cheapest\\" characters, citing his specials therein that led to lengthy combos. For his reemergence in Armageddon, Rain was given a new, distinct identity like the other ninjas from the two-dimensional games, with less emphasis on purple for his uniform and more on black and gold, giving him a more regal appearance that now included a back-length cape, while he still concealed his identity behind a mask that itself was a standalone entity as he was now shown as having long, black hair tied up in a topknot. In his official Armageddon render, he is seen brandishing a pair of curved knives but never actually uses them in the game; instead, his weapon is a sword. He was given more water-based special moves for Armageddon and the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, the latter in which he was later added as a downloadable character. =In other media and merchandise= Percy Brown as Rain in Mortal Kombat: Conquest Rain made a one-episode appearance in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, and was voiced by Rino Romano. The character's live-media incarnations were portrayed by African-American actors. He was played by stuntman Tyrone Cortez Wiggins in a minor role in the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, in which he serves as the general of Shao Kahn's extermination squads but is killed by Kahn after sparing the lives of Kabal and Stryker (both unseen) after capturing them. Rain makes a brief appearance in one episode of the 1998 television series Mortal Kombat: Conquest and is played by Percy \\"Spitfire\\" Brown. He has no dialogue and is sent by Kahn to kill Kung Lao before the next tournament, but is unsuccessful after being forced to flee when Taja intervenes. Rain was included as an \\"exclusive\\" in a \\"Klassic Ninja\\" six-pack of 4\\" action figures released in 2011 by Jazwares, while a polystone statue of the character was released by Syco Collectibles in 2012. In DC Comics' 2015 weekly Mortal Kombat X prequel miniseries, Rain debuts in the eighth chapter as he joins Reiko and Mileena in their war against Kotal Kahn, manipulating the weather to block out the sun and therefore deny Kahn his primary power source, but he is severely burned by Kahn in retaliation. He is not seen again until the twenty-first chapter, in which he is disfigured and recuperating under Mileena's care after being recovered by the Red Dragon clan. He informs Mileena of a conversation he overheard among Red Dragon clansmen regarding her former comrade Reiko's loyalty to Havik, resulting in Mileena planning an invasion of Shang Tsung's island to hunt down Reiko, Havik and the Red Dragon. Reception Rain is one of the Mortal Kombat series' more negatively received characters from the first generation of games, mainly due to his origins. Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack rated him among the ten worst series characters, praising his roundhouse kick but stating, \\"No ninja should be named after a Prince song.\\" Topless Robot, in 2009, ranked him fourth in their list \\"The 9 Most Pathetic Fighting Game Characters\\" for the same reasons, adding: \\"It's not that Rain is an untalented fighter. It's just that you can't help but feel like you've seen this guy somewhere before.\\" Den of Geek's Gavin Jasper criticized Rain's UMK3 attract-mode appearance as \\"false advertising\\", but also ranked Rain 36th in his 2015 rating of the 64 series characters due to his MK2011 ending and the expansion of his backstory in Armageddon as \\"a power-hungry jerk who believed that he was owed everything.\\" UGO ranked him 28th out of the series' top 50 characters in 2012. \\"Most Mortal Kombat characters don't get their start as an inside joke, but Rain proves to be a rare exception.\\" Elijah Watson of Complex named Rain as one of the series' most brutal characters in 2013. Rain's \\"Upside Down Uppercut\\" Fatality from Trilogy, in which he punches his opponent apart into four separate segments that fly vertically offscreen and then drop back down to perfectly reform their upended corpse, placed on 1UP.com's list of Mortal Kombat's fifteen worst Fatalities and made Game Informer's selection of the series' seven worst finishers: \\"Rain was one of the many palette-swap clones in Mortal Kombat Trilogy, and he easily had the worst Fatality.\\" His Animality tied with that of Scorpion as the eighth-worst Fatality in the series from GamePro. Gameranx rated his \\"Bubble Burst\\" Fatality from MK2011 as the series' third-most gruesome finisher, and Robert Workman of Prima Games ranked it 41st in his 2014 list of the series' fifty best Fatalities.

In the , Aspley had a population of 12,108 people. Geography Aspley is located about north and about a half-hour drive north of the Brisbane central business district. It is positioned on flat ground south of Cabbage Tree Creek, centred on Little Cabbage Tree Creek and on the surrounding hills to the east and south. History Prior to European settlement, Australian aborigines of the Duke of York clan lived in the local area, though their main camping ground was further south in the suburb now known as Herston. The Duke of York clan was part of the Turrbal tribe who occupied the area north from Logan River, south of the North Pine River, east of Moggill Creek to Moreton Bay. Soon after Brisbane was declared a free settlement in 1842, Europeans began exploring the lands north of Brisbane City. A northern route followed aboriginal tracks through what is now Kelvin Grove, Enoggera, Everton Hills, Albany Creek onto North Pine. This route is still known as \\"'Old Northern Road'\\" and \\"'Old North Road'\\" in places. Another aboriginal track branching eastward from the Old Northern Road at the South Pine River crossed towards Little Cabbage Tree Creek and continued towards Downfall Creek. This track is now known as \\"Albany Creek Road\\" and \\"Gympie Road\\". Albany Creek Road was known as \\"Chinaman Creek Road\\" before 1888. In 1857, the first land sales in the area east of the Old Northern Road and South Pine River begin under the control of New South Wales. Initially, the land was sold for farming and comprised the land around Cabbage Tree Creek, bordered by what is now Zillmere Road, Roghan Road, Bridgeman Road and the northerly continuation of Kirby Road, covering mostly what is now Aspley, Carseldine and Fitzgibbon. The land parcels east of what is now Hawbridge Street and Lacey Road were purchased by William John Ward. The western land parcels were not sold. These land parcels were bordered by what is now Graham Road, Roghan Road, Hawbridge Street/Lacey Road and Bridgeman Road, and were subsequently subdivided into smaller land parcels and sold. This area is now known as Carseldine. After the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, subsequent subdivisions were much smaller. Originally known as Soldiers Flat and then Little Cabbage Tree Creek, the area became officially called Aspley in 1897. The name is believed to refer to the Aspley Orangery and Aspley Vineyard owned by John Morris in 1860s. Morris came from Nottinghamshire in England where there was an Aspley Hall. In the following 5 years, land parcels south of Zillmere Road/Graham Road in what is now recognised as Aspley began. In 1865, subdivisions west of what is now Maundrell Terrace were sold at the Brisbane Land Sales. In 1866, subdivisions between what is now Gympie Road, Maundrell Terrace and Webster Road were auctioned. The subdivisions were named \\"Soldier's Flat\\". Initially, the area was known as \\"Little Cabbage Tree Creek District\\". The immigrants were primarily of English and German ancestry. During the 1860s James and John Castledean, who owned land and a general store in the Bald Hills District, pushed a direct track from Bald Hills through to what is now the intersection of Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road. In late October 1867 gold was discovered in Gympie, Queensland. By this time, a road from Brisbane City to Kedron Brook had been completed with the Bowen Bridge opened in 1860, permitting the northern track along Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road to be used as an alternate route to the Old Northern Road. However, neither road was of good quality. On 8 May 1868 the Government announced that it had allocated 2700 pounds to construct a trafficable, more direct, road to the Gympie goldfields. The new road came through Kedron Brook, Downfall Creek, Little Cabbage Tree Creek before heading to Bald Hills and North Pine. This road is now known as Gympie Road and travels a route very different from the original aboriginal track. With increased traffic on Gympie Road, the Royal Exchange Hotel was established in 1875 opposite the intersection of Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road. It also operated as a general store for a while with Cobb and Co coaches passing on their way to the Gympie goldfields. In 1934, a second building was built south of the original hotel. The new building was called the \\"Aspley Hotel\\". In the early 1870s, a vineyard was established by the Morris family on their property bounded by Maundrell Terrace, Gympie Road and Terrence Street. It was named the \\"Aspley Vineyard\\", after \\"Aspley Hall\\" in Nottingham, England. The vineyard operated for over twenty years. In 1897, Little Cabbage Tree Creek District was renamed Aspley. Matthew's Farm in 1887, which would become the site of Aspley State SchoolLittle Cabbage-tree Creek State School opened on 6 August 1890. Before it was built, students would infrequently attend classes at the schools in Bald Hills or Zillmere. Initial sites for the new school were not approved by the Government before finally accepting the location on the corner of Maundrell Terrace and Horn Road. In 1897 the school was renamed Aspley State School. In the latter part of the 19th century, Aspley was essentially a farming district. Additional industries were established to support the farming industry. In the 1880s, John Smith Booth established a bone mill and sawmill on Little Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek Road. It later relocated to the current location of the former Aspley Acres Caravan Park and finally closed in 1932. In 1888, Huttons Pty Ltd established a meat processing plant in nearby suburb Zillmere. It contributed greatly to the local economy of Aspley, providing an alternative employment for farmers during poor seasons. A blacksmith operated on the northern corner of Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road until the 1920s. Several slaughter houses operated along Little Cabbage Tree Creek.The Kedron Omnibus company provided horse-powered transport services to Aspley - Coach on display at the Queensland Museum, ToowoombaIn 1912 the Kedron Omnibus company was formed by locals and ran local services to Wooloowin Station after previous services were cancelled as an aftermath of the 1912 transport strike. Cobb & Co pickup point as the coaches did not change horses until Strathpine and \\"watering hole\\" for bullock teams. After World War I and into the 1920s, Aspley experienced some growth in the number of businesses present in the district. Griffiths Sweet Factory operated on Gympie Road between 1930 and 1950 after shifting from Windsor. Hedges Dripping Factory operated near the reservoir on Lawrence Road. A brickworks was established by the Granville family on Brickfield Road during the 1930s. In 1918 the local community hall was built on Gympie Road. A year later, movies were presented inside the hall. In 1950 the hall was sold to become St Paul's Anglican Church. The church was dedicated by Bishop Administrator John Hudson on 10 March 1963. It closed on 24 October 1981 as the land was resumed for road purposes. By the 1960s the growth of the local area necessitated building additional schools. St Dympna's Catholic Primary School was established by the Sisters of St Joseph, opening on 24 January 1963. Aspley East State School opened on 29 January 1963. It became one of the largest and most popular primary schools on Brisbane's north side, drawing students from a wide area.We Are Aspley East, 1st edition, Aspley East State School Parents and Citizens' Association, Aspley, 2013, p.129 In 2013, Aspley East State School celebrated its 50th anniversary. Aspley State High School opened on 29 January 1963. It was originally to be called Zillmere State High School but was renamed on 17 January 1963. Aspley Special School opened on 6 November 1973. In May 2006 John Howard Amundsen was arrested for fraudulently obtaining more than 50 kg of explosives, causing an evacuation of a number of nearby residents. In July 2008 Aspley's Bank of Queensland branch was destroyed by an explosion and fire in an attempted robbery. In August 2009 the Aspley Village Shopping Centre opened its doors to the Aspley Village Arts Markets each Sunday. In the , Aspley had a population of 12,108 people. Transport Aspley is primarily accessed by Gympie Road, the primary artery in Brisbane's northern suburbs. Other primary roads are Albany Creek Road to the west and Robinson Road to the east. Public transport is provided by buses operated by Brisbane Transport, Translink, Hornibrook Bus Lines. Brisbane's tram network originally terminated just south of Aspley on Gympie Road at Chermside. The closest railway stations are Geebung and Zillmere. In the 1961 Brisbane City Council Town Plan, the concept of a northern suburbs' expressway between Bowen Hills and Aspley was first proposed. The expressway would travel along the eastern side of Lutwyche Road to Park Road at Kedron, take a northerly route to Chermside and through the eastern side of Aspley, before heading north-westerly through Carseldine to connect with the Bruce Highway north of Bald Hills. The 1965 Wilbur Smith and Associates Brisbane Transportation Study recommended the additional construction of a Northwest Freeway between the Brisbane CBD and Aspley via the Grange and Everton Park. Gympie Road The freeway system was to be constructed between 1965 and 1985 in four five-year stages. However, by 1972, opposition was voicing concerns about inadequate compensation for resumed properties, the housing crisis at the time, and neglected public transport. By 1975 the freeway plan had been abandoned due to community opposition and funding issues. Land planning in the 1980s has protected the land corridor of the original Northwest Freeway between Alderley and Carseldine. The corridor is most obvious in the suburb running parallel to Trouts Road in the suburb's west. It is referred to as the Northwest Transport Corridor and remains in current planning standards as a four-lane median-divided road . There is speculation that the corridor may form part of a western bypass road which will link the Western Freeway with the Bruce Highway. Another proposal has been for a light-rail system to connect Caboolture and Ferny Grove lines. Demographics In the , Aspley recorded a population of 12,594 people and comprises 52.4% females and 47.6% males. The median age of the Aspley population was 40 years of age, 3 years above the Australian median. 74% of people living in Aspley were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 4.4%, England 3.5%, India 1.4%, Italy 1.1%, Philippines 1%. 84.1% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.9% Italian, 1.1% Cantonese, 1% Mandarin, 0.6% Hindi, 0.5% Greek. Government Initially, all northern districts of Brisbane belonged to the Nundah Divisional Board, established in 1879. In 1883, Toombul Divisional Board separated. In 1886, the Nundah Divisional Board was subdivided into three smaller boards. In 1903, the board responsible for the district renamed to Kedron Divisional Board and subsequently Kedron Shire Council to better reflect its representation, since it was no longer based in Nundah. On 1 October 1925, the Kedron Shire Council was integrated into Greater Brisbane.

Amenities  Pick 'n Pay Hypermarket, Aspley The Aspley Hypermarket, originally built by South African company Pick 'n Pay in 1984 (owned by Yu Feng and currently managed by Retail First), has a large presence in the suburb of Aspley. This shopping centre services the residents of Aspley, as well as surrounding suburbs of Carseldine, Zillmere, Chermside West, Taigum, Bridgeman Downs and Albany Creek. In 2012, the Pick 'n' Pay closed permanently and a Kmart department store and the first Coles superstore in Queensland opened on the site on 1 December 2012. In 2016/17, Aspley Hypermarket underwent a significant refurbishment and now has interior upgrades and a new food court, alongside a new fa√ßade and entry decoration. The shopping centre now has a Woolworths supermarket (added in 2017) in addition to Coles, Aldi, Sunlit Asian Supermarket and a fresh food precinct. Additionally, Aspley Hypermarket presents a mix of major chain and local specialty retailers and a large format Kmart. Shops on Gympie Road Aspley c.1972 Aspley also includes an abundance of car dealers and sidewalk shops along Gympie Road and the Aspley Homemaker Centre on Zillmere Road. Aspley also included one of the first McDonald's restaurants in Queensland until 2009, when the restaurant was demolished to make way for a more modern one and the McDonald's state headquarters of Queensland, located just behind the restaurant. In December 2008 a shopping complex was opened on Robinson Road, called Aspley Village Shopping Centre, which replaced the old one that was closed down and demolished on the site in 2007. This new shopping centre, now open consists of a Coles Supermarket and approximately 25 specialty shops including Watt Realty, Newsagency, T-Bone Butchery, Stellarossa, Bossy Hair, Malof Group Chemist, Bargain King, Atune Hearing and convenience shopping with alfresco dining. The existing medical centre will also be expanding which will incorporate a gymnasium and aquatic soothing pool that has now been opened. There is also undercover parking for approximately 470 cars. This shopping centre is unique in Brisbane as the only centre to feature a direct entrance from the centre car park into the grounds of a state school - in this case Aspley East State School. Aspley is serviced by a fortnightly visit by the Brisbane City Council's mobile library service at the corner of Gayford and Albany Creek Roads. Aspley is home to many denominations and other religious activities. Some of which are Aspley Uniting Church and a chaplaincy at Aspley State High and Aspley East State Schools.

Several distinct vehicles have borne the Midget name over the years, but all have had in common a single or two-seat utilitarian design, with an enclosed or semi-enclosed cab.  First generation (DK/DS/MP; 1957‚Äì1972)  = DK/DS series = Daihatsu Midget MP5 In August 1957 the original DKA Midget was introduced. It featured a three wheel, a single seat, a doorless cab, and handlebar steering. The engine was an air- cooled two-stroke single-cylinder design of 250 cc (ZA) which produced . Beginning in August 1959 it was replaced by the more comfortable DSA, which has doors and a more powerful version of the ZA engine. Maximum cargo capacity was also increased, from . There was also a rare two-seat version (DSAP), with the passenger seat offset to the left behind the driver. This required a longer passenger compartment, which encroached on the cargo area. There was also the DSV, a panel van version. = MP series = In October 1959 the MP2 Midget was introduced in Japan - updated with such features as a steering wheel, doors, and seating for two. This model had already been sold in the United States since April 1959, as the MPA, although it was marketed as the \\"Daihatsu Trimobile\\". Companies such as Boeing and Lockheed used these little vehicles inside of their plants, for instance. The engine was the same (ZA) air-cooled two-stroke one-cylinder design with but an extra made for a sluggish vehicle. The DSA continued to be built alongside the more expensive MP variants into the early sixties. There was again a panel van version also available. Subsequent revisions to the MP design were soon made, resulting in the model MP3 which has the larger ZD engine of 305 cc which produced . In May 1960 the longer MP4 arrived, featuring roll-up door windows. In August 1961 the doors were modified, now incorporating a triangular vent window and a chromed side strip. In September 1962 the final iteration, the MP5, arrived. It was again somewhat larger than the earlier MP4, with maximum length up to and cargo space increased by , to a total of . As a matter of fact, nearly all body panels were altered in some way, with new marker lights installed, redesigned doors, a blunter and more rounded front, bigger vent openings in front of the doors' leading edge, and finally a solid metal roof rather than the earlier fabric-covered opening. The MP5 also gained more chrome trim, around the headlamps and elsewhere. April 1963 saw the introduction of automatic oil mixing for the two-stroke engine. In August 1969 new safety regulations required certain lighting changes, a driver's side headrest, and seatbelts. The MP5 remained in production until December 1971, and on sale into 1972. By 1972, 336,534 units had been produced, and production was terminated because of the falling popularity of three-wheeled models in favor of more modern four-wheeled models. The Midget I has also been sold outside Japan as the \\"Bajaj\\", \\"Tri-Mobile\\", or \\"Bemo\\" (Bemos in Indonesia are used as autorickshaw share taxis). It is one of the first cars manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu, known for its low cost, practical vehicles. Thai production began in 1959, with Indonesia, Pakistan, and many other countries soon following. Almost exclusively used as an autorickshaw (or 'tuk-tuk') the Midget was also a well known icon of public transportation in South Asia. Not meant for performance, this obscure vehicle does weave through larger traffic well, despite the fact that it only has three wheels. These original tuk-tuks are a little harder to find in modern times. In Thailand the Midget MP4 is still in production as a Chinnaraje Midget in Chiang Mai and as a TukTuk Midget MP4 in Bangkok. The facelifted version, known as MP5 is also still manufactured by the TukTuk (Thailand) Co., Ltd. in Bangkok.  Second generation (K100; 1996‚Äì2001)  Daihatsu Midget II Cargo From 1996 to 2001, Daihatsu manufactured a four-wheeled kei Midget with four-wheel drive as well as air conditioning as options. As Kei cars, they were equipped with 660 cc engines. The Midget II was introduced as a concept at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show. There are two types of engine available, differentiated by the injection type, one being electronic. Both are identical in width and height, but the EFI (Electronic Fuel Injection) version is shorter by 75mm. They are available in a one-seater or two-seater configuration, with automatic and manual transmissions available. The Midget is often taken advantage of by owners of bars in Japan, as they are a perfect size to haul around kegs. The design of the Midget is somewhat unusual with the spare tire mounted on the front.

History \\"Hound Dog\\" by Big Mama Thornton was a hit for Peacock in 1953. Other significant rhythm and blues artists on Peacock were Marie Adams, James Booker, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Little Richard, Memphis Slim, and former gospel singer Jackie Verdell. The label also dabbled in jazz, releasing albums by vocalist Betty Carter and saxophonist Sonny Criss. In 1952, Robey gained control of the Duke Records label of Memphis, Tennessee. Duke/Peacock Records was formed. For a period of time in the early 1960s, Peacock released gospel music only, issuing singles and albums by some of America's most famous gospel artists, including The Dixie Hummingbirds, The Mighty Clouds of Joy, The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, Reverend Cleophus Robinson, The Sensational Nightingales, The Gospelaires of Dayton, Ohio, The Pilgrim Jubilee Singers, The Loving Sisters and gospel/jazz group Together (1975), which included saxophonist Felix \\"Top Cat\\" Dixon from Kansas City, Kansas. At the end of 1963, the label launched the gospel subsidiary label Song Bird Records which featured Inez Andrews. In the later 1960s, Peacock again began to issue secular soul singles by artists such as Jackie Verdell, the Inspirations, Little Frankie Lee, Al 'TNT' Bragg and Bud Harper. This later Peacock label featured a bright multi-colored peacock tail on an otherwise blue label background, and it is these later records which are often sought by Northern soul collectors. The Duke/Peacock family of labels (which also included Back Beat and Sure Shot) was sold to ABC Dunhill Records of Los Angeles on May 23, 1973, with label founder Don Robey staying with ABC as a consultant until his death in 1975. The label name was changed to ABC/Peacock in 1974. After ABC was sold to MCA Records in 1979, MCA briefly operated an MCA/Songbird label with new signings including Little Anthony (of Little Anthony and the Imperials) and Dan Peek (formerly of the group America). The previous rosters of both ABC-Peacock and ABC-Songbird were dropped (MCA later reissued several Peacock and Song Bird albums at budget price). MCA briefly revived the Peacock name for a series of CD reissues (\\"Peacock Gospel Classics\\") in the late 1990s. Along with the MCA back catalog, the Peacock and Song Bird masters are now controlled by the Geffen Records unit of Universal Music Group.

Life and career Born in Louvain, he won first prize in a local music competition at the age of 11 and subsequently enrolled at the Brussels Conservatoire. His main teacher there was Louis Brassin, a former pupil of Ignaz Moscheles, although he also took lessons from other staffers at the institution, including Joseph Dupont, Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert and Fernand Kufferath.Naxos After graduating with high distinction from the Conservatoire at the age of 17, De Greef went to Weimar to complete his studies under Franz Liszt. He was a pupil of Liszt for two years.Musicweb International Following the Weimar sojourn, De Greef embarked on a career as a concert pianist, travelling widely. He was a friend of Edvard Grieg, whose Piano Concerto he had played publicly in 1898, and who called him \\"the best performer of my music I have met with\\". In addition, he enjoyed the endorsement of Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. British critic Jonathan Woolf has written: \\"De Greef was, in all respects, an intensely musical, non-sensationalist, eloquent and impressive musician and whilst not being averse to some of the interventionist tactics of his contemporaries (retouching of the score) remained sympathetically self- effacing\\". De Greef composed a sizeable quantity of music, virtually all of which is now unknown. Among his works are two piano concertos.

Largely set in Africa, it is the first film made by Eon Productions not about the fictional MI6 agent James Bond and was made by most of the same crew as Dr. No. Plot Bob Hope plays Matt Merriwether, a New York writer who has passed off his uncle's memoirs of explorations in Africa as his own. Merriwether lives his false reputation as a great white hunter to the point of living in a Manhattan apartment furnished to look like an African safari lodge complete with sound effects records of African fauna. Based on his false reputation as an \\"Africa Expert\\", he is recruited by the United States Government and NASA to locate a missing secret space probe before it can be located by hostile forces. Hope's co-stars include Edie Adams and Anita Ekberg playing secret agents. Golfer Arnold Palmer also makes a brief cameo, playing a crazy round of golf with Hope--a scene revisited in the film Spies Like Us where Hope makes a cameo appearance and plays golf through a tent. A scene involving an unseen President John F. Kennedy in his famous rocking chair is parodied with his Russian counterpart Nikita Khrushchev rocking in a chair that squeaks loudly.

Broccoli's autobiography When the Snow Melts, Eon Productions was originally contracted by United Artists to make two films a year for them; one James Bond film and one non-Bond film. Many original suggestions were meant to showcase Sean Connery, who turned them all down, as he did not want his career totally in the hands of Eon. When asked by journalist and close Broccoli affiliate Donald Zec if they had any ideas for their non-Bond film, Harry Saltzman, who had previously made The Iron Petticoat with Hope, suggested a Bob Hope movie. Zec replied that he had seen a British rock and roll group called The Beatles that had sellout crowds and thought about featuring them in a film. Saltzman laughed and asked why he would want to make a film about four young long- haired kids from Liverpool when he had Bob Hope. United Artists made The Beatles film with Walter Shenson and A Hard Day's Night was more successful than Call Me Bwana. The film was originally intended to be shot entirely on location in Kenya but the problems of the Mau Mau Uprising led the producers to only have second unit cinematography led by John Coquillon.http://www.tcm.turner.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=92562&mainArticleId;=92499 Edie Adams thought that she was actually going to Africa and had painful inoculations. She remembered that the film seemed to be written as it went along; initially her character was a nuclear scientist, then a big-game hunter.p.90 Mackin, Tom Brief Encounters: From Einstein to Elvis2008 Author House One day on the set, she met a stuntwoman dressed like her character, throwing a male stuntman in a jiu jitsu throw; Adams realised that now her character was a secret agent. Adams' original role was given to Anita Ekberg, but as Hope had promised Adams a role, the script was rewritten to add a new female character.http://www.tcm.turner.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=92562&mainArticleId;=92499 In fact, the film was indeed being written during shooting. In October 1962, after being in production for two weeks, producer Broccoli hired novelist Paul Jarrico to do a \\"fast rewrite.\\" Six writers had already worked on the script, \\"hundreds of jokes had been written about a bumbling explorer and a CIA agent searching for a U.S. space capsule in Africa, but no filmable story had emerged.\\" Jarrico believed the script needed logic. Broccoli subsequently paid Jarrico $2,500 for four weeks' uncredited work. Production director Syd Cain recalled that originally wild African animals from British zoos were to be released onto the golf course sequence but the idea was shelved when they caused expensive damage.Cain, Syd Not Forgetting James Bond 2005 Reynolds and Hearn Spoofing a scene from Dr. No, Hope's character is asleep in a tent when a tarantula begins crawling up his leg. A similar thing had happened to James Bond in the first 007 film, played seriously, rather than for laughs. Call Me Bwana is \\"plugged\\" in Eon Productions' 1963 Bond film From Russia with Love during a sequence where Ali Kerim Bey assassinates the Russian agent Krilencu with a sniper rifle. Krilencu attempts to escape through a window, which is situated in Anita Ekberg's mouth, on the wall-sized poster: \\"She should have kept her mouth shut,\\" Bond says. In the original novel by Ian Fleming, published in 1957, the scene happens in a trapdoor situated in Marilyn Monroe's mouth on a poster for Niagara. The next non-Bond Eon Productions release would not be until Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool came out in 2017. Soundtrack The film was scored by Monty Norman. John Barry claimed that Norman contacted him to orchestrate his theme The Big Safarihttp://www.jollinger.com/barry/lawsuit.htm but the film's orchestration was eventually credited to Muir Mathieson. Barry released a recording of The Big Safari as well as another United Artists comedy The Mouse on the Moon under a pseudonym of \\"The Countdowns\\".http://www.45-rpm.org.uk/dirj/johnb.htm Bob Hope sang the title song over the end credits.

The grounds from 1972 until 1980 accommodated a venture which closed, Lambton Lion Park. Later the family have sold Biddick Woods enabling a link road from the A182 to the A690 in Houghton le Spring and new business units. In 2012, the castle was the setting of the BBC One drama The Paradise. On 30 December 2015 plans for the estate's development were submitted to the local planning authority to help fund park upkeep and conservation, with a vision to turn the castle into a wedding venue, boutique hotel or both, aiming to spend ¬£26 million to ¬£28.5 million on building and labour. The plans were submitted by the Trustees of Lord Durham‚Äôs 1989 Voluntary Settlement, which manages the estate on behalf of the family.

Her fiction and non-fiction, frequently detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and vivid descriptions of place. Manning's youth was divided between Portsmouth and Ireland, giving her what she described as \\"the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere\\". She attended art school and moved to London, where her first serious novel, The Wind Changes, was published in 1937. In August 1939 she married R. D. Smith (\\"Reggie\\"), a British Council lecturer posted in Bucharest, Romania, and subsequently lived in Greece, Egypt, and British Mandatory Palestine as the Nazis overran Eastern Europe. Her experiences formed the basis for her best- known work, the six novels making up The Balkan Trilogy and The Levant Trilogy, known collectively as Fortunes of War. Critics judged her overall output to be of uneven quality, but this series, published between 1960 and 1980, was described by Anthony Burgess as \\"the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer\\".Burgess, writing in The Sunday Times, quoted (for example) in the preface of Penguin's 1981 edition of The Balkan Trilogy Manning returned to London after the war and lived there until her death in 1980; she wrote poetry, short stories, novels, non-fiction, reviews, and drama for the British Broadcasting Corporation. Both Manning and her husband had affairs, but they never contemplated divorce. Her relationships with writers such as Stevie Smith and Iris Murdoch were difficult, as an insecure Manning was envious of their greater success. Her constant grumbling about all manner of subjects is reflected in her nickname, \\"Olivia Moaning\\", but Smith never wavered in his role as his wife's principal supporter and encourager, confident that her talent would ultimately be recognised. As she had feared, real fame only came after her death in 1980, when an adaptation of Fortunes of War was televised in 1987. Manning's books have received limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender and are not easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war and racism, and colonialism and imperialism; they examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation. Early years Olivia Manning was born in North End, Portsmouth on 2 March 1908.Some sources give her year of birth as 1911, possibly due to Manning's well-known obfuscations of her age. The Braybrooke and Braybrooke biography and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both give the 1908 date. Her father, Oliver Manning, was a naval officer who rose from naval trainee to lieutenant- commander despite a lack of formal schooling. At the age of 45, while visiting the port of Belfast, he met Olivia Morrow, a publican's daughter fourteen years his junior; they married less than a month later in December 1904, in the Presbyterian church in her home town of Bangor, County Down. Manning adored her womanising father who entertained others by singing Gilbert and Sullivan and reciting poetry he had memorised during long sea voyages. In contrast, her mother was bossy and domineering, with a \\"mind as rigid as cast- iron\\", and there were constant marital disputes. The initially warm relationship between mother and daughter became strained after the birth of Manning's brother Oliver in 1913; delicate and frequently ill, he was the centre of his mother's attention, much to the displeasure of Manning, who made several childish attempts to harm him. This unhappy, insecure childhood left a lasting mark on her work and personality. alt= A long, two storied building with a flat roof, large Georgian windows and a three arched gateway Manning was educated privately at a small dame school before moving to the north of Ireland in 1916, the first of several extended periods spent there while her father was at sea. In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School, and in Portsmouth Lyndon House School then Portsmouth Grammar School, developing, as she recalled, \\"the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere\\". Schoolmates described her as shy and prone to tantrums; her tendency to tell boastful tall-tales about her family led to ostracism by her peers. Supported by her father, Manning read and wrote extensively, preferring novels, especially those by H. Rider Haggard. Her mother discouraged such pursuits, and confiscated material she thought unsuitable; when she found her daughter reading the Times Literary Supplement she scolded that \\"young men do not like women who read papers like that\\", and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills, such as typing. Indeed, when financial circumstances forced Manning to leave school at sixteen, she worked as a typist and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes. Early career Manning's first published works were three serialised detective novels, Rose of Rubies, Here is Murder and The Black Scarab which appeared in the Portsmouth News beginning in 1929 under the pseudonym Jacob Morrow. Manning did not acknowledge these books until the 1960s; their publication dates might have given away her age, a secret she kept even from her husband. Between 1929 and 1935 she wrote about 20 short stories, including a ghost story that was the first work to be published under her own name, though using initials to obscure her gender. Manning also wrote two literary novels, neither of which was accepted for publication. Her second manuscript sufficiently impressed Edward Garnett, a literary editor at Jonathan Cape, that he asked his assistant Hamish Miles to write her a note of encouragement. Miles, a respected and well-connected literary adviser and translator in his late thirties, invited Manning to visit if she were ever in London. Manning, feeling stifled in Portsmouth, had already made efforts to move to the capital, but her meeting with Miles made her more determined. She succeeded in obtaining a typing job at the department store Peter Jones, and, despite opposition from her mother, moved into a run- down bed-sit in Chelsea. Short of food and money, Manning spent long hours writing after work. Miles took Manning under his wing, dazzling her with dinners, literary conversation, and gossip, and providing unaccustomed support. A married man with two children, he told Manning that his wife was an invalid and no longer able to tolerate sex; they soon became lovers. Manning later recalled that \\"sex for both of them was the motivating charm of life\\". A case of mistaken identity involving an artist with a similar name led Manning to a better-paid job antiquing furniture, at which she worked for more than two years, still writing in her spare time. She recalled this as \\"one of the happiest seasons\\" of her life. With Miles' encouragement she completed a novel, The Wind Changes, and saw it published by Jonathan Cape in April 1937. The novel, set in Dublin in June 1921 during the Irish War of Independence, revolved around a woman torn between an Irish patriot and an English writer with pro-Republican sympathies. It was well received, with one reviewer commenting that \\"the novel shows unusual promise\\". Soon after, Miles learnt that he had an inoperable brain tumour, and disappeared from Manning's life. Since the affair had been kept secret she had difficulty obtaining information about him, and could not afford to visit him in the Edinburgh hospital where he lay dying. She lost her job at Peter Jones, moved to a well-paid job at the Medici Society, but was sacked when she refused her boss's order to give up novel-writing in the evening so as to conserve her energy for the day job. Manning obtained other work assessing new novels for their potential as films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but by the time she had saved sufficient money for a trip to Edinburgh, Miles was too ill to see her. He died in December 1937. Miles did not normally introduce his literary friends to each other, but before his death, he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet Stevie Smith. The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London's backstreets, with regular outings to museums, cinema, and visits to the Palmers Green home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt. According to a mutual friend, Manning found in Smith's home \\"an atmosphere of security and comfort which must have made her room in Oakley Street seem even chillier and more threadbare\\". The novelist and critic Walter Allen met Manning in 1937 and observed that she had a \\"devastating\\" wit \\"and was as formidable a young woman as any in London\\". Manning and Smith, he added, were a malicious pair of snobs. Marriage and Romania In July 1939, Walter Allen introduced Manning to the charming Marxist R. D. \\"Reggie\\" Smith. Smith was a large, energetic man, possessed of a constant desire for the company of others. The son of a Manchester toolmaker, he had studied at Birmingham University, where he had been coached by the left-wing poet Louis MacNeice and founded the Birmingham Socialist Society. According to the British intelligence organisation MI5, Smith had been recruited as a communist spy by Anthony Blunt on a visit to Cambridge University in 1938. When he met Manning, Smith was on leave from his British Council position as a lecturer in Romania. He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works, and felt that her book The Wind Changes showed \\"signs of genius\\". He described Manning as a jolie laide, possessing lovely hair, hands, eyes, and skin though an overlong nose, and fell in love at first sight. When he borrowed a half-crown from her on their first meeting and repaid it the next day, he knew they would marry. Manning was less certain of the relationship, but Smith quickly moved into her flat, proposing in bed a few weeks later. They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18 August 1939, with Stevie Smith and Louis MacNeice as witnesses. The bridegroom, unconventionally yet true to form, did not produce a ring for the ceremony. A few days after the wedding, the couple received word that Smith had been recalled to Bucharest. They left within a matter of hours; Manning later wrote to Stevie Smith from Romania asking her to find out what had happened to their flat and to take care of her books while she was away. The couple travelled by train to Bucharest, arriving on 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany. Between the two world wars, Romania had looked to France to guarantee its security against German territorial aspirations. The impact of the Munich Agreement (1938), the German‚ÄìSoviet Non-Aggression Pact (1939), and the Fall of France (1940) increased German influence and control over the country, and included demands that Romania cede territory and resources. The couple's time in Bucharest coincided with the rise of fascist and totalitarian power within ostensibly neutral Romania, while war threatened from without, driving thousands of refugees within its borders. The Smiths initially rented a flat, but later moved in with the diplomat Adam Watson, who was working with the British Legation. Those who knew Manning at the time described her as a shy, provincial girl who had little experience with other cultures. She was both dazzled and appalled by Romania. The caf√© society, with its wit and gossip, appealed to her, but she was repelled by the peasantry and the aggressive, often mutilated, beggars. Her Romanian experiences were captured in the first two volumes of The Balkan Trilogy (The Great Fortune and The Spoilt City), considered one of the most important literary treatments of Romania during the war. In her novels, Manning described Bucharest as being on the margins of European civilisation, \\"a strange, half-Oriental capital\\" that was \\"primitive, bug-ridden and brutal\\", whose citizens were peasants, whatever their wealth or status. alt= Period photo of thousands of armed soldiers marching down a city street and around a circular park, while a horse and carriage and car pass in the opposite direction Manning spent her days writing; her main project was a book about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha, but she also maintained an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj, Transylvania, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Smith with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Smith's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another. Smith was relentlessly gregarious, and throughout his life, his warmth, wit, and friendliness earned him many friends and drinking companions. In contrast, Manning was reticent and uncomfortable in social settings and remained in the background. She acted, in her own words, as a \\"camp-follower\\", trailing after Smith as he went from bar to bar, often choosing to go home early and alone. While Manning remained faithful to Smith during the war, their friend Ivor Porter was to report that Smith had numerous affairs. The approaching war and rise of fascism and the Iron Guard in Romania disconcerted and frightened Manning. The abdication of King Carol and the advance of the Germans in September 1940 increased her fears, and she repeatedly asked Smith \\"But where will the Jews go?\\" Just before German troops entered Romania on 7 October at the invitation of the new dictator Ion Antonescu, Manning flew to Greece, followed a week later by Smith. Greece and Egypt Manning was subject to anxieties bordering on paranoia throughout her life. She had good reason to be concerned about Smith, who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German Lufthansa airline ‚Äì Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to Axis countries. He arrived safely, bringing a rucksack, a suitcase full of books, but no appropriate clothes for work. Smith relaunched his hectic social life, but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community, focussing instead on her writing. Nevertheless, this was a happy time for Manning; \\"Romania is abroad,\\" said Manning, \\"but Greece is home\\". Manning had her admirers, including Terence Spencer, a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Smith was busy with other activities ‚Äì he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in Friends and Heroes, the third book of The Balkan Trilogy. Soon after their arrival, Greece entered the war against the Axis. German soldiers raising a alt= refer to caption In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces, by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans; in a later poem Manning recalled the \\"horror and terror of defeat\\" of a people she had grown to love. The British Council advised its staff to evacuate, and on 18 April Manning and Smith left Piraeus for Egypt on the Erebus, the last civilian ship to leave Greece. For the three dangerous days of the passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wives‚Äì the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms by the end of the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot. Arriving in Alexandria, the refugees gratefully devoured the food provided by the British military, but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis. Manning's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: \\"For weeks we lived in a state of recoil\\". From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy. He invited them to stay at his Garden City flat that overlooked the embassy. Though nominally an independent country, Egypt had been effectively under British control since the late nineteenth century. With the outbreak of war, and under the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, the country was under virtual occupation by the British. At this stage in the war, the Germans were advancing apparently unstoppably across the desert towards Egypt, and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms. Manning was jittery and fearful. She was constantly anxious about illness and was indeed frequently unwell. Concerned, Smith suggested that it might be best if she returned to England, but she retorted \\"Wherever we go, we go together. If we return home, we both go. I won't have the war separating us. End of story.\\" Her father had made her a firm believer in the British Empire and the benefits it had brought the world, and Manning was a patriotic Briton, confident of ultimate Allied success. In Egypt, she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular. Smith quickly discovered the Anglo-Egyptian Union in Zamalek, where he drank and talked politics and poetry. As usual, he was well liked, and according to Lawrence Durrell often had a string of disreputable friends with him. Manning was much less popular. Durrell described her as a \\"hook- nosed condor\\", whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her. Manning was incensed that the British Council did not immediately find a job for Smith, whom she considered one of their most brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the council's representative, C. F. A. Dundas, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in Fortunes of War. Manning's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on Lord Dunsany, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists, poets, and writers in Cairo, paid so little attention to her and Smith; she later took revenge in a similar way. alt= Period photo of a hotel, with four stories, large square windows, and a wrought iron portico with flags. Pedestrians, horse-drawn carriages and a motor car are before it In October 1941, Smith was offered a post as lecturer at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Smith and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years. The air raids became intolerable to Manning, and she soon moved back to Cairo, where in late 1941 she became press attach√© at the United States Legation. In her spare time, she worked on Guests at the Marriage, an unpublished prototype for The Balkan Trilogy, as well as short stories and poetry, some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hopes of getting them published. Over the years, Stevie had brooded over Manning's desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie Smith, and around this time Stevie's jealousy took an overt form; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled \\"Murder\\", in which a man stands beside a grave and admits, \\"My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed ‚Äì / Well, fare his soul well, fear not I the dead\\". In subsequent reprintings, the name \\"Reggie Smith\\" was replaced by \\"Filmer Smith\\", veiling the allusion, but Manning found out and was furious. During her time in Egypt, Manning became a contributor to two Middle East-based literary magazines, \\"Desert Poets\\" and \\"Personal Landscapes\\", founded by Bernard Spencer, Lawrence Durrell, and Robin Fedden. The latter sought to explore the \\"personal landscapes\\" of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece, Manning wrote \\"We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of our return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own.\\" During their time in Egypt and Palestine, Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie Papadimitriou. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in \\"Poets in Exile\\" in Cyril Connolly's magazine Horizon. She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were \\"out of touch\\", suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages, and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell who objected to Spencer's poetry being praised at his expense. In 1942, Smith was appointed as Controller of English and Arabic Programming at the Palestine Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem; the job was to begin later, but in early July, with the German troops rapidly advancing on Egypt, he persuaded Manning to go ahead to Jerusalem to \\"prepare the way\\". Palestine The couple were to spend three years in Jerusalem. On arrival, Manning approached the Jerusalem Post for a job, and was soon appointed a reviewer. Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem's Public Information office, and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem. Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and took advantage of army drivers who were willing to give lifts to civilians; she visited Palestine, Petra and Damascus, gathering material for future works. alt= A period photo of street scene. Cars and pedestrians move through an intersection decorated with Union Jacks and Allied flags In 1944, Manning became pregnant; the couple were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, becoming less critical of others, including her own mother, with whom she had long had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, she rested, walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month, the baby died in utero, and as was the practice at the time, Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. \\"I am like a walking cemetery\\", she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Smith would be assassinated. Smith decided that she was having a nervous breakdown, and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month's holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this \\"strange and difficult woman\\", and Smith's \\"wonderfully patient\\" behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats. During her time in the Middle East, Manning had picked up amoebic dysentery, which led to several admissions to hospitals in Cairo and Palestine. When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, her state of health led the couple to decide that Manning should return to Britain earlier than Smith. They travelled to Suez together, where she sailed for home alone. Post-war England After a brief stay with her still- grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Smith arrived in mid-1945 and found a job in the Features Department of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). He was identified as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947 and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Smith had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Smith was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956. Manning also worked for the BBC; she wrote scripts for including adaptations of novels by George Eliot, Arnold Bennett and Ada Leverson. She completed her book on Stanley and Emin Pasha, titled The Remarkable Expedition in the UK and The Reluctant Rescue in the US, which was published in 1947, and subsequently reissued in 1985. The book received generally good reviews but remains comparatively unknown. In 1948, her book of short stories, Growing Up, was published by Heinemann, with the title story a fictionalised account of her affair with Hamish Miles. Manning was to remain with the publisher until 1974. alt= a head and shoulders engraving of a bearded man wearing a buttoned up jacket, round spectacles and an Eastern-style hat After living in a series of rented flats, in 1951 the couple moved to a house in St. John's Wood, where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors Julian Mitchell and Tony Richardson. Fuelled by plenty of gin and tonic to cover her shyness, Manning could be a witty participant in London's literary scene; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions, such as claiming a family relationship to Marie Belloc Lowndes and that she had received a marriage proposal from Anthony Burgess the morning after his wife's death. Her insecurities also showed in other ways: she was very anxious about finances, and always alert for ways to make and save money. After the war both she and Smith were unfaithful. At parties, Smith would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters, while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both William Gerhardie and Henry Green, and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger, Tony Richardson. Jerry Slattery, her doctor, became her long-term lover; her affair came as a shock to Smith, who felt he must have disappointed his wife. After a difficult start, Smith adjusted and soon became a close friend of Slattery. Manning's adultery in some ways made it easier for Smith to justify his own frequent affairs, including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson, who was to become his second wife. Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities, usually responding, \\"you know what Reggie's like\\". The two never contemplated divorce, believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment. Manning's first post-war novel, Artist Among the Missing, an evocative account of life in the Middle East, was published in 1949 and received mixed reviews. She worked on an Irish travel book, The Dreaming Shore, which drew on her Anglo-Irish upbringing, but proved \\"a millstone\\" as it required multiple expensive journeys to Ireland. The book was notable for her view that Ireland would one day be united. Manning continued the series of publications with School for Love, published in 1951. The novel concerned a boy growing up in Palestine during the Second World War. With its publication, Smith, on whom Manning relied heavily for literary judgment, help, and support, boasted that \\"My Olivia is what might be called an established author\\". The novel was generally well-received, but faced the possibility of a libel suit from Clarissa Graves, sister of Robert on whom Miss Bohun, one of the novel's characters, may have been based. Manning supplemented her book writing by reviewing for The Spectator, The Sunday Times, The Observer, Punch and others, as well as making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post. Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling that she did not get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. She consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her \\"the world's worst grumbler\\", and the publisher remembered that she was \\"never an easy author to handle\\". A friend gave her the nickname \\"Olivia Moaning\\", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance. In 1955 Manning published The Doves of Venus, which drew on her experiences in London in the 1930s; the two friends, Ellie Parsons and Nancy Claypole, bore similarities to Manning and Stevie Smith. In the book, an isolated Ellie seeks to escape a stultifying mother. The reviews were generally favourable, but Manning was not satisfied. Perhaps annoyed at her depiction in the novel, Stevie Smith wrote what Manning described as a \\"bitchy review\\"; the two great friends barely spoke thereafter, despite Smith's efforts at a rapprochement. Eventually, Manning grudgingly forgave her: learning of Smith's final illness, she remarked, \\"Well, if she's really ill, we'll have to let bygones be bygones.\\" Much time and focus were given to animals, especially the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond. She was very concerned about the health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets ‚Äì telling one \\"I do not pay you to tell me that there is nothing wrong with my animal\\" ‚Äì and trying animal faith healers at times. She was also a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats, published in 1967. In December 1956, Manning published My Husband Cartwright, a series of twelve sketches about Smith that had originally appeared in Punch. It was not widely reviewed, and as usual, Manning was frustrated and annoyed. The book was to be a precursor of her portrait of her husband in Fortunes of War, detailing comic episodes that highlighted Smith's character, including his gregarious nature and interest in social issues: \\"My husband Cartwright is a lover of his fellow-men. Lovers of their fellow-men can be maddening ... While lecturing abroad he suddenly conceived a resentment of 'sights' especially 'useless' sights, such as ruins or tombs. You might suppose that were it not for such distractions as Tiberias, the Valley of the Kings or Hadrian's Villa, tourists abroad would occupy themselves solely in alleviating poverty.\\" The Balkan Trilogy and other works Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's main project was The Balkan Trilogy, a sequence of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Smith. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they live and work in Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person, though there was significant fictionalisation. While Manning had been 31 and Smith 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not. alt= Large public building fronted by sentry boxes and a near-empty square. The first book in the trilogy, The Great Fortune, received mixed reviews, but subsequent volumes, The Spoilt City and Friends and Heroes were generally well-received; Anthony Burgess announced that Manning was \\"among the most accomplished of our women novelists\\" and comparisons were made to Lawrence Durrell, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell. There were a few unfavorable criticisms, and as usual, they ignited Manning's ire. Following the publication of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. \\"Everything fizzled out\\", she said. \\"I wasted a lot of time and that is something which you cannot afford to do when you are sixty\\"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two. The Levant Trilogy The 1970s brought a number of changes to the household: the couple moved to a smaller apartment following Smith's early retirement from the BBC and 1972 appointment as a lecturer at the New University of Ulster in Coleraine. The couple subsequently lived apart for long periods, as Manning rejected the idea of moving to Ireland. Manning was always a close observer of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend Kay Dick that, \\"I write out of experience, I have no fantasy. I don't think anything I've experienced has ever been wasted. Her 1974 novel The Rain Forest showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel's central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies against the background of a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning's lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker prize. Early in 1975 Manning began The Danger Tree, which for a time she described as \\"The Fourth Part of the Balkan Trilogy\\"; in the event, it became the first novel in The Levant Trilogy, continuing the story of the Pringles in the Middle East. The first book proved \\"a long struggle\\" to write, in part because of Manning's lack of confidence in her powers of invention: the book juxtaposes the Desert War experiences of a young officer, Simon Boulderstone, with the securer lives of the Pringles and their circle. Manning, fascinated by sibling relationships, and remembering the death of her own brother, also examined the relationship between Simon and his elder brother, Hugo. She felt inadequate in her ability to write about soldiers and military scenes; initial reviewers agreed, finding her writing unconvincing and improbable, though subsequent reviewers have been considerably kinder. British soldiers at alt=period photo of helmeted soldiers with rifles running through dust and smoke While some parts of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of The Danger Tree describes the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb during a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief- stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Smith in their artistic circle in Cairo. The scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring that there should be no further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer, and poet Stephen Haggard, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson, and remained with them until the end of her life. The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, The Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 Birthday Honours. With Field Marshal Montgomery's Memoirs as her guide, Manning found battle scenes easier to write in the second volume of the trilogy, The Battle Lost and Won. After a slow start, Manning wrote with certainty and speed; the book was completed in a record seven months and published in 1978. The book follows the Pringles as Rommel and the Afrika Korps approach Alexandria, where Guy is teaching. Egypt remains a place of privilege and sexual exchange for the non-combatants and the Pringles' marriage slowly disintegrates. Final years Manning was deeply affected by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant for more than a quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery. The Sum of Things was published posthumously, for on 4 July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting friends in the Isle of Wight. She died in hospital in Ryde on 23 July; somewhat typically, Smith, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He could not bear to see her \\"fade away\\" and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Smith would be late for her funeral, and he almost was. His mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in The Sum of Things. Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight. Manning had long complained about the lack of recognition she had received as a writer and was not consoled when her husband and friends responded that her talent would be recognised, and her works read for years to come. \\"I want to be really famous now, Now\\", she retorted. As it happened, her renown and readership developed substantially after her death; a television serialisation of Fortunes of War starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh finally came to fruition in 1987, bringing her work to a wider audience. Work =Reception= The posthumous popularity of Fortunes of War notwithstanding, most of Manning's books are rarely read and have received little critical attention. Of her books, only Fortunes of War, School for Love, The Doves of Venus, The Rain Forest and A Romantic Hero remain in print. Some of her novels, most often Fortunes of War, have been translated into French, German, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Greek, Romanian and Hebrew. As in her lifetime, opinions are divided; some assert that her books are \\"flawed by self-indulgence and a lack of self-judgment\\", and criticise portrayals of ethnic and religious groups as stereotyped and caricatured. Others praise tight, perceptive and convincing narratives and excellent characterisation. Her plots are often described as journeys, odysseys and quests in both literal and metaphorical senses. Manning's talent for \\"exquisite evocations of place\\", including physical, cultural and historical aspects have been widely admired, and the critic Walter Allen complimented her \\"painter's eye for the visible world\\". Fortunes of War Manning's best known works, the six books comprising Fortunes of War, have been described as \\"the most underrated novels of the twentieth century\\" and the author as \\"among the greatest practitioners of 20th-century roman-fleuve\\". Written during the Cold War more than sixteen years after the period described, The Balkan Trilogy, set in Romania and Greece, is considered one of the most important literary treatments of the region in wartime, while criticised for the Cold War era images of Balkanism, and for Manning's inability to \\"conceal her antipathy towards all things Romanian\\". The Levant Trilogy, set in the Middle East, is praised for its detailed description of Simon Boulderstone's desert war experience and the juxtaposition of the Pringles and their marriage with important world events. Excerpts from the novels have been reprinted in collections of women's war writing. Theodore Steinberg argues for the Fortunes of War to be seen as an epic novel, noting its broad scope and the large cast of interesting characters set at a pivotal point of history. As with other epic novels, the books examine intertwined personal and national themes. There are frequent references to the Fall of Troy, including Guy Pringle's production of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida in which British expatriates play themselves while Romania and Europe mirror the doomed Troy. In Steinberg's perspective, the books also challenge the typically male genre conventions of the epic novel by viewing the war principally through the eyes of a female character \\"who frequently contrasts her perceptions with those of the men who surround her\\". In contrast, Adam Piette views the novel sequence as a failed epic, the product of a Cold War desire to repress change as illustrated by \\"Harriet's self-pityingly dogged focus on their marriage\\" without dealing with the radicalism of the war, and fate of its victims as represented by Guy and his political engagement. Other works Manning's other works have largely been described as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, The Wind Changes (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its \\"subtle exploration of relationships against a backdrop of war\\". Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to write about it. Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, The Artist Among the Missing (1949) and School for Love (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism. Manning wrote reviews, radio adaptations and scripts and several non-fiction books. Her book The Remarkable Expedition (1947) about Emin Pasha and Henry Stanley was generally well reviewed, and when reissued in 1985 was praised for its humour, story telling and fairness to both subjects. Her travel book about Ireland, The Dreaming Shore (1950), received a mixed review even from her old friend Louis MacNeice, but extracts from this and other of Manning's Irish writing have subsequently been admired and anthologised. Manning's book Extraordinary cats (1967) proved to be chiefly about her own well-loved pets, and Stevie Smith's review in the Sunday Times complained that the book was \\"more agitated than original\\". She also published two collections of short stories, the well- reviewed Growing Up (1946) and A Romantic Hero and Other Stories (1967); the latter included eight stories from the earlier volume, and is imbued with a sense of mortality. =Themes= War In contrast to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount life on the home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non- combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and \\"with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant\\". Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely from the perspective of a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that \\"it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper\\". There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetition ‚Äì of stories, events and deaths ‚Äì used to give \\"the impression of lives trapped in an endless war\\" for which there is no end in sight. Colonialism and imperialism A major theme of Manning's works is the British empire in decline. Her fiction contrasts deterministic, imperialistic views of history with one that accepts the possibility of change for those displaced by colonialism. Manning's works take a strong stance against British imperialism, and are harshly critical of racism, anti-Semitism and oppression at the end of the British colonial era. \\"British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self-serving system, which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is actually on the verge of being dismantled\\", writes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning's novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence. In this view, Harriet's character, marginalised as an exile and a woman, is both oppressor and oppressed, while characters such as Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others, reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, who has written extensively on Manning's writing from a colonial and post-colonial perspective, notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers; the responses of the Pringles assert \\"the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised\\" and native Egyptians, though given very little direct voice in The Levant Trilogy, nevertheless assert subjectivity for their country. In The Artist Among the Missing (1949), Manning illustrates the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind in which the British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The School for Love (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment in a city that is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun. Manning explores these themes not only in her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, colonialist attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus on the impact of the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post- independence prospects. Displacement and \\"Otherness\\" Displacement and alienation are regular themes in Manning's books. Characters are often isolated, physically and emotionally removed from family and familiar contexts and seeking a place to belong. This crisis of identity may reflect that of Manning herself as the daughter of an Irish mother and a British naval officer. \\"I'm really confused about what I am, never really feeling that I belong in either place\\", she told an interviewer in 1969. In Manning's war fiction, conflict creates additional anxiety, emotional displacement and distance, with characters unable to communicate with each other. Eve Patten notes the \\"pervasive sense of liminality\\" and the recurrent figure of the refugee in Manning's work. Early literary interest in displacement was reinforced by Manning's own terrifying and disorientating experiences as a refugee during the war. Her travels also brought her into direct contact with the far worse plight of other war refugees, including Jewish asylum-seekers who were leaving Romania aboard the Struma. Exile had its rewards for literary refugees such as Manning, offering exposure to different cultures and \\"the sense of a greater, past civilisation\\", as she described in her 1944 review of British poetry. Her writing reflects her deep concern for the realities of most refugees, who are portrayed as \\"a degraded and demoralised Other\\", challenging complacent Western notions of stability and nationality. Manning has been classified as an Orientalist writer, whose depictions of cultures frequently emphasise exoticism and alien landscape. This feature has been most closely examined in her novels set in Romania. In these, scholars note Manning's positioning of Romania as an exotic \\"Other\\", a legacy of the Ottoman Empire located at the limits of civilised Europe and on the frontier with the uncivilised Orient. Her negative perceptions of Romanian \\"Otherness\\" include a childlike population living decadent lives, passive and immoral women, corruption, and a wild, untamed environment. These are contrasted with more positive reactions to Greece and Western Europe as the centre of civilising and orderly life in other books. In keeping with colonial construction of exoticism in Western literature, \\"otherness\\" is increasingly domesticated as characters recognise, with greater exposure to the country, links to Western culture. Her depiction of Romania led to Fortunes of War being restricted as seditious writing under Romania's Communist government. Gender and feminism Manning's books are not easily classified as a part of the feminist canon. Manning supported the rights of women, particularly equal literary fees, but had no sympathy for the women's movement, writing that \\"[t]hey make such an exhibition of themselves. None can be said to be beauties. Most have faces like porridge.\\" In Manning's books, the word \\"feminine\\" is used in a derogatory sense, and tends to be associated with female complacency, foolishness, artifice and deviousness, and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife, mother and the private domain. Elizabeth Bowen remarked that Manning had \\"an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience\\" that influenced her writing about women and the war. Manning viewed herself not as a female writer, but as a writer who happened to be a woman, and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials. Manning found it easier to create male characters, and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender, writing about people rather than women in particular. Harriet Pringle, for example, moves through processes of self-discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in feminist solidarity with her sex. In Manning's The Doves of Venus (1960), based on Manning's friendship with Stevie Smith, female characters display \\"the 1950s anger more often associated ... with young men\\". Treglown comments on how Manning's early books generally took a forthright approach to sex, often initiated by female characters. Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes, with a subtler depiction of sex, sensuality and sexual frustration in Fortunes of War. The Jungian critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning's female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society's gender norms, including for having erotic feelings. In contrast, Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning's ongoing grieving for her stillborn child.

It was unique in that it provided libraries of clip art and templates through a simple interface to build signs, posters and banners with household dot-matrix printers.InfoWorld magazine, page 57 - 17 September 1984 Over the years, the software has been updated to accommodate changing file formats and printer technologies. The original version was for the Apple II and created signs, cards, banners, and letterheads. Designed by David Balsam and programmed by Martin Kahn, it became one of the most popular Apple II titles of all time. Versions for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and the Atari 8-bit family followed, as did a variant for the Apple IIGS. These versions were published in Europe by Ariolasoft. Reception The Print Shop was very successful. In 1985, it and Ghostbusters were reportedly the two most widely pirated Commodore 64 programs. II Computing listed it seventh on the magazine's list of top Apple II non-game, non-educational software as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data. In 1988, Broderbund announced that the company had sold more than one million copies, and that sales of the software comprised 4% of the entire United States software market in 1987. The series comprised 29% of Broderbund revenue in fiscal year 1992. Ahoy!s reviewer called the Commodore 64 version of The Print Shop \\"one of the best thought out, easiest to use packages I've come across\\", reporting that he did not need to use the manual to produce his first greeting cards. He predicted that the software \\"is destined to become one of the most popular packages for the Commodore 64\\". II Computing criticized the Apple II version's inflexible layout options and lack of print preview, but concluded that it \\"is truly 'a graphics utility for the rest of us', encouraging creativity and self- expression ... you'll want to use this program over and over again\\". The Print Shop Companion The Print Shop Companion, developed by Roland Gustafsson and released in 1985, added a calendar feature, an updated graphic editor, font and border editors, and a \\"Creature Maker\\" game, as well as an expanded library of fonts, borders, and graphics. Initially, to use the new fonts and borders in The Print Shop Companion had to modify the original program; subsequent releases of The Print Shop included built-in support for Companion. In 1986, the first Apple Macintosh version was released. It featured graphics by Marney Morris and was the most powerful version available at the time. It was popular in schools and contained a unique feature with which graphics could be transferred to or from a MacPaint file. Graphics libraries for The Print Shop came from Broderbund and other vendors. Libraries were produced for the original version and continued to be rolled out as late as the 1990s. User-produced graphics were also commonly distributed by various user groups, and even submitted to disk magazines, such as the Softdisk family of magazines. The New Print Shop and subsequent versions The New Print Shop came out in 1988 for Apple II and MS-DOS, and improved on the original. Print Shop Deluxe, for Mac, MS-DOS, and Windows, followed in 1993. Deluxe used a new all-graphical interface still found in Print Shop programs today and allowed for the creation of calendars. Print Shop Deluxe Companion added new modules and graphics, and the Ensemble version combined The Print Shop, the Companion, and several graphics libraries on one CD. Many new versions of The Print Shop followed, such as Ensemble II. Now over 20 years old, Print Shop still generates printed greeting cards, banners, and signs. It offers new types of printed output, including CD and DVD labels and inserts, iPod skins, and photo book pages. For small-business users, it also offers projects such as business cards, letterheads, and presentations. On January 15, 2010, a new version for the PC-supporting Windows 7 titled The Print Shop 2.0 was released, published by Encore, Inc.. It is published in Standard, Deluxe, and Professional variants. To address Windows 7 support for pre-2.0 projects, an incremental release to the old line, The Print Shop Version 2.1 was released in July 2010. For macOS (formerly Mac OS X), the most recent version is 4.0, developed and published by Software MacKiev, and released in December 2017.

They stand watch on a 24-hour basis, constantly monitoring world events and keeping senior White House staff apprised of significant incidents.Inside the Situation Room: A National Nerve Center, Apr 14, 2007 Functions President thumb President left left President thumb The mission of the Situation Room is to provide current intelligence and crisis support to the NSC staff, the national security advisor, and the President. In effect, the Situation Room is a 24/7 meeting place for sensitive information flowing into and out of the White House. It is also the funnel through which most communications, especially classified information, will pass when the president is not in residence. It is an essential link, providing the traveling White House with access to all the information available from Washington's national security community. The day begins with the watch team's preparation of the Morning Book. Prepared for the president, vice president, and most senior White House staff, the Morning Book contains a copy of the National Intelligence Daily, the State Department's Morning Summary, and diplomatic cables and intelligence reports. The Morning Book is usually in the car when the national security advisor is picked up for work. The morning routine also includes the President's Daily Brief, which is prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, hand-delivered, and briefed by an intelligence community officer to the president and other NSC principals. In addition, the Watch Teams produce morning and evening summaries of highly selective material. These summaries, targeted on current interagency issues, are transmitted electronically to the NSC staff. The Situation Room staff also provides alerts on breaking events to NSC and White House personnel. Responsibility for informing the president belongs to the national security adviser. Later, a written \\"Sit Room Note\\" will be prepared, summarizing the event with up-to-the-minute reports from other centers, perhaps including a photo, diagram, or map. The task of the Situation Room staff is to ensure that the president and national security advisor are informed not only of the current situation but also how the situation is being portrayed by the media. Another typical Situation Room activity is arranging the president's phone calls and other sensitive communications with foreign heads of state. This includes coordinating the timing of such calls at each end, providing interpreters where necessary, and ensuring appropriate security and record keeping. In this function, the Situation Room coordinates closely with the White House Communications Agency. 2006‚Äì2007 renovations Situation Room: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, May 1, 2011thumb Video of the Situation Room facilities after the renovations The only comprehensive renovation of the Situation Room took place from 2006 to 2007. Prior to the renovation, the room used cathode ray tubes for monitors and fax for communication and had computers and telephones with 1985-era technology. The room also had a small kitchen with no sink. Encrypted audio/visual equipment was also unreliable, and such equipment would sometimes go black, \\"prompting a presidential outburst\\". The Situation Room once described as \\"uncomfortable, unaesthetic and essentially oppressive,\\" while other termed the pre-renovation complex \\"something of a low-tech dungeon.\\" Planning for the renovation began before the September 11, 2001, attacks, although the project became more urgent afterward. Renovations began in August 2006, when the Situation Room complex was gutted down to bricks and bare floor and rebuilt from the ground up. The complex was renovated over about four and a half months and was disruptive, particularly to White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten, whose office was directly above it. The New York Times reported that \\"Staff members described sitting in his room and hearing ear-piercing noise or watching water ripple in glasses on his desk as the floor shook.\\" The renovation yielded several pieces from decades before, including coaxial cables, columns and a frame window from a Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äìera sunken courtyard that was later built over. The renovations also included an expansion of the Situation Room's use from only the National Security Council to include the Homeland Security Council and office of the White House chief of staff. Some of the mahogany was removed to reduce noise, and three secure video rooms were added in addition to the two already in place. A secure direct feed to Air Force One was added. Additionally, the room was revamped to make future technological upgrades easier‚Äî\\"so you don't have to carve a hole in an antique mahogany wall to improve it,\\" according to Deputy White House Chief of Staff Joe Hagin. Sensors were installed in the ceilings to detect cellular signals to prevent unauthorized communications and bugging by mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and other devices. Before the renovation, the Secret Service confiscated phones but had no other means of preventing smuggled communication devices. The new complex includes a lead-lined cabinet near the reception area for the deposit of personal communication devices upon entry. Close by are glass-encased booths (which the Associated Press described as \\"retro-looking\\") for secure and private telephone calls. The seating of the room was also changed to add \\"two tiers of curved computer terminals that can be fed both classified and unclassified data from around the country and the world\\" for watch officers (who before the renovation were seated \\"so they stared at walls rather than each other\\"). The new Situation Room has six flat panel display televisions for secure videoconferencing. The renovation was formally completed by mid-May 2007. On May 17, 2007, President George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair participated in a video conference with members of their Iraq teams from the newly renovated Situation Room.White House news image of Bush and Blair's teleconference in the newly renovated Situation Room, May 17, 2007, The following day, President Bush officially opened the newly refurbished Situation Room in a ribbon-cutting ceremony.White House news image of the ribbon-cutting ceremony in the newly renovated Situation Room, May 18, 2007, See also * Situation Room ‚Äì a photograph of the situation room while receiving live updates from Operation Neptune Spear, leading to the killing of Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda. * Presidential Emergency Operations Center * Cabinet Office Briefing Room or COBR ‚Äì the United Kingdom counterpart. * National Military Command Center References Further reading * External links *Inside the White House: The Situation Room ‚Äì Video tour of or the White House Situation Room with explanation of operations and history *Inside The White House Situation Room: A National Nerve Center, CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence *White House Museum: West Wing ground floor, with floor plan and historical images Category:Rooms in the White House Category:United States National Security Council Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Situation Room"},{"id":"925993","text":"Bobbie L.

FEBO is the best- known chain of Dutch automats. Some outlets are open 24 hours a day, and are popular with locals, and those leaving clubs and bars late at night. The Dutch concept has been successfully exported overseas. = United States = 818 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, site of first U.S. Horn & Hardart Automat, with original Automat sign in July 2020 Originally, the machines in U.S. automats took only nickels. In the original format, a cashier sat in a change booth in the center of the restaurant, behind a wide marble counter with five to eight rounded depressions. The diner would insert the required number of coins in a machine and then lift a window, hinged at the top, and remove the meal, usually wrapped in waxed paper. The machines were replenished from the kitchen behind. All or most New York automats had a cafeteria-style steam table where patrons could slide a tray along rails and choose foods, which were ladled from tureens. The first automat in the U.S. was opened June 12, 1902, at 818 Chestnut St. in Philadelphia by Horn & Hardart; Horn & Hardart became the most prominent American automat chain.\\"Horn & Hardart Automat, 968 6th Ave. between 35th & 36th Sts.

The automats were popular with a wide variety of patrons, including Walter Winchell, Irving Berlin and other celebrities of the era. The New York automats were popular with unemployed songwriters and actors. Playwright Neil Simon called automats \\"the Maxim's of the disenfranchised\\" in a 1987 article. The format was threatened by the arrival of fast food, served over the counter and with more payment flexibility than traditional automats. By the 1970s, the automats' remaining appeal in their core urban markets was strictly nostalgic. Another contributing factor to their demise was the inflation of the 1970s, increasing food prices which made the use of coins increasingly inconvenient in a time before bill acceptors commonly appeared on vending equipment. At one time, there were 40 Horn & Hardart automats in New York City alone. The last one closed in 1991. Horn and Hardart converted most of its New York City locations to Burger King. At the time, the quality of the food was described by some customers as on the decline. In an attempt to bring back automats in New York City, a company called Bamn! opened a new East Village Dutch-style automat store in 2006, but it closed in 2009.

It is bounded to the north and east by the M621 motorway. The district lies in the LS10 Leeds postcode area. Belle Isle is part of the Middleton Park ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds Central parliamentary constituency. Etymology The name \\"Belle Isle\\" is first attested in the Rothwell parish register for 1762 as Newbell-ile, and then in 1763 as Belle Isle, situated at Middleton Wood End. The name is borrowed from that of the French island Belle √éle, off the Breton coast, whose name is French for 'beautiful island'. The island was captured and held by British forces from 1761 to 1763 during the Seven Years' War, and this event inspired the naming of the Yorkshire settlement.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place- Names Society, 2017), p. 25. There is also speculation that the name might be a pun on the place-name Bell Hill (which allegedly derives from the distinctive \\"bell\\" shaped early coal mining bell pits of the hilly area). History Belle Isle had its own tram link to the city centre which in 1949 was linked to the Middleton arm, creating a circular tramway largely segregated from other traffic. In the late eighteenth century, Belle Isle was just a small hamlet for workers at a colliery opposite Middleton Woods, near the current site of Middleton colliery railway. Belle Isle now consists largely of housing estates built on farming land by the local authority housing department during the clearance of slum dwellings and the expansion of Leeds in the early twentieth-century; some of these homes are now in private ownership. The estate is divided north to south by Belle Isle Road with the wide expanse of Belle Isle Circus lying at the centre of the estate. The majority of the homes in Belle Isle are red brick semi-detached houses although this stock has been added to over the years. The majority still belong to Leeds City Council and are managed locally by Belle Isle Tenant Management Organisation (TMO). BITMO is a not for profit housing company that is run by a tenant board. Some of the council estates of Belle Isle are listed below: * Petersfield Avenue * Windmill Road * The Clearings * Manor Farms (often debated as to whether this lies in Middleton) * Newhall Road * The Brooms * The Aberfields * The Lanshaws * The Nesfields A view of central Leeds from Belle Isle Road Demography Like the neighbouring communities of Beeston Hill, Holbeck and Middleton, Belle Isle is considered to be amongst the most deprived areas in the country. Examples of disadvantage found in the district include low educational attainment, low skill levels, and concerns about crime, anti-social behaviour and lack of facilities. In 2010 the Middleton Park ward which includes Belle Isle had 27487 inhabitants of which 52.2% were female and 47.8% male and 21.5% were aged 15 or under compared with an England average of 18.7%. Life Expectancy for males and females is more than three years less than the rest of Leeds. In 2001, most residents, 96.3%, identified as White British with 71.6% identifying as Christian and over 18% having no religion. Most houses are in the Council Tax Bands A and B. In April 2012, 1493 people were claiming Jobseekers allowance which at 8.3% was nearly double the Leeds' average. While all recorded crime was below the Leeds' average, criminal damage was substantially higher and nearly twice the England average. In the Middleton Park ward in 2001, there were 10,649 households. There were 1,201, households with dependent childrenhad and no adult in employment. Of the 1,410 of lone parent households with dependent children, most, 1,307 were women and most had no job. Male lone parents numbered 95 of which 39 were in full-time employment. Nearly half the households, 5,170 had no car or van. Education Belle Isle has a number of schools. Merlyn Rees Community High School, situated at the heart of Belle Isle, provided educational facilities for over 20 years (previously known as Belle Isle Middle School), but, in late 2006, the school closed down. Merlyn Rees then changed its name to South Leeds High School. It was then demolished and is now situated near South Leeds Sports centre. In 2009 the school was renamed South Leeds Academy. Other schools in the area are Windmill Primary School (previously known as Belle Isle Primary School) opposite Merlyn Rees School, and Clapgate Primary School on Cranmore Drive. Also, Sharp Lane Primary School is located near the Omnibus Pub. Broomfield SILC - Specialist Inclusive Learning Centre, an all-age generic special school is on the Broom estate. Religion St. John and St. Barnabas Church The churches of St. John and St. Barnabas (Anglican), West Grange (Evangelical) and St. Peter (Roman Catholic) serve the area. The United Reformed Church in South Leeds was built in 2011 on the site of a Congregational Church opened in 1952 on Nesfield Road. Entertainment It is the site of the popular Belle Isle Working Men's Club, which hosted many regional and national stars during the 1970s club boom. The club burnt to the ground in 2000 but was subsequently rebuilt. Notable people The television presenter and model, Nell McAndrew, is from Belle Isle. The England international rugby league players Garry Schofield, Jason Robinson and Sonny Nickle and the philosopher Paul Crowther also grew up there and were pupils at Belle Isle Primary School. Amenities At the heart of the area is a large area of public open land, in the centre of a traffic roundabout, called Belle Isle Circus; this was originally the site of a terminus for trams. The spoil tips surrounding the former colliery are now being converted into woodland, adjacent to the ancient semi-natural woodlands of Middleton Wood.

Audition RecordsAudition Records is a monthly e-magazine of Improvised Music and radical contemporary concepts focusing efforts on publishing and promoting artists working on sound improvisation and electroacoustic music. Audition Records is curated by Julian Bonequi,Julian Bonequi Live Performer musician and activist living in Berlin until November 2012. Currently the base of Audition Records is in Berlin. The philosophy of this new proposal aims to open a new space on the netaudio community focused on improvised music and live recordings of events and concerts all around the world. And as a mobile project, collecting concerts and concepts around the strong scene based in Europe. Audition Records is a series of documents centered on different compositional approaches of Free Jazz, Echtzeitmusik, Noise, Electroacoustic and all kind of Experimental and improvised music performances.  History  The project was born on 15 January 2010 in Barcelona, after Audioatalaia published the release Machinations of JoyMachinationes of Joy Dave Tucker, Ricardo Tejero & Julian Bonequi of which Julian Bonequi is former artist. Since that, Edu ComellesEdu ComellesSound Artist (the Coordinator of Audioatalaia, based in Valencia) and Julian Bonequi (project manager and curator of Audition Records) create an exclusive space for the denominated improvised music scene, without matters of the semantic school or the stylistic signature of the musicians. Audiotalaia Netlabel is a project founded with the aim to release and promote the work from Spanish artists and resident musicians working in Spain. They search for proposals in experimental sound composition, ambient music and electronic music. Audiotalaia was born from a previous project called Talaies Sonores. This project was based on the idea of dialoguing between sound composition and landscape. According to this, they look after artists working on an electronic media framework but keeping an eye into the natural world, the landscape and the environment.Audioatalaia History The first Audition Records, with no connection to the Audition Records based in Berlin, was sold in October 1959 by Enoch Light to ABC-Paramount Records.

It is an early ayurvedic medical term referring to techniques for lengthening lifespans and invigorating the body  Disambiguation  Modern authors, including the remaining part of this wikipedia entry (on 2020-10-17) commonly use the term RasƒÅyana wrongly as if it meant alchemy. This usage is not found in the primary Sanskrit literature. The common Sanskrit term for alchemy is rasa≈õƒÅstra \\"the teaching on mercury\\", although other terms are used, e.g., dhƒÅtuvƒÅda \\"doctrine of the elements.\\" History The more general name for the Indian science of alchemy or proto-chemistry is Rasa≈õƒÅstra (‡§∞‡§∏‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ in Sanskrit), or \\"The Science of Mercury,\\" in Nepali, Marathi, Hindi, Kannada and several other languages. Early Indian alchemical texts discuss the use of prepared forms of mercury or cinnabar (see samskaras). However, there is also ample mention of the preparation of medical tinctures in the early science of Indian alchemy. Significant progress in alchemy was made in ancient India. An 11th-century Persian chemist and physician named Ab≈´ RayhƒÅn Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´ reported \\"[the Indians] have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them. They call it Ras√¢yana, a word composed with rasa, i.e., gold. It means an art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, and compound medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restore the health of those who were ill beyond hope, and give back youth to fading old age...\\"p. 188, Alberuni's India, transl. Edward C. Sachau, vol. 1, London: Tr√ºbner & Co., Ludgate Hill, 1888. Rase≈õvara, a school of Indian philosophy, was focused on finding Moksha (perfection, immortality, liberation) using mercury. As such, it focused its efforts on transmutation of the human body: from mortal to immortal. The texts of Ayurvedic Medicine and Science have aspects similar to alchemy: concepts of cures for all known diseases, and treatments that focus on anointing the body with oils. Since alchemy eventually became ingrained in the vast field of Indian erudition, influences from other metaphysical and philosophical doctrines such as Samkhya, Yoga, Vaisheshika and Ayurveda were inevitable. Nonetheless, most of the RasayƒÅna texts track their origins back to Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranatha and the lineage of the Natha Siddhas. Two famous examples were Nagarjunacharya and Nityanadhiya. Nagarjunacharya was a Buddhist monk who, in ancient times, ran the great university of Nagarjuna Sagara. His book, Rasaratanakaram is a famous example of early Indian medicine. In traditional Indian medicinal terminology, \\"rusa\\" translates as \\"mercury\\" and Nagarjunacharya was said to have developed a method to convert the mercury into gold. Aim and types Rasayana therapy enriches rasa with nutrients to help one attain longevity, memory, intelligence, health, youthfulness, excellence of luster, complexion and voice, optimum development of physique and sense organs, mastery over phonetics, respectability and brilliance. ;Types of RasayanaInducting Rasayan Therapy in our Daily Routine by Dr. Krishna R.S #Kamya Rasayanas are promoters of normal health.

In pursuit of these matters, herbal prescriptions with many herbal substances, preserved in ghee and honey are given. Chyawanprasha is one of the traditional rasayanas. Specific adaptogenic herbs are also included in rasayanas including haritaki, amla, shilajit, ashwaganda, holy basil, guduchi and shatavari. Several rasayana herbs have been tested for adaptogenic properties: > The whole, aqueous, standardized extracts of selected plants (Tinospora > cordifolia, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Withmania somnifera, > Piper longum and Terminalia chebula) were administered orally to > experimental animals, in a dose extrapolated from the human dose, following > which they were exposed to a variety of biological, physical and chemical > stressors.

Rasayana formulae PuriRASAYAN: Ayurvedic Herbs of Rejuvenation and Longevity. Puri, H.S. (2003) Taylor & Francis, London has given detailed account of Classical formulations such as Amrit Rasayana, Brahm Rasayana, Jawahar Mohra, Kamdugdha Ras, Laxami Vilas Ras, Laxman Vilas Ras, Madanoday Modak, Makrdhawaj vati, Manmath Ras, Mukta Panchamrit Rasayana, Nari Kalyan Pak, Navjeevan Ras, Navratna Ras, Navratnakalp Amrit, Panchamrit Ras, Paradi Ras, Ramchuramni Ras, Rattivalbh Pak, Shukar Amrit Vati, Smritisagar Ras, Suvarn Malini Vasant, Suvarn Vasant Malti, Swapanmehtank, Vasant Kusmakar Ras, Visha Rasaayana, Vrihda Vangeshwar Rasa. These classical Rasayan formulas, contain a large number of ingredients, including minerals, pearl, coral and gems, and include a specially processed (samskara) mercury (the word ras indicates mercury as an ingredient). Because of negative publicity and cost factor, the use of the classical rasayana formulas has declined considerably, and most of the preparations available now have herbal ingredients with a couple of mineral and animal products. The non-availability and wild life protection act has made the use of musk, amber, and parts of wild-life animals nearly impossible. The current Rasayan formulas are based on such ingredients as amla (Emblica officinalis) which, if fresh, has high content of vitamin C, Terminalia belerica, Terminalia chebula, Shilajit, Long pepper, Black pepper, Ginger, processed Guggul, Guduchi, Ashwaganda, Shatavari and similar ingredients. Rasayan Shastr in Ancient India was much less developed than today. Nevertheless, the use and practice of Rasayan was widespread in Ancient India, and some examples of applied rasayan include paints used in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, Maharashtra state, the steel of Vishnustambha (literal meaning: the tower of Vishnu), and a processed wood sample in the Kondivade caves near the Rajmachi fort in Maharashtra.  Rasayana  In many Indian homes, rasayana (fruit squash) juices are prepared and served as drink, desert or as accompaniment to meals. In Tulunadu region of India, Banana and Mango Rasayana are made by mixing fruit pulp with cow's milk or coconut milk to a thick consistency. This rasayana may be drunk as juice by diluting with water or milk. With thick consistency it is used as accompaniment to Dosa, Chapati or meals. Rasayana may also be known as lassi. Many believe this rasayana helps to beat the heat of Indian summers. Rasayana is often given to devotees as Prasadam. In this case, it consists of thin slices of banana, milk or curd, sugar and honey. References Further reading * * Winston, David & Maimes, Steven.

History Although many sources give 1953 as the establishment date for Waldorf Music Hall, none of their releases appears to predate 1954.Discogs.com entry for Waldorf Music Hall Light's promotional literature identifies Waldorf Music Hall as the first record label he began on his own,Anonymous, \\"Sound and Light,\\" Billboard February 18, 1967, pg. 66 with Light's Project 3 label debuting in 1967. Therefore, the Waldorf label was \\"Project 1\\" whilst Grand Award Records and its later subsidiary Command Records became \\"Project 2\\". It was begun as a generic, \\"soundalike\\" label, with Light's stable of artists‚ÄîLoren Becker, Artie Malvin, Lois Winter, Dottie Evans and others‚Äîreproducing the hits of the day. Some have regarded Waldorf Music Hall as the first such label, but it appears that Big 4 Hits, a label based out of Cincinnati and headed by Carl Burkhardt, was established in 1952 and is therefore earlier.Rite Records Big 4 Hits Discography Emblazoned with the diamond-shaped logo \\"FDR\\"‚Äîmeaning \\"Full Dynamic Range,\\" signifying high fidelity, but also invoking an acronym for a popular American president‚ÄîWaldorf Music Hall was primarily a 10\\" LP label with 8 hits apiece; 48 releases in the 3300 series appeared between January 1954 and December 1957.Bronk, Bill, \\"Hunting Waldorf Music Hall Dime Store Vinyl Records a Satisfying Quest,\\" reprinted from Goldmine, antiquetrader.com Waldorf Music Hall also issued 45 rpm EPs of the same material;Discogs.com's Waldorf Music Hall Discography 78 rpm releases were issued on a plain label simply called \\"Waldorf\\" and on subsidiary labels 18 Top Hits and Rock N Roll.Great 78 Project: Jenny, Jenny; Little Darlin'; Bye Bye Love; Come Go With Me The 10\\" Lps sold for 99 cents, and the singles for 69 cents apiece. As mainstream pop vocals in the hit market began to give way to rock n' roll hits, Hit Parader type versions of these began to sound considerably more quaint and old- fashioned compared to the originals. Fortunately, Waldorf Music Hall had begun to diversify its offerings already through a $1.49 12\\" album program that featured coherent offerings ranging from classical and opera to children's records, jazz, dance music and gospel. In 1955, Light had begun his higher profile Grand Award label and this drew some attention away from Waldorf Music Hall; the Hit Parader issues stopped at the end of 1957. However, at the same time Waldorf gained a budget subsidiary, Colortone Records.Anonymous, \\"Waldorf Debs New Low Price Album Line, \\" Billboard December 30, 1957, pg. 13 In 1959, Enoch Light sold all of his labels to AM-PAR and became part of their organization. Grand Award continued, but at this point Waldorf Music Hall became dormant, having served its short-lived purpose. Legacy Many collectors view the Waldorf Music Hall records as \\"junk,\\" and they are relatively common in second hand shops, though it took one collector more than thirty years to locate copies of all 48 albums in the 10\\" 3300 series. Nevertheless, some of the 12\\" albums‚Äîfor example,those by the gospel group Deep River Boys and the traditional jazz band The Royal Playboys‚Äîremain desirable and are unique to Waldorf Music Hall. Moreover, the label also issued recordings by pianists Pauline Alpert and Dick Hyman (as \\"Knuckles O'Toole\\" and \\"Puddin' Head Smith\\"), bandleaders Will Bradley, Bobby Byrne and Peanuts Hucko and other significant artists under-utilized or not employed by the major labels. Waldorf Music Hall also released some novelty songs performed by TV comedian/actor Wally Cox. In keeping with Light's reputation as an audiophile, Waldorf Music Hall issues do on the whole sound better than average for Hit Parader records, and the performances are of professional caliber even if the idiom of rock 'n roll is not comfortably realized.

It is a mixed area of private suburban housing and suburban council estates. The name derives from its main park (approximately 500 metres north-south by 300 metres east-west) containing playing fields together with a conservation area of grassy meadow ending in woodland. The largest housing estate in West Park is Moor Grange. The majority of the area sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council, except for the south west corner sitting in the neighbouring Kirkstall ward. Governance The south west corner (with an eastern border of Spen Lane and the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road to the north) of West Park lies in the Kirkstall ward and the rest of the suburb sits in the Weetwood ward. As a result, West Park is split between two parliamentary constituencies with the Leeds North West constituency including Weetwood ward (served by Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament, Alex Sobel) and Leeds West constituency (represented by fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves) covering Kirkstall ward. It has the postcode of LS16. Geography The West Park district is approximately four miles north west of Leeds city centre. Its boundaries are approximately the A660 Otley Road to the east, the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road to the North, the Harrogate Line railway to the West, and the Queenswood Drive / Spen Lane intersection to the South. Amenities The amenities of West Park lie in two main areas, on Otley Road there are several shops, a post office, a laundrette, a specialist runners shop, an estate agency, Indian and Italian restaurants. There is also a nursery for children aged up to 5 years. The main parade of shops on Otley Road has Dutch fronts. There are amenities on the Moor Grange estate around Spen Lane and Butcher Hill, which include: Abbey Grange Church of England High School, St Chad's Church of England Primary School, St Andrew's church which also houses the offices of STEP (Supporting The Elderly People), a doctor's surgery, a post office, a beautician, hair salons, caf√©s, a Co-op supermarket, newsagents, takeaways, a pet shop, a charity shop, a window and glazing store, a florist, a launderette, and a public house called 'The Dalesman'. Lawnswood School lies in between West Park and Lawnswood. West Park lies close to Headingley and Horsforth which have larger local centres. The West Park Centre (an educational facility in the premises of the former West Park High School) was demolished in 2014 after the building was declared unsafe and deemed too expensive to repair.http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest- news/top-stories/demolition-day-for-west-park-centre-and-former-1950s-leeds- school-1-6387337 Transport West Park is between the A660 and the A65, with the Leeds Outer Ring Road running to the north of the area. The Leeds- Harrogate railway line runs through Moor Grange,but there is no station, the nearest to the south is Headingley and Horsforth to the north. Many bus routes run through the area, providing regular services to Leeds city centre, Headingley and Horsforth. Housing Houses on Spen Road West Park has an area of early 20th century private housing between Otley Road and Spen Lane, mainly large detached and semi detached houses. The streets here are mainly tree-lined and have wide pavements. There are also some older Victorian buildings around Otley Road, some of which have been divided into flats. The houses towards Otley Road are generally older and larger than those towards Spen Lane. The private housing generally lies to the East of West Park, where it gives way to Far Headingley to the South and Lawnswood to the North. Most of the private housing in West Park lie in a Conservation area. Norman Towers Moor Grange Estate is a 1950s-built council estate, on reclaimed farm land called 'Old Farm', together with a more affluent estate of predominantly large semi and detached housing between Spen Lane and the A660 Otley Road. The smaller Spen Estate is south of Butcher Hill. The Moor Grange area was used for filming The Beiderbecke Affair, using the Butcher Hill playing fields and the Clayton Grange flats. The crime rate in and around the Moor Grange and Spen Estates is generally lower than other council estates and house prices are similar to other North Leeds suburbs such as Roundhay, Oakwood, Adel, and Horsforth.

It is the most important modern tourist destination in the city of Valencia and one of the 12 Treasures of Spain. The City of Arts and Sciences is situated at the southeast end of the former riverbed of the river Turia, which was drained and rerouted after a catastrophic flood in 1957. The old riverbed was turned into a picturesque sunken park. Designed by Santiago Calatrava and F√©lix Candela, the project began the first stages of construction in July 1996, and was inaugurated on 16 April 1998 with the opening of L'Hemisf√®ric. The last major component of the City of Arts and Sciences, Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, was inaugurated on 9 October 2005, Valencian Community Day. The most recent building in the complex, L'√Ägora, was opened in 2009. Originally budgeted at ‚Ç¨300 million in 1991 for three structures, it has expanded about three times the initial expected cost.Suzanne Daley, Santiago Calatrava Collects Critics as Well as Fans The New York Times, Sept. 24, 2013  Buildings and structures  The complex is made up of the following buildings and structures, presented in the order of their inauguration: L'Hemisf√®ric *L'Hemisf√®ric (1998) ‚Äì an IMAX Cinema, planetarium and laserium. The building is meant to resemble a giant eye, and has an approximate surface of 13,000 m¬≤. The Hemisf√®ric, also known as the planetarium or the \\"eye of knowledge\\", is the centerpiece of the City of Arts and Sciences. It was the first building completed in 1998. Its design resembles an eyelid that opens to access the surrounding water pool. The bottom of the pool is glass, creating the illusion of the eye as a whole. This planetarium is a half-sphere in a concrete structure 110 meters long and 55.5 meters wide. The shutter is built of elongated aluminum awnings that fold upward collectively to form a brise soleil roof that opens along the curved axis of the eye. It opens to reveal the dome, the \\"iris\\" of the eye, which is the planetarium or Ominax theater. The structure is divided in half by a set of stairs that descend into the vaulted concrete lobby. The underground spaces are illuminated with the use of translucent glass panels within the walking path. The transparent roof is supported by concrete arches that connect to the sunken gallery. There is a remarkable echo in the building and if two people stand at the two opposite pillars inside of the eye they can speak with each other. Museo de las Ciencias Pr√≠ncipe Felipe *Museu de les Ci√®ncies Pr√≠ncipe Felipe (2000) ‚Äì an interactive museum of science that resembles the skeleton of a whale. It occupies around 40,000 m¬≤ on three floors. Much of the ground floor is taken up by a basketball court sponsored by a local team and various companies. The building has three floors, of which 26,000 square meters is used for exhibitions. The first floor has a view of the Turia Garden that surrounds it, which is over 13,500 square meters of water. The second floor hosts \\"The Legacy of Science\\" exhibition by researchers Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and Severo Ochoa y Jean Dausset. The third floor is known as the \\"Chromosome Forest\\" and shows the sequencing of human DNA. Also on this floor are the \\"Zero Gravity,\\" \\"Space Academy\\" and \\"Marvel Superheroes\\" exhibitions. The building's architecture is known for its geometry, structure, use of materials, and its design around nature. The building is about 42,000 square meters, of which 26,000 square meters is exhibition space, making it the largest in Spain. It has 20,000 square meters of glass, 4,000 panes, 58,000 m¬≥ of concrete, and 14.000 tons of steel. The building stands 220 meters long, 80 meters wide and 55 meters high. L'Umbracle, built over a car park *L'Umbracle (2001) ‚Äì an open structure enveloping a landscaped walk with plant species indigenous to Valencia (such as rockrose, lentisca, rosemary, lavender, honeysuckle, bougainvillea and palm trees). It harbors in its interior The Walk of the Sculptures, an outdoor art gallery with sculptures by contemporary artists (Miquel de Navarre, Francesc Abbot, Yoko Ono and others). The Umbracle is also home to numerous free-standing sculptures surrounded by nature. It was designed as an entrance to the City of Arts and Sciences. It is 320 meters long and 60 meters wide, located on the southern side of the complex. It includes 55 fixed arches and 54 floating arches that stand 18 meters high. The plants displayed were carefully picked to change colour with each season. The garden includes 99 palm trees, 78 small palm trees, and 62 bitter orange trees. There are 42 varieties of shrubs from the Region of Valencia including cistuses, mastics, buddleia, pampas grass, and plumbagos. In the garden there are 16 species of Mirabilis jalapa, or the four-o'clock flower (\\"beauty of the night\\"). Honeysuckle and hanging bougainvillea are two of the 450 climbing plants in L'Umbracle. There also are 5,500 ground cover plants such as lotus, agatea, Spanish Flags, and fig-marigolds. There are over a hundred aromatic plants including rosemary and lavender. L'Oceanogr√†fic *L'Oceanogr√†fic (2003) ‚Äì an open-air oceanographic park. It is the largest oceanographic aquarium in Europe with 110,000 square meters and 42 million liters of water. It was built in the shape of a water lily and is the work of architect F√©lix Candela. Each building represents different aquatic environments including the Mediterranean, wetlands, temperate and tropical seas, the Antarctic, the Arctic, islands and the Red Sea. This aquarium is a home to over 500 different species including dolphins, belugas, sawfish, jellyfish, starfish, sea urchins, walruses, sea lions, seals, penguins, turtles, sharks and rays. It also houses wetland bird species. Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia *Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia (2005) ‚Äì an opera house and performing arts center dedicated to music and the performing arts. It is surrounded by 87,000 square meters of landscape and water, as well as 10,000 square meters of walking area. The Palau de Les Arts has four sections: the main hall, the master hall, the auditorium, and the Martin y Soler theatre. It holds many events such as opera, theatre and music in its auditoriums. Panoramic lifts and stairways connect platforms at different heights on the inside of the metallic frames of the building. The building has a metallic feather outer roof that rests on two supports and is 230 meters long and 70 meters high. One of the supports allows for part of the building to overhang. The building is supported by white concrete. Two laminated steel shells cover the building, weighing over 3,000 tons. These shells are 163 meters wide and 163 meters long. Montolivet Bridge, newer southern segment *Montolivet Bridge (2007) - concrete road bridge crossing the dry Turia riverbed that consists of an older straight-roadway northern segment with column piers designed by Fern√°ndez Ord√≥√±ez (1933-2000) connected with a newer curved-roadway southern segment with white arch point supports designed by Santiago Calatrava, located in between, and complementing his design of, Palua de les Arts Reina Sofia and L'Hemisferic. Assut de l'Or Bridge *Assut de l'Or Bridge (2008) ‚Äì a white cable-stayed bridge sustained by a curved pylon with backstayed counterweights, crossing the dry Turia riverbed, connecting the south side with Minorca Street, in between El Museu de les Ci√®ncies and L'Agora. The pylon of the bridge, at 125 meters high, is the highest point in the city. L'√Ägora * L'√Ägora (2009) ‚Äì a covered plaza in which concerts and sporting events (such as the Valencia Open 500) are held. The Agora is a space designed to hold a variety of events such as concerts, performances, exhibitions, conventions, staging of congresses, and international sports meetings. Many important events have been held in this building, including the Freestyle Burn Spanish Cup in 2010 and the Christmas Special Program. * Valencia Towers ‚Äì part of a Calatrava project (2005) to complete the City of Arts and Sciences with the additional construction, then estimated to take more than two decades to complete, of three sculptural towers of 308, 266 and 220 m tall, which symbolize the cities of Valencia, Alicante and Castell√≥n, respectively. The proposed project has been put on hold. History =Origins of the project= In 1989, the president of the Valencian Autonomous Government, Joan Lerma, after a visit to the new Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris, and through the general director of planning and studies of the Presidency of the Generalitat Valenciana, Dr. Jos√© Mar√≠a Bernab√©, officially commissioned the scientist Dr. Antonio Ten Ros to draft a first proposal for a City of Science and Technology for Valencia. Dr. Ten Ros drew up a first draft, entitled \\"Vilanova, A City of Science for Valencia\\", which was officially presented to the Generalitat in May 1989. After that, he was formally commissioned in 1990 to direct the creation of a general draft amounting to 92,650,000 pesetas (556,000 euros), to be managed by the University of Valencia. Antonio Ten Ros assembled a team of 56 scientists, museologists and designers including Professor Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez Pi√±ero as responsible for the space \\"A walk through history\\". Ten Ros presented the draft in 32 volumes to President Lerma in the Palace of the Generalitat on 21 December 1991. The \\"City of Science and Communications\\" was the name that the autonomous government gave to the initiative, and plans included a 370m high communications tower, which would have been the third highest one in the world at that time; a planetarium; and a museum of science. The total price of the works was estimated to be about 25,000 million pesetas. In May 1991, the council approved the transfer of lands. Four months later the project plan with three structures (communications tower, planetarium, and a science museum) was presented, designed by Santiago Calatrava. The team that had designed the museum did not see eye to eye with the form in which Santiago Calatrava conceived the building, and a couple of changes were made. Preliminary site work began by the end of 1994. The project was not without controversy. The Conservative Popular Party saw in the City of Science a \\"work of the pharaohs\\" that would serve only to swell the ego of the Socialists, who were the driving forces behind the initiative. =Expanded plan and construction= Plan: longitudinal axis bisects Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia, Montolivet Bridge, L'Hemisferic, and extends through L'Agora to L'Oceanografic In 1995, the Popular Party won against the Socialists. However, several successive Popular Party governments continued and expanded the complex far beyond the original Socialist project at an enormous cost, heavily indebting the city. After a change of government in 1996, the planned telecommunication tower was cancelled and replaced by an opera house, which was more expensive, and architect F√©lix Candela was added to design an oceanographic park, all of which led to underspecified increases in the project budget and to updating the name to City of Arts and Sciences. In July 1996, the original Valencia, Ciencia y Comunicaciones was officially changed to Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias, S.A. (CACSA). Construction on the City of Arts and Sciences under CACSA began July 1996. When construction started in 1997 on the Palau de les Arts, it was built with the same foundation and the same contract that had been planned for the cancelled communications tower. The revised plan (by Calatrava) exhibited a strong longitudinal axis that defined the backbone tying together all the structures of the complex. It bisected the Opera House, Montolivet Bridge, L'Hemisferic, and extended through the Assut de L'Or Bridge and L'Agora (commissioned later in 2005) to L'Oceanografic (designed by Candela). Parallel to the axis were placed the science museum, L'Umbracle, raised promenades and reflecting pools. Another unifying element was the use of the city‚Äôs traditional heritage, viz., the use of ceramic mosaic tiles known as ‚Äútrencadis‚Äù, which was widely used as the exterior layer over the concrete surfaces of many of the buildings/structures and elements of the promenade throughout the complex. Construction continued on the site until the last structure, L'Agora, was completed in 2009. The total cost of the project came in at 1,200 million euros. =Inauguration= Logo: Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci√®ncies In April 1998, the complex opened its doors to the public with L'Hemisf√®ric. Eleven months later, the President of Valencia, Eduardo Zaplana, inaugurated the Museu de les Ci√®ncies Pr√≠ncipe Felipe, although the museum was not yet finished. The museum was opened to the public twenty months later. On 12 December 2002 was the opening of L'Oceanogr√†fic, the largest aquarium built in Europe. Queen Sofia, on 8 October 2005, inaugurated the Palau de les Arts Reina Sof√≠a, which became the opera house of Valencia. =Architects: Santiago Calatrava and F√©lix Candela= Santiago Calatrava in 2010 Santiago Calatrava was born in Valencia, Spain, on 28 July 1951. He is an architect and engineer also known for his skills in painting and sculpting. He attended the Art Academy in Valencia in the mid-1960s; then he earned a degree in architecture and a postgraduate course in city planning at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura, studied civil engineering at the Federal Polytechnic University of Zurich, and participated in academic research investigating the foldability of space frames. Calatrava's architecture aims to unite structure and movement. Early in his career, Calatrava designed Stadelhofen Station in Zurich. He was recognized for his achievement in creating poetics of movement and integrating public transportation in a natural setting and urban context. Another theme in his work was moving contraptions in his buildings; for example, his dome for the Reichstag Conversion Competition in Berlin opens and closes like a flower, and the Planetarium in the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia opens and closes like eyelids. F√©lix Candela was born on 27 January 1910 in Madrid, Spain, and died on 7 December 1997. His architectural designs are composed of reinforced concrete structures distinguished by thin, curved shells. His popularity sprung from his design, in collaboration with Jorge Gonzales Reyna, of the Cosmic Rays Pavilion (1951) in Mexico. He used his signature design of the reinforced concrete roof that varies in thickness from only 5/8 inch to 2 inches. He also built the church of La Virgin Milagrosa in Mexico City and the church of San Vicente de Paul. His designs consisted of warped-shell industrial buildings, thin-shell centenary, and barrel-vaulted factories and warehouses. Candela was also a teacher at Harvard University and the University of Illinois. Felix Candela designed the underwater city L'Oceanogr√†fic in the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, reminiscent of Antoni Gaud√≠'s work in Barcelona. =In popular culture= Parts of the musical number \\"Style\\" from the 2007 Indian film Sivaji were shot at the City of Arts and Sciences. Portions of the area were featured in the 2013 racing game Gran Turismo 6 as a photo location. Exterior scenes of the futuristic city in the 2015 film Tomorrowland were filmed around the complex. In 2016 (broadcast in 2017) it was used as a filming location for the British science- fiction television programme Doctor Who, appearing in the second episode of the tenth series, \\"Smile\\". The location was used as the headquarters of the company DELOS in the third season of the HBO series Westworld. Various exterior shots of the complex were used to depict a conceptual 2039 New York World's Fair for the season finale of Cosmos: Possible Worlds on National Geographic. Architectural elements from the site were used as a green screen backdrop for the futuristic 2720 city in the 2020 film Bill & Ted Face the Musichttps://www.atlasofwonders.com/2020/09/bill-and-ted-house-filming- locations.html October 2020 It's also used in set of the 2020 adoption of Brave New World. Economic impact In 2019 it was reported that the economic impact of the complex is ‚Ç¨113 million a year and generates 3509 jobs.

The wife of Aristobulus I, and afterward of Alexander Jannaeus,That Alexandra, the widow of Aristobulus I, was identical with the one who married his brother Alexander Jannaeus is nowhere explicitly stated by Josephus, who, it is generally inferred, took it for granted that the latter performed the levirate marriage prescribed by the law for the widow of a childless brother deceased. she was the last queen of Judea, and the last ruler of ancient Judea to die as the ruler of an independent kingdom from 76 to 67 BCE. Family Salome Alexandra's personal genealogy is not given by Josephus. Rabbinical sources designate the sage, Simeon ben Shetah, as her brother,Hezser, C. Rabbinic law in its Roman and Near Eastern context making her the daughter of Shetah Bar Yossei. Salome Alexandra's oldest son by Alexander Jannaeus was Hyrcanus II who fought his younger brother Aristobulus II in 73 BCE over the Jewish High Priesthood.Figure based upon Josephus (Antiquities 14.1.2), where, in the original Greek, is written: \\"Hyrcanus began his high priesthood on the third year of the hundred and seventy seventh Olympiad..., when presently Aristobulus began to make war against him.\\" The 177th Olympiad corresponded with the 238th year of the Seleucid era, or what was then 73 BCE. Hyrcanus II was eventually successful after enlisting the help of the Nabataean king, Aretas III; bribing Roman officials, including Scaurus; and gaining the favour of Pompey the Great, who defeated his brother and took him away to Rome.See Josephus, Jewish War (1.107 - 155) Consort According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Salome Alexandra was instrumental in arranging the assassination of her brother-in-law, Antigonus, by convincing her husband that his brother was plotting against him.\\"Aristobulus I\\", Jewish Encyclopedia Upon the death of Aristobulus in 103 BCE, Aristobulus' widow freed his half-brother, Alexander Jannaeus, who had been held in prison. During the reign of Alexander, who (according to the historian Josephus) apparently married her shortly after his accession,Josephus' statement (Jewish Antiquities xv. 6, ¬ß 3), that Hyrcanus II, Jannaeus' eldest son, was eighty years old when he was put to death by Herod, in 31 BCE, is probably erroneous, for that would set the year of his birth as 111 BCE, and Jannaeus himself was born in 125 BCE, so that he could have been but fourteen when Hyrcanus was born to him. It is difficult to understand how a thirteen-year-old boy married a widow of thirty. The statement, made by Josephus (Jewish Antiquities xiii. 11, ¬ß¬ß 1, 2), that during the reign of Aristobulus, Aristobulus' wife, presumably Salome Alexandra, brought about the death of the young prince Antigonus I, because she saw in him a rival of her husband, lacks additional confirmation. Alexandra seemed to have wielded only slight political influence, as evidenced by the hostile attitude of the king to the Pharisees. Political ability The frequent visits to the palace of the chief of the Pharisaic party, Simeon ben Shetach, who was said to be the queen's brother, must have occurred in the early years of Alexander's reign, before Alexander had openly broken with the Pharisees. Alexandra does not seem to have been able to prevent the persecution of that sect by her husband. According to archaeologist Kenneth Atkinson, \\"There are also some passages in the Talmud that say, during her husband's reign, that she protected Pharisees and hid Pharisees from his wrath.\\"Silver, Carly. \\"The Peace of Zion\\", Iron Ladies of the Ancient World, the Archaeological Institute of America (2010) Nevertheless, the married life of the royal pair seems to have ended cordially; on his deathbed Alexander entrusted the government, not to his sons, but to his wife, with the advice to make peace with the Pharisees. Salome Alexandra's next concern was to open negotiations with the leaders of the Pharisees, whose places of concealment she knew. Having been given assurances as to her future policy, they declared themselves ready to give Alexander's remains the obsequies due to a monarch. By this step she avoided any public affront to the dead king, which, owing to the embitterment of the people, would certainly have found expression at the interment. This might have been attended with dangerous results for the Hasmonean dynasty.  Regent  Salome Alexandra received the reins of government (76 or 75 BCE) at Jannaeus' camp before Ragaba, and concealed the king's death until the fortress had fallen, in order that the rigour of the siege might be maintained. She succeeded for a time in quietening the vexatious internal dissensions of the kingdom that existed at the time of Alexander's death; and she did this peacefully and without detriment to the political relations of the Jewish state to the outside world. Alexandra managed to secure assent to a Hasmonean monarchy from the Pharisees, who had suffered under Alexander. Re-establishment of the Sanhedrin The Pharisees now became not only a tolerated section of the community, but actually the ruling class. Salome Alexandra installed as high priest her eldest son, Hyrcanus II, a man who was wholly supportive of the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin was reorganized according to their wishes and became a supreme court for the administration of justice and religious matters, the guidance of which was placed in the hands of the Pharisees. Internal and external policy Hasmonean Kingdom under Salome Alexandra The Sadducees were moved to petition the queen for protection against the ruling party. Salome Alexandra, who desired to avoid all party conflict, removed the Sadducees from Jerusalem, assigning certain fortified towns for their residence. Salome Alexandra increased the size of the army and carefully provisioned the numerous fortified places so that neighbouring monarchs were duly impressed by the number of protected towns and castles which bordered the Judean frontier. As well, she did not abstain from actual warfare; she sent her son Aristobulus with an army to besiege Damascus, then beleaguered by Ptolemy Menneus. The expedition reportedly achieved little. The last days of Salome Alexandra's reign were tumultuous. Her son, Aristobulus, endeavoured to seize the government, and succeeded her after her death. Prosperity Rabbinical sources refer in glowing terms to the prosperity which Judea enjoyed under Salome Alexandra. The Haggadah (Ta'anit, 23a; Sifra, ·∏§u·∏≤·∏≤at, i. 110) relates that during her rule, as a reward for her piety, rain fell only on Sabbath (Friday) nights; so that the working class suffered no loss of pay through the rain falling during their work-time. The fertility of the soil was so great that the grains of wheat grew as large as kidney beans; oats as large as olives; and lentils as large as gold denarii. The sages collected specimens of these grains and preserved them to show future generations the rewards of obedience to the Law, and what piety could achieve. Name \\"Shlomtzion\\" (), derived from the queen's name, is sometimes used as a female first name in contemporary Israel. Among others, the well-known Israeli writer Amos Kenan bestowed that name on his daughter. In the 1977 Knesset elections Ariel Sharon accepted the advice of Kenan to give the name \\"Shlomtzion\\" to a new political party which Sharon was forming at the time (it later merged with the Likud). In medieval sources According to some versions of the Toledoth Yeshu, a medieval alternative-Christian life of Jesus, Salome is connected with Jesus of Nazareth, placing the death of Jesus 150 years earlier.Goldstein, Jesus in the Jewish Tradition, pp. 148‚Äì154 See also *Hasmonean coinage References Sources *Josephus, Antiquities xiii. 11, ¬ß 12; 15, ¬ß 16; *idem, B.

It is a racially diverse area, with sizable Afro-Caribbean and Irish communities, but suffers the social problems typical of similar areas across the country. From 1859 to 1957 Burmantofts was the home of Burmantofts Pottery, a manufacturer of ceramic pipes and construction materials. In the early 20th century, Burmantofts was a large centre of the textile industry. A Burtons textile factory was located in the area; it is still owned by Burtons, but today is being used as a storage facility. Etymology The name Burmantofts is first attested, as le Burmantoftes, in 1427. It seems to have been coined in the Middle English period, from the words burghman ('burgher, town-dweller, burgess', from burgh 'town' and man 'person') and toft ('plot of land'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 31. The name refers to the half-acre parcels of land (or tofts) given to owners of building plots (or burgages) by the River Aire, thus Burgage Men's Tofts. www.leeds.gov.uk Discovering Leeds ‚Äì Industrial Leeds History The burghers from whom Burmantofts takes its name pursued craft businesses in the town, and grew crops on their tofts, such as grain which would be processed at the nearby mill on what is now Miles Hill.Thoresby Society A Brief History of Leeds. It was on the edge of the Yorkshire coalfield and coal mines and clay extraction led to works making bricks and earthenware. Notably in 1842 Lassey and Wilcock acquired 100 acres north of Nippet Lane, and found they were able to extract both coal and clay from the same mine and became coal sellers and brickmakers. In 1870 this became Wilcock and Co also selling drainage pipes, though this only occupied 4 acres, the rest being farmland. Further development of the site and of newer products led to Burmantofts Pottery, which was made there until 1957.Bradford Art Galleries & Museums and Leeds City Museum (1984) Burmantofts Pottery In 1878, Burmantofts was the site of Leeds' first municipal waste incinerator, making use of a former industrial chimney.Scientific American Supplement. Vol. XIV, No. 362 (1882) via Gutenberg The Burtons factory in Burmantofts is now used only as a warehouse The area was also home to some textile industry and in 1921, Montague Burton began to develop a site on Hudson Road which eventually became the biggest clothing factory in the world.on:yorkshire magazine Burton Menswear ‚Äì A Leeds History After the Second World War Burmantofts was in a very poor condition, however redevelopment did not occur for sometime. While the area was dilapidated and buildings such as the Pineapple Hotel (no 77 Accommodation Road) stood derelict for many years throughout the 1930s and 1940s, no real redevelopment started until the mid-1950s, most of this however was just demolition and in this time only a handful of houses were built around Torre Road and Lupton Avenue. In 1960 the site of Burmantofts Pottery was acquired by the Leeds Corporation and used for housing and the Shakespeare school.BBC Leeds Local History Glazed Over =St Agnes' parish church= St Agnes' interior, showing organ, altar with reredos in Burmantofts faience and stained glass East window The only historic building in the area is St Agnes' United Church, the Church of England parish church on Stoney Rock Lane. It is a Gothic Revival building with stone walls and slate roof, designed by Leeds architects John Kelly and Edward Birchall. The foundation stone was laid on 9 July 1887 and the completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Ripon on 20 May 1889.St Agnes' United Church Undated leaflet available from the church It was made the parish church in the 1930s when the church of St Stephen (built 1851) was demolished. The west window stained glass in St Agnes' was originally in St Stephen's. The church has a reredos of Burmantofts faience and is a Grade II listed building. =Housing= There was relatively little housing in Burmantofts until the 20th century: just a few low-rent houses built amongst the mills. Most of the workers in Burmantofts would have lived in nearby areas such as Harehills, however redevelopment through the 1950s and 1960s brought high density living to Burmantofts and it is this redevelopment that has shaped modern Burmantofts. By the 1960s, neighbouring Lincoln Green was seeing many new high rise council flats being erected, however it did not take long for Burmantofts to catch up and by the mid-1960s most of the blocks that stand today had been completed. Burmantofts as it is known today was completed around the early 1970s, since then changes in the area have been few and far between. Looking over Burmantofts from the West. Burmantofts has changed very little in the last forty years, the only area of change is a St James' Hospital, which separated Harehills and Burmantofts. St Bridgets Roman Catholic Secondary Modern School on Torre Road closed down in the 1980s and is now St. Patrick's Primary School, while the transport depot opposite is now the site of Benfield Ford. In September 2006, the area's main secondary school, Primrose High School moved into new premises. With regards to housing, Leeds City Council has not proposed any regeneration in the area, and in recent years is focusing on areas of early-20th century back-to-back housing such as Beeston and Holbeck. There has however been refurbishment of a number of blocks. The Shakespeare Flats separate Burmantofts with neighbouring Harehills At present the majority of the housing in Burmantofts is mid-20th century council-owned housing, mostly made up by multi-story blocks of flats of various heights. A small number of 19th century houses remain close to the Burtons warehouse. Population Ebor Gardens estate Burmantofts has a sizeable Afro Caribbean community. The age range of Burmantofts residents is quite varied, with probably the two largest age groups being young adults and the elderly. Burmantofts has a high unemployment rate, which is one of the contributing factors to its low house prices. Politics Burmantofts falls into the Burmantofts & Richmond Hill ward of Leeds City Council, currently represented by three Labour ward councillors. The ward sits within the Leeds Central parliamentary constituency, for whom Hilary Benn has been the Member of Parliament since the 1999 Leeds Central by-election. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 24,843. Transport Burmantofts is situated adjacent to the A64 road. It has regular bus routes to the city centre and to other parts of the city, in particular East Leeds. The proposed Leeds Supertram Eastern line was supposed to run in-between Burmantofts and Harehills, however the future of this scheme is uncertain. Other projects have been considered using this route including the Leeds Trolleybus. There is no railway station in Burmantofts, the nearest being Leeds and Cross Gates. Facilities Sportsman Pub, Stoney Rock Lane Burmantofts has fairly limited facilities. Neighbouring Lincoln Green has a small shopping precinct with a Freshways, Costcutter, Cash Converters and other shops, this is walking distance for most of Burmantofts. Burmantofts itself has Ebor Garden's Primary and St Peter's Primary, the Anglers Club on Nippet Lane, The Sportsman' public house on Stoney Rock Lane and The New Torre on Torre Road. A Heron Foods store opened in 2017 on Lincoln Green Road. Burmantofts is in most parts less than a mile from the Eastern fringes of Leeds city centre providing it with many other amenities close by. Burmantofts amateur boxing club are based in parts of the former Burtons factory, on the corner of Hudson Road and Stoney Rock Lane. Education Burmantofts only has one secondary school, this being The Co-operative Academy of Leeds. Shakespeare Primary School is on the same site.

She was an ing√©nue, the typical girl next door, and a foil as well as a friend to glamorous Hollywood star Ginger Grant, played by Tina Louise. In addition, her practical domestic skills and plain, good, common sense make her an indispensable member of the group. She is from Winfield, Kansas, a farm girl, and a reference to Dorothy Gale as played by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic movie The Wizard of Oz (occasionally wearing Dorothy's ubiquitous pigtails and a gingham dress). She was travelling alone on the \\"three-hour tour\\", which she had won in a contest, that was lost at sea, and was in her late teens to early twenties, an age which she pinpoints in season 2, episode 30 \\"V for Vitamins,\\" when she says, \\"Women and children first, so I get two votes.\\" She tells the others in season 2, episode 18, \\"The Postman Cometh\\", that she has a boyfriend named Horace Higgenbotham from Horner's Corners, Kansas, so they would think she has someone special waiting for her, but confesses later that he is \\"a real creep\\" and not her boyfriend at all. In Rescue from Gilligan's Island, she is revealed to be in fact engaged and that her fianc√© had waited 15 years for her, but when she was finally rescued, they no longer loved each other, and he married her best friend instead. Mary Ann mentions her mother and father in passing and only very briefly, such as when she tells about her father going bankrupt, before the shipwreck, due to a dishonest business partner, but references her Aunt Martha and Uncle George multiple times, leading some to believe that she lived with them and that her parents may be deceased, another connection to The Wizard of Oz.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Italy for four homicides (two policemen, a jeweler and a butcher). He fled Italy first to France and then to Mexico before settling in Brazil where he lived as a free man until an order of extradition issued in December 2018. He then fled to Santa Cruz in Bolivia, where he was arrested in 2019 by an Italian team of Interpol and extradited to Italy where is currently under arrest. He is also a fiction author, having written 15 novels. Battisti was sentenced to 12 years for being a member of an armed group and for the material killing of two people and instigating another two homicides. He fled to France in 1981, where he received protection under the Mitterrand doctrine. Later, he was tried in absentia based on testimony in Pietro Mutti's trial implicating him in four murders, bringing the total number of charges against him to 36. He was sentenced to life in prison in 1995. After the de facto repeal of the Mitterrand doctrine in 2002, Battisti fled to Brazil under a false identity to avoid a possible extradition. He was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on March 18, 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers.

On 31 December 2010, on Lula's last effective day as president, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced.

Youth and PAC membership  Cesare Battisti was born in 1954 at Cisterna di Latina, near Latina. He left the classical lyceum he was attending in 1971, engaged in petty crime, and then moved on to more serious offenses.L'appello: \\"Battisti in Italia e in galera\\" Il Tempo In 1976, he moved to Milan, and took part in activities of the PAC, an autonomist Marxist group which conducted armed struggle, and which had a \\"horizontal\\", decentralized structure, opposed to the centralist organization of the Red Brigades (BR). The organization, which counted approximately 60 members, had its roots in Barona, a district in the south of Milan. Four assassinations were committed by the PAC: Antonio Santoro, a prison guard accused by the PAC of mistreatment of prisoners (on June 6, 1978 in Udine); jeweler Pierluigi Torregiani, who had shot and killed a robber in an act of self-defense (on February 16, 1979 in Milan); Lino Sabbadin, a butcher and member of the neo- fascist Italian Social Movement (on the same date, near Mestre); and DIGOS agent Andrea Campagna, who had participated in the first arrests in the Torregiani case (on April 19, 1979 in Milan). The PAC also engaged in several robberies. The murder of Torregiani and Sabbadin had been decided by the PAC because both of them had killed militants in the past.¬´La culpabilit√© de Battisti repose sur des preuves¬ª, interview with public prosecutor Armando Spataro, in L'Express, 15 March 2004 Torregiani was killed as revenge in front of his 13-year-old son, who was also shot by his father as a result of a tragic error.Valerio Evangelisti, Valerio Evangelisti r√©pond √† 50 questions The son was left paralysed, and the paraplegic Torregiani considers now that, in any case, Battisti is responsible for the shooting, and should serve his sentence in jail: \\"It's not about the person of Cesare Battisti,\\" he declared to the national press agency ANSA, \\"It's in order that everyone understands that, sooner or later, those who have committed such serious crimes should pay for their faults.\\" Torregiani: A Cesare Battisti chiederei solo perche , 18/03/2007  First trial and escape  Cesare Battisti was arrested and jailed in Italy on February 26, 1979, sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison for participation in an \\"armed group\\" (\\"partecipazione a banda armata\\"). He was sentenced on the ground of material evidenceBattisti persiste et signe, Guillame Perrault and testimony provided by two \\"collaboratori di giustizia\\" (defendants who testified against their former accomplice) who benefitted from lighter sentences for their testimony.Cesare Battisti: dire la v√©rit√©, respecter les droits , Human Rights League (LDH), public statement of March 17, 2007 The status of \\"collaboratore di giustizia\\", also popularly known as pentito, was established by anti-terrorist legislation enacted during this period. PAC members organised his escape on October 4, 1981, while he was in Frosinone prison. Battisti fled to Paris and then Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca, Mexico, very shortly afterward. While in Mexico, he founded a literary review, Via Libre, which is still active. He also participated in the creation of the Book Festival of Managua, Nicaragua, and organised the first Graphic Arts Biennal in Mexico. Battisti began to write at the suggestion of Paco Ignacio Taibo II and collaborated with various newspapers.  Second trial  Pietro Mutti, one of the leaders of the PAC who had been sentenced in absentia for the assassination of the prison guard Santoro, was arrested in 1982. He sought the status of collaboratore di giustizia and his testimony, which helped him reduce his sentence, implicated Battisti and an accomplice in the four assassinations claimed by the PAC. Battisti's trial was thus reopened in 1987, and he was sentenced in absentia in 1988 for two assassinations (Santoro and DIGOS agent Campagna) and complicity in murder in the two others (jeweler Torregiani and butcher Sabbadin). The court sentenced him in 1995, on appeal, to a life-sentence. Two years earlier, the Court of Cassation had quashed, on procedural grounds, the case against Battisti's accomplice, accused by Pietro Mutti. Two of the assassinations occurred on February 16, 1979, one at Milan at 15h, and the other in Mestre, 270 km away from Milan, at 16h50. Battisti was sentenced for materially committing the first assassination, and for planning the second one.  Return to France  Ten years earlier, in 1985, the Socialist President of France Fran√ßois Mitterrand had indicated that \\"leftist Italian activists who were not indicted for violent crimes and had given up terrorist activity would not be extradited to Italy\\"; this became known as the \\"Mitterrand doctrine\\". Many Italian political activists had fled to France during the 1970s-1980s. Trusting in this declaration, Battisti returned to France in 1990, where he was arrested at Italy's request in 1991, when his sentence was confirmed in the Court of Cassation. He thus passed five months in Fresnes prison and then was freed after the extradition request was rejected by the Paris Appeal Court on May 29, 1991. French justice concluded that the anti-terrorist legislation enacted in Italy \\"went against the French principles of law,\\" which, along with the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), prohibited in particular extradition of a person sentenced in absentia if that person had not been in a condition to adequately defend himself during his trial. The court also declared the evidence against Battisti as \\"contradictory\\" and \\"worthy of a military justice.\\"Vantaggiato, Iaia (2009) Cesare Battisti, no all'estradizione quotation: \\"Nell'aprile '91 la Chambre d'Accusation lo dichiar√≤ non estradabile in base alla dottrina Mitterrand che garantiva protezione ai latitanti per motivi politici. La magistratura francese boll√≤ le prove a suo carico come \\"contraddittorie\\" e \\"degne di una giustizia militare\\".\\" Original French quotation: \\"dignes d'une justice militaire\\" After his release in 1991, Battisti lived in Paris, where he wrote his first novel, Les Habits d'ombre (\\"The shadow clothes\\"). Two thrillers, L'Ombre rouge (\\"The red shadow\\") and Buena onda (\\"Good wave\\"), took as their setting and backdrop the Parisian world of Italian fugitives from justice. Another major novel, titled Derni√®res cartouches (\\"Last bullets\\"), takes place in Italy during the \\"years of lead\\". In 1997, jointly with other left-wing Italians who had fled to France and were accused of taking part in violent crimes, he asked without success the President of Italy at the time, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (DC), for amnesty.  Diplomatic dispute between France and Italy  Over the years, Italy asked France several times to arrest and extradite left-wing Italians involved in court cases connected with political violence in Italy who had fled to France. On September 11, 2002, the extradition of Battisti and others was again requested during a meeting in Paris between Italy's Minister of Justice Roberto Castelli and France's Minister of Justice Dominique Perben. Arrest in France On February 10, 2004, the French government arrested Battisti at Italy's request and planned to extradite him to Italy. On June 30, 2004, the Paris Court of Appeal approved his extradition. An appeal to the Court of Cassation was filed against this opinion and another to the Conseil d'√âtat against the extradition decree. President Jacques Chirac stated on July 2, 2004, that he would not oppose the French justice system's decision to extradite him. Perben confirmed Paris' new position: \\"There is no ambiguity. There has been a change of attitude from France, and I support it,\\" (in reference to the \\"Mitterrand doctrine\\"), among other reasons \\"because of the European construction\\".Richard Malli√©, deputy of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, Question au gouvernement: Extradition de Cesare Battisti, 26/10/2004 Clarisse Vernhes, ¬´ Paris pr√™te √† extrader d‚Äôautres ¬´brigadistes¬ª, in RFI, 2002 As of 2007, only Paolo Persichetti, former member of the Unit√† Comuniste Combattenti, among the 200 Italians involved in Court cases dealing with political violence requested by Italy, had been extradited (in August 2002). He was eventually sentenced to 22 years of prison. Minister Edouard Balladur signed Persichetti's extradition decree in 1994; it was validated by the Conseil d'Etat the following year. According to RFI radio station, the Perben-Castelli agreement was divided in three parts: all events before 1982 would be prescribed \\"except in case of exceptional gravity\\"; facts between 1982 and 1993 would be \\"examined on a case by case basis\\", in function of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) principle and of the \\"conditions in which the trials took place in Italy\\". Still claiming innocence, Cesare Battisti failed to check in at the local police station while on parole, and went underground on August 21, 2004. On March 18, 2005, the French Conseil d'Etat (the French Supreme Court in administrative law), ruling ultimately for Battisti's extradition, affirmed clearly that the Italian legislation did not conflict with the French principles of law. The Conseil established that: ECtHR, then, confirmed those decisions and ruled that the Italian trial in absentia in Battisti's case was fair under its provisions. In July 2005, the Italian press revealed the existence of the Department of Anti-terrorism Strategic Studies (DSSA), a \\"parallel police\\" created by Gaetano Saya, leader of Destra Nazionale neofascist party, and Riccardo Sindoca, two leaders of the National Union of the Police Forces (Unpf). Both claimed they were former members of Gladio, NATO's \\"stay-behind\\" paramilitary organization involved in Italy's strategy of tension and various alleged activist acts. According to Il Messaggero, quoted by The Independent, judicial sources declared that wiretaps suggested DSSA members had been planning to kidnap Cesare Battisti. (URL accessed on January 22, 2007) On 5 February 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it expressed its trust \\"that the re-examination of the decision on the extradition of Cesare Battisti will take into account the judgment delivered by an EU Member State in full compliance with the principle of the rule of law in the European Union\\". The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), in its December 2006 decision, rejected Battisti's claim that France's extradition decision was illegitimate. The Court considered that: > The applicant had patently been informed of the accusation against him and > of the progress of the proceedings before the Italian courts, > notwithstanding the fact that he had absconded.

After Brazil granted him refugee status through a decision of its Minister of Justice Tarso Genro. Battisti's request for asylum was first denied by the National Committee for Refugees, in a decision taken by simple majority. His defense appealed to the Minister of Justice, who granted in January 2009 refugee status, a decision which divided Brazilian public opinion.http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/brasil/ult96u490815.shtml Refugee status, however, halts the request for extradition, which is being considered by the Brazilian Supreme Court. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano wrote to Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, informing him of the \\"emotion and understandable reactions\\" raised in his country, in public opinion and among political forces by this \\"grave decision\\". Italian Justice Minister, Angelino Alfano, has asked Brazilian authorities to reconsider this decision \\"in the light of international cooperation against terrorism\\".Gazeta do Povo, 17/01/2009. Presidente da It√°lia manda \\"carta de pesar\\" a Lula pelo asilo a Battisti Lula answered Napolitano, mentioning that Genro's decision is founded on the Brazilian constitution and on the UN 1951 Convention on Refugee Status and is an act of sovereignty of Brazil.Folha de S.Paulo. 23/01/2009. Leia √≠ntegra da carta do presidente Lula enviada ao governo da It√°lia. Criticism was also based on speculations about the influence exerted by Carla Bruni, spouse of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, on Genro's decision. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Suplicy attested to Corriere della Sera that Bruni herself asked Lula to refuge Battisti. Bruni denied this claim on a RAI interview as she expressed her condolences with the families of Battisti's victims.Folha de S.Paulo. 25/01/2009. Carla Bruni nega participa√ß√£o em decis√£o brasileira de refugiar Battisti. Controversy surrounded Genro's decision to grant refugee status to Battisti. Many law specialists have said that the decision was illegal. The Brazilian Supreme Court began trying the case in September 2009. By 5 to 4 (simple majority), the court ruled Genro's decision null and void on 18 November. However, the court also decided by 5 to 4 that the Brazilian constitution gives the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chose, effectively putting the decision in the hands of Brazilian President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. On 29 December 2010, unofficial reports in Italy and Brazil said President Lula was about to announce he was denying extradition of Battisti, just three days short before the end of his presidential term. The official announcement did take place on December 31, hours before the end of Lula's time in office.\\"Lula sparks diplomatic spat with Italy over refusal to extradite killer\\" The Guardian, Friday 31 December 2010 18.54 GMT On 8 June 2011, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that Lula's decision is final. Italian authorities announced their intention to appeal to the International Court of Justice saying Brazil breached an extradition treaty. In November 2013, the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina invited Battisti to speak at a conference. Cesare Battisti lived in the town of Embu das Artes, in the S√£o Paulo metropolitan area, and worked as a realtor. In March 2015, a federal judge ruled null and void a decision to grant him a permanent visa as this would conflict with Brazilian law, and ordered his deportation. The judge stressed that the deportation should not be confused with extradition, as it does not require that Battisti be surrendered to Italy, but rather to the country from which he entered Brazil, or any other country that will agree to receive him. On 14 September 2015, the Regional Federal Court of S√£o Paulo declared the expulsion illegal and canceled the order of deportation. In June 2015 Battisti married Joice Lima, a Brazilian citizen. Extradition to Italy On 12 January 2019, Battisti was arrested by an Italian team of Interpol in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Bolivia, and returned to Italy to start serving his sentence. On 25 March 2019, Battisti acknowledged his responsibilities in the crimes attributed to him, pleading guilty. Public opinion Until 25 March 2019, Cesare Battisti denied having committed any of the murders he had been sentenced for; on that date he admitted to the chief prosecutor of Milan (Francesco Greco) involvement in four killings. The circumstances of his sentence have been questioned. A movement claiming Battisti's innocence is active in the media and in public opinion (especially in France and Italy). Among the most vocal supporters of Battisti are the writers Fred Vargas, Valerio Evangelisti and Bernard-Henri L√©vy. They consider that the trials conducted in Italy were marked by irregularities. These alleged irregularities involved the use of torture (Battisti's French lawyers have not used this peculiar charge, the violation of article 3 ECHR, in their rejected claim to ECtHR), and the misuse of witnesses: according to Battisti's supporters, witnesses against Battisti were either affected by mental troubles, or were \\"collaboratori di giustizia\\", (that is, defendants testifying against other defendants in order to benefit from a reduced sentence. Those peculiar witnesses are also used by French justice, i.e. art. 132-78 French Code p√©nal). Battisti's supporters also claim that ballistic analysis and graphological expertises used in Italian court cases do in fact exonerate Battisti, contrary to what the courts considered.Fred Vargas, ¬´ Cesare Battisti: A la recherche de la justice perdue ¬ª in La R√®gle du Jeu, n¬∞30 (January 2006) Cesare Battisti, Ma Cavale, 27/4/2006, Preface p. 13 Most of public opinion in Italy disagrees with those views, and Battisti's arrest in Brazil has been commented upon favourably in the media. Rifondazione Comunista, however, claims that he should not be extradited, as he would not be granted the right to a new trial. In France, supporters of Battisti, such as Gilles Perrault, have called the 2007 arrest, a few weeks before the April 2007 presidential election, an \\"electoral feat,\\" closely timed by the then Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, candidate for the UMP conservative party. Fran√ßois Bayrou, candidate for the UDF right-of-center party, has called for a new trial, as have members of the left-wing. Defenders of Battisti, among whom the Human Rights League (LDH), consider that France's decision to extradite Battisti was illegal, since Battisti would not have the right to a new trial after having been judged in absentia. The right to a new trial is not a sufficient guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled by the ECHR in the case of Krombach v. France, application no. 29731/96; and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that there is not an absolute right to a new trial after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him, and therefore his rights had been violated. The Union syndicale des magistrats (USM, the largest trade union of French judges) has supported the fairness of the Italian trial in absentia and has also confirmed the legality of Battisti‚Äôs condemnation:Communiqu√© USM Affaire Battisti in References  Bibliography  * Travestito da uomo (French title: Les habits d'ombre) * Nouvel an, nouvelle vie (1994) * L'ombre rouge (Italian title: L'orma rossa; 1995) * Buena onda (1996) * Copier coller (1997) * J'aurai ta Pau (1997) * L'ultimo sparo (French title: Derni√®res cartouches; 1998) * Naples (1999, short story anthology with works also by Jean-Jacques Busino, Carlo Lucarelli, Jean-Bernard Pouy and Tito Topin) * Jamais plus sans fusil (2000) * Terres br√ªl√©es (2000, editor) * Avenida Revoluci√≥n (2001) * Le Cargo sentimental (2003) * Vittoria (2003) * L'eau du diamant (2006) * Ma cavale (2006)  External links  * Audio interview of Battisti, by Isabelle Sommier, February 11, 2004, France Inter on Daniel Mermet's show * The website of the \\"Associazione Italiana Vittime del Terrorismo e dell'Eversione Contro l'Ordinamento Costituzionale dello Stato\\" (Association of terror victims) * Battisti in Brazil * Page on Battisti's case (Ext 1085) on the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil website Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Italian criminals Category:People from the Province of Latina Category:Italian expatriates in Brazil Category:Urban guerrilla warfare Category:Fugitives wanted on terrorism charges Category:Italian communists Category:Anti-revisionists Category:Italian assassins Category:Terrorism in Italy Category:20th-century Italian novelists Category:20th-century male writers Category:21st-century Italian novelists Category:France‚ÄìItaly relations Category:Brazil‚ÄìItaly relations Category:People convicted in absentia Category:Italian people convicted of murder Category:Italian people imprisoned abroad Category:Prisoners and detainees of Brazil Category:Italian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Italy Category:Communist terrorism Category:People extradited from Brazil Category:Italian exiles ","title":"Cesare Battisti (born 1954)"},{"id":"926111","text":"Mason Science College was a university college in Birmingham, England, and a predecessor college of Birmingham University. Founded in 1875 by industrialist and philanthropist Sir Josiah Mason, the college was incorporated into the University of Birmingham in 1900. Two students of the college, Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, later went on to become Prime Ministers of the UK. History Sir Josiah Mason, the founder of Mason Science College. Bust by William Bloye, after Francis John Williamson. The college was established by an English industrialist and philanthropist Sir Josiah Mason in 1875.Eric Ives et al, The First Civic University: Birmingham 1880-1980 An Introductory History (Birmingham, 2000), p. 12 The building of the college in Edmund Street, Birmingham was designed by Jethro Cossins and opened on 1 October 1880 and was marked by a speech by Thomas Henry Huxley. In the speech, Huxley considered the opening of the college as a victory for scientific cause and supported Mason's antagonistic views on the classics and theology. The college developed various liberal and vocational subjects, but forced out the artisans. The medical and scientific departments of Queen's College, Birmingham moved to the nearby Mason Science College. In 1898 it became Mason University College, with Joseph Chamberlain becoming the President of Court of Governors of the college. In 1900 it was incorporated into the University of Birmingham. Students at the College were awarded their degrees by the University of London until the University of Birmingham was established and received degree awarding powers in its own right. William A. Tilden was professor of chemistry from 1880 to 1894. In September 1893 Francis William Aston began his university studies at the college, where he was taught physics by John Henry Poynting and chemistry by Frankland and Tilden. In 1881 Charles Lapworth became the first professor of geology at the college. In 1891 physics professor John Henry Poynting successfully calculated the mean density of the Earth. The Mason College building housed Birmingham University's Faculties of Arts and Law for over half a century after the founding of the University in 1900. The Faculty of Arts building on the Edgbaston campus was not constructed until 1959-61. The Faculties of Arts and Law then moved to the Edgbaston Campus. After the Second World War the style of architecture was not as appreciated as it is now. Paul Cadbury referred to it in 1952 as a neo-gothic monstrosity and expected it to be demolished within 50 years. In the event it was demolished in 1964, along with the original Central Public Library and the Birmingham and Midland Institute, as part of the redevelopment within the inner ring road. The former Central Library stood on the site of the old college, the library having moved to a new site in 2013; the building was demolished in 2016. Departments During the first academic session of the college in 1880 courses in physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics were offered to students. By 1881 courses in geology and mineralogy, botany and vegetable physiology, engineering, English language and literature, Greek and Latin, and French and German language and literature were also available. From 1882 Medical students at Queen's College, Birmingham were able to attend classes in botany, physiology and chemistry, and in 1892 the medical faculty of Queen's College was transferred to Mason College. There was also a short- lived department of ‚ÄòMental and Moral Science‚Äô, which was not successful despite funds being gifted specifically to support the endeavor in 1882.Eric Ives, Diane Drummond and L.D.

Mio padre, il ladro della Gioconda Theft In 1911, Peruggia perpetrated what has been described as the greatest art theft of the 20th century. It was a police theory that the former Louvre worker hid inside the museum on Sunday, 20 August, knowing the museum would be closed the following day. But, according to Peruggia's interrogation in Florence after his arrest,Extrait du Proces-Verbal de la confrontation de M. Vingoolle avec Peruggia, 20 Dec.. 1913, Archives Nationales, Paris he entered the museum on Monday, 21 August around 7 am, through the door where the other Louvre workers were entering. He said he wore one of the white smocks that museum employees customarily wore and was indistinguishable from the other workers. When the Salon Carr√©, where the Mona Lisa hung, was empty, he lifted the painting off the four iron pegs that secured it to the wall and took it to a nearby service staircase. There, he removed the protective case and frame. Some people report that he concealed the painting (which Leonardo painted on wood) under his smock. But Peruggia was only tall,Peruggia mugshot, 25 January 1909, Archives Nationales, Paris and the Mona Lisa measures approx. , so it would not fit under a smock worn by someone his size. Instead, he said he took off his smock and wrapped it around the painting, tucked it under his arm, and left the Louvre through the same door he had entered.Mona Lisa Is Missing, 2013, Virgil Films, dir. Joe Medeiros Peruggia hid the painting in his apartment in Paris. After keeping the painting hidden in a trunk in his apartment for two years, Peruggia returned to Italy with it. He kept it in his apartment in Florence, Italy for some time. However, Peruggia eventually grew impatient, and was finally caught when he contacted Alfredo Geri, the owner of an art gallery in Florence. Geri's story conflicts with Peruggia's, but it was clear that Peruggia expected a reward for returning the painting to what he regarded as its \\"homeland\\". Geri called in Giovanni Poggi, director of the Uffizi Gallery, who authenticated the painting. Poggi and Geri, after taking the painting for \\"safekeeping\\", informed the police, who arrested Peruggia at his hotel. After its recovery, the painting was exhibited all over Italy with banner headlines rejoicing its return. The Mona Lisa was then returned to the Louvre in 1913. While the painting was famous before the theft, the notoriety it received from the newspaper headlines and the large scale police investigation helped the artwork become one of the best known in the world. =Motivations= There are currently two predominant theories regarding the theft of the Mona Lisa. ;Patriotism Peruggia said he did it for a patriotic reason: he wanted to bring the painting back for display in Italy \\"after it was stolen by Napoleon\\". Although perhaps sincere in his motive, Vincenzo may not have known that Leonardo da Vinci took this painting as a gift for Francis I when he moved to France to become a painter in his court during the 16th century, 250 years before Napoleon's birth. Experts have questioned the 'patriotism' motive on the grounds that‚Äîif 'patriotism' was the true motive‚ÄîPeruggia would have donated the painting to an Italian museum, rather than have attempted to profit from its sale. The question of money is also confirmed by letters that Peruggia sent to his father after the theft. On 22 December 1911, four months after the theft, he wrote that Paris was where \\"I will make my fortune and that his (fortune) will arrive in one shot.\\" Peruggia Letter 22 December 1911, Archivio di Stato, Florence The following year (1912), he wrote: \\"I am making a vow for you to live long and enjoy the prize that your son is about to realize for you and for all our family.\\" Put on trial, the court agreed, to some extent, that Peruggia committed his crime for patriotic reasons and gave him a lenient sentence. He was sent to jail for one year and 15 days, but was hailed as a great patriot in Italy and served only seven months in jail. ;Criminal conspiracy Another theory emerged later. The theft may have been encouraged or masterminded by Eduardo de Valfierno, a con-man who had commissioned the French art forger Yves Chaudron to make copies of the painting so he could sell them as the missing original. The copies would have gone up in value if the original were stolen. This theory is based entirely on a 1932 article by former Hearst journalist Karl Decker in The Saturday Evening Post. Decker claimed to have known Valfierno and heard the story from him in 1913, promising not to print it until he learned of Valfierno's death. There is no external confirmation for this tale. Later life and personal life Peruggia was released from jail after a short time and served in the Italian army during World War I. He later married, had one daughter, Celestina, returned to France, and continued to work as a painter decorator using his birth name Pietro Peruggia. Death He died on 8 October 1925 (his 44th birthday) in the town of Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s, France. His death was not widely reported by the media; obituaries appeared mistakenly only when another Vincenzo Peruggia died in Haute-Savoie in 1947.Who stole the Mona Lisa?, FT.com, August 2011 Portrayals *In Der Raub der Mona Lisa (1931), an early German soundfilm, he was portrayed by Willi Forst. *In The Man Who Stole La Gioconda (2006), a television-miniseries he was portrayed by Alessandro Preziosi. * In an April 1956 episode of the TV-show You Are There, called \\"The Recovery of the Mona Lisa (December 10, 1913)\\", Peruggia is played by Vito Scotti, who reprised the role in yet another TV-reconstruction of the famous theft, this time for the TV-show G.E.

Character summary Grant is a \\"movie star\\", and would casually mention names of some of the biggest movie stars of the day, as co-stars or acquaintances, suggesting that she too was a great star. In season 1 episode 1, \\"Two on a Raft\\", Ginger is singing in a club in Waikiki, the same gig mentioned by the radio announcer, after which she was seen boarding the tour boat still wearing the evening gown from her performance. \\"When I first broke into show business, I used to work with a magician\\", Ginger confesses in Season 1 Episode 33 \\"It's Magic\\". In the Gilligan's Island's pilot, actress Kit Smythe portrayed Ginger, who was then a secretary. Ginger was sometimes seen helping the Professor with his experiments, dressed in a lab coat and spectacle frames, and they conspired together in the episode \\"Ship Ahoax\\" to make it appear as though she were fortune-telling. They also shared romantic scenes, although these were usually in the form of a \\"lesson in love\\", such as in the episodes \\"Erica Tiffany- Smith to the Rescue\\" and \\"The Postman Cometh\\". She also appears to have been the object of desire of The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr.) in several episodes. The Skipper chooses Ginger as his preferred contestant in the \\"Miss Castaway Pageant\\" held on the island (Season 2 Episode 2 \\"Beauty Is as Beauty Does\\"). In addition, when Skipper loses his memory in the first season Episode 30 \\"Forget Me Not\\", he is much more attracted to Ginger than Mary Ann, asking Ginger, \\"Hi, beautiful, what's your name?\\" while leering at her with delight. Ginger does not know about the Skipper's memory loss and she answers, with appropriate Hollywood pique, \\"Ginger, big boy, what's yours?\\" Ginger sides with Thurston Howell III on many occasions ‚Äì acting as a witness during a trial over treasure, serving as a sort of spy to divulge information from Gilligan by scratching his back, and allowing herself to be bribed by Howell, such as during the election of who was to be president of the island. Her secret agent code name and her measurements were both 36-25-36. She is also close friends with Mary Ann; the two are around the same age. Ginger Grant, due to many prior film roles in Hollywood, spent her time on the island occasionally taking on the roles of chanteuse, barefoot fortune-teller, lab assistant, hair stylist, and psychoanalyst ‚Äì as well as fronting the hastily formed island musical trio: The Honeybees. She also had to deal with a doppelganger, a plain mousy girl named Eva Grubb (also played by Tina Louise). Unlike the other female castaways, who were seen in more than one set of clothes, Ginger initially appeared only in her evening gown. Later episodes did include changes in apparel for her as well. The character in Gilligan's Island reunion films For the 1978 made-for-TV-movie, Rescue from Gilligan's Island, Tina Louise declined to return, for she believed the role had typecast her forever as a glamour queen; she was replaced by Judith Baldwin. Baldwin also portrayed Ginger in the sequel The Castaways on Gilligan's Island, but didn't return for the third sequel, The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island; therefore, Constance Forslund, stepped in to play the \\"movie star\\". Casting Jayne Mansfield, a late-1950s sex symbol, was offered the role of Ginger after the departure of Kit Smythe, who played Ginger as a secretary in the pilot. When Ginger was converted to a movie star, the producers swapped the actresses, and asked Mansfield, who was Marilyn Monroe-esque, to portray the character. However, she turned it down and was replaced by Tina Louise. Louise, however, disliked the character and for years felt it had stymied her career as a \\"serious\\" actress. Judith Baldwin played her in the first and second reunion film. Constance Forslund played her in the third and final reunion film to date. Kristen Dalton played Ginger in Surviving Gilligan's Island. Tina Louise didn't reprise her role in the animated-spinoffs either: in The New Adventures of Gilligan Jane Webb voiced her, while in Gilligan's Planet she was replaced by her co-star Dawn Wells. Roseanne Barr portrayed the role of Ginger in a parody episode of Roseanne.

The Joint Senate consists of the Presidents of the five Federal Supreme Courts (excluding the Federal Constitutional Court) and two members of each of the Senates involved (\\"Senate\\" here denotes a judicial 'sub-unit' within a court, usually consisting of three or more judges, with all Federal Supreme Courts and subordinate courts of appeal being divided into several senates). The Joint Senate decides on questions regarding the interpretation of law that are relevant for all five branches of law overseen by the five Federal Supreme Courts. The Joint Senate gathers rarely (between 2000 and 2010, there were only three decisions), as the areas of responsibility of the branches of justice in Germany are in general well- defined and so most of its rulings are on definitory matters. Its meetings are organised by the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe. The Joint Senate should not be confused with the Great Senate that exists within each Federal Supreme Court. Its function is similar to that of the Joint Senate, as it mediates between the several Senates of a Supreme Court in cases of dissent. To make things even more confusing, the Federal Court of Justice has not one Great Senate but three: one for civil law issues, one for criminal law issues and one for disputes between the criminal law senates and the civil law senates. Also, the Federal Constitutional Court has a similar body, then called the Plenum, which consists of all the judges of the court and again meets only if a dispute arises between two different Senates that cannot be resolved otherwise.

Rugby union is thought to have reached Wales in the 1850s, with the national body, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) being formed in 1881.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pp41 Wales are considered to be one of the most successful national sides in Rugby Union, having won the most Six Nations Championships, as well as having reached 3 World Cup semi finals in 1987, 2011 and 2019, having finished 3rd in the inaugural competition and having finished 4th in 2011 in a repeat of the first third place play-off. The Welsh team of the 1970s is considered to be arguably the greatest national team of all time, prompting many experts in the game to suggest that had the Rugby World Cup existed during this period, Wales would be amongst the list of World Cup winners. Following their fourth-place finish in the latest World Cup, they are ranked 4th in the world, behind England but ahead of Ireland. The national team play at the WRU-owned Principality Stadium, and compete annually in the Six Nations Championship, as well as having competed at every Rugby World Cup. Wales are ranked as a tier-1 nation by World Rugby (WR). Wales also competes as one of the 15 \\"core teams\\" in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series, and won the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens. The main domestic competition in Wales is the Pro14 (historically the Celtic League), in which Wales have four regional sides in the competition which is also contested by Irish and Scottish clubs and from 2010-11 Italian teams. Top-level Welsh regional teams (Ospreys, Cardiff Blues, Scarlets and Dragons) also compete in the Europe-wide European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup and alongside the teams of England's Premiership in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. Beneath the Pro14, club rugby is represented by over 200 WRU affiliated clubs who play in the Welsh Premier Division and the lower Welsh Divisional leagues. Historically the four major Welsh club teams that have shaped the Welsh national team have been Cardiff, Newport, Swansea and Llanelli, though other clubs which have fought for prominence and provided national sporting heroes during the last 120 years include Bridgend, Neath, Pontypool, Pontypridd, and England exiles London Welsh. Four Welsh teams compete in the British and Irish Cup, a competition for semi-professional and developmental sides from Great Britain and Ireland. They are usually the top Premier Division clubs of each region, although the reserve sides of the Pro12 teams were entered in 2015-16. As of February 2019 the Welsh Rugby Union are reviewing the number of regions, with potential consolidation for funding two or three super teams. History =The growth of rugby in Wales 1850-1900= Rugby-like games have a long history in Wales, with games such as cnapan being played for centuries.Smith (1980), pg18. Rugby seems to have reached Wales in 1850, when the Reverend Professor Rowland Williams brought the game with him from Cambridge to St. David's College, Lampeter,Smith (1980), pg22. which fielded the first Welsh rugby team that same year. Arthur \\"Monkey\\" Gould was the first Welsh superstar of rugby union Rugby initially expanded in Wales through ex-pupils of the Welsh colleges settling, or students from English colleges and universities returning to the larger industrial hubs of South Wales. This is reflected in the first clubs to embrace the sport in the early to mid-1870s, with Neath RFC widely recognised as the first Welsh club. The strength of Welsh rugby developed over the following years, which could be attributed to the 'big four' South Wales clubs of Newport (who lost only seven games under the captaincy of Llewellyn Lloyd between the 1900/01 and 1902/03 seasonsThomas, Wayne 'A Century of Welsh Rugby Players, 1880-1980'; Ansells Ltd. (1979)), Cardiff, Llanelli (who lost just twice in 1894 and 1895) and Swansea. With the coming of industrialisation and the railways, rugby too was spread as workers from the main cities brought the game to the new steel and coal towns of south Wales. Merthyr formed in 1876, Brecon in 1874, Penygraig in 1877; as the towns adopted the new sport they reflected the growth and expansion of a new industrial Wales.Smith (1980), pg11. In the 19th century as well as the established clubs there were many 'scratch' teams populating most towns, informal pub or social teams that would form and disband quickly. Llanelli, as an example, in the 1880s was home not only to Llanelli RFC, but also to Gower Road, Seasiders, Morfa Rangers, Prospect Place Rovers, Wern Foundry, Cooper Mills Rangers, New Dock Strollers, Vauxhall Juniors, Moonlight Rovers and Gilbert Street Rovers.Smith (1980), pg11-12. These teams would come and go, but some would merge into more settled clubs which exist today, Cardiff RFC was itself formed from three teams, Glamorgan, Tredegarville and Wanderers Football Clubs. The South Wales Football Club was established in 1875Smith (1980), pg14. to try to incorporate a standard set of rules and expand the sport and this was succeeded by the Welsh Football Union which was formed in 1881.Smith (1980), pg41. With the forming of the WFU (which would become the Welsh Rugby Union in 1934), Wales began competing in recognised international matches, with the first game, against England, also in 1881.Smith (1980), pg40. The first Welsh team although fairly diverse in the geography of the clubs represented, did not appear to truly represent the strength available to Wales. The team was mainly made up of ex-Cambridge and Oxford university graduates and the selection was heavily criticised in the local press after the crushing defeat by England. By the end of the 19th century, a group of exciting Welsh players began to emerge, including Arthur Gould, Billy Bancroft and Gwyn Nicholls; players that would be regarded as the first super-stars of Welsh rugby and would usher in not only the first golden era of Welsh rugby, but would also see the introduction of specialised positional players. =The first golden era 1900-1919= The first 'Golden Era' of Welsh rugby is so called due to the success achieved by the national team during the early 20th century. Wales had already won the Triple Crown in 1893, but between 1900 and 1914 the team would win the trophy on six occasions, and with France joining the tournament (unofficially in 1908 and 1909) three Grand Slams.Smith (1980), pg481. The Welsh 1905 team that beat the touring Original All Blacks With the introduction of specialised players like hooker George Travers,Thomas (1979), pg40. the WFU could no longer choose the 'best players' to represent Wales, they needed to think tactically and choose people who could do a specific job on the pitch. This period of Welsh rugby would see the grip of the 'Big Four' clubs providing the bulk of national players, slip slightly. The WFU still tended to turn to the likes of Swansea and Newport to supply the skillful back players and usually kept club half- back pairings together such as Jones and Owen of Swansea. But it was the introduction of the 'Rhondda Forward' which saw men who worked day in day out in the coal, iron and tin mines enter the Welsh front row. Chosen for their strength and aggressive tackling, players such as Dai 'Tarw' Jones from Treherbert and Dai Evans from Penygraig added muscle to the front row. World War I recruitment poster Although a progressive time for international rugby, this period initially saw regression for many of the club sides in the form of the temperance movement. In the early 1900s, rugby was seen as a wicked temptation to the young men of the mining and steel communities, leading to violence and drink,Smith (1980), pg120. and the valley areas in particular were part of a strong Nonconformist Baptist movement. The religious revival saw some communities completely reject rugby and local clubs, like Senghenydd, disbanded for several years. It wasn't until the 1910s that the social view of rugby would change the other way, fostered by mine owners as a great social unifier;Smith (1980), pg121. and like baseball in America would be portrayed as a '...source of community integration because it installed civic pride'.Morgan (1988), pg391. Unlike the game in England, rugby union in Wales was never seen as a sport for gentlemen of higher learning. Although this was fostered in the first international Welsh team, the fast absorption of the sport into the working class areas appeared to sever the link of rugby as a sport for the middle and upper classes.Smith (1980), pg195. As rugby became linked with the hard working men of the industrialised areas of Wales, it should also be noted that the sport did not escape the hardships of the industries. In 1913 five members of the Senghenydd team were killed in Britain's worst colliery disaster and many more lost their lives in the 'slow drip' of deaths caused by the industries. Far worse was to follow during the conflict of World War I when many teams lost members, including Welsh internationals like Charlie PritchardThomas (1979), pg43. and Johnnie Williams. =Post-war Welsh rugby 1920-1930= The 1920s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby. The first golden period was over and the players that made up the teams that won four Triple Crowns had already disbanded before the Great War. The war could not be blamed for the downturn in Welsh fortunes as all the home nations lost their young talent in equal numbers. The fact that so many of Wales' talented stars had retired from rugby before 1910 was felt when Wales failed to win the tournament in the few years leading up to the war. But the main reason for Welsh failure on the rugby pitch can be mapped to an economic failures of Wales as a country. The First World War had created an unrealistic demand for coal, and in the 1920s the collapse in the need for coal resulted in a massive level of unemployment throughout the south Wales valleys.Smith (1980), pg224. This in turn led to mass emigration as people left Wales for work. The knock-on effect was felt in the port cities of Newport and Cardiff, that relied on the transportation of coal. Suddenly the call of the professional league was a very strong draw to men who could not claim money for playing union. Between 1919 and 1939, Forty-eight capped Welsh rugby union players joined league rugby.Smith (1980), pg225. The fact that the equivalent of three full national squads left the sport can only allude to the number of trialists and club members that also left the sport. Exceptional players lost to the league game included Jim Sullivan of Cardiff, William Absalom of Abercarn and Emlyn Jenkins of Treorchy. The other side of the depression was linked to those people that stayed behind. In homes where men were the only earners, the decline in heavy labour areas resulted in very stark choices in where the household money could be spent. It was difficult to justify paying to watch rugby when there was little money for food and rent. With crowds dwindling clubs were forced to drastic measures in the hope of survival. Loughor which had produced five internationals in the 1920s were by 1929 begging door to door for old kit.Smith (1980), pg259. Haverfordwest disbanded from 1926‚Äì29, Pembroke Dock Quins were reduced to 5 members by 1927 and in the valleys the Treherbert, Llwynypia and Nantyffyllon clubs had vanished before 1930.Morgan (1988), pg394. Even clubs of the size of Pontypool were not spared; in 1927 they were playing and beating the Waratahs and the Maoris, by 1930 they were ¬£2,000 in debt and facing bankruptcy.Smith (1980), pg260. Another reason for the fall in the Welsh union game can be placed on the improvement of football in Wales.Smith (1980), pg232. Traditionally seen as a game more associated with North Wales, the success of Cardiff Football Club in the 1920s was a strong draw for many supporters. With two F.A. Cup Finals in 1925 and 1927, Cardiff were making the once unpopular sport of 'soccer' very fashionable, for fans and sportsmen alike. During the 1920s the one team that appeared to be unaffected by the double threat of soccer and debt was Llanelli.Smith (1980), pg234. The Scarlets had an unswerving loyalty shown by their home supporters, who were repaid by exciting, high scoring matches. During the 1925/26 season the club were unbeaten and the next season they had achieved the feat of defeating Cardiff on four occasions. This success would later be reflected in the growing number of Llanelli players that would represent their country in the 1920s,Smith (1980), pg236. including Albert Jenkins, Ivor Jones and Archie Skym. Apart from a few sporadic victories from the national team, there appeared little to cheer about in the 1920s for Welsh rugby at club or country level; but the seeds of recovery were being planted during the same decade. On June 9, 1923 the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union was established in Cardiff.Smith (1980), pg240. Founded by Dr R Chalke, head of Porth Secondary School with WRU members Horace Lyne as president and Eric Evans as secretary. Its aim was to promote rugby at school level in an attempt to regain 'the glorious days of Gwyn Nicholls, Willie Llewellyn and Dr E.T. Morgan'. In April 1923, at the Arms Park, Wales played their first secondary schools fixture led by future international Watcyn Thomas, who would progress to captain the first Welsh University XV in 1926.Smith (1980), pg241. Over the coming years, schools such as Cardiff High School, Llanelli County School, Llandovery and Christ College, Brecon fostered a generation of players which would fill the Welsh ranks over the coming years. Wales had in effect begun to mimic the systems adopted by England and Scotland, that rugby should be nurtured from youth, through adolescence to adulthood.Smith (1980), pg243-44. The 1920s closed with the formation of the West Wales Rugby Union, an event that initially appeared to be a positive indication of growth, but in fact the union was formed by western clubs to wrest control away from the WRU. The West Wales clubs had become disenchanted in decisions made by their parent body and believed the Union had no interest in the lower tier clubs, allowing them to become mere feeders for the bigger clubs.Smith (1980), pg261. =The Welsh revival 1930-1939= The 1930s began on a high for Welsh international rugby, with success in the Home Nations Championship and the emergence of a strong Welsh team. In the 1931 Championship Wales beat Ireland at Ravenhill in a bruising affair that not only gave Wales the title but denied Ireland the Triple Crown. This may have signaled a change in fortunes in Welsh rugby but underneath the same problems that dogged Wales throughout the 1920s still remained. Wales was still suffering the effects of the depression and club rugby was struggling to survive.Smith (1980), pg268. Even the WRU had problems, as it faced the fact that it was the only home union without their own ground. The Cardiff Arms was leased and St Helens was on loan.Smith (1984), pg182. From what at first appears to be yet another decade of turmoil for Welsh rugby, is actually regarded as a period of revival. The economic situation began turning from 1937, the WSSRU was bringing many exciting backs through the school system, North Wales embraced the game and the national team won two morale lifting games against England in 1933 and the All Blacks in 1935. From a statistical point of view, the Welsh national team appeared to be winning roughly the same number of games throughout the 1930s as the poor 1920s period, but Wales were actually improving. In the 1920s most Welsh victories were against France, then the weakest team in the Five Nations Championship; but in 1931 France were excluded from the tournament over accusations of professionalism at club level and were not readmitted until after the 1939 tournament, just before international rugby was suspended because of the Second World War. Welsh victories were now coming against the more established home nation teams. During this period, Wales won three Championships, but its greatest victory happened during the 1933 tournament when they finished last. Since its first international game in 1910, Wales had failed to beat England at Twickenham in nine attempts. Now dubbed the 'Twickenham bogey', it took the self confidence of Cardiff's Ronnie Boon to break the losing streak as he scored a try and a drop goal to take the match 7-3. The game also saw the debut of two players who would become Welsh greats, Wilf Wooller and Vivian Jenkins. Wales played host to two touring Southern Hemisphere teams in the 1930s, first came Bennie Osler's South Africa followed by Jack Manchester's All Blacks. The South Africans were rampant in Wales, winning the test match and all six club matches, though gained few supporters due to the kicking tactics Osler employed. The New Zealander's received a better welcome, and after the previous tour where the tourist went unbeaten the Welsh press were hoping for a return of the spirit that won the first encounter in 1905. Before the match with Wales, New Zealand were to face eight club teams over six games. After winning the opening three English county matches and then beating a joint Abertillery and Cross Keys the All Blacks were showing the same form shown in their first two tours, but then stumbled against Swansea. Swansea were not in a period of particular growth and the only two players showing any flair were Wales Schoolboy players Willie Davies and Haydn Tanner. During the game Merv Corner could not contain the attacking bursts from Tanner, the New Zealand flankers were drawn in which in turned allowed Davies the freedom to run which Claude Davey finished off with two tries. Jack Manchester's response to the Swansea win was to ask the New Zealand press \\"Tell them we have been beaten, but don't tell them it was by a pair of schoolboys\\". This win gave Swansea the honour of being the first club team to have beaten all three major Southern Hemisphere touring teams. The All Blacks were unbeaten in the next twenty matches, but lost to Wales in a classic game which Wales managed to win in the last ten minutes of the game after the Welsh hooker, Don Tarr, was stretchered off with a broken neck. =Post-war Welsh rugby 1945-1959= The post-war years saw strong club teams emerge, but it wasn't until the 1950s that a true blend of players could be produced to translate club success into international victories. The coming of television saw an upsurge in popularity for the national team, but a decline in club support. Success was gained in the Five Nations Championship, Wales supplied many players to the ranks of the British Lions and New Zealand was beaten for the last time that century. The decades following on from the Second World War were a boom time for Welsh rugby, though it took until the 1950s for the benefits to be seen on the playing fields. Although Britain was suffering from a post-war slump, attendance figures at club grounds saw an increase as rugby was again embraced as a spectator sport.Smith (1980), pg330. Towns and villages which had seen their club disbanded during wartime saw their teams re-established. The WRU had 104 member clubs during the 1946-47 season; by the mid fifties there were 130, even though the Union had done nothing to relax its strict membership regulations. By the 1950s Britain and Wales were beginning to benefit from improved economic conditions. This saw growth in consumer power and spending, which drew many people away from traditional spectator past times, such as sport and the cinema. With a newfound wealth the populace began switching from social pursuits to home entertainment, with the biggest draw being the availability of television. From the mid-fifties there was a significant drop in gate receipts as television became more and more popular. During the 1955 Five Nations Championship, the Scotland v. Wales match was televised live; at the same time an Aberavon v. Abertillery game which would normally draw a crowd of 4000 was unable to muster 400. This created a situation whereby rugby in Wales was gaining in popularity due to the number of people who could now watch the international matches, but support at club level declined. This forced club committees to adopt different strategies to keep their clubs afloat. Many teams set up 'coupon funds' to allow clothing rations to be contributed by members to buy kit. With careful management and thrift most clubs not only survived but grew. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, with little money, many clubs were able to build new facilities or even own their grounds and club-houses for the first time in their history.Smith (1980), pg331. In 1951 Glamorgan Wanderers purchased the Memorial Grounds in Ely and in 1952 Llanelli were able to purchase the rugby portion of Stradey Park. Similarly, 1954 saw Blaina construct a new stand while Llanharan were able to build their first changing rooms procured from RAF surplus units. These events were typical of club expansion through the 50s. It was around this time that club social activities were extended including the introduction of ladies‚Äô committees. Clubs also took matters into their own hands to promote themselves and their sport. 1947 saw the first unofficial club championship, won by Neath in its inaugural year, but dominated by Cardiff and Ebbw Vale until the 1960/61 season. In 1954 Welsh rugby sevens had their own tournament with the introduction of the Snelling Sevens competition, while Glamorgan County RFC introduced the Silver Ball Trophy in 1956 for the promotion of second tier clubs in the region. The national team, after unconvincing displays during the 1940s, found unexpected success in the early 1950s winning the Grand Slam twice; in 1950 and 1952. The 1950 win came after a disastrous 1949 campaign, which saw Wales collect the wooden spoon; but after an opening win over England, the team finished the last three matches conceding only three points. The tournament saw the emergence of Welsh record breaking player Ken Jones as a world class wing; who is most remembered for his late try against the 1953 touring New Zealand team. The 1950 championship is also remembered for the tragic events following the away win over Ireland, when a chartered flight, returning from the Triple Crown winning match, crashed at Llandow. Seventy five Welsh fans and five crew died in the accident; at the time it was the world's worst civil air disaster.John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales (2008) pp816 =The second golden era 1969-1979= A grogg of the famous \\"Pontypool front row\\". The zenith of Welsh rugby was the 1970s, when Wales had players such as Barry John, Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett and JPR Williams. Wales won four consecutive Triple Crowns. The strong Pontypool front row of Graham Price, Bobby Windsor & Charlie Faulkner were all manual workers, and Robin McBryde was formerly the holder of the title of Wales's strongest man. Gareth Edwards was voted the greatest player of all time in a players poll in 2003 and scored what is widely regarded as the greatest try of all time in 1973 for the Barbarians against New Zealand. =The start of the professional era: 1980 to 2012= The 1980s and early '90s were a difficult time for Welsh rugby union when the team suffered many defeats. Harsh economic times in the eighties meant that players such as Jonathan Davies and Scott Gibbs were tempted to 'go North' to play professional rugby league in order to earn a living. In 2003/4 the Welsh Rugby Union voted to create five regions to play in the Celtic League (now the Pro14) and represent Wales in European competition. This soon became four when the Celtic Warriors were liquidated after just one season. The WRU have announced their hopes of developing a fifth region in North Wales in the long run; the team at the centre of this plan is now known as RGC 1404. In recent years, Welsh Premier Division and Welsh Championship club rugby has faced increased financial hardship, with historic clubs at threat. Premiership side Neath RFC had received a now-resolved winding up petition from HM Revenue and Customs, while Championship team Pontypool RFC have had to fund-raise from supporters to remain at their ground. = Regional Rugby and future reforms: 2013 to present = Created by David Moffat in 2003, Welsh rugby follows a region system with a top tier composed of four club regions. This arrangement has however faced a number of funding issues in recent years. The regions currently operate on a 2009 Participation Agreement which expires in 2019. The regions in 2013 protested against a new agreement, as they felt it did not offer any funding commitments or clarity regarding competitions such as the Heineken Cup. The Union retorted that funding would increase, but that regions would need to commit to the framework or risk losing their revenue streams.  Project Reset  In 2018 the WRU launched Project Reset to review regional arrangements. Due to the growing strength of French Top 14 and English Premiership Rugby sides, the WRU have increase salaries to bring Welsh international players such as Taulupe Faletau, Dan Biggar, Ross Moriarty, and Rhys Webb back into the Welsh league system. Yet the Union now feel the salary arrangements are unsustainable. The WRU has established the Professional Rugby Board to handle the proposed changes, composed of representatives from both the WRU and the regions. Proposal 1 - Merge Scarlets/Ospreys and Blues/Dragons Under one proposal, the region system would decrease from four sides to two. Ospreys and the Scarlets would merge, as would Cardiff Blues and Dragons. Such proposals face widespread opposition from sections of supporters whose local loyalties would prevent them from travelling to traditionally 'rival' grounds to follow their team, standing in the terraces with their bitter rivals. Yet opponents of the proposal have pointed to the struggles of the Scottish rugby union team in test fixtures since switching to a two-region model dominated by Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors. Proposal 2 - Ending the Dragons franchise, or move it to North Wales As the poorest performing Welsh region, the WRU have reportedly discussed moving the Dragons to North Wales, or closing it altogether. This would be challenging given the side's contractual commitments, and its guarantees to ground share at Rodney Parade with Newport RFC and EFL League Two side Newport County A.F.C. until 2021. The WRU have proposed the resulting space then be filled by a North Wales side taking the place of Conwy-based, semi professional RGC 1404. In recent years Dragons have improved their attendances however, so such a move is considered highly controversial and financially ineffective. The WRU nonetheless own both the team and the ground, so have strong control over the franchise's future. A regional rugby franchise, originally known as Rygbi Gogledd Cymru (Welsh language for \\"Rugby North Wales\\") and later known as RGC 1404, was established in North Wales; plans called for the side to enter the Welsh Premier Division as early as 2010‚Äì11 and eventually the Celtic League/Pro12, but the venture was unsuccessful and was liquidated in 2011. The team, however, continues to play as part of Wales' national rugby academy. RGC 1404 also had a partnership with Rugby Canada by which the franchise would have a secondary role of developing players for the Canada national rugby union team, at least until enough local players were developed to fill a complete competitive squad. Proposal 3 - Merging Cardiff Blues and Ospreys As the most successful side in Pro14 (previously Celtic League) history, Ospreys now face significant issues, with reports of debts and stalled contract negotiations threatening their claim to players such as Alun Wyn Jones and head coach Allen Clarke. Managing director Andrew Millward had described the struggle, involving year long budget cuts and structural flaws in the Welsh rugby system, as leaving Wales unable to compete with rivals IRFU and FRR. Facing a merger with Cardiff Blues however, Ospreys supporters have pushed back, arguing that the removal of the Ospreys franchise from the Swansea region would leave one of Wales' rugby heartlands without a local region side, instead forced to travel to their rivals ground at Cardiff Arms Park. Blues supporters also point to the fierce battle their side won to remain in their traditional Cardiff RFC colours and name back in 2003, and are unwilling to adopt a new identity. Proposal 4 - Merge Ospreys and Scarlets More recent discussions have punted merging western sides Scarlets and Ospreys, with the Llanelli and Swansea teams either sharing grounds or moving fully. Scarlets however opposed such a merger with Ospreys back in 2003, with the late Stuart Gallacher famously opposed to any arrangement which would have ended the Scarlets name. Governing body The Welsh Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in Wales. Their responsibilities include producing the national team and the four regional franchises Cardiff Blues, Scarlets, Dragons, and Ospreys. Competitions Wales' four professional rugby regions play in the Pro14 league and take part in the European Rugby Champions Cup, European Rugby Challenge Cup and Anglo- Welsh Cup. The first two of these competitions, set to launch in 2014‚Äì15, replace the now-defunct Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup. Since 2006 they have also competed in the Anglo-Welsh Cup against clubs from the English Premiership. There is also a Welsh Premier Division and WRU Challenge Cup competed for by Wales' traditional club teams. Starting in 2009‚Äì10, the four Home Unions have instituted the British and Irish Cup, an annual competition for semi-professional teams throughout Britain and Ireland; beginning with the 2013‚Äì14 edition, the WRU conducts a play-off among the 12 Premier Division clubs to determine the four that will be entered in the British and Irish Cup. Popularity Rugby union has a particular hold on the national psyche of Wales, especially the Six Nations tournament. The first proof of Wales as a nation embracing the sport of rugby union is reflected in the rapid growth of rugby clubs in the late 19th century. Within a period of 25 years, from 1875 to 1900, most towns and villages in South Wales were represented by at least one team, though it would take until the 1930s for the North of Wales to set up their own leagues. Although difficult to prove popularity, two events that took place early in the history of Welsh rugby illustrate its growing influence on the people of Wales. The first was the Gould Affair, when a testimonial fund was set up for Welsh international Arthur Gould, instigated by a local newspaper. From an initial fund of one shilling the public response saw the amount reach into hundreds of pounds, mainly from working-class families with little spare money. The second incident was during the Tonypandy Riot of 1910, when the striking coalminers attacked the shops and premises in the town centre. 80 police officers and 500 civilians were injured and one person died. Over 60 establishments were attacked and looted, with only two buildings avoiding damage. One was a jewelers which had roller shutters, the other was the chemist shop owned by Willie Llewellyn, which despite the chaos of the events was spared due to his services to Wales on the playing field.The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales. John Davies, Nigel Jenkins, Menna Baines and Peredur Lynch (2008) pg512 Rhondda Cynon Taff Library Service - Tonypandy Morgan (1988), pg393 For the match against Scotland in 2005, 40,000 Welsh people went to Edinburgh to watch the game. Over 10,000 gathered on \\"Henson Hill\\" to watch a big screen of Wales v. Ireland that gave Wales its first Grand Slam since 1978. The result was greeted well amongst fans and was even used to explain a sudden economic surge. Since 2013, the Millennium Stadium hosts the Judgement Day, a double-header fixture of the four Pro12 teams. The first two editions had over 30,000 spectators. The 2015 edition had 52,762 spectators, the highest in the history of the league. The choral tradition of Wales manifests itself at rugby games in singing. Popular songs among the fans are 'Delilah' by Tom Jones, 'Cwm Rhondda' and 'Calon Lan' and in part replace the normal chanting of other Rugby supporters. =Statistics= According to WR, Wales has 239 rugby union clubs; 2321 referees; 28,702 pre-teen male players; 21,371 teen male players; 19,000 senior male players (total male players 69,073) as well as 1,000 teen female players; 1,056 senior female players (total female players 2,056). =Demographics= Whereas rugby in England fractured into the two separate sports of rugby union and rugby league over the issue of money, Wales for the most part stayed loyal to the union game. There were some attempts to run professional rugby league sides in Wales but the heartland of Welsh rugby was simply too far from Yorkshire and Lancashire for this to be sustained. There has always been an element of class warfare to rugby union in Wales. In 1977 Phil Bennett's pre-game pep talk before facing England produced a memorable quote: > Look what these bastards have done to Wales. They've taken our coal, our > water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every > year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing. We've been exploited, > raped, controlled and punished by the English -- and that's who you are > playing this afternoon. The Welsh valleys north of Cardiff produced so many quality number tens that it was often referred to as 'The Outside Half Factory' immortalised in a song by Max Boyce. Boyce's humour refers to rugby union very often and he has written many songs about the trials and tribulations of following the game as a fan e.g. 'Asso Asso Yogoshi', 'The Scottish Trip', 'Hymns and Arias'. The national team Wales compete annually in the Six Nations, which they have won 27 times, the last being in 2019. Wales have also appeared in every World Cup that has been held, and achieved their best result in the 1987 tournament, when they finished third. The national team play at the Millennium Stadium, built in 1999 to replace the old National Stadium. Wales play in scarlet jerseys, white shorts and green socks, with the jersey sporting the Prince of Wales's feathers as their official badge, underlining the close bond between the WRU and the English royal family. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Wales as well as England, Ireland and Scotland. In 2013, during the third and final Test match of the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, Wales fielded 10 players in the 15 man starting lineup. The Lions went on to win the game with ease, securing the series 2-1.

The brand was purchased by Unilever in 1942 and is still owned by the company outside of the United States and Canada. In 2003, Unilever sold the rights to the brand in those countries to Church & Dwight. History A tube of Pepsodent toothpaste Pepsodent toothpaste was introduced in the United States in 1915 by the Pepsodent Company of Chicago. The original formula for the paste contained pepsin, a digestive agent designed to break down and digest food deposits on the teeth, hence the brand and company name. From 1930 to late 1933 a massive animated neon advertising sign, featuring a young girl on a swing, hung on West 47th Street in Times Square in New York City. (This ad was re-created for the climax of the 2005 film King Kong and was featured in the original film in an establishing shot of Times Square itself.) Following the acquisition of the Pepsodent Company by Unilever in 1944, sales of Pepsodent in the UK increased rapidly, more than doubling between 1944 and 1950. The company outgrew its original factory in Park Royal, and the manufacture of the product was moved to the factory of another Unilever-owned toiletry manufacturer, Joseph Watson and Sons of Whitehall Road, Leeds, in 1951. Pepsodent was a very popular brand before the mid-1950s, but its makers were slow to add fluoride to its formula to counter the rise of other highly promoted brands such as Crest and Gleem toothpaste by Procter & Gamble, and Colgate's eponymous product; sales of Pepsodent subsequently plummeted. Today Pepsodent is a ‚Äúvalue brand‚Äù marketed primarily in discount stores and retails for roughly half the price of similarly sized tubes of Crest or of Colgate. Its best-known slogan was ‚ÄúYou'll wonder where the yellow went / when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent!‚Äù. The product was discontinued in South Africa in 1974 but was revived in 1976 with a new ad slogan \\"Gets Your Teeth Their Whitest\\" featuring celebrity endorsers Rita Moreno, Steve Lawrence, and others. The popular slogan was also changed in South Africa to \\"You'll wonder where the dullness went / when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent\\". Pepsodent is still sold as a Unilever property in all markets except the United States and Canada. In Vietnam, Pepsodent is called P/S. In 2013, Pepsodent was ranked 201st among India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2013 India study, a research conducted by Trust Research Advisory. According to the Brand trust Report 2014, Pepsodent moved up to 71st position among India's most trusted brands. Pepsodent's parent company Hindustan Unilever was ranked 47th in the Trust Report 2014. Advertising Early US Pepsodent TV advertisement Pepsodent was advertised for its purported properties for fighting tooth decay, attributed in advertisements to the supposed ingredient Irium. In a 1994 speech, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, Reed Hundt, claimed that the \\"Irium\\" mentioned in Pepsodent advertisements \\"didn't exist\\". \\"Irium\\" was being used as another name for sodium lauryl sulfate, an ionic surfactant. Another ingredient, \\"I.M.P.\\", which stood for \\"Insoluble Meta-Phosphate\\", was purported to whiten teeth. =Radio program= Pepsodent sponsored a radio program, The Pepsodent Show Starring Bob Hope that began airing in 1938 and ran for approximately 10 years on NBC. The show featured Bob Hope and his cast of regular characters such as Jerry Colonna, Barbara Jo Allen as Vera Vague, Frances Langford, and Skinnay Ennis. Famous Hollywood guest stars such as Cary Grant, Orson Welles, Judy Garland, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Paulette Goddard, Dorothy Lamour, Rita Hayworth, Penny Singleton, Arthur Lake, Basil Rathbone, Gary Cooper, Veronica Lake, Ginger Rogers, Edward G. Robinson, Hedda Hopper, and many more would be on hand to trade comedic barbs with Hope. The show was the first radio program to broadcast live from the Hollywood Canteen on October 13, 1942, and soon the show was playing live to U.S. troops during World War II, even including some of the soldiers in the show.

The tenor and the alto are the two most commonly used saxophones. The tenor is pitched in the key of B (while the alto is pitched in the key of E), and written as a transposing instrument in the treble clef, sounding an octave and a major second lower than the written pitch. Modern tenor saxophones which have a high F key have a range from A2 to E5 (concert) and are therefore pitched one octave below the soprano saxophone. People who play the tenor saxophone are known as \\"tenor saxophonists\\", \\"tenor sax players\\", or \\"saxophonists\\". The tenor saxophone uses a larger mouthpiece, reed and ligature than the alto and soprano saxophones. Visually, it is easily distinguished by the curve in its neck, or its crook, near the mouthpiece. The alto saxophone lacks this and its neck goes straight to the mouthpiece. The tenor saxophone is most recognized for its ability to blend well with the soprano, alto and baritone saxophones, with its \\"husky\\" yet \\"bright\\" tone. Tenor sax has been an important solo instrument in jazz music. Famous and influential players include Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Ben Webster, Dexter Gordon, Wardell Gray, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane and Wayne Shorter. The work of younger players such as Michael Brecker and Chris Potter has been an important influence in more recent jazz. History The tenor saxophone is one of a family of fourteen instruments designed and constructed in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian-born instrument maker, flautist and clarinetist. Based on an amalgam of ideas drawn from the clarinet, flute, oboe and ophicleide, the saxophone was intended to form a tonal link between the woodwinds and brass instruments found in military bands, an area that Sax considered sorely lacking. Sax's patent, granted on 28 June 1846, divided the family into two groups of seven instruments, each ranging from alto down to contrabass. One family, pitched alternatively in B and E, was designed specifically to integrate with the other instruments then common in military bands. The tenor saxophone, pitched in B, is the fourth member of this family. Description File:TenorSopranoSax.JPGTenor (left) and soprano saxophones, showing their comparative sizes The tenor saxophone, like all saxophones, consists of an approximately conical tube of thin brass, a type of metal. The wider end of the tube is flared slightly to form a bell, while the narrower end is connected to a single reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. At intervals down the bore are placed between 20 and 23 tone holes; these are covered by pads which can be pressed onto the holes to form an airtight seal. There are also two small speaker holes which, when opened, disrupt the lower harmonics of the instrument and cause it to overblow into an upper register. The pads are controlled by pressing a number of keys with the fingers of the left and right hands; the left thumb controls an octave key which opens one or other of the speaker holes. The original design of tenor saxophone had a separate octave key for each speaker hole, in the manner of the bassoon; the mechanism by which the correct speaker hole is selected based on the fingering of the left hand (specifically the left ring finger) was developed soon after Sax's patent expired in 1866. Although a handful of novelty tenors have been constructed 'straight', like the smaller members of the saxophone family, the unwieldy length of the straight configuration means that almost all tenor saxophones feature a 'U-bend' above the third-lowest tone hole which is characteristic of the saxophone family. The tenor saxophone is also curved at the top, above the highest tone-hole but below the highest speaker hole. While the alto is usually bent only through 80‚Äì90¬∞ to make the mouthpiece fit more easily in the mouth, the tenor is usually bent a little more in this section, incorporating a slight S-bend. The mouthpiece of the tenor saxophone is very similar to that of the clarinet, an approximately wedge-shaped tube, open along one face and covered in use by a thin strip of material prepared from the stem of the giant cane (Arundo donax) commonly known as a reed. The reed is shaved to come to an extremely thin point, and is clamped over the mouthpiece by the use of a ligature. When air is blown through the mouthpiece, the reed vibrates and generates the acoustic resonances required to produce a sound from the instrument. The mouthpiece is the area of the saxophone with the greatest flexibility in shape and style, so the timbre of the instrument is primarily determined by the dimensions of its mouthpiece. The design of the mouthpiece and reed play a big role in how a saxophone sounds. Classical mouthpieces generally help produce a warmer and rounder tone, while jazz mouthpieces generally help produce a brighter and edgier tone. Materials used in mouthpiece construction include plastic, ebonite and various metals e.g. bronze, brass and stainless steel. The mouthpiece of the tenor saxophone is proportionally larger than that of the alto, necessitating a similarly larger reed. The increased stiffness of the reed and the greater airflow required to establish resonance in the larger body means the tenor sax requires greater lung power but a looser embouchure than the higher-pitched members of the saxophone family. The tenor sax reed is similar in size to that used in the bass clarinet, so the two can be easily substituted. Uses The tenor saxophone first gained popularity in one of its original intended roles: the military band. Soon after its invention, French and Belgian military bands began to take full advantage of the instrument which Sax had designed specifically for them. Modern military bands typically incorporate a quartet of saxophone players playing the E baritone, tenor, E alto and B soprano. British military bands customarily make use only of the tenor and alto saxes, with two or more musicians on each instrument. The tenor is used in classical music. It is a standard instrument in concert bands and saxophone quartets. It also has a body of solo repertoire. The tenor is sometimes used as a member of the orchestra in pieces such as Sergei Prokofiev's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Lieutenant Kij√© Suite\\" and Maurice Ravel's \\"Bol√©ro\\". Charles Ives employs a tenor in his Fourth Symphony. Vincent d'Indy wrote for a tenor in his opera Fervaal. Lukas Foss includes a tenor in his Symphony No. 2. The Tenor Saxophone Index, an online repertoire database, was launched in July 2012. Much of the popularity of saxophones in the United States derives from the large number of military bands that were around at the time of the American Civil War. After the war, former military band instruments found their way into the hands of the general public, where they were often used to play gospel music and jazz. The work of the pioneering bandleader Patrick Gilmore (1829‚Äì1892) was highly influential; he was one of the first arrangers to pit brass instruments (trumpet, trombone and cornet) against reeds (clarinet and saxophone) in a manner that has now become the norm for big-band arrangements. The tenor saxophone became best known to the general public through its frequent use in jazz music. It was the pioneering genius of Coleman Hawkins in the 1930s which lifted the tenor saxophone from its traditional role of adding weight to the ensemble and established it as a highly-effective melody instrument in its own right. Many innovative jazz musicians from the 1930s onwards have been tenor saxophone players. The strong resonant sound of Hawkins and his followers was in contrast with the lighter approach of Lester Young and his school. During the bebop years the most prominent tenor sounds in jazz were those of the Four Brothers in the Woody Herman orchestra, including Stan Getz who in the 1960s went on to great popular success playing the Brazilian bossa nova sound on tenor saxophone (not forgetting John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins). In recent years, the tenor continues to be very popular with fans of smooth jazz music, being played by artists like Kirk Whalum, Richard Elliot, Steve Cole and Jessy J. Saxophonists Ron Holloway and Karl Denson are two of the major proponents of the tenor on the jam band music scene. As a result of its prominence in American jazz, the instrument has also featured prominently in other genres, and it has been said that many innovations in American music were pioneered by tenor saxophonists. The tenor is common in rhythm and blues music and has a part to play in rock and roll and more recent rock music as well as African American, Latin American, Afro-Caribbean, and African music.

An anti-tank gun is a form of artillery designed to destroy tanks and other armored fighting vehicles, normally from a static defensive position.OXFORD Advanced Lerner's DICTIONARY opf Current English, NEW EDITION, Cornelsen & OXFORD, A S Hornby, 5th edition, page 42. The development of specialized anti-tank munitions and anti-tank guns was prompted by the appearance of tanks during World War I. To destroy hostile tanks, artillerymen often used field guns depressed to fire directly at their targets. However, this practice expended too much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. The first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s and by World War II was a common appearance in many European armies. In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns.MILIT√ÑRISCHES STUDIENGLOSAR ENGLISCH Teil II/ Teil III, Deutsch ‚Äì Englisch, Abk√ºrzung Begriff, Bundessprachenamt (Stand Januar 2001), page. 283, anti-tank ammunition. Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted, and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another. Anti-tank guns deployed during World War II were often manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to light infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, except for the British Army, which had developed the 40mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder. As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger and more effective armor-piercing shot. The development of the compact hollow charge projectile permanently altered anti-tank warfare, since this type of ammunition did not depend on a high muzzle velocity and could be fired from low-recoil, man-portable light weapons, such as the Panzerfaust and the American series of recoilless rifles. Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved expensive and difficult to conceal. The later generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from the shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantry. Recoilless rifles replaced most conventional anti-tank guns in the postwar period; nevertheless, the development of new anti-tank guns exhibiting similar low-recoil performance continued until the late 1950s in France, Belgium, and the Soviet Union. A few Soviet designs saw combat well into the 1980s. The People's Republic of China was still producing large caliber anti-tank guns as late as 1988. History =Interwar period= The first specialized anti-tank weaponry consisted of anti-tank rifles. These emerged from the mixed results of deploying field artillery against tanks during World War I, and the need to produce a more economical weapon to destroy them. Most anti-tank rifles were over 1.3m in length, however, and difficult for infantrymen to operate in the confines of their trenches. They could penetrate a tank's armor at long range, but without explosive firepower, often failed to cause catastrophic damage, kill or even seriously injure the crew, or disable the tank. A number of infantry support guns designed to defeat hard targets such as fortified machine gun emplacements were used as makeshift anti-tank weapons, including the French Canon d'Infanterie de 37 mod√®le 1916 TRP. The 3.7 cm Tankabwehrkanone 1918 im starrer R√§der‚Äìlafette was probably the first dedicated anti-tank gun in service. However, its gun barrel was based on an earlier Hotchkiss 5- barrelled rotary-cannon. The 3.7 cm TAK 1918 was designed and built for the Imperial German Army in 1918. The 3.7 cm Pak 36 which first appeared in 1928 was probably the first purpose built anti-tank gun. Weighing some 160 kg, the Pak 36 could inflict a catastrophic kill on a tank rather than merely penetrating its armor plate. Towed guns similar to the Pak 36 were the only anti-tank weapon issued to European armies during the 1930s, and a number of influential designs proliferated, such as the B√∂hler gun. By the late 1930s, anti-tank guns had been manufactured by companies in Germany, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. A few countries, such as the Soviet Union, also manufactured foreign designs under license. = World War II= German PaK 38 50mm anti-tank gun At the outbreak of World War II, most armies were fielding light anti-tank guns firing 3.7 cm (37mm) ammunition. The guns were usually mounted on two-wheeled carriages so they could be towed into position, then withdrawn and repositioned rapidly. Since they weighed only a few hundred pounds on average, they could also be manhandled into position. All fired high-explosive and solid armor-piercing shot effective at relatively medium range, and an increasing number were manufactured with protective gun shields in addition to a split rail mounting. They were able to destroy tanks fielded by both sides during the first two years of the war, but soon proved impotent against the heavier tank armor that debuted in 1940. Introducing improved ammunition and increasing muzzle velocity initially helped compensate for their mediocre performance, but it was clear that small caliber anti-tank guns would soon be overtaken by yet more heavily armored tanks. Medium caliber guns in the 40mm to 50mm range began to appear, some of which simply utilised rebored 37mm barrels. Although they too were soon approaching obsolescence, most remained in use with infantry units until the end of the war. Anti-tank guns remained ineffective against sloped armor, as demonstrated by an incident in 1941 when a single Soviet T-34 tank was hit more than 30 times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37mm and 50mm anti-tank guns. The tank survived intact and was driven back to its own lines a few hours later. This helped earn the Pak 36 the moniker of Panzeranklopfger√§t (\\"tank door knocker\\") because its crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34's armor. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than testing their lighter cannon against bow and turret armor. These difficulties resulted in new types of ammunition being issued, namely high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and armor- piercing discarding sabot (APDS) projectiles. Towards the end of World War II, armor plating became still thicker, with tanks such as the Tiger II being fitted with armor over 100mm in thickness, as compared to the 15mm more typical in 1939. This prompted the development of a third generation of anti- tank guns, large caliber pieces in the 57mm to 100mm range. The British Army adopted the Ordnance QF 6-pounder and Ordnance QF 17-pounder, which were then considered great advances in firepower, and the Wehrmacht fielded the even larger 7.5 cm Pak 41 and 8.8 cm Pak 43. While the early 37mm anti-tank guns were easily concealed and moved; the large caliber weapons available late war required equally large vehicles to tow them into place and were difficult to conceal, dig in, withdraw, or reposition. By 1945, large anti-tank guns had become almost impractical in their role, and their size and weight was considered a liability. They were also expensive to produce and although they were capable of defeating the most formidable of opponents, most tank units still consisted of less heavily armoured models that remained vulnerable to less expensive and more practical guns as well. Many heavy anti-tank guns were issued, at least initially, on the divisional level but gradually made their way to individual infantry battalions. Meanwhile, the effect of very compact hollow charge warheads was being noted and a number of countries began producing man-portable anti-tank weapons utilizing this ammunition. The development of man-portable, shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket launchers began in 1941; most could be reloaded, but a few such as the German Panzerfaust were fired from disposable tubes. Unlike anti-tank guns, their light weight made them easily portable by individual infantrymen on the battlefield, and they offered similar degrees of firepower whilst being quicker and cheaper to produce. Towed anti-tank guns disappeared from most Western countries, such as the United States, after World War II, to be replaced by shoulder-fired rocket launchers, recoilless rifles, and eventually, guided anti-tank missiles. = Postwar period = Postwar Soviet MT-12 100 mm anti-tank gun. At the end of the war, German engineers had proposed a new large caliber anti-tank gun that used less propellant than a rocket or recoilless weapon, yet fired similar compact hollow charge shells. German forces subsequently fielded the 8 cm PAW 600, which was an extremely lightweight, low pressure weapon still able to fire the same ammunition types as higher velocity anti-tank guns. In the 1950s, this idea was revived by a Belgian firm, Mecar, which subsequently improved on the concept and developed a low pressure, smoothbore 90 mm anti- tank gun. Because of its low recoil forces and light construction, the gun was particularly useful for being mounted on armored cars or small gun carriages. Its design inspired the lightly rifled French DEFA D921 anti-tank gun, which fired fin-stabilized shells and was available on a towed carriage or as a vehicle mount. It was later mated to the AML-90 and EBR series of French armored cars. The Soviet Union also adopted a similar design at around the same time, the 100 mm T-12 anti-tank gun, which was smoothbore and fired fin- stabilized shells. Switzerland developed a postwar 90 mm anti-tank gun of its own, the Pak 50/57, firing shells with an even lower velocity than the Mecar or DEFA guns. Apart from the T-12, which utilized APDS rounds, these weapons could only use HEAT shells for armor-piercing purposes. France did introduce an APFSDS shell for the DEFA D921 at some point in the 1980s. The last country known to have produced a dedicated anti-tank gun was the People's Republic of China, in 1988. The Chinese gun was known as the Norinco Type 86 and was probably manufactured as a replacement for the ageing Soviet-sourced T-12. Anti-tank guns continued to be used in a number of conflicts around the world, such as the Six-Day War and the South African Border War. Soviet anti-tank guns in particular were exported to at least eighteen other countries after being retired from service and have continued to see action. Self-propelled anti-tank guns Archer tank destroyer, based on the hull of a Valentine tank. Although still being drawn by horses or towed by trucks, towed anti- tank guns were initially much lighter and more portable than field guns, making them well-suited to infantry maneuvers. However, as their size and caliber increased, the guns likewise became increasingly heavy and cumbersome, restricting their role to static defense. In consequence, during World War II, both sides were compelled to make anti-tank guns self-propelled, which greatly increased their mobility. The first self-propelled anti-tank guns were merely belated attempts to make use of obsolete tanks, such as the Panzerj√§ger I, which was a 4.7 cm Pak (t) mated to a Panzerkampfwagen I chassis. The trend continued with older tanks, which were available in large numbers for conversions to self-propelled guns when they were replaced by heavier and better-armed tanks. Although just a makeshift solution, these initial experiments proved so successful they spawned an entire class of new vehicles: dedicated tank destroyers. Tank destroyers offered some advantages over towed anti-tank guns, since a static gun emplacement sacrificed concealment and surprise after firing the first shot; however, the same gun mounted on a tracked or wheeled chassis could open fire and throw a tank formation into substantial disarray before quickly withdrawing to repeat the same tactic elsewhere. The introduction of tank destroyers also put an end to the traditional tactic of suppressing anti-tank gun batteries with heavy artillery bombardments, as their crews were now well-protected under armor. They were not without their own series of disadvantages, however, namely presenting a much larger target than a towed gun, the added responsibilities of vehicle maintenance and logistical support, and the limited spaces in which the crew had to operate and stow all their available ammunition. By the end of the war, dedicated tank destroyers had been superseded by tanks, which were just as effective at destroying other tanks, and there was little incentive to continue their separate development. Nevertheless, much like towed anti-tank guns, they were widely exported and were still in service with several armies in the late twentieth century.

He took up the tenor saxophone while serving in the United States Air Force from 1948 to 1952, then pursued a musical career, playing briefly with pianist Earl Hines before encountering Sun Ra in 1953. For the next four decades, Gilmore recorded and performed almost exclusively with Sun Ra. This was puzzling to some, who noted Gilmore's talent, and thought he could be a major star like John Coltrane or Sonny Rollins. Despite being five years older than Gilmore, Coltrane was impressed with his playing, and took informal lessons from Gilmore in the late 1950s. Coltrane's epochal, proto‚Äìfree jazz \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" was inspired partly by Gilmore's sound. The Penguin Guide to Jazz suggests Gilmore remained an influence in Coltrane's later period, particularly on Sunship. In 1957, he co-led with Clifford Jordan a Blue Note session which resulted in the album Blowing in from Chicago. The rhythm section featured Horace Silver, Curly Russell, and Art Blakey. In the mid-1960s, Gilmore toured with the Jazz Messengers and he participated in recording sessions with Paul Bley, Andrew Hill (Andrew!!! and Compulsion), Pete La Roca (Turkish Women at the Bath), McCoy Tyner (Today and Tomorrow) and a handful of others. In 1970, he co-led a recording with Jamaican trumpeter Dizzy Reece. His main focus throughout, however, remained with the Sun Ra Arkestra. Gilmore's devotion to Sun Ra was due, in part, to the latter's use of harmony, which Gilmore considered both unique and a logical extension of bebop. Gilmore had stated that Sun Ra was \\"more stretched out than Monk\\" and that \\"I'm not gonna run across anybody who's moving as fast as Sun Ra ... So I just stay where I am.\\" Gilmore occasionally doubled on drums and also played bass clarinet until Sun Ra hired Robert Cummings as a specialist on the latter instrument in the mid-1950s. However, tenor sax was his main instrument and Gilmore himself made a huge contribution to Sun Ra's recordings and was the Arkestra's leading sideman, being given solos on almost every track on which he appeared. In the Rough Guide to Jazz, Brian Priestley says: > Gilmore is known for two rather different styles of tenor playing. On > performances of a straight ahead post-bop character (which include many of > those with Sun Ra), he runs the changes with a fluency and tone halfway > between Johnny Griffin and Wardell Gray, and with a rhythmic and motivic > approach which he claims influenced Coltrane. On more abstract material, he > is capable of long passages based exclusively on high-register squeals. > Especially when heard live, Gilmore was one of the few musicians who carried > sufficient conviction to encompass both approaches. After Sun Ra died in 1993, Gilmore led Ra's Arkestra for a few years before his own death from emphysema.Pareles, J.

The game was developed by Square, published in Japan in 1999 and in both North America and, unlike the previous game, in PAL regions in 2000. It is the sequel to Parasite Eve and the second game in the series of the same name. Parasite Eve II is set several years after the events in the original game. The protagonist from the first game, Aya Brea, also features in this game as the playable character. She becomes involved with another outbreak of Neo-Mitochondrial creatures. Gameplay diverges from the previous game: battles take place in real-time and the area of action is less restrictive. The approach is more typical of traditional survival horror games, although some role-playing elements are retained. The title was written and directed by Kenichi Iwao, who wrote Resident Evil (1996). The game was well received by critics, although it was criticized for using a control system that was seen as being outdated.  Gameplay  Parasite Eve II is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Character control is accomplished in a traditional survival horror manner: Aya is able to move forwards, backwards, and pivot left and right. Camera movement is limited, generally being confined to a single view of a room or area, and cannot be altered by the player. Unlike Parasite Eve, there is no Active Time Bar that governs the order of actions during a battle. Battles take place in real time, so the player is free to act as they see fit. Another contrast is the absence of the 'range dome' seen in the first game, allowing the player to shoot at off-screen targets and engage targets from a safe distance. There are also no random battles; enemies will be found wandering in plain view, hence allowing the player to avoid confrontations and plan strategies. Aiming, as with most other games of this genre, is accomplished by cycling through the various 'lockable' targets within Aya's range. Having locked her abilities gained in the original game, players have to \\"rediscover\\" abilities available with Aya's parasite energy (PE). This is done by using EXP gained from defeating enemies. However, whereas the first game used a levelling up system, in which abilities are unlocked at certain levels, the sequel allows players to choose freely which abilities they want to prioritise. These are categorised into 4 elements and can be summarised as follows: fire for offensive abilities, water for health- related abilities, wind for status-related abilities, earth for abilities that affect damage stats (given or taken). There are 3 abilities in each element category, and each ability has three tiers (level 1, 2 and 3), with level 3 being the most powerful and costing the least MP. Equipment can be obtained through various methods, including finding, purchasing and 'creating' items such as body armor, weapons, ammunition and tools. Unlike most other survival horror games, ammunition is almost never in short supply. While Aya can only carry limited amounts of equipment with her, inexhaustible ammunition boxes exist in most areas and can be revisited as often as required for a top-up. This encourages the player to fight rather than run, which is essential to the gameplay as it is the only way to gain experience and thus for Aya to become powerful enough to succeed. While equipment follows the original game's concept of being customizable, in general the weapons and armor are quite limited in the alterations available. Armor, which not only reduces damage but also affects the amount Aya can carry, has the option of adding extra item slots up to a limit of ten. Once the game has been completed, bonus items become available for the player should they choose to redo the game in Replay mode. Other modes also become available, such as Bounty Hunter and Scavenger which are more difficult for the player to complete. The most difficult mode \\"Nightmare\\" only becomes available after completing the game in Scavenger Mode.  Plot  The game opens to reveal Aya Brea, the protagonist of the original Parasite Eve game, who is now an FBI operative in their Mitochondrial Investigation and Suppression Team (MIST) being dispatched on an urgent mission in central Los Angeles, where there have been reports of NMC sightings. The first chapter in the game puts Aya in the position of investigating the Akropolis tower where she finds a slaughtered SWAT team and an NMC infestation. She soon discovers that the NMCs can take on human form, and eventually encounters a different type of creature; a humanoid Artificial Neo-Mitochondrial Creature (ANMC) called Golem No. 9. She encounters this ANMC three times in the game. Golem No. 9. destroys the tower, but Aya along with her colleague Rupert, who has been at the scene before she arrives, escape in a police helicopter. After a brief interlude, the next chapter finds Aya in the desert town of Dryfield, Nevada. It is nothing more than a truck-stop on a seldom used highway, with a motel, garage and diner but little else. Upon arriving, she finds that Dryfield too is infested with NMCs. She later encounters a survivor (Mr. Douglas) and his dog, Flint, who will act as her source of news and equipment for much of the game. She later rescues Kyle Madigan, a private investigator who claims he is on a mission similar to Aya's. He tells her about \\"The Shelter\\", a nearby underground facility that may hold the answers to the recent outbreak of NMCs. After spending some time in Dryfield, Aya and Kyle find an entrance to the shelter located in an abandoned mine. They part company and she proceeds to investigate the shelter alone. As Aya explores the shelter she discovers that the ANMCs are the result of genetic engineering in an attempt to artificially create superior life- forms, and that in some way she is closely involved. The game's storyline unfolds through various animated cut scenes that appear at regular intervals when plot points are triggered; one of these reveals that the ANMCs were created from her own DNA. Eventually Aya discovers the game's fourth and final area, the Neo-Ark (Shambala in the Japanese version), the entrance to which is concealed in the shelter. She finds out that the Ark facility was intended to be a showcase of ANMC technology, divided into different habitats, with zoo- like visitor commentaries and viewing platforms throughout the area. Habitat containment has broken down and the ANMCs are loose. This area is now infested with the creatures too. The goal in this area is for Aya to disable the power generator, which allows access to an area that could not be reached in the shelter. Returning to the shelter, and reunited with Kyle, Aya rescues a girl that has been manipulated into controlling the hostile NMCs. She also finds out that the girl, Eve, was created from her own DNA, making her, in a sense, Aya's daughter. Eve is later kidnapped by No. 9. Returning to the shelter entrance, Aya encounters a small army of Golems, but is rescued by the US Marines, who have been alerted by Aya's contacts at MIST. She later receives a gift from Mr. Douglas, via Flint, of supplies. She decides to use Flint to help her find Eve, giving him Eve's bear to let him track her scent. He leads her back into the shelter. Aya tracks Eve down to a room containing an enormous cocoon, to find No. 9 incorporating Eve into it. Kyle is there as well; apparently helping No. 9. Kyle eventually turns on No. 9, preventing him from placing Eve into the cocoon. After a cut scene showing a satellite weapon being fired per the President's orders, and Dryfield being wiped off the map, Aya and Kyle find themselves separated by a hole that has penetrated all the shelter's floors. She looks down to see Eve hanging onto a piece of debris on the edge of one of the lower levels. Eventually, the cocoon breaks open having been dislodged by the impact of the weapon, revealing the largest NMC in the game. After defeating this creature, Eve herself transforms into a very fast and powerful winged NMC that resembles Melissa Pearce-Eve's second to last form from the first game. Again Aya must fight. Once this final battle is concluded, various cut scenes are shown depending on the actions of the player during the game. The good ending being Aya adopting Eve as her sister with help from MIST. One year later, Pierce gives them 2 tickets to the American Natural History Museum in New York City where they meet Kyle Madigan again. Development Development of Parasite Eve II was handled by Square, developers of the original Parasite Eve. The game was directed and written by Kenichi Iwao, who had previously worked in those roles for the 1996 survival horror game Resident Evil. Due to its popularity at the time, Square decided to design a new Parasite Eve game which emulated that style. The game was originally intended to be a spin-off of the first game with Kyle as the main protagonist; this was the main reason for the shift in genre and gameplay. During development, it was decided to turn the game into an official sequel to Parasite Eve, making Aya the main protagonist and removing Kyle as a playable character. Production was handled by an entirely new development team based on Osaka. The staff included several former Resident Evil staff members. Using feedback from the original game, the team decreased and smoothed the transition between exploration and battle, and adjusted the controls to be more user-friendly. The character of Aya had been created for Parasite Eve by the producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, and designed by artist Tetsuya Nomura. Her design in Parasite Eve II was to have been handled by a different artist, using her original design as a template. While most of the design was finalized, the designer quit halfway through the game's development, and Nomura was called in again. As the in-game model had already been created, he preserved what had already been done while adding touches of his own. =Music= The score for Parasite Eve II was composed by Naoshi Mizuta and arranged by Hiroshi Nakajima. It took Mizuta a year and a half to compose the soundtrack. He states he was given quite a bit of freedom in his composition, and drew most of his influence from watching the game's already completed scenario. The game's music is depicted as being much more ambient than its predecessor. The sound effects of Parasite Eve II were influenced by futuristic and sci-fi themes. The 66-track two-disc Parasite Eve II Original Soundtrack was released by DigiCube on December 20, 1999, in Japan. The soundtrack was released in North America by Tokyopop on September 12, 2000.  Release  Parasite Eve II was released in Japan on December 16, 1999. It was released in North America on September 12, 2000, and in Europe on August 25, 2000. The game sold over 220,000 copies in Japan during 1999. It broke the one million unit sales mark by February 2004, with 0.43 million sold in Japan and 0.66 million sold in the rest of the world. In late 2000, the game was re- released as part of the Square Millennium Collection along with a figure of Aya and a portrait of her character model, Yumiko Shaku. The game was re- released as part of the PSone Books best-seller line by Sony in Japan in 2002. In early September 2010, posts made on Twitter in relation to the spin-off title The 3rd Birthday suggested that Parasite Eve 1 and 2 would be added to the PlayStation Network's game download service. On October 28 these rumors were proven to be correct, with Parasite Eve being given a November 4 release date and Parasite Eve 2 arriving on the PlayStation Network in Japan on November 24. Parasite Eve II was released on the North American PlayStation Network on August 23, 2011. Reception Greg Orlando reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Square seems to have taken to heart most of the criticism from the original. Eve II is scary good fun.\\" Parasite Eve II received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

Angelo Branduardi (born 12 February 1950) is an Italian folk/folk rock singer-songwriter and composer who scored relative success in Italy and European countries such as France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands and Greece.  Biography  Branduardi was born in Cuggiono, a small town in the province of Milan, but early moved with the family to Genoa. He was educated as a classical violinist in the Genoa music conservatory, Niccol√≤ Paganini. At the age of 18, he composed the music for the Confessioni di un malandrino (Hooligan's Confession) by Sergei Yesenin. He is married to Luisa Zappa, who wrote the lyrics for many of his songs. They have two daughters, Sarah and Maddalena, both musicians.  Works  = The beginnings = Branduardi's first album was never released, and resulted from a co-operation with Maurizio Fabrizio, composer and gifted performer. The first released album, Angelo Branduardi '74 was arranged with Paul Buckmaster. = The minstrel = La Luna (\\"The Moon\\"), including \\"Hooligan's Confession\\" (translation of a poem by Esenin) and the fine, delicate song giving the LP its name, was a prelude to the success of the following works. Alla fiera dell'Est (English edition: Highdown Fair, 1976) was Branduardi's first vastly popular album, followed by La Pulce d'Acqua (English version, Fables and Fantasies 1978) and Cogli la prima mela (English edition, Life is the Only Teacher, 1979). Lyrics for the English versions of Branduardi's albums were written by Peter Sinfield, also lyricist for King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In those albums, Branduardi exploited themes and patterns from early music, mostly Renaissance and early Baroque. The song \\"Alla fiera dell'Est\\" (\\"At the Eastern Fair\\") is still popular among Italians of every age, who test themselves committing to memory all the fable-like, repetitive lyrics. It is based on an old Jewish song in Aramaic (\\"Chad Gadya\\" ‚Äì One Kid Goat) sung at the end of the Passover Seder night service. In 2007 \\"Alla fiera dell'Est\\" was covered by Israeli singer Shlomi Shabat for a Passover time commercial for cellphone company Pelephone. Lyrics had a broad spectrum of inspiration: a Danse macabre, the theme of Satan's mistress, Chinese, Native American and Druidic tradition, the apocryphal Gospels. Concertation owes much to the talents of Maurizio Fabrizio, and exploits unusual instruments for pop music: dulcimer, Pan flute, lute, clarinet, among others ‚Äì mixed with more standard guitar, bass and drums. = Experimentation and crisis = Subsequent albums showed an increasing desire towards experimentation and differentiation. Branduardi (1981) had a more intimate tone, Cercando l'oro (\\"Searching for Gold\\", 1983) had very sophisticated and delicate arrangements (starts with a String Quartet), Branduardi canta Yeats (\\"Branduardi sings Yeats\\", 1985) was a tribute to William Butler Yeats. Pane e rose (\\"Bread and Roses\\", 1988) was a still inspired, but increasingly dark picture of life and death. Il Ladro (\\"The Thief\\", 1991) marked a very delicate point of Branduardi's life, edging on depression, echoed in a dark, almost cemeterial, style of singing. The album Si pu√≤ fare (\\"It Can Be Done\\", 1993) brought back Branduardi to normality, but the artist is now struggling to evade the minstrel character which was now too tight for him. In 1994, he published Domenica e luned√¨ (\\"Sunday and Monday\\"), dedicated to the Italian poet Franco Fortini who was one of Branduardi's professors in his school years. = New directions = In 1996, during the celebrations for the restoration of the Duomo of Spilimbergo after the catastrophic 1976 earthquake, he recorded the album Futuro antico (\\"Ancient Future\\"), in which he, as an early Baroque musician, keeps reusing, mixing, wording pre-existing material along with his own. This experience, accomplished with the aid of musicians and musicologists, continued with Futuro antico II and Futuro antico III. The same year he performed \\"Te vojo 'bbene assaje\\" (\\"I love you so much\\" in Neapolitan) with Italian pop singer Eugenio Finardi. In 1998, Branduardi teamed up with Italian stand-up comedian and writer Giorgio Faletti for Il dito e la luna (\\"The Finger and the Moon\\"). He subsequently reworked earlier musical themes with writings of and about St. Francis to produce L'infinitamente piccolo (\\"The Infinitely Small\\"); he wrote a musical on the same topic (Francesco). In 2003, a new album, Altro ed altrove (\\"Other and Elsewhere\\"), in a time period marked by a rise of racism and intolerance, brought together (mainly) love stories from several cultures. For the last 10 years, his band, on stage, has been composed of Davide Raggazoni (drums), Michele Ascolese (guitars), Leonardo Pieri (keyboards) and Stefano Olivato (bass and harmonica), or with Ellade Bandini (drums) and Maurizio Fabrizio (guitars and keyboards).

The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era. These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, comprised the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods. The lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition. Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete. Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly Oedipus the King and Antigone. Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre. The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy. The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the sixth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes. The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential. Important later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote The Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays. The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Hellenized Syrian, who wrote primarily works of satire. Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large. In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors. Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs.  Pre-classical and classical antiquity  This period of Greek literature stretches from Homer until the fourth century BC and the rise of Alexander the Great. The earliest known Greek writings are Mycenaean, written in the Linear B syllabary on clay tablets. These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc.); no real literature has been discovered. \\"The glimpse we have suddenly been given of the account books of a long-forgotten people...\\" Michael Ventris and John Chadwick, the original decipherers of Linear B, state that literature almost certainly existed in Mycenaean Greece, but it was either not written down or, if it was, it was on parchment or wooden tablets, which did not survive the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces in the twelfth century BC. Greek literature was divided in well-defined literary genres, each one having a compulsory formal structure, about both dialect and metrics. The first division was between prose and poetry. Within poetry there were three super- genres: epic, lyric and drama. The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology. Lyric and drama were further divided into more genres: lyric in four (elegiac, iambic, monodic lyric and choral lyric); drama in three (tragedy, comedy and pastoral drama). Prose literature can largely be said to begin with Herodotus. Over time, several genres of prose literature developed, but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred. = Epic poetry = At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey. The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery. Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time (see Homeric Question). The Iliad is a narrative of a single episode spanning over the course of a ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War. It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal.Guy Hedreen, \\"The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine\\" Hesperia 60.3 (July 1991), pp. 313‚Äì330. Neoclassical painter Thomas Degeorge depicting the climactic final scene from Book Twenty-Two of The Odyssey in which Odysseus, Telemachus, Eumaeus, and Philoetius slaughter the suitors of Penelope The Odyssey is an account of the adventures of Odysseus, one of the warriors at Troy. After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family. Penelope was considered the ideal female, Homer depicted her as the ideal female based on her commitment, modesty, purity, and respect during her marriage with Odysseus. During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar. Both of these works were based on ancient legends. The stories are told in language that is simple, and direct. The Homeric dialect was an archaic language based on Ionic dialect mixed with some element of Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect, the latter due to the Athenian edition of the 6th century BC. The epic verse was the hexameter. The other great poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod. Unlike Homer, Hesiod refers to himself in his poetry.J.P. Barron and P.E. Easterling, \\"Hesiod\\" in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 92 Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any external source. He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC.West, M. L. Theogony. Oxford University Press (1966), page 40 Hesiod's two extant poems are Works and Days and Theogony. Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age.Jasper Griffin, \\"Greek Myth and Hesiod\\", J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford University Press (1986), page 88 The writings of Homer and Hesiod were held in extremely high regard throughout antiquity and were viewed by many ancient authors as the foundational texts behind ancient Greek religion; \\"... These traditions were first recounted only orally as there was no sacred text in Greek religion and later, attempts were made to put in writing this oral tradition, notably by Hesiod in his Theogony and more indirectly in the works of Homer. Homer told the story of a heroic past, which Hesiod bracketed with a creation narrative and an account of the practical realities of contemporary daily life. = Lyric poetry = A nineteenth-century painting by the English painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema depicting the poetess Sappho gazing on in admiration as the poet Alcaeus plays the lyre Lyric poetry received its name from the fact that it was originally sung by individuals or a chorus accompanied by the instrument called the lyre. Despite the name, however, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by cithara, but by flute. These two latter genres were elegiac poetry and iambic poetry. Both were written in the Ionic dialect. Elegiac poems were written in elegiac couplets and iambic poems were written in iambic trimeter. The first of the lyric poets was probably Archilochus of Paros, 7th century BC, the most important iambic poet.J. P. Barron and P. E. Easterling, 'Elegy and Iambus', in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 117 Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets. The few remnants suggest that he was an embittered adventurer who led a very turbulent life.David A. Campbell, Greek Lyric Poetry, Bristol Classical Press (1982) page 136 Many lyric poems were written in the Aeolic dialect. Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters. The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called \\"Nine Lyric Poets\\".J. M. Edmonds - Lyra Graeca (p.3) Wildside Press LLC, 2007 [Retrieved 2015-05-06] Of all the lyric poets, Sappho of Lesbos (c. 630 ‚Äì c. 570 BC) was by far the most widely revered. In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer.Hallett, Judith P. (1979). \\"Sappho and her Social Context: Sense and Sensuality\\". Signs. 4 (3). Only one of her poems, \\"Ode to Aphrodite\\", has survived to the present day in its original, completed form.Rayor, Diane; Lardinois, Andr√© (2014). Sappho: A New Edition of the Complete Works. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . In addition to Sappho, her contemporary Alcaeus of Lesbos was also notable for monodic lyric poetry. The poetry written by Alcman was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the Doric dialect, which was normally considered unpleasant to hear.Pausanias 3.15.2 . The later poet Pindar of Thebes was renowned for his choral lyric poetry.M. Davies's \\"Monody, Choral Lyric, and the Tyranny of the Hand-Book\\" in Classical Quarterly, NS 38 (1988), pp. 52-64. = Drama = Medea kills her son (a scene from Euripides's Medea), Campanian red-figure amphora, c. 330 BC, Louvre (K 300) All surviving works of Greek drama were composed by playwrights from Athens and are written exclusively in the Attic dialect. Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states. The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus.Buckham, Philip Wentworth, Theatre of the Greeks, Cambridge : J. Smith, 1827. Later playwrights expanded the number of actors to three, allowing for greater freedom in storytelling. In the age that followed the Greco-Persian Wars, the awakened national spirit of Athens was expressed in hundreds of tragedies based on heroic and legendary themes of the past. The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus. In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth. Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty. Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship. Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens. The poets competed for the prizes offered for the best plays. All fully surviving Greek tragedies are conventionally attributed to Aeschylus, Sophocles or Euripides. The authorship of Prometheus Bound, which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus,Griffith, Mark. The Authenticity of the Prometheus Bound. Cambridge, 1977. and Rhesus, which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are, however, questioned.Walton, J. Michael, Euripides Our Contemporary, University of California Press, 2009, . There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus. Three of these plays, Agamemnon, The Libation-Bearers, and The Eumenides, form a trilogy known as The Oresteia.Burke, Kenneth (1952). \\"Form and Persecution in the Oresteia\\". The Sewanee Review. 60 (3: July ‚Äì September): 377‚Äì396. . One of these plays, Prometheus Bound, however, may actually be the work of Aeschylus's son Euphorion.West, M.L. Studies in Aeschylus. Stuttgart, 1990. Seven works of Sophocles have survived, the most acclaimed of which are the three Theban plays, which center around the story of Oedipus and his offspring.Suda (ed. Finkel et al.): s.v. Œ£ŒøœÜŒøŒ∫Œª·øÜœÇ. The Theban Trilogy consists of Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone. Although the plays are often called a \\"trilogy,\\" they were actually written many years apart. Antigone, the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles's career. Oedipus the King, the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles's career.Although Sophocles won second prize with the group of plays that included Oedipus Rex, its date of production is uncertain. The prominence of the Theban plague at the play's opening suggests to many scholars a reference to the plague that devastated Athens in 430 BC, and hence a production date shortly thereafter. See, for example, Oedipus at Colonus, the second of the three plays chronologically, was actually Sophocles's last play and was performed in 401 BC, after Sophocles's death. There are nineteen surviving plays attributed to Euripides. The most well-known of these plays are Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae.B. Knox,'Euripides' in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 316 Rhesus is sometimes thought to have been written by Euripides' son, or to have been a posthumous reproduction of a play by Euripides.Walton (1997, viii, xix) Euripides pushed the limits of the tragic genre and many of the elements in his plays were more typical of comedy than tragedy.B. Knox. \\"Euripides\\" in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature I: Greek Literature, P. Easterling and B. Knox (ed.s), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 339 His play Alcestis, for instance, has often been categorized as a \\"problem play\\" or perhaps even as a work of tragicomedy rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending.Banham, Martin, ed. 1998. The Cambridge Guide to Theatre. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. .Brockett, Oscar G. and Franklin J. Hildy. 2003. History of the Theatre. Ninth edition, International edition. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. . Illustration for Aristophanes's Lysistrata by Aubrey Beardsley (1896) Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes.Aristophanes: Clouds K.J. Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. page X. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In The Birds, he ridicules Athenian democracy. In The Clouds, he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In Lysistrata, he denounces war.David Barrett's edition Aristophanes: the Frogs and Other Plays (Penguin Classics, 1964), p. 13 Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John Lempri√®re's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, \\"the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Moli√®re seems dull and Shakespeare clownish.\\" Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences. A commercially successful modern musical adaptation of it was performed on Broadway in 2004. The third dramatic genre was the satyr play. Although the genre was popular, only one complete example of a satyr play has survived: Cyclops by Euripides.Euripides. McHugh, Heather, trans. Cyclops; Greek Tragedy in New Translations. Oxford Univ. Press (2001) Large portions of a second satyr play, Ichneutae by Sophocles, have been recovered from the site of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.Hunt, A.S. (1912) The Oxyrhynchus Papyri: Part IX. London. = Historiography = bust of Herodotus from the first half of the fourth century BC Two notable historians who lived during the Classical Era were Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called \\"The Father of History.\\"T. James Luce, The Greek Historians, 2002, p. 26. His book The Histories is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence. Thucydides's book History of the Peloponnesian War greatly influenced later writers and historians, including the author of the book of Acts of the Apostles and the Byzantine Era historian Procopius of Caesarea.Procopius, John Moorhead, Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing: M‚ÄìZ, Vol. II, Kelly Boyd, (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1999), 962 A third historian of ancient Greece, Xenophon of Athens, began his Hellenica where Thucydides ended his work about 411 BC and carried his history to 362 BC.Xenophon, Hellenica 7.5.27; Xenophon. Xenophontis opera omnia, vol. 1. Oxford, Clarendon Press. 1900, repr. 1968 Xenophon's most famous work is his book The Anabasis, a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne. Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates: The Apology of Socrates to the Jury, The Symposium, and Memorabilia. Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different. Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. \\"Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates' Behavior in Court.\\" Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281‚Äì321. = Philosophy = Many important and influential philosophers lived during the fifth and fourth centuries BC. Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called \\"Milesian philosophers\\": Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, and Anaximenes.G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven and M. Schofield, The Presocratic Philosophers (Cambridge University Press, 1983, 108‚Äì109. Of these philosophers' writings, however, only one fragment from Anaximander preserved by Simplicius of Cilicia has survived.Simplicius, Comments on Aristotle's Physics (24, 13): : \\"\\" In ancient Greek, quotes usually blend with the surrounding text. Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, but Anaximander's writing, in \\"somewhat poetic terms\\" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.Curd, Patricia, A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia (Hackett Publishing, 1996), p. 12. Very little is known for certain about the life of the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos and no writings by him have survived to the present day, but an impressive corpus of poetic writings written by his pupil Empedocles of Acragas has survived, making Empedocles one of the most widely attested Pre- Socratic philosophers.Simon Tr√©panier, (2004), Empedocles: An Interpretation, Routledge. A large number of fragments written by the philosophers Heraclitus of Ephesus and Democritus of Abdera have also survived. Of all the classical philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally considered the most important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name.Cohen, M., Philosophical Tales: Being an Alternative History Revealing the Characters, the Plots, and the Hidden Scenes that Make Up the True Story of Philosophy, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 5, . The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem. The Death of Socrates, by Jacques-Louis David (1787) Plato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals. Some of the best-known of these include: The Apology of Socrates, a purported record of the speech Socrates gave at his trial;Henri Estienne (ed.), Platonis opera quae extant omnia, Vol. 1, 1578, p. 17. Phaedo, a description of the last conversation between Socrates and his disciples before his execution; The Symposium, a dialogue over the nature of love;Plato, The Symposium. Translation and introduction by Walter Hamilton. Penguin Classics. 1951. and The Republic, widely regarded as Plato's most important work,National Public Radio (August 8, 2007). Plato's 'Republic' Still Influential, Author Says. Talk of the Nation.Plato: The Republic. Plato: His Philosophy and his life, allphilosophers.com a long dialogue describing the ideal government. Aristotle of Stagira is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential philosophical thinkers of all time. The first sentence of his Metaphysics reads: \\"All men by nature desire to know.\\" He has, therefore, been called the \\"Father of those who know.\\" His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as \\"the Philosopher\\". Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations. However, none of these exist today. The body of writings that have come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum.<, ref name=\\"iep-lyceum\\"> Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government. Among Aristotle's most notable works are Politics, Nicomachean Ethics, Poetics, On the Soul, and Rhetoric.  Hellenistic period  Imaginative nineteenth-century engraving of the ancient Library of Alexandria By 338 BC all of the Greek city-states except Sparta had been united by Philip II of Macedon. Philip's son Alexander the Great extended his father's conquests greatly. Athens lost its preeminent status as the leader of Greek culture, and it was replaced temporarily by Alexandria, Egypt. The city of Alexandria in northern Egypt became, from the 3rd century BC, the outstanding center of Greek culture. It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world. In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of Christian thought. The Musaeum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I. The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library.Entry ŒúŒøœÖœÉŒµŒØŒøŒΩ at Liddell & Scott The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek. It was intended to serve as a repository for every work of classical Greek literature that could be found. = Poetry = A painting by John William Waterhouse depicting a scene from The Argonautica by Apollonius of Rhodes The genre of bucolic poetry was first developed by the poet Theocritus.Introduction (p.14) to Virgil: The Eclogues trans. Guy Lee (Penguin Classics) The Roman Virgil later wrote his Eclogues in this genre.Article on \\"Bucolic poetry\\" in The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature (1989) Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, composed the Aetia (\\"Causes\\"), a long poem written in four volumes of elegiac couplets describing the legendary origins of obscure customs, festivals, and names, which he probably wrote in several stages over the course of many years in the third century BC. The Aetia was lost during the Middle Ages, but, over the course of the twentieth century, much of it was recovered due to new discoveries of ancient papyri. Scholars initially denigrated it as \\"second- rate\\", showing great learning, but lacking true \\"art\\". Over the course of the century, scholarly appraisal of it greatly improved, with many scholars now seeing it in a much more positive light. Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the Ibis, which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius. He also compiled a prose treatise entitled the Pinakes, in which he catalogued all the major works held in the Library of Alexandria.Blum 1991, p. 236, cited in The Alexandrian poet Apollonius of Rhodes is best known for his epic poem the Argonautica, which narrates the adventures of Jason and his shipmates the Argonauts on their quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece from the land of Colchis. The poet Aratus wrote the hexameter poem Phaenomena, a poetic rendition of Eudoxus of Cnidus's treatise on the stars written in the fourth century BC.A. W. Mair and G. R. Mair, trans., Callimachus and Lycophron; Aratus, Loeb Classical Library (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1921), p. 363 = Drama = Republican or Early Imperial relief depicting a seating Menander holding the masks of New Comedy (1st century BC ‚Äì early 1st century AD) Princeton University Art Museum During the Hellenistic period, the Old Comedy of the Classical Era was replaced by New Comedy. The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright Menander. None of Menander's plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, The Bad-Tempered Man, has survived to the present day in a near-complete form. Most of another play entitled The Girl from Samos and large portions of another five have also survived.Konstan, David (2010). Menander of Athens. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 3‚Äì6. . = Historiography = The historian Timaeus was born in Sicily but spent most of his life in Athens.Baron, Christopher A. (2013). Timaeus of Tauromenium and Hellenistic Historiography. Cambridge University Press. His History, though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius. In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work. Timaeus also wrote the Olympionikai, a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games.Brown, Truesdell S. (1958). Timaeus of Tauromenium. Berkeley: University of California Press. =Ancient Biography= Ancient biography, or bios, as distinct from modern biography, was a genre of Greek (and Roman) literature interested in describing the goals, achievements, failures, and character of ancient historical persons and whether or not they should be imitated. Authors of ancient bios, such as the works of Nepos and Plutarch's Parallel Lives imitated many of the same sources and techniques of the contemporary historiographies of ancient Greece, notably including the works of Herodotus and Thucydides. There were various forms of ancient biographies, including 1) philosophical biographies that brought out the moral character of their subject (such as Diogenes Laertius's Lives of Eminent Philosophers 2) literary biographies which discussed the lives of orators and poets (such as Philostratus's Lives of the Sophists) 3) school and reference biographies that offered a short sketch of someone including their ancestry, major events and accomplishments, and death, 4) autobiographies, commentaries and memoirs where the subject presents his own life and 5) historical/political biography focusing on the lives of those active in the military, among other categories.Marincola, John, ed. A companion to Greek and Roman historiography. John Wiley & Sons, 2010, 528-531. = Science and mathematics = The Archimedes Palimpsest revealed works by Archimedes previously thought to have been lost. Eratosthenes of Alexandria ( 276 BC ‚Äì 195/194 BC), wrote on astronomy and geography, but his work is known mainly from later summaries. He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference. Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and Archimedes has been preserved. Euclid is known for his Elements, much of which was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus. The Elements is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics. From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present. Among them are Measurement of the Circle, in which he worked out the value of pi; The Method of Mechanical Theorems, on his work in mechanics; The Sand Reckoner; and On Floating Bodies. A manuscript of his works is currently being studied. = Prose fiction = Very little has survived of prose fiction from the Hellenistic Era. The Milesiaka by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC. The Milesiaka itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived. The book established a whole new genre of so-called \\"Milesian tales,\\" of which The Golden Ass by the later Roman writer Apuleius is a prime example.

Brill Studies in Middle Eastern Literatures, 30 (Leiden: Brill, 2003), p. 1. were probably both written during the late first century BC or early first century AD, during the latter part of the Hellenistic Era. The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal the existence of a genre of ancient Greek picaresque novel.  Roman period  While the transition from city-state to empire affected philosophy a great deal, shifting the emphasis from political theory to personal ethics, Greek letters continued to flourish both under the Successors (especially the Ptolemies) and under Roman rule. Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well. A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The New Testament, written by various authors in varying qualities of Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul. = Poetry = The Mykonos vase, one of the earliest surviving depictions of the myth of the Trojan Horse, a myth which is described in depth in Quintus of Smyrna's Posthomerica The poet Quintus of Smyrna, who probably lived during the late fourth century AD,Thomas Christian Tychsen, Quinti Smyrnaei Posthomericorum libri XIV.

He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168. In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus. He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage. He was with Scipio at the destruction of Carthage in 146. Diodorus Siculus was a Greek historian who lived in the 1st century BC, around the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He wrote a universal history, Bibliotheca Historica, in 40 books. Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain. The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era. The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France.Sacks, Kenneth S. (1990). Diodorus Siculus and the First Century. Princeton University Press. . Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the first century BC. His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched. He also wrote a number of other treatises, including On Imitation, Commentaries on the Ancient Orators, and On the Arrangement of Words.T. Hidber. Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece (p.229). Routledge 31 Oct 2013, 832 pages, , (editor N. Wilson). Retrieved 2015-09-07. The historians Appian of Alexandria and Arrian of Nicomedia both lived in the second century AD. Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Arrian served in the Roman army. His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life. Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the Diatribai, based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus. Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119. His Parallel Lives of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published. His other surviving work is the Moralia, a collection of essays on ethical, religious, political, physical, and literary topics.\\"Plutarch\\". Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy.Stadter, Philip A.

Diogenes La√´rtius, who lived in the third century AD, wrote Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, a voluminous collection of biographies of nearly every Greek philosopher who ever lived. Unfortunately, Diogenes La√´rtius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable. Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers.\\"Diogenes La√´rtius\\", The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 2013 His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved. His biography of Epicurus, for instance, is of particularly high quality and contains three lengthy letters attributed to Epicurus himself, at least two of which are generally agreed to be authentic. Another major philosopher of his period was Plotinus. He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called Neoplatonism.Philip Merlan, From Platonism to Neoplatonism (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3. His Enneads had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century.Detlef Thiel: Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: Der Aufstieg zum Einen. Plotinus's philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of nous, psyche, and the \\"One.\\" After the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism.New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge 3rd ed. 1914. Pg 284 Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was even able to hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise Contra Celsum. = Prose fiction = Marc Gabriel Charles Gleyre depicting a scene from Daphnis and Chloe The Roman Period was the time when the majority of extant works of Greek prose fiction were composed.

Daphnis and Chloe, by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos. The Wonders Beyond Thule by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date. The Wonders Beyond Thule has not survived in its complete form, but a very lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived.J.R. Morgan. Lucian's True Histories and the Wonders Beyond Thule of Antonius Diogenes. The Classical Quarterly (New Series), 35, pp 475‚Äì490 . The Ephesian Tale by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD. Illustration from 1894 by William Strang depicting a battle scene from Book One of Lucian of Samosata's A True Story The satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD. Lucian's works were incredibly popular during antiquity. Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day.Moeser, Marion (Dec 15, 2002). The Anecdote in Mark, the Classical World and the Rabbis: A Study of Brief Stories in the Demonax, The Mishnah, and Mark 8:27‚Äì10:45. A&C; Black. p. 88. . Retrieved 16 September 2016. Almost all of Lucian's works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time. His book The Syrian Goddess, however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus.Lightfoot, De Dea Syria (2003)Lucinda Dirven, \\"The Author of De Dea Syria and his Cultural Heritage\\", Numen 44.2 (May 1997), pp. 153‚Äì179. Lucian's most famous work is the novel A True Story, which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction.Greg Grewell: \\"Colonizing the Universe: Science Fictions Then, Now, and in the (Imagined) Future\\", Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 55, No. 2 (2001), pp. 25‚Äì47 (30f.)Fredericks, S.C.: \\"Lucian's True History as SF\\", Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49‚Äì60 His dialogue The Lover of Lies contains several of the earliest known ghost stories\\"The Doubter\\" by Lucian in Roger Lancelyn Green (1970) Thirteen Uncanny Tales.

The Ancient Novel. 1995. p. 78 It tells the story of a young Ethiopian princess named Chariclea, who is estranged from her family and goes on many misadventures across the known world.Bowersock, Glanwill W. The Aethiopica of Heliodorus and the Historia Augusta. In: Historiae Augustae Colloquia n.s. 2, Colloquium Genevense 1991. p. 43. Of all the ancient Greek novels, the one that attained the greatest level of popularity was the Alexander Romance, a fictionalized account of the exploits of Alexander the Great written in the third century AD. Eighty versions of it have survived in twenty-four different languages, attesting that, during the Middle Ages, the novel was nearly as popular as the Bible. Versions of the Alexander Romance were so commonplace in the fourteenth century that Geoffrey Chaucer wrote that \\"...every wight that hath discrecioun / Hath herd somwhat or al of [Alexander's] fortune.\\"  Legacy  Hero Mourns the Dead Leander by Gillis Backereel (1640s) Ancient Greek literature has had an enormous impact on western literature as a whole. Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature. These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics. Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later Greek literature. For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work Hero and Leander, written by Musaeus Grammaticus.English translations of Musaeus Grammaticus' Hero and Leander: The Divine Poem of Musaeus: First of All Books Translated According to the Original (George Chapman, 1616); Hero & Leander (E.E. Sikes, 1920) Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works. The Roman poet Vergil, for instance, modeled his epic poem The Aeneid on The Iliad and The Odyssey. During the Middle Ages, ancient Greek literature was largely forgotten in Western Europe. The medieval writer Roger Bacon wrote that \\"there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars.\\" It was not until the Renaissance that Greek writings were rediscovered by western European scholars.Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society, Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C. Jacob, James R. Jacob, 2008, 903 pages, p.261/262. During the Renaissance, Greek began to be taught in western European colleges and universities for the first time, which resulted in western European scholars rediscovering the literature of ancient Greece.Reynolds and Wilson, pp. 119, 131. The Textus Receptus, the first New Testament printed in the original Greek, was published in 1512 by the Italian humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus.W. W. Combs, Erasmus and the textus receptus, DBSJ 1 (Spring 1996), 45. Erasmus also published Latin translations of classical Greek texts, including a Latin translation of Hesiod's Works and Days. The influence of classical Greek literature on modern literature is also evident. Numerous figures from classical literature and mythology appear throughout The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. Plutarch's Lives were a major influence on William Shakespeare and served as the main source behind his tragedies Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus. Shakespeare's comedies A Comedy of Errors and The Twelfth Night drew heavily on themes from Graeco-Roman New Comedy. Meanwhile, Shakespeare's tragedy Timon of Athens was inspired by a story written by LucianArmstrong, A. Macc. \\"Timon of Athens - A Legendary Figure?\\", Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., Vol. 34, No. 1 (April 1987), pp. 7‚Äì11 and his comedy Pericles, Prince of Tyre was based on an adaptation of the ancient Greek novel Apollonius of Tyre found in John Gower's Confessio Amantis. Page from an Arabic translation of Aristotle's Poetics by Ab≈´ Bishr MattƒÅ John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost is written using a similar style to the two Homeric epics. It also makes frequent allusions to figures from classical literature and mythology, using them as symbols to convey a Christian message. Lucian's A True Story was part of the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels. Bulfinch's Mythology, a book on Greek mythology published in 1867 and aimed at a popular audience, was described by Carl J. Richard as \\"one of the most popular books ever published in the United States\\".Richard, Carl J., The Golden Age of the Classics in America, Harvard University Press, 2009, page 33. George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion is a modern, rationalized retelling of the ancient Greek legend of Pygmalion. James Joyce's novel Ulysses, heralded by critics as one of the greatest works of modern literature, (review of Danius book). is a retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in modern-day Dublin.Ellmann, Richard. James Joyce. Oxford University Press, revised edition (1983). The mid-twentieth-century British author Mary Renault wrote a number of critically acclaimed novels inspired by ancient Greek literature and mythology, including The Last of the Wine and The King Must Die. Even in works that do not consciously draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: catharsis, ethos, anagnorisis, hamartia, hubris, mimesis, mythos, nemesis, and peripeteia.

Officially she was rebuilt from the first Vanguard, but likely only shared some of the timber and fittings from the previous ship. By 1660, her armament had been increased to 56 guns. She took part in both the First and Second Dutch Wars. The ship served as the flagship for General at Sea George Monck at the Battle of Portland in 1653, and of Vice-Admiral Joseph Jordan at the Battle of the Gabbard and the Battle of Scheveningen later the same year. She also took part in several actions of the Second Dutch War, including the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665 and the Four Days Battle and St James's Day Fight in 1666. In 1667 Vanguard was scuttled to form a barrier in the River Medway to prevent the Dutch fleet from capturing or burning the British ships there. She was subsequently sold.

It blends into the Halton Moor/Osmondthorpe area and is 1 mile to the east of Leeds city centre in the LS9 Leeds postcode area. General description The area is situated in the vicinity of the A64 York Road, east Leeds' main thoroughfare, and is also home to a large park dating back from Victorian times which was purchased by Leeds City Council in the late 19th century, when it was waste land. Housing in the area is made up of nineteenth-century through terraced housing, some back-to- back terraced housing. Semi-detached and detached houses are also found in the area. Many of the back-to-back terraced houses in the area were due to be demolished as part of the ¬£1.3 billion EASEL regeneration scheme in east and south east Leeds. However these plans were withdrawn in 2010 with Leeds City Council citing the recession debilitating the private sector's ability to build as the main reason.http://www.leeds.gov.uk/council/Pages/EASEL-Area- Action-Plan.aspx File:Victoria Grove.jpgOlder street-fronted terrace File:Back Terraces, East End Park 13 August 2017.jpgRear gardens of terrace houses File:Terraces in East End Park 13 August 2017.jpgBack-to-back terraces File:Nixon Avenue 13 August 2017.jpgSemi-detached houses File:East End Park North End 13 August 2017.jpgOld and new houses by the park File:Charlton Road 15 August 2017.jpgCharlton Road, one of several streets with Charlton in the name.

It is bounded on the north by the A6120 (Weetwood Ring Road), on the west by the A660 (Otley Road), on the east by Meanwood Beck and to the south by Hollin Lane. Weetwood Lane runs north and south through it. The area lends its name to and sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council, which is also part of Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. Politics The Weetwood ward for local government purposes includes areas known as Far Headingley (south of the above), West Park (west of the A660), Ireland Wood (north of the A6120), and Tinshill. Its three Leeds City Councillors and the terms for which they are currently elected, are Jonathan Bentley (Liberal Democrat, 2018-2022), Christine Knight (Labour Party, 2018-2020) and James Gibson (Labour Party, 2018-2019).

For most of this time the land was owned by Kirkstall monastery. Following the dissolution of the monasteries, the area went into private hands, notably the Foxcroft family who held it from 1583 until 1741, building a manor house, Weetwood Hall in 1625. The Meanwood Beck provided power for Weetwood mill and Walley's tannery from 1656 to 1820. In the Middle Ages Weetwood Lane was the principal route between Adel and Leeds, and particularly to the market in Headingley. The construction of the Leeds to Otley Turnpike (now the A660 Otley Road) in 1741 provided a faster link so that residences began to be built, particularly after 1840. In June 1853 Ann Husler inherited Weetwood Quarry from her husband, and ran it successfully until her death in 1874. Buildings =Weetwood Hall= Weetwood Hall is now a hotel and conference centre, which includes a manor house and buildings of the same name dating back to 1625. It is a Grade II* Listed building of local gritstone ashlar. The porch is of Classical design, with widely spaced Ionic columns, and the interior has elaborately plastered ceilings. It was taken over by the University of Leeds in 1919 and was a hall of residence until 1993, when it took on its present role after extensive re- development. =Fox Hill= Fox Hill is the name of a hill, a hall which stands on it, and a residential area within Weetwood.

Kissinger called Hoover to find out who might have leaked this information to the press. Hoover suggested Halperin, and Kissinger agreed that was likely. That day, the FBI began tapping Halperin's phones at Kissinger's direction. (Kissinger says nothing of this in his memoirs and mentions Halperin in passing about four times.) The Nixon administration bugged Halperin's home phone, without a warrant, for 21 months starting in 1969. Halperin also ended up on Nixon's Enemies List of 20 people with whom the White House was unhappy with because they disagreed in some way with the administration. Halperin was number 8 on the list. Nixon aide Charles Colson, who compiled the list, wrote next to Halperin's name, \\"a scandal would be helpful here.\\" Defense Secretary Robert MacNamara asked Halperin to oversee the production of the Pentagon Papers. Les Gelb, a member of Halperin's staff, oversaw the staff that actually wrote the study. Halperin was a friend of Daniel Ellsberg. When Ellsberg was investigated in connection with the Pentagon Papers, suspicion fell on Halperin, who some Nixon aides believed had kept classified documents when he left government service. The tapping of Halperin's phone without a warrant was discovered when it came out in Ellsberg's trial. Despite the continued use of the wiretap well after Halperin left government, Kissinger told reporters on May 13, 1973, that, \\"I never received any information that cast any doubt on [Halperin's] loyalty and discretion.\\" Halperin sued in federal court. Halperin won a symbolic $1 judgment in 1977 for the offense, but the judgment was overturned by an appeals court.United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. - 606 F.2d 1192, http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate- courts/F2/606/1192/441367/ In 1991, Kissinger apologized to Halperin in a letter and the suit was dropped at Halperin's request in 1992.  Positions between government service  After leaving the Nixon administration, Halperin joined the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow from 1969 to 1973 and then became the research director for the Project on Information, National Security and Constitutional Procedures at the Twentieth Century Fund from 1974 to 1975. He was the director for the Project on National Security and Civil Liberties from 1975 to 1977. From 1977 to 1992, he served as the director of the Center for National Security Studies (jointly sponsored by the Fund for Peace and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation. And from 1992 to 1994, he was a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)  From 1984 to 1992, Halperin served as director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) office in Washington. While at the ACLU, Halperin, along with Jerry Berman, also at the ACLU, worked with President Reagan's CIA Director William Casey to agree on language in the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, which has successfully protected journalists publishing the names of covert agents. He also worked on a number of civil rights bills, including an immigration reform bill in 1986, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, and the American Disabilities Act of 1990. http://pando.com/2015/02/07/how-the-aclu-ron-paul-and-a-former-eff- director-helped-jail-a-cia-whistleblower/, Mark Ames, pandodaily, February 7, 2015 He defended the right of The Progressive magazine to publish a description of the design principle of a thermonuclear weapon (H-Bomb).  Clinton administration  At the start of the Clinton administration, Halperin was appointed as a consultant to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (1993). President Clinton nominated Halperin for the position of assistant secretary of defense for democracy and peacekeeping, but the Senate never considered his nomination and, after Secretary of Defense Les Aspin resigned, Halperin withdrew his name. Clinton then named him to be a Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Democracy at the National Security Council (1994‚Äì1996). Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appointed him to the position of Director of Policy Planning at the State Department (1998‚Äì2001) in Clinton's second term. Halperin focused on several issues of interest to Secretary Albright, including democracy promotion (the Community of Democracies and inauguration of the four priority democracies); nuclear issues; a review of the way that the United States responds to humanitarian disasters overseas; and northeast Asian security. He also was integrally involved in managing the crises in Kosovo and East Timor.  Post-Clinton administration  Following his service in the Clinton Administration, Halperin joined the Council on Foreign Relations (2001-2002) as senior fellow and director, Center for Democracy and Free Markets. Halperin created the Open Society Foundations' office in Washington, D.C., and oversaw all policy advocacy on U.S. and international issues, including promotion of human rights and support for open societies abroad. He was the director of the Washington office for the Open Society Institute (now the Open Society Foundations) from 2002 to 2005 and the director of U.S. advocacy from 2005 to 2008. He was the executive director of the Open Society Policy Center from 2002 to 2008. He also was a senior vice president at the Center for American Progress from 2003 to 2005 and a senior fellow at CAP from 2003 to 2009. He currently is a senior advisor to the Open Society Foundations.  Obama administration  President Obama nominated Halperin to serve on the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2012 and again in 2015, and he was twice confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Books  Halperin is a prolific author and co-author of 25 books, including Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy. The first edition of Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy is one of the most successful Brookings titles of all time. He also authored Strategy and Arms Control (with Thomas C. Schelling); Limited War in the Nuclear Age; and Contemporary Military Strategy.  Awards  Halperin has won numerous awards, including: *Meritorious Civilian Service Award, Department of Defense, January 1969 *Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award, Playboy Foundation, July 1981 *Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal, Yale Graduate School Alumni Association, June 1983 *Fellow, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, June 1985, June 1990 *John Jay Award, Columbia College, 1986 *Public Service Award, Federation of American Scientists, December 1998 *National Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame, March 2006 In 1985 he won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship. He was a partial writer of The Lawless State, which documents the surveillance techniques and crimes of the U.S. government during the Cold War.  Boards  Halperin is the chairman of the Community of Democracies, Civil Society Pillar International Steering Committee and he is chairman of the board of JStreet. He also serves on the boards of ONE and ONE Action.

She was the first of a new type of sailing battleship: a Symondite. Construction The Vanguard was designed by John Edye, Chief Clerk in the Surveyor's Office,Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p72. to the directions of the Surveyor, Captain Sir William Symonds. The Vanguard was the first of a class of eleven. She was ordered from Pembroke Yard in June 1832; HMS Collingwood was ordered 'as a duplicate frame using the moulds of Vanguard, to test the efficacy of an American scheme whereby duplicate frames were stored for many years.'Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p158. Vanguard was laid down in May 1833; she required 60 skilled men for 16 weeks to set up the frame. She was launched on schedule in August 1835. At the time she was the broadest ship ever built in England.Brown, Before the Ironclad, p39. 'Vanguard cost ¬£56,983 to build, and a further ¬£20,756 to fit for sea.'Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p159, Admiralty to Surveyor 11 April 1842 - UK National Archives ADM 83/86. Her construction used 3,560 loads of timber and required 186 man-years.Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p159. Characteristics of Symondite warships Warships designed to the ideas of Captain Sir William Symonds (1782‚Äì1856) are known as Symondite warships, although the adjective has no official use as terminology. His intention was to give the Royal Navy an advantage in speed (under certain weather conditions), allowing it to force action.Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p71. Symondite warships were very broad, and had a sharp 'V'-shaped hull-form.There is a midship section model of Vanguard in the Science Museum in London. A photograph of this model is in: Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p158. (Preceding designs had a 'U'-shaped hull form.) * Their wide beam gave them very high stability, which allowed them to carry nearly twice the power of sail as vessels of the old type.Comments by Admiral John Hayes summarised in Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p159. Unfortunately the Surveyor's department was understaffed,Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p32 & 72. with the result that their stability was over- done. Symondite warships rolled quickly, heavily and sometimes unevenly. This made them poor gun platforms. The rapid rolling also caused the rigging to wear out more quickly than on previous designs.Brown, Before the Ironclad, p38-41. * Because Symondite warships got their stability from their great beam, they did not need to carry so much iron ballast as previous designs. * Their 'V'-shaped hull with its steeply rising floors was inconvenient for carrying stores.Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p161. * They had higher and wider gun decks than preceding designs. This gave the gun crews more space to work in, improving efficiency. It also helped their sailing performance, because they were carrying fewer guns for their size. * They had an excessively raked stern. In some ships, modifications to their sterns to remedy defects in the original design left \\"the stern timbers badly arranged, weakly supported and held together with iron straps.\\" The Symondite stern \\"lacked the defensive strength of the true round stern. There was simply too much glass to offer any protection to the crews of the stern battery in action.\\"Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p80. There is a model of the Albion's stern in the Science Museum in London. Symondite warships were very sensitive to how they were stowed.'It may do very well for a yacht to require as nice trimming and handling as Albion seems to do, when they are only running a race from Cowes and back, but it is a serious drawback in a two decker.' Sir Charles Wood to Lord Minto 30 November 1844 (Papers of Lord Minto, National Library of Scotland), quoted in Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p82. If trimmed carefully, they were fast in moderate winds, thought they did not do as well as preceding designs in head seas, or rough seas.Brown, Before the Ironclad, p38-41. Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p161-2. Compared with previous designs, Symondite warships required 19% more loads of wood and 30% more man-hours to build.Lambert, Battleships in Transition p66. Some of the Symondite warships were converted to steam in the 1850s (though not Vanguard). Their 'V'-shaped hull made it difficult to add a steam engine and boilers and to store coal.For instance, the Symondite 3-decker Queen had less space below the orlop than the slightly smaller Trafalgar (an earlier design). Lambert, Battleships in Transition p17. The extra weight was low in the ship, exacerbating their excess stability, which made their rolling even worse than before.Lambert, Battleships in Transition p63. (In fairness, at the time they were designed, it was never anticipated that they would be converted to steam.) Service Life Vanguard in Malta Harbour in 1837, with Medea and Barham Vanguard was commissioned in 1837 by Captain Sir Thomas Fellowes, with the normal picked complement of officers, including Baldwin Walker as First LieutenantWhilst Lambert claims that Walker was First Lieutenant (The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p159), an online biography of Walker states that Walker had been promoted to commander on 15 July 1834, and was commander (i.e. executive officer or 2nd in command) on Vanguard from 1 September 1836 until 24 November 1838 (Online biography of Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker (1802-1876)) and Mr Miller, one of Symonds's favourite sailing masters. The object was clear. Symonds wanted his ships to be tried by men capable of making the best of their qualities... Out in the Mediterranean Vanguard soon made a name for herself as the fastest ship in the fleet, with the handiness of a frigate when beat out of Grand Harbour [Malta].' At the end of her first three-year commission Captain Fellowes wrote that Vanguard had 'great stability' was 'very easy at sea and works less than ships of her class' and had 'great advantage in all points of sailing.'Fellowes to Admiral Sir E Codrington C-in-C Portsmouth 29 Mar 1840 - UK National Archives ADM 87/10, quoted in Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p159. On the night of 30 January 1838, Vanguard was at Malta under the command of Captain Sir Thomas Fellowes. The ship's First Lieutenant, C.M.M. Wright, ordered the Assistant Surgeon, Robert Thomas Charles Scott, to stomach-pump a drunken seaman. Scott expressed the medical opinion that a stomach-pump should not be administered. Wright ordered him to give it anyway as a punishment and reminded Scott that it was an order he had received. A short while later Wright ordered Scott to do the same to another seaman. The next morning Scott reported the matter to Commander Baldwin Walker who reported Scott to the Captain for disrespect and disobedience of a lawful order. Captain Fellowes threatened Scott with a court martial and reported him to Sir William Burnett, the Physician-General of the Navy. When this affair became public knowledge, an Admiralty Order was issued banning the use of a stomach-pump as a punishment. Captain David Dunn commanded Vanguard from 2 April 1843 to August 1843. Vanguard again served in the Mediterranean (including operations on the coast of Syria in 1840), and off Lisbon. In October 1843 Vanguard was out of commission at Devonport.Online history of HMS Vanguard (1835) On 4 February 1845, Vanguard was commissioned by Captain George Wickens Willes, and served in the Channel Squadron, the 1845 and 1846 Evolutionary Squadrons, and in Mediterranean. In the first trial of the Evolutionary Squadron of 1845, Vanguard (Captain George Willes) and her sister Superb (Captain Anwar Lowry Corry) were the slowest battleships in the squadron. The Surveyor (Symonds) thought that they had been badly stowed and needed recoppering. Once this was done they performed well. Vanguard's captain wrote: 'such an entire change has taken place in her motion at sea, steering and working generally (although she is still deficient in her weights low down) that I can scarcely bring myself to believe she is the same ship.'Willes to Admiralty 17 November 1845, quoted in Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p161. Vanguard was refitted after the 1845 trials (as were Superb and Canopus). In the August 1846 trials, Vanguard and Canopus were 'nearly alike in performance, with the former superior in smooth water, and the latter in rough.'Lambert, The Last Sailing Battlefleet, p162. (The significance of Canopus is that she was regarded as one of the best of the previous type of 84-gun two-deckers.) In May 1846 Evolutionary Squadron exercised firing the stern batteries. This was a rare occurrence and reflects no credit on any of the two-deckers: *Vanguard took ten minutes to clear for action and then fired two rounds from each stern gun. However the extreme overhang of the stern prevented the muzzles running clear, with the result that there was a minor fire. *Superb took 15 minutes to clear for action plus an hour to remove her sashes, and then was able to fire without incident. *Canopus was excused firing altogether. Captain Willes died on 26 October 1847. Captain George Frederick Rich commanded Vanguard in the Mediterranean from 6 November 1847 until Vanguard paid off in March 1849. Vanguard did not see service during the Crimean War. Unlike most members of the Vanguard-class, Vanguard was not converted to steam.Lambert, Battleships in Transition Vanguard's last commission was as Coast Guard at Kingston from 18 February 1861 to March 1862, commanded by Commanded by Captain Edmund Heathcote. Vanguard was renamed Ajax in 1867, to allow her former name to be given to an ironclad battleship then being laid down in the ways. Ajax (ex-Vanguard) was broken up in 1875.

The area sits in the Moortown ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency. Origins and history The name Meanwood goes back to the 12th century, and is of Anglo-Saxon derivation: the Meene wude was the boundary wood of the Manor of Alreton, the woods to the east of Meanwood Beck.W. A. Hopwood (1981) Meanwood (private publication) Dwellings and farms near the wood were known by a variety of names including Meanwoodside until 27 August 1847 when the parish of Meanwood was established and the woods became known Meanwood Woods. A skirmish, between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces, took place in Meanwood, during the Civil War. It is said that the \\"beck ran red\\", with the blood of the fallen, hence, the place name \\"Stainbeck\\".Leeds Mercury 22 September 1888 Local Notes and Queries no 507: Meanwood Valley The Meanwood Valley was a place of industry as long ago as 1577 and it continued to the 19th century. The Meanwood Beck provided water and power for corn, flax and paper mills, dye works and tanneries. There were numerous quarries. In 1830 a turnpike road was established through the Meanwood Valley to Leeds. Public transport followed from 1850 and electric trams in 1890, meaning that it was practical for people to travel to work from greater distances, encouraging both industrial buildings and housing. Geography and buildings =Tunnel How Hill= Tunnel How Hill, north of the Stonegate Road, \\"was reputed to be the highest point in Leeds.\\" A folly in the form of a ruined castle stood there from the 18th century until 1946, dedicated to King Alfred. Some streets adjacent to the hill are named after King Alfred. The hill was formerly known as Pen-how-fyn, and a hamlet below it was Paenfynaen (where fynaen means settlement). It was referred to as Penny Fun in the 19th century and several houses in the vicinity used the name.Leeds Mercury 29 May 1886 \\"Local Notes and Queries\\" The 1850 Ordnance Survey Map labels the settlement as Pen-y-ffynon.via digimap.edina.ac.uk (subscription required) A public house in the Moor Allerton District Centre was called the Penny Fun until 2020, when it was renamed. =Various Buildings= Sugarwell Court Former Baptist School The 1841 census listed 144 houses, including Carr House (Carr Manor), Meanwood Hall and Whalley House (now demolished). Most properties were stone cottages, now gone, with the exception of a few houses on Monkbridge Road. Hustler's Row remains as a group of 1850 stone cottages named after John Husler, a quarry owner.W. A. Hopwood & F. P. Casperson (1986) Meanwood - Village, Valley, Industry and People To the west along the road towards Meanwood Park are some houses built for tannery workers and the Meanwood Institute, built about 1820, but opened as the Institute in 1885, a Grade II listed building. Sugarwell Court on Meanwood Road, is the former Cliff Tannery, an 1866 Grade II listed building converted into a university hall of residence. Nearby is a former Baptist school, a brick Grade II listed building dating from about 1886.Leeds Mercury 6 April 1886 Leeds and Yorkshire Architectural Association Meanwood Tannery blue plaque There are a number of 19th-century industrial buildings in Meanwood Valley along the Meanwood Beck, and 19th century terraced housing on the valley side leading to Headingley, Weetwood and Woodhouse, along with an area of woodland known locally as the Ridge. New estates have been built with grand, suburban housing, the Woodleas, the Stonegates and the Bowoods. 20th century council housing mixed with open space forms the opposite side of the valley leading up to Scott Hall. There is a shopping centre opposite a Waitrose Food & Home store on Green Road, near the site of a tannery which is believed to date from 1700. =Meanwood Hall= Meanwood Hall Meanwood Hall is a grade II listed building. It was built about 1762 for Thomas Denison, extended in 1814 for Joseph Lees, and further developed in 1834 for Christopher Beckett. In 1919 it was bought by the city council to form the nucleus of Meanwood Park Hospital which accommodated men, women and children with learning disabilities. It served the city of Leeds and other areas of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and at its maximum extent in the 1960s had 841 beds. After the hospital closed in 1997, the hall was converted to housing, and further housing developments now fill the hospital grounds. =Meanwood Towers= Meanwood Towers, in 2017 In the middle of an estate of inter-war semi-detached houses behind Stonegate Road stands a Victorian Gothic house, Meanwood Towers. Designed by Edward Welby Pugin, and built in 1866-67. A private house, it was commissioned by Thomas Stuart Kennedy and was originally called Meanwood House. Kennedy commissioned the German organ- builder Edmund Schulze to build him a pipe organ. In 1869, it was installed in a specially-built 800-seat wooden concert hall or 'organ house'. After eight years, there were problems with the organ house and the Schulze organ was loaned to St. Peter's Church, Harrogate and two years later, in 1879, it was sold and presented to St. Bartholomew's Church, Armley.Brief History of the Armley-Schulze Organ In keeping with its grand design, the house was built with tall chimneys, but in 1969 these were shortened for safety reasons. Most of the original house survives, but converted into flats. =Carr Manor= Carr Manor was a 17th-century manor house sometimes known as Carr House. It was greatly extended 1880-81 by architect Edward Schroeder Prior for Thomas Clifford Allbutt. It was used by the City of Leeds as a residence for judges during trials at Leeds Crown Court, but is now private dwellings.Leodis photographic archive of Leeds Carr Manor Carr Manor gives its name to a 1950s estate of private housesLeodis Carr Manor housing estate, aerial view and a primary and high school.

The area also hosted Sugarwell Hill Mill which had a distinctive round chimney. Farm Hill estate In 1919, 80 acres of land to the south of Meanwood, close to Woodhouse Ridge, was sold by the Model Farm to Leeds Corporation. The Farm Hill housing estate was developed on the land. The area was often referred to informally as the 'white houses' because of the colour the concrete was rendered. The estate became a concentration of bad press for Meanwood very quickly. Most of the original houses were demolished in the late 1980s and many of the residents were moved to the Beckhill estate. The opening credits to police drama Parkin's Patch began with a scene shot at Farm Hill. View of Farm Hill Way and Boothroyd Drive, showing the Model Farm towards the bottom left. Meanwood Cricket Club can also be seen. The area was redeveloped in 1990 as a series of two- and three-bedroom semi-detached houses and bungalows, around half of which are privately owned. A few of the original 1920s houses remain on the fringes of the estate. The Model Farm, after which the hillside and estate is named, is still standing today (situated off Farm Hill South) with a number of fields used as pasture for horses. Many of the streets in the area are still known as Farm Hill. The estate also hosts the much newer Meanwood Valley Urban Farm. A network of woodland and field footpaths connect the estate to Potternewton Lane, Buslingthorpe Lane and Woodhouse Ridge. In 2000, a further estate of residential houses was built on the opposite side of Meanwood Road, centred around Boothroyd Drive. Although the Farm Hills and Boothroyd Drive are contiguous, Meanwood Road divides the older and new estates and represents a political and postal boundary. Houses on the Farm Hill have an LS7 postcode, whilst houses on the south side of Meanwood Road have an LS6 postcode. Woodhouse Community Sports and Social Club is sandwiched between the two developments (despite its name, the club house and pitches are in Meanwood, not Woodhouse). The club hosts cricket (Woodhouse Cricket Club) and amateur rugby league (both Headingley Hawks and Woodhouse Warriors). Religion The Church of England parish church is Holy Trinity Church,Holy Trinity Meanwood Church website a Grade II* listed building consecrated in 1849, designed by William Railton in the lancet Gothic style. Its clock was designed by Edmund Beckett and made by Edward John Dent, who was responsible for Big Ben. It has three faces, as there was open country to the east. The Methodist Church was built in 1881 in a modified Gothic style, and enlarged seven years later to accommodate a further 120 seats. A previous Methodist Church in Meanwood had been built in 1811. The church building was closed in October 2014 and the church community moved to use the Holy Trinity Church building.Meanwood MC (at Holy Trinity , accessed 1 December 2015 The building is now used by the Iglesia ni Cristo.Iglesia ni Cristo Directory: Leeds, accessed 7 July 2017 St Oswald's Church was built in 1890 as a chapel of ease for St Chad's of Far Headingley.

This photo of a YMCA camp shows campers in a lake. A summer camp or sleepaway camp is a supervised program for children or teenagers conducted during the summer months in some countries. Children and adolescents who attend summer camp are known as campers. Summer school is usually a part of the academic curriculum for a student to make up work not accomplished during the academic year (summer camps can include academic work, but is not a requirement for graduation). The traditional view of a summer camp as a woody place with hiking, canoeing, and campfires is changing, with greater acceptance of newer types of summer camps that offer a wide variety of specialized activities. For example, there are camps for the performing arts, music, magic, computer programming, language learning, mathematics, children with special needs, and weight loss. In 2006, the American Camp Association reported that 75 percent of camps added new programs. This is largely to counter a trend in decreasing enrollment in summer camps, which some argue to have been brought about by smaller family sizes and the growth in supplemental educational programs. There are also religiously affiliated summer camps, such as those run by Christian groups and various denominations of Judaism. The primary purpose of many camps is educational, athletic, or cultural development. A summer camp environment may allow children to learn new skills in a safe and nurturing environment. Summer camp experience can have a lasting psychological impact on the development of a child. A group of summer camp attendees make music with alt= Girls' camps in the United States began to appear around 1900; many of the early camps were located in New England. In 1900, there were fewer than 100 camps in the United States, but by 1918 over 1000 were in operation. Early camps for girls were located in remote, natural areas, and many camps featured a water venue. There were outdoor activities such as canoeing, archery, and hiking. Other types of popular instruction involved handcrafts, dramatics, camp and fire-making. Campers slept in wigwams, tents, or open dormitories. Any of these options encouraged a camper to take responsibility for maintaining her own personal space and to develop self-sufficiency. Mimicking Native American traditions such as council fires and storytelling generated a sense of community and inspired campers to become conscientious members of a group. Typically, girl campers wore their hair in a version of native style. Uniforms were standard in most camps, but braided hair and headbands were common attire for campers. For camp ceremonies and pageants, girls would dress in special Native inspired dresses, at times even contributing to the handiwork. In this era, camps were considered to be a natural pathway for young girls to develop healthy bodies, self-assurance and a sense of community. Today's girls' camps offer many activities, such as STEM Camps, sailing, and dramatic arts.  Organization  In most camps, young adult or teenage supervisors are called counselors or \\"cabin leaders\\". In many camps, counselors are assigned to small groups of campers, called \\"bunks\\", \\"huts\\", \\"cabins\\", or \\"units\\", who participate in activities as a group, such as campfires, hiking, canoeing, swimming, nature lore, and arts and crafts. Counselors often share living accommodations with their group. In the United States, counselors for residential camps are typically drawn from older teens and college-aged adults (early 20s) because of the temporary, seasonal and low-paying aspects of the work. International staff are often hired alongside their American counterparts through agencies who vet the staff beforehand. Overall camp supervision is typically done by older camp directors, who lead a team that includes cooks, sports instructors, a nurse, maintenance personnel and counselors. The director and the maintenance personnel have a longer-term affiliation with the summer camp. Professional camp staff organize the preparation of facilities and supplies for the camp season and supervise the maintenance of the camp during the off- season. Camp directors conduct the hiring of seasonal counselors, instructors, and support staff, often during job fairs held on campuses or on online job boards. At some camps, all campers stay overnight in cabins and eat all their meals in a cafeteria. At some camps, also known as day camps, the campers go home each night. Some other camps allow both day and overnight campers. In the US, residential camps that have overnight facilities are sometimes called \\"sleepaway camps\\". Summer camp is often the first time that children spend an extended period of time away from home. The practice of running residential holidays for children away from their own home seems to have originated in Appenzell in the Alps in 1876, when Pastor Bion set up holiday camps in which children made tree-houses, sang songs, did drama, made kites and had adventure games. Post-war France used Pastor Bion's model to take children who had grown up during the war years, away from cities, and their scheme ‚Äòcolonies de vacances‚Äô became state-controlled, part of their state education system for all children. The American camps developed from a very different cultural root. Educational camps Young girls learning how to make a bed at a \\"vacation school\\" in the late 1890s, what in modern terminology would probably be a summer camp. In the United States, there are numerous models of camp with an educational focus that cater to students with differing ages and academic interest. =College credit courses= Some camps offer students the opportunity to explore a pre-college experience. Typically, students entering grades 10 through 12 stay in the college dormitories and attend summer classes run by college faculty. At the successful completion of a summer program, course credits are awarded, which in turn are accepted by most tertiary institutions. Typically, colleges in the United States and Canada offer these programs, as it serves as an introduction to students to entice them to attend the college as full-time students based upon a memorable summer experience. A camper launches a model rocket at Starbase Kelly at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, Aug. 10, 2007. Starbase Kelly, sponsored by the 433red Airlift Wing of the U.S. Air Force, is a five-day camp focused on providing fourth, fifth and sixth-graders with education on math, science and technology during the summer. =Non-college credit courses= Some camps, such as CTY and Duke TIP, are focused primarily on education or on educational-related activities, such as debate, history, or journalism. These camps are often run by colleges or universities, and are usually for children in junior or senior high school. Instruction in debate and speech is also available for middle school students and incoming high school students all over the country. Educational summer camps are different from summer schools as the summer camps often are not offered for school credit, and often have a significant focus on non-academic activities. Students for these programs are often invited or recruited. Many of these camps, such as Canada/USA Mathcamp and SSP, focus on a specific subject, such as mathematics or astronomy. These camps tend to have selective application processes involving problem solving or an essay about the applicant's interest in the subject. =Academic adventure camps= These provide high school students with the opportunity to study academic topics on a summer adventure travel program, typically in the wilderness or a foreign country. Many include community service as a component of the course. Others also offer college credit with the successful completion of the program. =SAT preparation courses= Various camp programs offer preparation for the SAT Reasoning Test as part of a mixture of academic learning with summer fun. Often the SAT preparation is offered as a full morning immersion while the afternoons and evenings are geared towards homework and recreational activities. These camp programs often outsource their SAT component from test preparation companies like The Princeton Review or Kaplan who provide the teachers and resources. =Enrichment courses= These programs offer a wide range of classes that may have little or no scholastic overlap but are taught with the purpose of broadening the student's conception and interest in many otherwise unknown areas of study. Students typically explore subjects like photography, community service, drama, magic, scuba diving, video production, comic book design, crime scene forensics, cooking, yoga, and similar areas. =Science and nature= Summer camps provide opportunities for children to learn hands-on. One of the oldest and longest-running science camps is the International Astronomical Youth Camp (IAYC) which began in 1969. So far, IAYCs have been held in 15 countries and have hosted 3,468 participants (~1,700 unique), from 81 nationalities worldwide.  Canada  Some well- known summer camps focusing on science and nature in Canada include Deep River Science Academy, Shad Valley, numerous university-sponsored and hosted day camps including the University of Toronto's Science Outreach, Space Camp Canada and the now defunct Algonquin Space Campus hosted at the Algonquin Radio Observatory. Safari Science is another camp that is located in Oakville Ontario and provides campers an adventure in learning about their world. =Tech camps= Participants at a robotics camp for children at Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City. Tech camps focus on technology education. These summer camps develop 21st-century skills in areas such as game design, 3D game creation, web design, graphic design, robot building, and programming languages. These summer camps are typically held on college campuses. Many universities now offer technology-focused camps in the summer as a way of reaching future students, generating revenue and providing community service outreach. =Language and foreign culture camps= To meet a growing demand for language education, language camps have developed around the United States. Many of these summer programs are hosted by high schools. Colleges and universities have also created camps using their facilities to host younger students. Foreign countries have established summer schools in the United States to offer education regarding their culture and language. The growing popularity of summer language camps may be related to a growing interest in languages not typically offered in United States high school curricula. Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, and Korean are examples of languages in- demand that do not often appear in a curriculum. Art and performing arts camps Other camps have become summer training grounds for a variety of arts. Many offer elective classes in a range of creative and performing arts activities including visual arts, music, theater, speech, debate, dance, circus arts, rock and roll, magic and other specialties. Some of these programs have a narrow focus on one particular area, while others offer a wide range of programs. Due to the popularity of these activities, many traditional camps have added some elements of the visual and performing arts into their programs as well. Oftentimes camps will have various totems or traditions that pass from one group of campers to the next, with each group adding something that denotes their time at the camp, often like a time capsule. Painted totems, wood carving, and show programs often accumulate as a sacred object that passes from one group to the next. Cheer camps have popularized the concept of a spirit stick. Performing art camps often run 3 or 4 week sessions that culminate in some sort of performance that parents and families attend. Sports camps Summer camps can be found that offer intensive instruction in almost any sport imaginable, or that offer quality instruction and competition in a wide range of sports. Camps are split into groups of day camps and overnight camps. In the United States, overnight sports camps fall into two groups. The more traditional of these offer boys and girls the chance to learn and play many sports. Sessions are typically 3 to 8 weeks long, and some camps have multiple sessions. While many strong athletes attend these camps, a traditional sports camp program also serves the needs of less proficient athletes by having all campers compete on teams picked by ability, so all kids get a chance to contribute to their team's success in their daily competitions. Some of these camps have been operating for more than 100 years. These camps generally focus, through the medium of team sports, on the development of the whole child; not just how they are as an athlete, but also how they are as a person, a bunkmate, a teammate, and a friend. Many of these camps include a variety of non-sports programs as well for a more diverse experience. Many sports camps are of the second type, which focuses almost exclusively on one particular sport. These camps generally focus on helping each camper acquire skills in a sport that helps them gain confidence and improve their chances of making the team when they return to school. Indeed, some campers are helped to be nationally competitive by way of this kind of intensive summer training. These camps generally run week-long sessions, and some campers may attend more than one session even though the curriculum repeats each week. Some single-sport camps offer longer sessions. Many of the instructors at these camps are coaches of local teams, and thus many athletes get valuable extra time with the coach they play for during the school year (or the coach they hope to play for during the upcoming school year). Such camps are also a good way to learn about potential college scholarships in their sport. Both multi-sport and single-sport camps tend to be run by experienced teachers and coaches (who typically have summers off from their school responsibilities). Cabin staff, instructors, and counselors are typically college athletes. The best sports camps succeed at challenging aspiring athletes both mentally and physically, while also promoting their social and leadership skills. This is possible in part because many of the counselors attended as campers, and thus there is a vibrant \\"camp culture\\" that welcomes new campers into an extended camp family and establishes the high standards that incoming campers are encouraged to achieve. The best sports camps do much more than just improve a camper's soccer, tennis, lacrosse, or wrestling skills; they help each child become a more skillful athlete, a more gracious competitor, a more committed team player, and a more confident person. Weight loss camps Weight loss camps are for overweight children, teens, and adults to learn about losing weight and keep it off while having a summer camp experience.  Emotional education camp  These kinds of camps are a new way to increase the emotional intelligence of the children. There are some examples of these camps, around the world, for example, Rumbend√´ll emotional camp, based in Seville, Spain.  LGBT camps  LGBT summer camps are safe spaces designed for LGBT youths to experience the supportive atmosphere they may lack at home. They follow a similar model to summer camps, with traditional activities like swimming, canoeing, and bog runs but also queer activities like \\"Grave Digging,\\" where kids can bury their old gender identities and deadnames, or learning makeup tips from a drag queen. Identity-affirming camps can improve the psychological well-being of LGBT youth. Around the world =Australia= Summer camps are largely non-existent in Australia, because the Australian summer break (known as the Christmas holidays) only lasts between six and eight weeks, and occurs over Christmas and the New Year, shorter than in North America. Most children participate in School-camps, Girl Guide/scout camps, or school holiday camps with some religious groups (Such as the Salvation Army and Seventh-Day Adventists) holding week-long Summer Camps. Girl Guides and Scouts offer 'jamborees' which are camps over 1 to 2 weeks. Multiple-week camps are next to unheard of. Many of Australia's youth music organizations hold annual rehearsal camps in summer including the Australian Youth Orchestra's National Music Camp and Gondwana Choirs Gondwana National Choral School. Other than the Seventh-Day Adventist Summer Camps, most holiday camps are referred to as \\"Adventure Camps\\", because they largely do not occur over summer. Many groups hold holiday day-camps for Primary aged children, and often run week-long adventure camps during the Spring, Autumn and Winter breaks. Australian Defence Force Cadets often and almost exclusively run their extended camps and courses over school holiday periods, the vast majority of which provide all food and lodging for Cadets over the course of the camp. However, these camps often last only one or two weeks and thus do not fill up the majority of the summer holiday break. This allows the Cadets (who are aged 12‚Äì18 years and therefore the majority attend school) to attend the camps whilst still completing normal schooling. =Canada= Children in a Montreal summer camp, July 1941 In Canada, summer camps are very popular. About 70% of Canadian camps tend to be affiliated with organizations, while the rest are private. There are also many summer camps for ESL students. Summer camp fairs are held throughout Canada, usually during the winter months. Parents and children can meet camp directors and collect information about summer camps. Admission to these fairs is typically free, and the camps on display vary in their cost from completely subsidized fees to quite expensive. Some camps are specifically designed to reduce Summer learning loss, particularly in literacy and mathematics. For example, the Council of Ontario Directors of Education (CODE) published the results of their study entitled The Ontario Summer Literacy Learning Project 2010. Then, in 2014 they published a Program Planning Guide to help Boards implement Summer Learning Programs (SLP). After three years of delivering the SLP, they concluded that the programs a) make a difference for students experiencing literacy challenges, b) minimize summer learning losses, and c) in many cases, increase literacy achievements. In recent years the project has included both French and English classes, blended literacy & numeracy, robotics, coding, student mentors, Indigenous activities and English Language Learning, and reports are available online. =Chile= The Chilean Ingl√©s Abre Puertas (English Opens Doors) program from the Ministry of Education runs each January and July English-language Summer and Winter camps, respectively. The camps take place during the students' vacations, and \\"are designed to give talented Chilean public high school students the chance to practice English in a more hands-on way through interactive activities including role-playing exercises, field trips, group projects, and competitive games.\\" =China= Most of the summer camps are sponsored by the educational bureau. However, nowadays, there are more privately held camp programs. The traditional camps are only open to the selected students within individual school districts. In recent years, programs have started that are open to kids from different backgrounds and regions. There are also programs tailored for international students who are interested in learning Chinese language and culture. =Cyprus= In Cyprus, summer camps are widely used for children. They usually are situated in the Troodos Mountains area and more specific around Platres. The church, government and organised groups provide funds for many children so that they can join summer camps for free. =Czech Republic= Czech camp made of typical \\"podsadov√© stany\\" There is a long-standing tradition of summer camps in the Czech Republic. Most commonly, campers are accommodated in tents standing on so-called \\"podsada\\". It was invented in 1913 and nowadays it is widely used across the Czech Republic, but also in some other European states such as Slovakia. These camps are usually situated in meadows surrounded by forests far away from cities and civilisation in general. Even though there is almost no possibility to use electrical devices and no facilities such as hot water, the popularity of those camps is still increasing. =Finland= Many Finnish non-governmental organizations arrange summer camps for children in a wide variety of age brackets. Major organizers of summer camps are the scouts, sports teams and the orthodox and evangelic-Lutheran churches. The concept of summer camps arose with the rapid post-WWII urbanization and industrialization Finland experienced. The reason behind this was that Finnish pedagogues of that period, influenced by the values of the largely agrarian pre-WWII society, were convinced that an urban lifestyle was harmful to the development of children. The idea behind summer camps was to ensure that children had experiences of the countryside, experiences that would aid in development into a decent citizen. One Finnish tradition also arose soon after WWII, was confirmation camps. Confirmations camps, religious camps for 13‚Äì16 years old youths organized by the local churches, aimed to combine the traditional concept of confirmation school and the newer concept of summer camps in order to battle secularization of the society. The concept was successful enough to such an extent that today, 90% of all youths participate in confirmation camps. The camps require their participants to learn certain religious texts, such as the catechism, and the Lord's prayer. There are a number of non- religious alternatives for confirmation camps, such as the Prometheus Camp, which aim to generate a positive intellectual and social atmosphere for the participants of the camp without religious tuition. =France= In France, they are called colonies de vacances or more recently centres de vacances. According to the French administration, more than 25% of French children attend this kind of \\"collective holiday\\" each year. =Greece= In Greece, summer camps are widely known for offering organized vacations for children. They offer sports activities, entertainment activities, and educational activities. Children 5 ‚Äì 15 years old can join summer camps and have the opportunity to interact with peers. The Greek government provides funds for many children so that they can join a summer camp, free. =India= Summer camps in India are primarily located in the Himalayas in Northern India in the state of Uttarakhand in places like Uroli near Ranikhet, near the Tons river in Purola, near the Ganges in Rishikesh, in Uttarkashi where many peaks like Darba top are located, and in the Shimla region in Himachal Pradesh. In South India, summer camps are popular in Coorg in the state of Karnataka and in Yercaud and Anaikkati in the state of Tamil Nadu. Activities in summer camps in India include rock climbing, backpacking, mountain biking, white water rafting, trekking, ropes, and wilderness craft. Many pre-schools in India such as Season Camps, G MaX, Gurukul Preschool (Hunar Summer Camp ) AppleKids conduct extensive Summer Camps for Kids aged 2 to 12 years. Adventure activities for kids are also popular at the summer camps for age groups of 7 to 18 years. Summer camps focusing on wildlife conservation are getting popular over the years. Many of these summer camps are also held in and around metros like Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune. =Ireland= Summer camps in Ireland were traditionally in the form of Irish colleges in areas that are officially recognized as speaking Irish as the local language, (called Gaeltachts). They are residential Irish language summer courses that give students the opportunity to be totally immersed in the Irish language, usually for periods of three weeks over the summer months. During these courses, students attend classes and participate in a variety of different activities games, music, art and sport. These courses not only provide students with the ability to improve their language skills but also have proved to be a vehicle for introducing traditional cultural activities (c√©il√≠s, Irish traditional music, etc.) to a new generation. Whilst Irish colleges are still popular, a greater variety of summer camps are now on offer catering for a range of interests. Sports camps covering Gaelic games as well as rugby and soccer have proven very popular. Arts and crafts, cookery, acting, dance, and outdoor pursuits are some of the other niche camps available. There is also a growing popularity for technical or computer camps. They cover areas such as web design, video production, desktop publishing, etc., reflecting a more modern and diverse Ireland. =Israel= Israeli campers from Kibbutz Yagur in the 1950s. The majority of summer camps in Israel are run by the youth movements and the largest organization is the Israeli Scouts who are organizing over 40 different overnight camps every summer with more then 80,000 participants. Youth movement summer camps usually take place between 3 to 12 days. There are some longer overnight camps where campers stay for two weeks such as Camp Kimama, which was founded in Michmoret, within the youth village of Mevo'ot Yam. The affiliation of the overnight summer camps is Jewish so they celebrate Shabbat and other Jewish holidays. The summer camps are international and are meant for Jewish kids and teens from Israel and countries around the world. Today, there are summer day camps in almost every village and city, most of which are run by the local authority or certain organizations. In addition, there are a lot of church organized camps including many denominations. For example, all evangelical churches (mostly in the Galilee) hold a Vacation Bible School (VBS) which includes many activities for children. One of the overnight camps is called the Potter's Wheel Camp (PWC) which was originally started by Baptist missionaries at the Baptist Village near Petach Tekvah. This camp continues to serve hundreds of children to this day. =Italy= In Italy, summer camps take place during the students' vacations (usually between June and August). =South Korea= Summer camps in South Korea are English Immersion camps where the emphasis is on learning through structured lessons, and especially tailored activities to ensure students use the language as much as possible. South Korea is quite unique with its emphasis on acquiring English speaking skills, and teachers for these 2 to 4 week camps come from all over the English speaking world. Some of the teachers are on vacation from their regular work in South Korea. Others come from their home countries or other countries where they might be working and are on special visas just for the camps. Some employ as many Korean staff as there are native English teachers to ensure the cultural and communication gaps are narrowed. A good camp should provide equipment and well-researched texts for the different levels of students. To maximize the learning time spent there should be no more than 11 students per class. At some of the camps, students sleep at dormitory accommodations, which are monitored all through the night by Korean staff. Other camps are day camps where the majority of students are bused to and from the camp. Teachers spend most of their time with their students. They eat together, play sports together, and supervise them when there are special group activities. Similar camps are also offered during winter vacation. They are certainly no less popular than the summer camps =Malaysia= Summer camps in Malaysia are not so popular as in other countries. Children & teenagers have fun together by themselves. But now, summer camps are slowly getting attention. The biggest summer camps available are usually for children below 7 years old. =Russia= In the USSR, the first summer camps were created shortly after its establishment and were called Young Pioneer camps during the Soviet Union's existence. Their number grew throughout the history of the Soviet Union and they numbered more than forty thousand in 1973, with 9,300,000 children attending them during their vacation every year. After the breakup of the USSR, the number of Young Pioneer camps greatly declined. However, many of the major camps still exist. There are 2,726 Residential camps (with 2,000,000 children), and more 40,000 Day camps (3,500,000 children) in Russia (2006). Most of them were united by All-Russian Camp Association \\"Deti Plus\\" (Children Plus) in 1994. =Sweden= The Church of Sweden provides confirmation camps, usually combined with outdoor life. Summer camps are often single sport camps. =Tunisia= Every year during the summer school holiday, the Youth and Science Association organizes Scientific camps in many regions in Tunisia where children and teenagers can learn new skills, develop their potential and have fun. =United Kingdom= Kingswood, West Runton, a UK summer camp. Summer camps are not a major part of childhood in the United Kingdom in the way they are in North America. The UK school summer holiday is shorter, typically six weeks for state schools. Children are more likely to go on a long (e.g. two- or three-week) holiday with their family during this period rather than a camp just for children. (UK employees get longer holiday leave from their jobs than their US counterparts, facilitating long family summer holidays.) The industry body is called the British Activity Holiday Association. Camps in the UK are also generally less specialized than in the United States, and most offer a fairly broad multi-activity programme of adventure activities alongside some fun social elements. This is partly because summer camps in the UK grew as an offshoot of the activity holiday industry and were therefore influenced by their adventure-only outdoor program. The UK has for the past few decades had a number of organizations that have established themselves more along the traditional model with a very wide range of holiday options as well as themed camps and major event days. Some religious groups, such as the Christadelphians, also run well publicized and attended camps throughout the country. A number of youth organizations, such as the Scout Association, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps, do often run more specialized summer camps for their membership, though these are not usually open to non-members. The Council of Colony Holidays for Schoolchildren ran summer camps called \\"Colonies\\" from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. Colonies were not based on outdoor pursuits or the \\"action- adventure\\" model, but were multi-activity holidays designed to appeal to a very wide range of children. This organization was based on the French model, and was unique in the UK in that the young volunteers who worked directly with the children (known as \\"Monitors\\") were prepared for their work in training courses designed and run by the organization. After Colony Holidays folded in the 1980s, Chris Green, one of their former staff, set up ATE Superweeks to provide similar holidays. He also campaigns for summer camps to become more widely supported and to help transform children's lives. = United States = Children swimming at an Indiana church camp. Gunnery Camp in 1861 The American Camp Association (ACA) reports that there are about 7,000 overnight camps and about 5,000 day camps in the U.S., for a total of more than 12,000 camps.ACA Facts and Trends, American Camping Association (accessed August 22, 2013). These camps are attended each year by more than 11 million children and adults. Of the 12,000 camps, about 9,500 are operated by nonprofit groups, and 2,500 by for-profit operators, employing more than 1,500,000 adults. Sports camps abound, offering single and group instruction in numerous sports and activities, often as prep for collegiate sports and scholarships. In the United States, youth organizations, such as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, the JCC, the YMCA, Camp Fire, and several religiously affiliated groups are known for having many camps and integrating them with their own local organizations. Since 2008, the United States has been home to the world's first children's sleep away camp for transgender children. It is called Camp Aranu'tiq and serves campers aged 8 to 18. It won the Eleanor P. Eells Award from the American Camp Association in 2012.

Vanguard ‚Äî under the command of Captain Richard Dawkins, sailed out of Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) harbour on 27 August 1875 in company with three other ironclads, , and . The ships were part of the First Reserve Squadron and were on a summer cruise around the Irish coast. The squadron ‚Äî under the command of Admiral Tarleton, was en route to Queenstown (Cobh), County Cork where the cruise would finish. As they passed the Kish lightship, a heavy fog came down which restricted visibility to less than a ship's length. Vanguards sister ship ‚Äî Iron Duke ‚Äî noticed she was drifting off course and began returning to her proper station. A problem with her steam plant rendered her foghorn inoperable, and could not be used to alert the other vessels of her position or course. At about 12:50, a look-out on Vanguard spotted a sailing ship directly ahead. As Vanguard turned to avoid it, Iron Duke appeared out of the fog on her port side less than away. Collision was unavoidable. Iron Dukes underwater ram tore open Vanguards hull near her boilers. Iron Duke freed herself after a few minutes, sustaining only minor damage. Vanguard, however, was sinking. Her pumps could move water at a rate of 3,000 lb/min (23 kg/s) but the flooding exceeded 50 long tons per minute (847 kg/s). The pumps were powered by the engines, which shut down ten minutes after the collision when the engine room flooded. HMS Vanguard (right) sinking. HMS Iron Duke is on the left Vanguard and Iron Duke both launched all boats. The abandonment was completed in good order with Captain Dawkins the last of the 360 crew aboard to leave and the only casualty was his dog which was lost. Warrior and Hector sailed on in the fog and only learned of the sinking upon reaching Queenstown. Seventy minutes after the collision, Vanguard rested on the seabed deep. The tips of her masts were still visible above the surface. The Admiralty was confident that the ship could be raised and diving operations started, but were soon abandoned. Captain Dawkins was blamed at the court martial for not doing enough to save his vessel following the collision, and never received command of another vessel. Contemporary popular opinion, however, was sympathetic towards him. The wreck was rediscovered in 1985 and lies in of water. The wreck is protected under the Irish National Monument Act, and a licence from the National Monuments Service is required to dive it. Notes and references Bibliography *Roger Chesneau and Eugene M.

It is situated on a hill between West Park and Horsforth and is circled by Butcher Hill, the A65 and Vesper Road. Hawksworth lies within the LS5 Kirkstall postcode area and is commonly known as The Hawk, The Hawky or The Hawky Estate. Etymology The name Hawksworth appears to have been given to the estate as recently as its foundation in the twentieth century, and is not covered by the relevant English Place Name Society surveys.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place- Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), pp. 52-53. The name also belongs to the ancient village of Hawksworth five miles away and may have been transferred to the Hawksworth estate from there. The name Hawksworth Wood probably refers to the wood that stood to the west of Kirkstall Abbey. It provided shelter, fuel, pannage and building resources such as thatch for the abbey; timber was generally brought from elsewhere since Alexander, the founding abbot of Kirkstall who completed the initial building work, was concerned to preserve the woodland at Hawksworth. History After the First World War, councils were encouraged to build 'Homes fit for Heroes', and by 1930 7,000 new council houses had been built in Leeds, on estates which included the Hawksworth Wood. The woodland around the Hawksworth estate lies within the framework of the Upper Aire Valley. Parts of these sites were formerly quarried or gleaned for millstone grit but have now reverted to woodland and scrub. The woodlands are predominantly mixed broadleaves mainly containing oak and sycamore, with the understories consisting of rowan, hazel, holly and guelder rose. Small pockets of heather can also be found. These woodlands provide considerable colour and diversity to this suburban and formerly industrial area and are currently managed to ensure a continuity of multi-aged tree cover. Great Hawksworth has received active management in recent years through the removal of invasive tree species and the promotion of understorey and ground flora. St. Marys Church Another interesting fact concerning the area is that the 1933 Penny of George V, a classic rarity, had been placed under the foundation stone of St. Mary's Church in the area. Most accounts indicate that a mere seven pieces were struck for special presentation purposes, and only three currently reside in private collections. In 1933 there was no requirement for the Royal Mint to produce any pennies because there were already enough in circulation. Requests were, however, received for sets of coins dated 1933 to be placed under the foundation stones of buildings erected in that year, and the Mint obliged by striking a small number of coins. The result was to create a rarity that many people thought could turn up in their change. Reports indicate that in 1970, during construction at Church of St. Cross, Middleton, one of these examples was stolen. In response, the Bishop of Ripon ordered that the St. Mary's Church 1933 Penny be unearthed and sold as a protective measure to prevent its theft. Numerous public rights of way run through the woods which are accessible via Butcher Hill, Hawksworth Road, New Road Side, Abbey Road, Vesper Road, Cragside Walk and Cragside Close. There is a metal hatch in Hawksworth Woods which is actually the entrance to an old explosives store from when the woods were once quarried for stone. It has been mistaken for a World War II shelter. Facilities There are a few shops on the estate but no pubs. There once was a pub on Vesper Road called \\"The Woodway\\" which no longer exists. The nearest public house is \\"The Dalesman' on Butcher Hill. The main road into the estate from Horsforth. The only drinking place left on the estate now is the Conservative Club on Cragside Walk. Shops on Broadway Shops in the area include a post office, co-op, bakers and several fast food establishments. Hawksworth Wood Primary School is the only school on the estate. It was originally Hawksworth Wood Primary School but was split into two in the 1970s: the Broadway building became Hawksworth Wood Primary, and the Cragside building was redeveloped with old and new buildings to become Vesper Gate Middle School. In recent times the Broadway building was refurbished to become Hawksworth Wood Children's Centre, including a facility for adult education previously run by Leeds City College this was closed some years ago. whilst the Cragside building is now called Hawksworth Wood Primary again. The nearest high school is Abbey Grange on Butcher Hill. Hawksworth Co- op There is a licensed restaurant called \\"Hand Food's\\" on Vesper Road. The TV series A Touch Of Frost starring David Jason has been filmed on the Hawksworth Estate.

Each book was written in the second person, with the reader choosing how the story should progress. They were designed by Byron Preiss Visual Publications. The main difference between the Choose Your Own Adventure series and the Time Machine series was that Time Machine books featured only one ending, forcing the reader to try many different choices until they discovered it. Also, the series taught children basic history about many diverse subjects, from dinosaurs to World War II. Only the sixth book in the series, The Rings of Saturn, departed from actual history; it is set in the future, and features educational content about the solar system. Some books gave the reader their choice from a small list of equipment at the beginning, and this choice would affect events later in the book (e.g. \\"If you brought the pen knife, turn to page 52, if not turn to page 45.Mueller, Richard; World War I Flying Ace (Time Machine, No. 24); page 32\\"). Another main difference between the Time Machine novels and the Choose Your Own Adventure counterparts was hints offered at certain junctures, where the reader was advised to look at hints at the back of the book. An example was in Mission to World War II about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, where the reader was given the choice of starting the mission in the Jewish ghetto or the Aryan part of Warsaw, in which the hint read \\"Ringelblum was Jewish\\", suggesting the reader should begin in the Jewish section of the city, but not ordering it, or it was possible for the hint to be missed. The line spawned a brief spin-off series for younger readers, the Time Traveler novels.  Books = 1984 = * 1. Secret of the Knights by Jim Gasperini, * 2. Search for Dinosaurs by David Bischoff, * 3.

The submarine is based at Faslane, HMNB Clyde, Argyll, Scotland. Vanguard was built at Barrow-in-Furness by Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions), was launched on 4 March 1992, and commissioned on 14 August 1993. Operational history The submarine's first commanding officer was Captain David Russell and the senior engineer officer, during build, was Commander James Grant OBE. HMS Vanguard arriving back at HM Naval Base Clyde, Faslane, Scotland following a patrol In February 2002, Vanguard began a two-year refit at HMNB Devonport. The refit was completed in June 2004 and in October 2005, Vanguard completed her return to service trials (Demonstration and Shakedown Operations) with the firing of an unarmed Trident missile. During this refit, Vanguard was boarded by a pair of anti-nuclear protesters who spent half an hour on board before being challenged. They were charged with damaging a fence which they cut to access the submarine. On 4 February 2009, Vanguard collided with the French submarine in the Atlantic. She returned to Faslane in Scotland under her own power, arriving on 14 February 2009. In January 2012 radiation was detected in the PWR2 test reactor's coolant water, caused by a microscopic breach in fuel cladding. This discovery led to Vanguard being scheduled to be refuelled in its next \\"deep maintenance period\\", due to last 3.5 years from 2015, and contingency measures being applied to other Vanguard and submarines, at a cost of ¬£270 million.

It is approximately to the north west of Leeds city centre. It was planned by Leeds Housing Director RAH Livett and won the Ministry Housing medal for 1945-9. An early plan of Ireland Wood in 1950 is shown on the Leodis website .http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=7702http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=20031024_58955020 The estate was constructed throughout the 1950s and provided a refuge from the slum houses in industrial parts of the city which they (along with other similar areas) replaced. This estate is particularly leafy, due to the amount of greenery and woodland surrounding. The area's main thoroughfare is the Otley Old Road. It sits in the Weetwood ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. The district is close to the Holt Park, Cookridge and Tinshill areas and the Leeds Ring Road. Housing Typical concrete house, original finish on right Most housing in Ireland Wood is late 1940s concrete, prefabricated housing. This stock is generally in a good condition and has been recently refurbished. There is one block of highrise flats, Beevers Court, situated on Iveson Approach. Most housing in the area is off yellow in colour, but as many houses in the area have been bought by their residents, some owners have painted their houses white. From late 2013 many council houses have seen a repaint, accompanied with new insulation. Most housing on the estate comprises semi-detached properties with two or three bedrooms. Council housing on nearby estates such as Tinshill and Moor Grange is built with bricks, as opposed to being prefabricated, and so generally fetches a higher price on the property market.

It lies at the northern tip of the marshlands between the Tigris and Euphrates. it had a population of about 340,000 as of 2002 and about 420,000 as of 2005. It is the administrative capital of the Maysan province. A major trading center for the surrounding agricultural area, it is known for woven goods and silverware. the staple economic goods produced in northern Amarah are winter cereals like wheat and barley, and animals like sheep and horses. History Kurdish coolies along the banks of the Tigris in Amarah, ca. 1919 The city was founded in the 1860s as an Ottoman military outpost from which the empire tried to control the warring Banu Lam and Al Bu Muhammad tribes. In 1915 Amarah was captured by the British. Before the revolution in 1958 Amarah was known for its feudal system with local estate-holders maintaining private militias. Abdul Rahim al-Rahmani founded the first bookstore in Amarah in 1922, and the city's first cinema in 1950. During the eight-year Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the eastern parts of the province became the site of several battles, notably Operation Before the Dawn launched by Iran. Since the Baghdad-Basra highway cut through the province, Iran targeted the area due to its strategic significance to the Iraqis. After the Persian Gulf War, Amarah was one of many sites during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq against Saddam Hussein. Many insurgents throughout Iraq retreated to safe havens in the Amarah area. Many were killed and crudely buried in a mass grave outside the city. Saddam Hussein also resorted to a crude tactic of draining the marshes surrounding Amarah. Furthermore, Saddam constructed a number of dams in an effort to cut off the water supply to the area. Throughout the 90's, the town's population swelled with refugees from the marshes. Saddam Hussein occasionally neglected service to the city in retribution for its role in the uprising. The city also supported the efforts of Moqtada al-Sadr, whose father was also killed by Saddam. In May 1999, Ba'ath party militias and units of the Special Republican Guard conducted operations in the region. Local resistance forces reportedly repelled the operation. =Iraq War (2003-2012)= During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the city made a final stand as a center of resistance to Saddam Hussein. The city was soon occupied by British forces, which set up two camps. Local residents hired diggers to unearth the bodies in the mass grave after twelve years. However, in June 2003, citizens of Amarah took up arms against patrolling British forces, killing six soldiers each in two separate attacks, south of the City in Majar al-Kabir. The British bases frequently experienced mortar attacks afterward. The books Sniper One by Sergeant Daniel Mills, Dusty Warriors by Richard Holmes and Barefoot Soldier by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC all contain very good accounts on the events in Al Amarah during this period. Battle of Amarah: After the British handed power over to the Iraqi government, a power struggle erupted between Shi'ite loyalists of the Mahdi Army and Badr Brigades. A number of assassinations occurred in the city between the rival factions. According to Sheik Abdul Kareem al-Muhamadawi, the latest dispute between the Shiite militias began after Qassim al-Tamimi, the chief of investigations for the provincial police force and a member of the Badr Organization, was killed in a bombing. Badr fighters blamed the Mahdi Army for the killing. After the brother of Sheikh Fadel al-Bahadli, the Mahdi Army commander in the province, was captured, the Mahdi Army captured least three police stations and other state facilities on October 20, 2006, resulting in at least twenty-two deaths, three of which were children.Kim Sengupta, \\"Bloody battle for Amarah a glimpse of future,\\" The Independent (21 October 2006). Retrieved 7 February 2015. Iraqi Army and British advisers arrived from Basra the next day to secure a truce with Sadr representatives. On June 18, 2008, the Iraqi Army launched a major operation in Amarah to wrest the city from the control of militias loyal to Moqtada al Sadr and to reduce the flow of weapons and Shiite militants transiting through the city from nearby Iran. The operation, codenamed Promise of Peace (Bashir Al Salem in Arabic), followed significant Iraqi Army operations in Basra, the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, and Mosul in the first half of 2008.Londono, Ernesto and Aahad Ali, \\"Iraq, US Launch Crackdown,\\" Washington Post (June 20, 2008). Retrieved 7 February 2015. During this time, the 4th Brigade of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division established a semi-permanent presence in the province by constructing two large operating bases in the Province and several smaller company outposts. Specific within 4th Brigade, Amarah and its surrounding towns were covered by 2nd Battalion of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, which established FOB Garryowen just west of the city proper. Throughout 2008 and 2009 over 2,000 US troops from the 1st Cavalry Division partnered with the Iraqi Army, police, and the Border Enforcement Brigade in the Province to defeat Shia extremism and interdict illicit arms smuggling across the Iranian border. Working closely with British investigators and Iraqi police, US troops also successfully detained 11 out of 17 individuals who were wanted for the murder of British soldiers in Majr Al Khabir back in 2003. All 11 suspects are now facing murder charges in a Baghdad court. Provincial elections in January 2009 saw a dramatic shift in the balance of power in Amarah and Maysan Province in general. In an election widely recognized as both credible and legitimate, Maysan voters broke the six-year-long grip that Sadrist parties had on power in the Provincial Council resulting in an even split between Sadrist and Islamic Dawa Party affiliates in the council. In May 2009, the PC formally appointed a Dawa Party member to the governorship to replace the radical Sadrist leadership that had held power for years in the Province.

He graduated from Woodward High School in 1924 and served as class valedictorian, the first African American to hold that honor in Cincinnati. In his senior year, he won an essay contest with an entry submitted under the pseudonym Thomas Playfair after an all-white panel had rejected his initial entry. Berry worked at steel mills in Newport, Kentucky, to pay tuition at the University of Cincinnati and then at its law school. Legal career Berry was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1932. He served as president of the Cincinnati branch of the NAACP from 1932 to 1946. In 1938 he was appointed the first black assistant prosecuting attorney for Hamilton County. =Military service= During World War II, Berry worked in the Office of War Information as a morale officer. The job took him to Washington, D.C. and also caused him to change his political affiliation from Republican to Democrat. In 1945, Berry defended three black Army Air Force officers, members of the Tuskegee Airmen, who had protested a segregated officer's club in Indiana. He won acquittal for two of the men. In 1995, the Air Force pardoned the third who had been convicted. =NAACP service= From 1947 to 1961, Berry served on the NAACP Ohio Committee for Civil Rights Legislation where he worked on equal employment and fair housing issues.

Military career before Nuevo Santander Escand√≥n was one of three sons of Juan de Escand√≥n and Francisca de la Helguera. He arrived in New Spain as a child in 1715. He volunteered to serve as a cadet in the cavalry of the city of M√©rida, Aadi where he fought against the English at Laguna de T√©rminos. For his valor, he was promoted to lieutenant and posted to Quer√©taro. There he fought in the wars against the Apaches. In Quer√©taro he learned to treat the Indians \\"como amigos, con mano suave, y como enemigos, con rigor implacable\\" (as friends, with a soft hand, and as enemies, with implacable rigor). In 1727 he pacified the Pames, who had revolted in Celaya, and was promoted to sergeant mayor of the regiment. In 1732 he subdued rebels at the mines in Guanajuato, and the following year he did the same at Irapuato. In 1734 he pacified 10,000 Indian rebels at San Miguel el Grande. For these accomplishments, he was promoted to colonel and assigned as an aide to the captain general of the Sierra Gorda. In 1742 he was transferred from Quer√©taro to Veracruz, which was threatened by the English, but upon his arrival he received orders to return to Tehuac√°n. In 1749 he pacified disturbances in Quer√©taro that resulted from a famine following a drought. Several times he visited the missions in the Sierra Gorda, introducing reforms in the administration. He also fought against the Tamaulipecos who were devastating the region of Nuevo Le√≥n. Colonization of Nuevo Santander In the 1760s Spain, because of encroachments of the French from Louisiana and the English along the Gulf coast, decided that they would have to complete the conquest of the Seno Mexicano (the Gulf coast, especially Tamaulipas and Texas). A council of war meeting was held to consider this project, from May 8, 1748 to May 13. Various officers presented plans, and that of Jos√© de Escand√≥n was chosen as the most comprehensive. Escand√≥n had already financed an expedition to the region and thus was in a position to choose sites for settlement. He proposed the name Nuevo Santander. He also proposed a budget of 115,000 pesos for the new expedition, plus 500 pesos for each colonist. Upon the acceptance of Escand√≥n's plan, it was advertised in Quer√©taro, San Luis Potos√≠, Charcas, Huasteca, Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila, and very quickly attracted the intended number of colonists. Between December 25, 1748, the date of the foundation of Llera, and 1755, he founded over twenty towns or villages and a number of missions in the colony, including Santander, Soto la Marina, G√ºemes, Camargo, Reynosa, Mier, and Revilla south of the Rio Grande, and Laredo and Nuestra Se√±ora de los Dolores hacienda north of the Rio Grande. Escand√≥n is sometimes referred to as the \\"father of the lower Rio Grande Valley\\". As governor of Nuevo Santander For his firmness and energy, he was also known as the Exterminator of the Pames of Quer√©taro. In Nuevo Santander he was accused of murdering the Indians and taking slaves. He faced a court case where he was charged with illegally using Indian labor in his textile mills and using the port of Santander to bring in English contraband. However, in the period 1770-1775 there were more than twice as many deaths among the Indians as in the 22 years he governed. Among his enemies in the region were the Jesuits, the French and the secular clergy. Coat of arms of Jos√© de Escand√≥n He accumulated vast wealth during his stay in Quer√©taro, San Miguel and Nuevo Santander from the work of badly paid Indians and slaves, as well as large land grants from the viceroys. The livestock and other products of his lands, as well as what he bought from the colonists, were shipped from the port of Soto la Marina along the coast to Veracruz in a frigate he owned. He was considered one of the great statesmen of New Spain in the eighteenth century, superior to many of the viceroys. He assigned activities and crops to each settlement, stimulated irrigation and constructed roads and bridges. He built a grand mansion in Santander, capital of the colony, known as the Palace of the Count. He also built the church at Santander and a reservoir for drinking water. He brought in masons, carpenters and blacksmiths from Tacubaya and established kilns, sugar mills and flour mills. To reward him for his services, the Crown granted him the title of conde de Sierra Gorda, free of lanzas (duty imposed on noblemen in lieu of military service) and media anata (tax paid on assuming office). He died forgotten in 1770, probably on September 10, in Quet√©tero or Mexico City. Five years later he was exonerated of the legal charges against him, and rehabilitated. The title passed to his eldest son, Manuel. Manuel died without descendants, and the second son of Jos√©, Mariano, became count. Ciudad Victoria, now the capital of the state of Tamaulipas, erected a statue to his memory in 1975. There are also streets named for him there and in Quer√©taro. In Laredo, Texas the Festival de M√∫sica Jos√© de Escand√≥n is celebrated annually in November. There is also a statue dedicated to him in Alice, Texas. A statue was dedicated to Jose de Escandon in 2014. It‚Äôs located at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg, Texas.

Clark had his best years with the Detroit Tigers (1995‚Äì2001), but also played with five other teams during a 15-year career that ended in 2009. He was a switch hitter, and threw right-handed. He was third in Rookie of the Year voting in 1996, and was an All Star in 2001. Clark was a union representative while he was a player, and after retiring he joined the staff of the MLBPA in 2010. He served as deputy executive director and acting executive director of the union before he was appointed executive director in December 2013, upon the death of Michael Weiner. Clark is the first former player to be executive director of the MLB players' union. High school career and college career Clark prepped at Valhalla High School in El Cajon, California, but after going out to dinner with principal Ed Giles and others, Clark transferred to nearby Christian High School. He averaged 43.7 points per game in basketball in his senior season. He amassed a then-San Diego-area high school basketball record with 2,549 career points, and broke Bill Walton's San Diego high school single-season scoring record with 1,337 points as a senior. Clark played college basketball at the University of Arizona and San Diego State, where he was the Aztecs' top scorer with 11.5 points per game in 1991‚Äì92. During the summers, he played minor league baseball after having been drafted out of high school with the second overall pick in 1990 by the Detroit Tigers. He would eventually leave college (and his basketball career) without finishing his business administration degree in order to focus on baseball. Professional baseball career In a 15-year career, Clark hit .262 with 251 home runs and 824 run batted in (RBIs) in 1,559 games played. He was third in Rookie of the Year voting in 1996, when he hit .250 with 27 home runs. His most productive seasons were 1997, with 32 homers and 117 RBIs (10 errors at first base), 1998, with 34 homers and 103 RBIs (13 errors at first), and 1999, with 31 home runs and 99 RBIs (10 errors at first). Clark was selected an All-Star in 2001. In 2002, Clark hit only .207 with 29 RBIs and three home runs for Boston in 90 games, with a career- low .291 slugging percentage. In 2003, he batted .232 for the New York Mets. =2004= Signed as a bench player, Clark filled in for the New York Yankees in 2004 after Jason Giambi was forced out of the lineup because of an injury. Though he was replaced as the main first baseman by John Olerud late in the season, he still had a few memorable performances. On June 29, 2004, at Yankee Stadium, Clark hit a deep center field two-run homer off Derek Lowe, to help his team to an 11-3 win over the Red Sox. Clark joined Bernie Williams and Danny Tartabull as the only players to reach the center field bleachers more than once since the remodeled Yankee Stadium opened in 1976. During an August 28 game, Clark hit a career-high 3 home runs in an 18-6 rout of the Blue Jays in Toronto. Clark with the Diamondbacks in 2007 =2005= Clark signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks after the 2004 season. In 2005, he enjoyed success with the D-Backs. In a limited role (349 at bats), he hit .307, belted 30 home runs, and knocked in 87 runs. =2006= In 2006, Clark was injured for most of the season. Although he tried to play through a shoulder injury that required significant surgery to repair, he batted a career-low .197, with a career-low .279 on-base percentage, in 132 at-bats. He struggled especially against right-handers, batting .125 against them. =2007= In 2007, Clark shared first base with Conor Jackson. He played in 113 games, and batted .249. =2008= After the season, his contract was up and on February 10, 2008, Clark agreed to a one-year contract worth $900,000 with the San Diego Padres. On July 17, 2008, he was traded back to the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Evan Scribner. In order to complete the trade, Clark waived a clause under his contract with the Padres pursuant to which he was to receive $500,000 from the Padres if traded. In 2008, between the two teams, Clark batted .225 with a .318 slugging percentage. Clark struck out more than of the time, with 55 strikeouts in 151 at-bats. He struggled especially against right-handers, batting .198 against them. =2009= Clark filed for free agency after the 2008 season. On January 2, 2009, he signed a one-year deal worth $800,000 to remain with the Diamondbacks. Clark had a startling good performance on Opening Day 2009, hitting 2 home runs to lead the D-Backs to a victory over the Colorado Rockies; fellow switch-hitting teammate Felipe L√≥pez also homered from both sides of the plate in the same game, making them the first teammates to do so on an Opening Day. Clark slumped badly thereafter, however, as in his next 18 at-bats he only managed to eke out a single. As of May 6 he was batting .179, and had struck out in more than half his at bats. That day Clark was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a lingering wrist ligament injury, and Whitesell, who was hitting .356 for the Reno Aces with a .477 on-base percentage, was called up to the Diamondbacks to take his place. Clark suffered the injury during spring training, and re-aggravated it in late April, leaving him unable to swing comfortably from the left side. It was anticipated that the injury could require more than 15 days to heal. On June 19 Clark came off the disabled list and returned to Arizona (after a rehab assignment at Reno in which he batted .160, and during which he turned 37), and Whitesell was optioned back to Reno (after batting .300 with a .447 on- base percentage in his second stint with the team). In his first game back with the team, Clark went 0-3 with 2 strikeouts to bring his batting average down to .161, with strikeouts in 55% of his at bats for the season. Clark struggled on defense as well, as on June 21 in his second game back he dropped a throw to him at first base with two outs in the ninth, allowing the winning run to score for Seattle. The play left players and managers on both sides stunned and speechless. \\"It's a miserable ending to a rough road trip\\", manager A. J. Hinch said. His resulting .973 fielding percentage was last among major league first basemen who had played 60 or more innings. On July 12, 2009, the Diamondbacks released Clark, who was hitting .182 with four home runs and 11 RBIs. They replaced him with Whitesell. Clark said he would continue to work out the next few weeks in the event an opportunity might arise with another team, and that if he didn't land with another team he'd consider broadcasting and coaching, perhaps with the Diamondbacks. Diamondbacks General Manager Josh Byrnes expressed an interest in keeping him with the organization, and Clark said he \\"would welcome the opportunity.\\" =Post-Season= Clark played in four post-season series through 2008, two each for the Yankees and the Diamondbacks. In aggregate, he batted .135, with a .158 on-base percentage and a .189 slugging percentage, and drove in one run in 37 at-bats. =Television= In August 2009, after being released from the Diamondbacks, Clark became a studio analyst with the MLB Network. Baseball Players Association Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend (center), and Rob Manfred (right) before the Fort Bragg Game in 2016 Throughout his playing career, Clark was involved in the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) on various levels. He attended an Executive Board meeting for the first time in 1999 and was a team player representative and Association Representative for several seasons following. He was an active participant in the union's collective bargaining in 2002 and 2006 and in negotiations regarding Major League Baseball's drug policy. In March 2010, Clark was hired to be the MLBPA's Director of Player Relations. It was reported in April 2013 that Clark was close to earning a degree in history and planned to potentially pursue a law degree. Following the death of Michael Weiner, Clark was unanimously voted executive director of Major League Baseball Players Association in December 2013. He became the first former Major League player to hold the position. Nickname During his time in Detroit, fans and the media gave Tony the nickname \\"Tony the Tiger.\\" The nickname came from the Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger and that he was a member of the Detroit Tigers.

It is approximately from Leeds city centre situated between Tinshill, Cookridge and Adel, and is at the edge of the Leeds urban fringe, bordering the green belt which makes up two thirds of the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds. The nearby Tinshill BT Tower dominates the skyline. Holt Park is in the Leeds North West constituency; its Member of Parliament is Labour Co-op Alex Sobel, who won the seat from Liberal Democrats in the 2017 General Election. The Labour constituency office is in Holt Park District Centre. It is part of the Adel & Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council. Housing One half of Holt Park was built as a council estate; the other half as private housing, built to typical British 1970s design by the well-known property developer Norman C. Ashton Limited (similar/identical architecture and build can be found in other areas in Leeds and West Yorkshire, including Otley, Ainsty in Wetherby, Ferrybridge and Knottingley), comprising a mixture of detached and semi-detached housing, and several apartments. This came about after an agreement between Norman Ashton (an experienced developer) and Leeds City Council to create a new 'village' within the city, which would include a mixture of private and council housing stock with shops and leisure facilities. The farm was sold to the developers by The Co-op, who purchased the land in 1920 as one of five dairy farms in Leeds.Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - Display The earlier housing was completed before the farm was closed, and the farmer took advantage of this delivering milk to all the new residents in the early years. The council housing is a mixture of two-story terraced houses, end-bungalows and flats with bedroom numbers ranging from one to four. These are set in cul-de-sacs within, off and on the periphery of Holtdale Approach, connected by various alleyways and footpaths. Some of this stock is now privately owned, but much of it remains under the control of the Council. Several blocks of flats, set over three storeys, also exist, albeit owned/managed by a housing association. At the same time two schools (Holt Park Middle School and Ralph Thoresby High School), a sports centre (Holt Park Leisure Centre), a library (Holt Park Library, which was annexed to and therefore part of the High School) were builtLeodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - Display and a shopping centre were built.  Ralph Thoresby School  Ralph Thoresby School 2009. The original Ralph Thoresby buildings were built around 1975 and remained the school's premises until September 2007. It was strategically built as part of the district centre and so the leisure centre and the library were fully accessible to the public and part of the school's premises. Holt Park Library and Ralph Thoresby High School were rebuilt on a new site off Holtdale Approach (south), with the opening in September 2007. This is one in a long line of North Leeds secondary schools to be rebuilt, following Lawnswood School and Roundhay School to name but two.  Holt Park District Centre  The Interior of the Holt Park District Centre. The shopping centre began to decrease in character from the late 1990s, with many businesses occupying the units either closing or relocating. The Asda supermarket that has been the main anchor of the centre since it opened in the early 1970s, has enlarged its floor space by taking over some of the empty shop units. A complete redevelopment of the district centre has been discussed for many years. In 2005, a planning application was submitted to Leeds City Council for a complete rebuild of the shopping centre and a standalone Asda superstore with a petrol station to be built next to it. The plans were ultimately rejected. However, discussions remain ongoing. Adjacent to the shopping centre is High Farm, the farm which the estate was originally built on and around, and later converted into a public house. The building itself is known to date back to the 17th century and the interior of the pub still contains period features such the original oak beams.Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds - Display The shopping centre also contains the area's bus 'station'. In many ways the district centre is similar (although smaller) to many new town shopping centres such as those in Newton Aycliffe and Cumbernauld. = Public houses = The High Farm public house The Eyrie public house There is now just one public house in Holt Park, The High Farm, adjacent to the shopping centre, is situated in the old farm buildings and won awards when converted into a pub in the 1970s. The High Farm pub was formerly tied to Hull based brewery North Country Breweries and latterly the Mansfield Brewery. It has a function room in an original barn with beams dating back to the 16th century.  Transport  Holt Park has bus services operated by First Leeds (formerly Yorkshire Rider), particularly Route 1 \\"Brown Line\\" which runs from the shopping centre, through Weetwood, Headingley, Leeds University, Leeds city centre and terminates in the South Leeds area of Beeston. The original terminus of the Route 1 in Holt Park was the roundel where Heathfield meets Holt Lane. The first public-service bendy-buses in the United Kingdom were pioneered on this route in 1999. By 2009, withdrawals had begun on these vehicles, but they are still in service as of the end of 2015. The Route 6 \\"Sky Blue Line\\" (formerly the 96 \\"Sky Line\\") bus service runs through Cookridge, Tinshill, Weetwood, Headingley and Leeds University to Leeds City bus station. The original 96 route ran to and terminated at Cookridge. In the late 2000s, the route was extended to Holt Park via Cookridge, before being renumbered as the number 6 in August 2010. Route 940 (operated by Connexionsbuses) also runs from the shopping centre to Otley, via Bramhope and Pool-in-Wharfedale. Routes 31 and 32 operate from Holt Park Shopping Centre to Horsforth Green on circular routes. These are run by Tordoff transport. All buses are governed by West Yorkshire Metro (and The West Yorkshire Combined Authority). The nearest railway station to Holt Park is Horsforth situated on the Leeds-Harrogate-York Line.

In his autobiographical essay, Borges wrote about \\"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\\", \\"it now seems to me to foreshadow and even to set the pattern for those tales that were somehow awaiting me, and upon which my reputation as a storyteller was to be based.\\" Background Borges in 1976 Written in 1935, \\"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\\" was first published as an essay in Borges's 1936 philosophical essay collection, A History of Eternity (Historia de la eternidad). It was labeled a short story when it was reprinted in 1942 in Borges's first short fiction collection, The Garden of Forking Paths (El jard√≠n de senderos que se bifurcan), which became a subsection of Ficciones when that was published in 1944. Borges described his story as \\"both a hoax and a pseudo-essay.\\" He borrowed from Kipling for some of the plot of the fake book. The supposed publisher of the fictitious book described in the story was an actual publisher, Victor Gollancz, as was the supposed writer of the preface, Dorothy L. Sayers. Plot summary The story is a review of The Conversation with the Man Called Al-Mu'tasim: A Game of Shifting Mirrors, the second edition of an earlier work, The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim. Written by Mir Bahadur Ali, an Indian lawyer, and published in 1934, the second edition is described by the narrator as inferior to the first edition, published in 1932. The reviewer gives a history of the book, first describing the success of the first edition, the publishing of the second edition by a respected publisher in London, and the positive and negative reception given to it by critics. Borges states that though both books have been popular, the first had an original printing of 4,000 copies and was never reprinted, while the second is by far the better known, having been reprinted several times and translated into English, French, and German. The second has often been criticized for poor writing and for its obvious allegory to the quest of finding God. The narrator then summarizes the plot of the novel. The book is a detective story about a freethinking Bombay law student of Islamic background. He becomes involved in a sectarian riot in which he impulsively kills a Hindu, after which he becomes an outcast among the lower classes of India. He flees to a tower where he meets a robber of Parsee corpses collecting gold teeth. He then begins a journey across the subcontinent (the geography of which Borges describes in detail), interacting with untouchables along the way. He meets a man who, though destitute, is happy and spiritual. The student encounters many such people radiating a small amount of this spiritual clarity. From these experiences, he infers the existence of a perfect man, whom he calls Al- Mu'tasim. (Al-Mu'tasim means \\"he who goes in quest of aid\\" or \\"the seeker of shelter\\".) This perfect man is a higher spiritual being, the source and originator of this pure spiritual clarity. Obsessed with meeting Al-Mu'tasim, the student goes on a pilgrimage through Hindustan to find him. He eventually hears the voice of the Al-Mu'tasim resounding from a hut. He pulls back the curtain and goes in. The book ends at this point. The reviewer then gives his criticisms of the work. A long footnote at the end of the review summarises The Conference of the Birds (1177) by Farid ud-Din Attar, in which a group of birds seek a feather dropped in the middle of China by Simurgh, the bird king. Thirty birds reach the mountain of Simurgh and there they find through contemplation that they themselves are the Simurgh. (Si murgh means \\"thirty birds\\".) Themes The main story and the poem summarized in the footnote share a theme. The clearer conclusion of The Conference of the Birds explains the ambiguous ending of \\"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim.\\" Just as the birds find they are what they seek, the law student is Al-Mu'tasim. Style Borges's mixing of the fictional and the real, which Jaime Alazraki calls a \\"Borgesian device,\\" both imparts a real feeling to the fictional, and an unreal feeling to the real. Also, the use of a summary within a summary, and the taking of those summaries and stripping them down to expose the same principle \\"are a form of expressing in the structure of the story the pantheistic idea that anything is all things.\\" Naomi Lindstrom describes the reviewer of the detective story as \\"a typical Borges narrator\\". At times he demonstrates great knowledge of detailed information, but at other times he cannot grasp the most basic concepts. His narrative is uncertain and inconstant. His confusion serves to emphasize the incomprehension of the main character of the fictitious book as he goes on his pilgrimage. Borges's use of an allegory to shed light on a detective story shows his use of religious doctrines for aesthetic value.

The game is produced by Chrisbo I.P. Holdings Limited in New Zealand.  History  Cathedral was invented between 1962 and 1979 by Robert Moore (16 August 1942 ‚Äì 19 June 1998), a pilot in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. Inspiration for the game was provided by Christchurch Cathedral and its environs in Christchurch, New Zealand. From the air, Moore was fascinated by the way the cathedral and neighbouring buildings intricately fit together, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. He conceived of a game involving players trying to build interlocking buildings around a cathedral. In 1979 Moore presented a prototype version of his game to Brightway Products, a New Zealand wooden toy and game company. Two versions of the game were originally created: a \\"formal piece\\" using three-dimensional wooden models of mediaeval buildings and towers; and an \\"abstract piece\\" consisting of two-dimensional squares. The formal piece proved more popular and is the only version produced today; in Standard, Tournalux (larger), and Grandelux (larger and higher quality) versions. The game was also recreated from as early as 1985 (from Mattel) in a more consumer accepted version in plastic moulded version with very highly detailed parts as well as a grided locking system added to the board. It is generally accepted that the concept of the game is not subject to copyright. However, the name and specific wording of the rules and gameplay are copyright 1998 Chrisbo I.P. Holdings Limited.  Overview  The idea of the game is to capture territory on the game board, allowing you to place all of your gamepieces while preventing your opponent from doing likewise.  Equipment  Cathedral is played on a wooden board divided into a 10x10 grid. The board is enclosed by turreted walls and represents a medieval city. There are 29 pieces, all small abstracts of buildings. One building is the Cathedral, painted grey. The rest of the buildings are divided into 14 dark and 14 light pieces, one set for each player. Notable is the fact that two of the pieces are configured differently between colors: the Academy and the Abbey. In the standard and tournalux versions of the game the darker pieces are stained, in the grandelux version they are made of a darker hardwood. The pieces and the game board are covered with a lacquer finish. A plastic version was produced for a short period in the mid 1980s.  Rules  Whichever player is using the \\"light\\" pieces begins by placing the Cathedral anywhere within the play area, aligned with the squares. Next the \\"dark\\" player places one of their game pieces on the board. Play alternates between the two sides until one side is unable to make a move. At this point, the other side attempts to place all of their remaining pieces in areas they have captured. Players may capture territory within the city by completely enclosing it with their pieces alone, or with the help of the city walls. Boundaries of these areas must be \\"wall to wall;\\" that is, if two of the surrounding pieces only touch on their corners, that's not a capture. If the captured territory contains one and only one of the opponent's pieces or the cathedral, that piece may be removed and the opponent may no longer place pieces in that area. An opponent's piece so removed can return to play at a later stage, but the cathedral will remain absent for the remainder of the game. If the territory contains more than one piece (including the Cathedral), it is not captured and remains available for the opponent to use. Strategy: Use the largest pieces first, don't play into your captured space until you have no pieces left that will fit into the uncaptured areas. The winner is the player who manages to place all of their pieces, while preventing their opponent from doing so. If neither player is able to place all of their pieces, then the player whose remaining pieces would take up the smaller area is declared the winner. When playing multiple games in a row, players alternate placing the Cathedral and moving first. At the end of each game, each player gets a score based on the number of squares that their opponent's remaining buildings would occupy. Because of the different configuration in the two pieces mentioned above (in equipment), a good way to play multiple games is a 4-game set, with players playing each color twice, players alternating playing the Cathedral and moving first.  Solved/fix  It is argued by ludologist Tom Lehmann that Cathedral is \\"broken\\", in that there is an opening strategy for the first player that cannot be countered by the second player. The suggested fix is for the second player to also place the Cathedral along with their first piece.

After he was shot and killed by Prince Pierre Bonaparte, a cousin of the French Emperor Napoleon III (), Noir became a symbol of opposition to the imperial regime. His tomb in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris has become a fertility symbol. Life Son of a Jewish cobbler who had converted to Catholicism, born Yvan Salmon at Attigny, Vosges, he adopted \\"Victor Noir\\" as his pen name after his mother's maiden name. He went to Paris and became an apprentice journalist for the newspaper La Marseillaise, owned and operated by Henri Rochefort and edited by Paschal Grousset. =Background to shooting= In December 1869, a dispute broke out between two Corsican newspapers, the radical La Revanche, inspired from afar by Grousset and the loyalist L'Avenir de la Corse, edited by an agent of the Ministry of Interior named Della Rocca. The invective of la Revanche concentrated on Napoleon I. On 30 December, l'Avenir published a letter to its editor authored by Prince Pierre Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon, and cousin of Emperor Napoleon III, who by then had ruled more than twenty years. Prince Bonaparte castigated the staff of la Revanche as cowards and traitors. The letter made its way from Bastia to Paris. Grousset took offense and demanded satisfaction. In the meantime, la Marseillaise lent strong support to the cause of la Revanche. On 9 January 1870, Prince Bonaparte wrote a letter to Rochefort, claiming to uphold the good name of his family: =Shooting= On the following day, Grousset sent Victor Noir and Ulrich de Fonvielle as his seconds to fix the terms of a duel with Pierre Bonaparte. Contrary to custom, they presented themselves to Prince Bonaparte instead of contacting his seconds. Each of them carried a revolver in his pocket. Noir and de Fonvieille presented Prince Bonaparte with a letter signed by Grousset. But the prince declined the challenge, asserting his willingness to fight his fellow nobleman Rochefort, but not his \\"menials\\" (ses man≈ìuvres). In response, Noir asserted his solidarity with his friends. According to Fonvieille, Prince Bonaparte then slapped his face and shot Noir dead. According to the Prince, it was Noir who took umbrage at the epithet and struck him first, whereupon he drew his revolver and fired at his aggressor. That was the version eventually accepted by the court. Aftermath A public outcry followed and on 12 January, led by political activist Auguste Blanqui, more than 100,000 people joined Noir's funeral procession to a cemetery in Neuilly. Attendance in this procession was regarded as a civic duty for republicans. When Marie Fran√ßois Sadi Carnot endorsed electoral candidates, he often identified them as such attendees. (\\"\\") At a time when the emperor was already unpopular, Pierre's acquittal on the murder charge caused enormous public outrage and a number of violent demonstrations. The Franco-Prussian War resulted in the overthrow of the Emperor's regime on 4 September 1870 and the establishment of the Third Republic. In 1891 the body of Victor Noir was moved to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Monument CP - Tombeaux historiques - 002 - Noir A life-sized bronze statue was sculpted by Jules Dalou to mark his grave, portrayed in a realistic style as though he had just fallen on the street, dropping his hat which is depicted beside him. The sculpture has a very noticeable protuberance in Noir's trousers. This has made it one of the most popular memorials for women to visit in the famous cemetery. The myth says that placing a flower in the upturned top hat after kissing the statue on the lips and rubbing its genital area will enhance fertility, bring a blissful sex life, or, in some versions, a husband within the year. As a result of the legend, those particular components of the otherwise verdigris (grey-green oxidized bronze) statue are rather well-worn and shiny. In 2004 a fence was erected around the statue of Noir, to deter superstitious people from touching the statue. However, due to supposed protests from the \\"female population of Paris\\", in fact led by French TV anchor P√©ri Cochin, it was torn down again.

He played baritone saxophone, alto saxophone, and Fender bass and was known for his 40-year association with Sun Ra. His son, Deval Patrick, was governor of Massachusetts. Early life Patrick was born in East Moline, Illinois, to Laverne and Laurdine Kenneth Patrick His father (1905‚Äì2001), a native of Kansas, worked as an iron moulder at a factory at the time of his son's birth. Patrick first learned piano, drums, and trumpet as a child, and then switched to saxophones. He attended and studied music at DuSable High School in Chicago, where he met future bassist Richard Davis and future saxophonists John Gilmore and Clifford Jordan. Patrick was baritone saxophonist for the Regal Theater's house band while still at school. \\"In 1949 he enrolled at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, but he soon returned to the Chicago area to study at Wilson Junior College.\\" Later life and career Patrick first played in one of Sun Ra's bands as part of a trio around 1950. He played occasionally in Ra's Arkestra from around the same time, and then became a regular band member in 1954. In February 1955, Patrick married Emily Wintersmith in Cook County, Illinois. His children with Emily were Deval Patrick and Rhonda Sigh. He had at least one child, La'Shon Anthony, outside his marriage. In 1959, a woman called for Patrick and his wife asked for a message. This precipitated the breakup of his marriage that year. In 1960, Patrick left Emily, Deval and Rhonda, and moved out of their apartment. When four-year-old Deval chased after him, he slapped his son and continued.Hillary Chabot, \\"Gruff Deval Patrick rankled Beacon Hill\\", Boston Herald, April 12, 2011. He refused to sign Deval's application to Milton Academy, arguing that Deval would lose his African-American identity there. Deval, whose tuition was paid by scholarship, was accepted anyway. Deval saw his father only rarely during his life.\\"'Lessons' From Deval Patrick: A (Not) Likely Story\\", NPR Books, April 12, 2011. Patrick resided for several years in the Arkestra's communal residences in New York City's East Village and Philadelphia. The Arkestra, with Patrick, moved to New York in 1961. He also played with John Coltrane (appearing on Africa/Brass in 1961), Blue Mitchell (A Sure Thing, 1962), Mongo Santamar√≠a (\\"Yeh, Yeh\\", which he composed, and \\"Watermelon Man\\") and Thelonious Monk (early 1970s). He also extensively backed Babatunde Olatunji. In December 1965, Patrick was remarried in Las Vegas, Nevada, to Edna Jean Ballinger. In 1972, Patrick co-founded the Baritone Saxophone Retinue, which recorded two albums for Saturn Records. He toured Europe with Ra in 1970 and 1976, and was part of some other Arkestra performances in that decade, but he also devoted time to teaching at the State University of New York at Old Westbury. He was a frequent member of the Arkestra again from 1986 to 1988. Grove Music wrote that, \\"Patrick was a well-schooled, versatile soloist and ensemble player and made an important contribution to Sun Ra's music. Besides his principal instrument, which was baritone saxophone, he played flutes, bass, and percussion.\\" He died from leukemia in Moline, Illinois, on December 31, 1991.

It is the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use. The baritone saxophone uses a mouthpiece, reed, and ligature in order to produce sound. It is larger than the tenor, alto and soprano saxophones, which are the other commonly found members of the family, and it is pitched one octave below the alto. The baritone saxophone is commonly used in concert bands, chamber music, military bands, and jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos). It also is occasionally employed in rock bands and marching bands, though less frequently than other saxophones due to its size, weight, and cost. History The baritone saxophone was created in 1846 by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax as one of a family of 14 instruments, developed to be a tonal link between the woodwinds and brasses, which Sax believed to be lacking. The family was divided into two groups of seven saxophones each from the soprano to the contrabass. Though a design for an F baritone saxophone is included in the C and F family of saxophones, no known F baritones exist. The family consisting of saxophones in the keys of B and E was more successful because of their popularity in military bands, and the E baritone is the fifth member of this family. Originally, like all saxophones the baritone was keyed to low B, but a low B mechanism was patented in 1887 and by 1910 this was standard for most saxophones including baritones. Over time players began creating 'low A pipes' to insert into the bell and extend the range to the very useful pitch of low A (concert C2), at the expense of making low B inaccessible and low B out of tune. This method is still used today by some players. From the 1930s through the 1950s, manufacturers experimented with extending the bell to add a low A key to the horn. The simplest way was to add a cylindrical section between the bell and bow to provide the extra length and tone hole, and some makers produced and sold instruments built this way, but these horns generally suffer from intonation problems in the lowest few notes and players often consider their tone poor as well. Selmer Paris began producing low A versions of the Mark VI baritone saxophone in the late 1950s which had a bell that had been designed separately from the low B version (such a bell may have been a custom-order option before this time), and these instruments do not generally suffer from the same intonation problems as horns with a cylindrical extension. In the 1970s, Yamaha's YBS-61 was keyed to low A with no low B option, and by the 1980s most baritones were being manufactured with a low A bell. In modern times, only a few manufacturers still produce low B instruments, as the low A is considered standard and is often written in sheet music for the instrument. In its original form, the baritone saxophone's highest keyed note was high Eb, but instruments keyed to high F became standard during the 1920s. High F# became a rare option starting in the 1950s and slowly became more common, but as with other modern saxophones, most baritones are now manufactured with a high F key. Description The baritone saxophone, like other saxophones, is a conical tube of thin brass. It has a wider end, flared to form a bell, and a smaller end connected to a mouthpiece. The baritone saxophone uses a single reed mouthpiece like that of a clarinet. There is a loop in the top of the body (sometimes also known as the 'pigtail') in two U-shaped pieces of tube called the upper bow and spit bow, to reduce it to a practical height. Baritone saxophones are typically found in two versions with one ranging to low A and the other to low B. Despite the ubiquity of the low A horn, some players still prefer to use B horns because of the added weight of a low A bell or because of personal preference for a particular vintage instrument. Some also believe low A horns sound inferior in the low range, however this is the subject of debate among players. The baritone saxophone's relatively large mass (, depending on the manufacturer's choice of material and structural designs, and whether it has a low A key) has led to the development of harness-style alternatives to neckstraps which distribute the instrument's weight across the user's shoulders. Several different kinds exist which each distribute weight differently across the saxophonist's neck, clavicle, and shoulder blades. Many marching saxophonists prefer this style for its ability to decrease fatigue. Those who mainly perform seated, on the other hand, may dislike the decreased ability to move one's upper body with a harness. Some modern instruments are also produced with mounts for floor pegs to reduce weight on the player's neck when seated, similar to those found on bass clarinets. Transposition It is a transposing instrument in the key of E, pitched an octave plus a major sixth lower than written. It is one octave lower than the alto saxophone. Modern baritones with a low A key and high F key have a range from C2 to A4. Adolphe Sax also produced a baritone saxophone in F intended for orchestral use, but these fell into disuse as the saxophone never became a standard orchestral instrument. As with all saxophones, its music is written in treble clef. By coincidence, it is possible to use a trick known as clef substitution to read music written in bass clef at concert pitch (for example most tuba or bassoon parts), by reading as if it were a transposing part in treble clef and pretending there were three more sharps (or three fewer flats) in the key signature. A similar trick allows instruments in B like the tenor saxophone to read concert pitch tenor clef. In classical music The baritone saxophone is used as a standard member of saxophone quartets. It has also been occasionally called for in music for orchestra. Examples include Richard Strauss' Sinfonia Domestica, which calls for a baritone saxophone in F; B√©la Bart√≥k's The Wooden Prince ballet music; Charles Ives' Symphony No. 4, composed in 1910‚Äì1916; and Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris. In his opera The Devils of Loudun (Die Teufel von Loudun), Krzysztof Penderecki calls for two baritone saxes. Karlheinz Stockhausen includes a baritone saxophone in Gruppen. It has a comparatively small solo repertoire although an increasing number of concertos have appeared, one of these being \\"Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra\\" by American composer Philip Glass. This is a piece that can be played with or without an orchestra that features the baritone sax in the second movement. In jazz music A number of jazz performers have used the baritone saxophone as their primary instrument. It is part of standard big band instrumentation (the larger bass saxophone was also occasionally used up until the 1940s). As phrased by Alain Cupper from JazzBariSax.com, \\"Used a few times in contemporary classical music...it is especially in jazz that this wonderful instrument feels most comfortable.\\" One of the instrument's pioneers was Harry Carney, longtime baritone saxophone player in the Duke Ellington band. Since the mid-1950s, baritone saxophone soloists such as Gerry Mulligan, Cecil Payne, and Pepper Adams achieved fame, while Serge Chaloff was the first baritone saxophone player to achieve fame as a bebop soloist. In free jazz, Peter Br√∂tzmann is notable. A noted Scottish performer is Joe Temperley, who has appeared with Humphrey Lyttelton as well as with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. More recent notable performers include Hamiet Bluiett (who has also led a group of baritone saxophone players), John Surman, Scott Robinson, James Carter, Stephen \\"Doc\\" Kupka of the band Tower of Power, Nick Brignola, Gary Smulyan, Brian Landrus, and Ronnie Cuber. In the avant-garde scene, Tim Berne has doubled on bari. Jazz/funk player Leo Pellegrino of Lucky Chops and Too Many Zooz has become popular with younger listeners for his aggressive playing style and energetic performances. In other music Baritone saxophonist in a military band of the Italian army. The baritone sax is an important part of military bands and is common in musical theater. The baritone sax also plays a notable role in many Motown hits of the 1960s, and is often in the horn sections of funk, blues, Latin, soul bands, and is used in rock music although it is not as common. Prominent baritone saxophonists in contemporary American popular music include Stephen Kupka of Tower of Power, Dana Colley of Morphine, and Leroi Moore of the Dave Matthews Band. Nigerian Afrobeat singer, musician, and bandleader Fela Kuti typically featured two baritone saxophone players in his band. A few modern non-jazz artists have recently begun to incorporate saxophones into their instrumentation. The LA Indie rock band Fitz and The Tantrums featured both an alto and a baritone saxophone in their music‚Äîmost recently their 2016 song \\"Handclap\\" from an album of the same name. Both were played by band member James King. The \\"Brass house\\" (experimental jazz/funk) group Too Many Zooz is another group that has popularized the baritone saxophone. Originally a New York City subway band, the trio has released three albums and been featured on a TEDxYouth@Budapest segment. In popular culture Lisa Simpson from the cartoon comedy series The Simpsons plays the baritone sax.

Childhood and Education  Oglethorpe was born in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, England (where he later founded a school), the third son of George Oglethorpe. He attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was elected a Fellow in 1524.1500-1714, Oade-Oxwick He completed his BA in 1525, received his MA in 1529, and his BTh and DTh in 1536. He was reputed to have taken a keen interest in his studies.  Career  Oglethorpe was appointed a Junior Proctor at Oxford University in 1533. He served as President of Magdalen from 1536 to 1552, was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford for 1551‚Äì1552, and was again President of Magdalen from 1553 to 1555. In addition to being one of Henry VIII's chaplains, he was also a canon of both Christ Church, Oxford, and St. George's Chapel, Windsor (1540‚Äì1553). In 1541 he was appointed Rector of Romaldkirk in the newly-created Diocese of Chester. The exact date is not recorded but he was appointment by Henry VIII himself. He was deprived of the freehold of the living on 4th August 1559 (just over a month after being deprived of his See for failing to take the Oath of Supremacy to Elizabeth I). Oglethorpe was unpopular with the 'reformers' at Oxford, and he was forced to resign his university offices during the reign of Edward VI. His fortunes changed under Mary I, and was appointed Dean of Windsor and Registrar of the Order of the Garter, serving from 1553 to 1556. Bishop of Carlisle (including the coronation of Queen Elizabeth) Oglethorpe was consecrated Bishop of Carlisle on 15 August 1557 alongside Thomas Watson, Bishop of Lincoln, and David Poole, Bishop of Peterborough. When Mary I died on 17 November 1558, she was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth. Oglethorpe was chosen (for unknown reasons) to celebrate Elizabeth's Christmas Day mass in the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace. Oglethorpe refused Elizabeth's instruction to not elevate the host at its consecration (an action that implied the corporeal presence of Christ). According to a letter sent by Don Aloisio Schivenoglia to Ottaviano Vivaldino, the Mantuan ambassador, Oglethorpe remained adamant that he could not alter the service, as it was against both his conscience and his training. So, after the gospel had been read, Elizabeth walked out of the service to avoid witnessing the elevation of the host. It remains unclear as to why Oglethorpe was presiding at the service (the Queen's chaplains usually presided at services in the Chapel), especially as the way the Schivenoglia describes the event, Elizabeth was pre-warned that Oglethorpe would elevate the host, meaning that she could have found a different presider. For reasons that scholars have never been able to explain, and despite his 'performance' at the Christmas Day mass, Oglethorpe would go on to preside at Elizabeth's coronation only a few weeks later. As was traditional, the coronation took place in Westminster Abbey on 15 January 1559. Oglethorpe greeted Elizabeth in Westminster Hall, and sprinkled her with holy water. Then, during the service itself, Elizabeth was anointed and invested with the sacred regalia; she was crowned three times, with the crown of St Edward, the imperial state crown, and a third crown (which had likely been made for Mary's coronation); and she swore the coronation oath, which included the distinctly Protestant promise to rule according to \\"true profession of the Gospel established in this Kingdom\\"‚Äîall of which was administered or performed by Oglethorpe. The service, however, was celebrated by George Carew, the newly installed Dean of the Royal Chapel. Carew's celebration was likely to prevent Oglethorpe elevating the host, and to allow the epistle and the gospel to be read in English. After parliament passed the Elizabethan religious settlement, the Church of England became formally Protestant. Oglethorpe refused to swear the required Oath of Supremacy, and was deprived of his See on 26 June 1559. After his deprivation, Oglethorpe remained in London under loose house arrest. He drew up his will on 10 November 1559, and died on 31 December 1559. He was buried in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church, Fleet Street, on 6 January 1560.

The final revision (v3.74) of the GUS Classic features of onboard RAM (upgradeable to 1024 kB through DIP sockets), hardware analog mixer, and support for 16-bit recording through a separate daughterboard based on the Crystal Semiconductor CS4231 audio codec. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1993 criticized the UltraSound's Sound Blaster emulation and lack of native support in games, stating that \\"it is hard to recommend this card to anyone other than a Windows MIDI musician\\". =UltraSound MAX= Gravis UltraSound MAX Released in 1994, UltraSound Max is a version of GUS with CS4231 codec on board, 512 kB of RAM on board (upgradeable to 1024 kB with a single SOJ chip) and Panasonic/Sony/Mitsumi CD-ROM interface slots. CS4231 provides support for Windows Sound System specs, although the IO port range doesn't match the WSS hardware, and can be used for SoundBlaster emulation. The software CD includes a demo that featured \\"3D holographic sound\\" through the use of software HRTF filters. Gravis UltraSound PnP Pro =UltraSound Plug & Play (PnP)= Released in 1995, a new card based on AMD InterWave technology with a completely different sound set. Supposedly Synergy acted as the ODM- producer for it (as evidenced by their logo on the rear side of the card, although early and now very rare GUS PnP cards did not have Synergy logo). The card features 1 MB of sound ROM, no onboard RAM (although it can be expanded to 8 MB with two 30-pin SIMMs), and ATAPI CD-ROM interface. A 'Pro' version adds 512 kB of on-board RAM required for compatibility with GUS Classic. In 2014 a RAM adapter for 72-pin SIMM was produced by retro-computer enthusiasts that made it possible to install 16 MB of RAM on the 'Pro' version without any modifications to the card. =UltraSound ACE (Audio Card Enhancer)= Released in 1995, this budget version of UltraSound Classic has 512 kB of RAM (upgradable to 1024 kB, just as is the MAX), and has no game port or recording ability. Marketed as a competitor to Wave Blaster-compatible cards, it is supposed to be installed alongside a SoundBlaster Pro/16 card as a sample- based synthesis (marketed as 'wavetable synthesis') upgrade. A prototype of this card was named \\"Sound Buddy\\". Gravis UltraSound ACE =UltraSound CD3= An OEM version of UltraSound Classic produced by Synergy, with of RAM features AT-BUS CD-ROM interfaces: Sony, Mitsumi and MKE/Panasonic standards. This is the only Gravis soundcard with a green circuit board. It's similar to a few card clones, including the Primax SoundStorm Wave (model Sound M-16B) and the AltraSound. =UltraSound Extreme= Released in 1996, the UltraSound Extreme is a 3rd party OEM system combining the UltraSound Classic with an ESS AudioDrive ES1688 sound chip for Sound Blaster Pro and AdLib emulation. It was produced by Synergy as was the ViperMAX. It has 1 MB RAM by default, but cannot be upgraded any further. Gravis UltraSound Extreme =UltraSound Clones and OEM cards= All clones use original Gravis GF1 or AMD InterWave soundchip. * Primax SoundStorm Wave (GF1) - there are two variants of cards from the well known scanner and mouse producer. Re-labeled Altrasound as Sound M-16B and different Sound M-16C with 4x CD-ROM Interfaces. * Synergy ViperMAX (GF1) - same card later repacked as UltraSound Extreme, but with only RAM on board. * Expertcolor MED3201 (InterWave LC) - probably the only card with cut- down variant of GFA1 chip - AM78C200 InterWave LC. First series was with standard Am78C201KC. * Compaq Ultra-Sound 32 (InterWave) - one of the last InterWave cards was designed for Compaq Presario desktops. Newer \\"C\\" revision of InterWave - AM78C201AKC and TEA6330T fader. Produced by STB Systems. * STB Systems Soundrage 32 (InterWave) - standard InterWave card missing SIMM slots and IDE interface. There was \\"Pro\\" variant with 512 kB RAM. AM78C201KC chip. * Core Dynamics DYNASonix 3D/PRO (InterWave) - features additional DSP chip that offered a graphic equalizer and additional sound FX presets. * Philips PCA761AW (InterWave) - card design closely resembles the \\"AMD InterWave OEM Design\\" prototype. Has a footprint for 512kb RAM, often left unpopulated. AM78C201KC chip. * Reveal WAVExtreme 32 (InterWave) - AM78C201KC based design. Comes without RAM and has no sockets/footprints to add any. * As of February 2015 there are efforts by hobbyists to produce a new InterWave based UltraSound compatible soundcard named ARGUS. GF1 The GF1 was co-developed by Advanced Gravis and Forte Technologies (creator of the VFX1 Headgear virtual reality helmet) and produced by Integrated Circuit Systems under the ICS11614 moniker. The chip was actually derived from the Ensoniq OTTO (ES5506) chip, a next-generation version of the music-synthesizer chip found in the Ensoniq VFX and its successors. The GF1 is purely a sample-based synthesis chip with the polyphony of 32 oscillators, so it can mix up to 32 mono PCM samples or 16 stereo samples entirely in hardware. The chip has no built-in codec, so the sounds must be downloaded to onboard RAM prior to playback. Sound compression algorithms such as IMA ADPCM are not supported, so compressed samples must be decompressed prior to loading. The sound quality of the GF1 is not constant and depends on the selected level of polyphony. A CD- quality 44.1 kHz sample rate is maintainable with up to 14-voice polyphony; the sample rate progressively deteriorates until 19.2 kHz at the maximum of 32-voice polyphony. The polyphony level is software-programmable, so the programmer can choose the appropriate value to best match the application. Advanced sound effects such as reverberation and chorus are not supported in hardware. However, software simulation is possible; a basic \\"echo\\" effect can be simulated with additional tracks, and some trackers can program effects using additional hardware voices as accumulators. =Sample RAM= The UltraSound offers MIDI playback by loading instrument patches into adapter RAM located on the card, not unlike how instruments are stored in ROM on other sample-based cards (marketed as \\"wavetable\\" cards). The card comes with a 5.6 MB set of instrument patch (*.PAT) files; most patches are sampled at 16-bit resolution and looped to save space. The patch files can be continuously tweaked and updated in each software release. The card's various support programs use .INI files to describe what patches should be loaded for each program change event. This architecture allowed Gravis to incorporate a General MIDI-compatible mapping scheme. Windows 95 and 98 drivers use UltraSound.INI to load the patch files on demand. In DOS, the loading of the patches can be handled by UltraMID, a middleware TSR system provided by Gravis that remove the need to handle the hardware directly. Programmers are free to include the static version of the UltraMID library in their applications, eliminating the need for the TSR. The application programmer can choose to preload all patches from disk, resizing as necessary to fit into the UltraSound's on-board RAM, or have the middleware track the patch change events and dynamically load them on demand. This latter strategy, while providing better sound quality, introduces a noticeable delay when loading patches, so most applications just preload a predefined set. Each application can have their own UltraMID.INI containing a set of patch substitutions for every possible amount of sample RAM (256/512/768/1024 kB), so that similar instruments are used when there was not enough RAM to hold all of the patches needed (even after resampling to smaller sizes), and unused instruments are never loaded. This concept is similar to the handling of sample banks in digital samplers. Some games ‚Äî including Doom, Doom II and Duke Nukem 3D ‚Äî come with their own optimized UltraMID.INI. The UltraSound cards gained great popularity in the PC tracker music community. The tracker format was originally developed on the Commodore Amiga personal computer in 1987, but due to the PC becoming more capable of producing high-quality graphics and sound, the demo scene spilled out onto the platform in droves and took the tracker format with it. Typical tracker formats of the era included MOD, S3M and, later, XM. The format stores the notes and the instruments digitally in the file instead of relying on a sound card to reproduce the instruments. A tracker module, when saved to disk, typically incorporates all the sequencing data plus samples, and typically the composer would incorporate his or her assumed name into the list of samples. This primitive precursor to the modern sampler opened the way for Gravis to enter the market, because the requirements matched the capabilities of the GF1 chip ideally. The problem with the other sound cards playing this format was that they had to downmix voices into one or both of its output channels in software, further deteriorating the quality of 8-bit samples in process. An UltraSound card was able to download the samples to its RAM and mix them using fast and high- quality hardware implementation, offloading the CPU from the task. Gravis realized early on that the demo scene support could be a sales booster, and they gave away 6000 cards for free to the most famous scene groups and people in the scene. =Compatibility= As the GF1 chip does not contain AdLib- compatible OPL2 circuitry or a codec chip, Sound Blaster compatibility was difficult to achieve at best. Consumers were expected to use the included emulation software to emulate other standards, an activity not necessary with many other cards that emulated the Sound Blaster through their sound hardware. The emulation software ran as a huge TSR that was difficult to manage in the pre-Windows days of complicated DOS extenders. Although there was native support for many popular games that used middleware sound libraries like HMI (Human Machine Interfaces) Sound Operating System, the Miles Audio Interface Libraries (AIL), the Miles Sound System and others, the user had to patch the games by replacing the existing sound drivers with the UltraSound versions provided on the installation CD. Also, the UltraSound required two DMA channels for full-duplex operation, and 16-bit channels were generally faster, so many users chose to use them, but this led to errors for games that used the DOS/4GW DOS extender, which was common in the UltraSound's era. The two principal software sound emulators included with software package were: *SBOS, Sound Board OS ‚Äî Sound Blaster Pro 8-bit stereo emulation and AdLib FM synthesis. It was a real-mode software emulator that recreated the AdLib's OPL2 FM synth chip and required that the user had, at the least, a 286 processor. There were special versions for the UltraSound MAX (MAXSBOS) and AMD InterWave-based cards (IWSBOS), which made use of the CS4231 codec chip instead. *Mega-Em ‚Äî advanced emulation software that required at least a 386 processor and EMM manager with DPMI/VCPI support. Mega-Em emulated the 8-bit Sound Blaster circuitry for sound effects and the Roland MT-32/LAPC-I or Roland Sound Canvas/MPU-401 for music. It supported UltraMID TSR functionality. AMD InterWave The great potential of the original UltraSound enabled Advanced Gravis to license the new GFA1 chip and software to AMD, who were trying to make it into the sound chip market at the time. The chip, released in 1995, was named AMaDeus, with the AMD part number of Am78C201 and was marketed as InterWave. It was enhanced to handle up to 16 MB of onboard memory, IMA ADPCM-compressed samples, have no sample rate drop at full 32 voices, and featured additional logic to support hardware emulation of FM synthesis and simple delay-based digital sound effects such as reverb and chorus. It was compatible with CS4231 codec installed in the UltraSound MAX or 16-bit recording daughterboard for the UltraSound Classic. The sound \\"patch set\\" was reworked from a collection of individual instrument .PAT files to a unified .FFF/.DAT sound bank format, resembling SoundFont, which could be either ROM or RAM based. There were 4 versions of the sound bank: a full 16-bit 4 MB with 8-bit downsampled 2 MB version, and 16-bit 2 MB (different sample looping) with 8-bit downsampled 1 MB version. A converter utility, GIPC, was provided for making .FFF/.DAT banks out of .PAT/.INI collections. The reference card contained 1 MB Œº-law ADPCM compressed sound ROM, which contained basic General MIDI voices and sound samples to help FM emulation, and 2 slots for RAM expansion through 30-pin SIMMs. The IWSBOS emulator was reworked to include Mega-Em features such as General MIDI emulation, and the SBOS kernel was included in Windows 95 drivers to provide emulation in a DOS Box window. The process of patching middleware sound 'drivers' was greatly simplified with PREPGAME utility, which could fix most known DOS games automatically either by correctly installing and configuring native InterWave drivers or replacing the binaries for some rare devices like Covox. It could also update DOS/4GW extender to work around its 16-bit DMA bug. The GFA1 featured a GUS/MAX compatibility mode, but base card was not compatible with UltraSound Classic unless some memory was installed. The InterWave technology was used in Gravis UltraSound PnP line of cards. It was also licensed to various OEMs such as STB Systems, Reveal, Compaq, Core Dynamics, Philips and ExpertColor. Some high-end OEM variants contained full-blown 4 MB patch set in ROM and proprietary hardware DSPs to enable features like additional sound effect algorithms and graphic equalizer. Software drivers for the InterWave were written by eTek Labs, containing the same development team as the earlier Forte Technologies effort. eTek Labs was split off from Forte Technologies just prior to this effort. In August 1999, eTek Labs was acquired by Belkin and is currently their research and development team. Demise Some game developers of the time noted problems with the software development kit and the product's hardware design. On the user-side, the Sound Blaster emulation was especially hard to get right out of the box, and this resulted in a substantially high number of product returns at the store level and thus soured the retail channel on the product. Bundled software was refined over time, but Gravis could not distribute updates effectively. The company itself also created its own trouble. When Gravis's list of promised supporting game titles failed to materialize, the company lost credibility with consumers and commercial developers. Several publishers and developers threatened to sue the company over misrepresentation of their products ‚Äî pointing to outright fabrication of Gravis's list. The shareware games industry embraced the Gravis more than the retail games industry. Companies which did this in an early stage were publisher Apogee and developers id software and Epic MegaGames. Gravis can also claim victory in the demo scene, which had taken the GUS to its heart, ensuring a dedicated cult following for a number of years. But without the marketing and developer presence of Creative Labs, Gravis could not generate either the sales or support required for the Gravis soundcard to compete in the mainstream market against the de facto standard Soundblaster. Although the InterWave chip was a substantially improved version of the GF1 chip, this new design was not able to hold up with the Sound Blaster AWE32. More than that, AMD was facing financial troubles at the time so it was forced to close many projects, including the InterWave. Due to dwindling sales, Gravis was eventually forced out of the soundcard business, and the UltraSound's failure nearly took the entire company down with it. Advanced Gravis, once one of the dominant players in the PC peripherals marketplace, had bet much of the future of the company on the UltraSound and paid the price for its demise. Shareholders sued the company charging gross incompetence by its management, in regards to the entire UltraSound effort. After significant restructuring, including acquisition by competitor Kensington Technology Group (via its parent, ACCO World Corp), the company retreated to its core-market, the one which had made it a success ‚Äî joysticks and gamepads.

Loudon Snowden Wainwright III (born September 5, 1946) is an American songwriter, folk singer, humorist, and actor. His sister is Sloan Wainwright. He is the father of musicians Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, and Lucy Wainwright Roche, and is the former husband of the late folk singer Kate McGarrigle. To date, Wainwright has released 24 studio albums, 4 live albums and 6 compilations, as well as appearing in at least 18 television programmes and feature films. Reflecting upon his career in 1999, he stated, \\"You could characterize the catalog as somewhat checkered, although I prefer to think of it as a tapestry.\\" In October 2017, Wainwright released his autobiography, Liner Notes: On Parents & Children, Exes & Excess, Death & Decay, and a Few of My Other Favorite Things. Early life Wainwright was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the son of Martha Taylor, a yoga teacher, and Loudon Wainwright Jr., a columnist and editor for Life magazine. His great-great- grandfather was the politician and diplomat A. Loudon Snowden. His father was not a professional musician, but he played the piano and wrote some songs, exposing his children to musicians such as Tom Lehrer and Stan Freberg, whom Wainwright later cited as influences. Wainwright grew up in Bedford, New York, in Westchester County. Among his sisters is Sloan Wainwright, also a singer. He graduated from St. Andrew's School in Delaware, where the movie Dead Poets Society was filmed. Career Wainwright's career began in the late 1960s. He had played the guitar while in school but later sold it for yoga lessons while living in San Francisco. Later, in Rhode Island, Wainwright's grandmother got him a job working in a boatyard. An old lobsterman named Edgar inspired him to borrow a friend's guitar and write his first song, \\"Edgar\\". Wainwright soon bought his own guitar and in about a year wrote nearly twenty songs. He went to Boston and New York City to play in folk clubs and was eventually noticed by Milton Kramer, who became his manager. He signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, which released his self-tiled first album in 1970. Wainwright is perhaps best known for the 1972 novelty song \\"Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road)\\" and for playing Captain Calvin Spalding (the \\"singing surgeon\\") on the American television show M*A*S*H. His appearances spanned three episodes in its third season (1974‚Äì1975).imdb.com ‚Äì Loudon Wainwright III Retrieved October 6, 2008 Using a witty, self-mocking style, Wainwright has recorded over twenty albums on eleven different labels. Three of his albums have been nominated for Grammy Awards: I'm Alright (1985), More Love Songs (1986), and High Wide & Handsome: The Charlie Poole Project (2009), for which he won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in January 2010. Wainwright has also appeared in a number of films, including small parts in The Aviator, Big Fish, Elizabethtown, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Knocked Up, and the television series Undeclared and Parks and Recreation. In the UK he recorded sessions for John Peel from 1971 onwards and appeared on a simultaneous broadcast on BBC TV and on Radio 1 in February 1978 (known as Sight and Sound in Concert).BFI Film & TV Database Retrieved January 16, 2011 However, it was in the late 1980s that he gained much wider popularity in Britain when he appeared as the resident singer with comedian Jasper Carrott in his UK show, Carrott Confidential, and has remained popular in the UK ever since. He appeared as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live in the first season's fifth episode, which was broadcast on November 15, 1975. He performed \\"Bicentennial\\" and \\"Unrequited to the Nth Degree\\" as a guest of host Robert Klein. Wainwright has claimed that, like many of his contemporaries, he was inspired musically by seeing Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963. He was one of many young folksingers tagged as the \\"new Dylan\\" in the early 1970s, a fact that he later ruefully satirized in his song, \\"Talking New Bob Dylan\\", from the album History (1992). Wainwright was a judge for the 4th annual Independent Music Awards.Independent Music Awards ‚Äì Past Judges . According to his own liner notes, Wainwright entered a period of deep depression following the death of his mother in 1997 and believed he could never write again. Retreating to his mother's cabin in the woods, he underwent therapy and gradually recovered, eventually recording the soul-baring Last Man on Earth in 2001. Since then, his recording career has mostly returned to its previous frequency. In September 2006, Wainwright and musician Joe Henry began composing the music for the Judd Apatow film Knocked Up, which was released on June 1, 2007. In addition to composing the soundtrack, Wainwright appeared in the film in a supporting role as the protagonists' obstetrician.imdb.com ‚Äì Knocked Up Retrieved October 6, 2008 He has also composed music for the new theatre production of Carl Hiaasen's Lucky You, which premiered at the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Wainwright released a new studio album, Older Than My Old Man Now, in April 2012. Personal life Wainwright's first marriage, to the singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle, ended in divorce. During their marriage, they had two children, Rufus and Martha. Rufus was the inspiration behind two of Wainwright's songs: \\"Rufus Is a Tit Man\\" (referring to Rufus during breastfeeding) and \\"A Father and a Son,\\" a retrospective. Wainwright's songs inspired by Martha are \\"Pretty Little Martha\\" (composed about her as an infant), \\"Five Years Old\\" (about missing her fifth birthday), the confessional \\"Hitting You,\\" duet \\"Father/Daughter Dialogue\\" and comedy number, \\"I'd Rather Be Lonely.\\" Both Rufus and Martha are singer-songwriters. Rufus composed \\"Dinner at Eight\\", about his conflicted relationship with his father. Martha composed the song \\"Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole,\\" which according to her is about her father. They sang a duet on the song \\"Father Daughter Dialogue\\" (on Wainwright's 1995 album Grown Man) and collaborated on the song \\"You Never Phone\\" (on Wainwright's 2003 album So Damn Happy). Wainwright had a relationship with the singer Suzzy Roche, during which they had one daughter, Lucy Wainwright Roche, who is also a singer. The relationship ended, although Wainwright and Suzzy Roche remain on good terms and occasionally appear onstage together, sometimes with their daughter. Wainwright's second marriage, to Ritamarie Kelly, ended in divorce. They have a daughter, Alexandra (Lexie) Kelly Wainwright (born 1993). Since 2015, Wainwright has lived with Susan Morrison, an editor at The New Yorker.

Since 1855, the collection is a part of the Neues Museum on Berlin's Museum Island, which reopened after renovations in 2009. History Egyptian courtyard at the Neues Museum, lithograph by Eduard Gaertner (1862) The museum originated in the 18th century from the royal art collection of the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia. Alexander von Humboldt had recommended that an Egyptian section be created, and the first objects were brought to Berlin in 1828 under King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Initially housed in Monbijou Palace, the department was headed by the Trieste merchant Giuseppe Passalacqua (1797‚Äì1865), whose extensive collections formed the basis. A Prussian expedition to Egypt and Nubia led by Karl Richard Lepsius in 1842‚Äì45 brought additional pieces to Berlin. In 1850, the collections moved to its present-day home in the Neues Museum, built according to plans designed by Friedrich August St√ºler. The Nefertiti Bust, discovered during the excavations by Ludwig Borchardt in Amarna, was donated to the museum by the entrepreneur Henri James Simon in 1920; it quickly became its best-known exhibit. After World War II, during which the Neues Museum was heavily damaged by strategic bombing, the collections were divided between East and West Berlin. The main part remained in East Berlin and was displayed at the Bode Museum, while those artifacts evacuated to West Germany, including the Nefertiti Bust, returned to West Berlin. From 1967 to 2005, these items were housed vis-√†-vis Charlottenburg Palace. The whole collection was reunited again after the Reunification of Germany, when it returned to Museum Island. Collection The collection contains artefacts dating from between 4000 BC (the Predynastic era) to the period of Roman rule, though most date from the rule of Akhenaten (around 1340BC). The most famous piece on display is the exceptionally well preserved and vividly coloured bust of Queen Nefertiti. The collection was moved from Charlottenburg to the Altes Museum in 2005 and was rehoused within the newly reconstructed Neues Museum on Berlin's Museum Island in October 2009.

It is a cross of Folle blanche and the Noah grape, created in 1898 by the grape breeder Fran√ßois Baco. Folle blanche is its Vitis vinifera parent. Noah, its other parent, is itself a cross of Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 27 Oxford University Press 1996 Baco blanc was developed to produce some of the same flavors as Folle blanche but without the susceptibility to American grape disease and phylloxera. In the 20th century it was widely planted in the Gascony region for uses in brandy production. Both Armagnac and Cognac (from the Charentes and Charente-Maritime districts north of Gascony) are brandies made from white grapes - Ugni blanc, Folle blanche and Colombard - but only Armagnac was permitted under French regulations to use Baco blanc and until the late 1970s, Baco blanc was the primary grape of Armagnac.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 39 Harcourt Books 2001 Following the grape's decline in the late 20th century, there was some speculation about the future of the variety, especially after a 1992 Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) decree that all vines of Baco blanc were to be uprooted by 2010. However, advocates for the grape variety and its historical role in Armagnac were able to persuade French authorities to continue permitting its use in the distilled wines from the Armagnac region.Harper's Wine and Spirits \\"Baco to the Future \\" July 14th 2005 History and parentage Fran√ßois Baco, the breeder of Baco blanc. Baco blanc was bred in 1898 by French grape breeder Fran√ßois Baco from a crossing of the Vitis vinifera Folle blanche, which was having difficulties taking to the rootstock grafting after the phylloxera epidemic of the mid to late 19th century, and the American hybrid grape Noah (itself a previously crossing of an unknown Vitis labrusca species and the Vitis riparia grape Taylor. Four years earlier Fran√ßois Baco also use Folle blanche and an unknown species of Vitis riparia to produce a dark skin version of Baco blanc known as Baco noir.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 28, 238 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Prior to Baco noir's development, Folle blanche was the primarily grape variety for the eau de vie grape brandies produced in the Cognac and Armagnac regions of France. But, in addition to its difficulties with the new American rootstock, the grape was highly susceptible to several grape diseases including grey rot in the Cognac region and black rot in Armagnac. The aim of Fran√ßois Baco was to produce a grape that had many of the neutral flavors and characteristics which made Folle blanche favorable for distillation but without the susceptibility that had plagued Folle Blanche growers. While growers in the Cognac region began adopting Ugni blanc (the same grape known in Italy as Trebbiano), growers in the Armagnac region began to enthusiastically plant Baco's new white hybrid. For most of the 20th century, Baco blanc was the primary grape of the Armagnac region. Its reached it peak in the 1970s when more than 85% of all plantings in the area were Baco blanc, accounting for more than . However, as Ugni blanc began gaining more of a foothold in other Gascon wine regions, the plantings of Baco blanc began to gradually decline. By the end of the 20th century, Ugni blanc had eclipsed Baco blanc as the most widely planted grape in Armagnac. This decline lead to some speculation about the future of the variety, especially after a 1992 (INAO) degree that all vines of Baco blanc were to be uprooted by 2010. However, advocates for the grape variety and its historical role in Armagnac were able to persuade French authorities to continue permitting its use in the distilled wines from the Armagnac region. While far from its early to mid-20th century prominence, the variety continues to play an important role in the Armagnac region and, as of 2005, the Bureau National Interprofessionnel de L'Armagnac (BNIA) reported that the grape variety was still used in the production of nearly half of all Armagnac. Wine regions Since the end of the 20th century, Baco blanc has been falling out of favor as more growers replant with Ugni blanc (pictured) and other varieties. Baco blanc is found primarily in France and was one of the \\"work-horse\\" hybrids that the country turned to following the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century. While scattered plantings could be found throughout France, most of the Baco blanc plantings could be found on the west side of the country (in many of the areas where its parent vine, Folle blanche is found, from the South West France wine regions of Gascony all the way to the Loire Valley where it was particularly popular Muscadet and Anjou wine-Saumur regions of the \\"Middle Loire\\". The early to the mid-20th century saw a particular \\"boom period\\" in the Loire, with its cool maritime climate in most areas, for hybrid varieties. At late as 1979, Baco blanc along with other hybrid grapes such as Baco noir, Chambourcin, Plantet and Villard noir accounting for more than 10% of all grape plantings. But since the mid to late 20th century, the grape variety has fallen out of favor among French wine producers who are continuing pulling up their hybrid grapes and returning to vinifera-only plantings (which are permitted for Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e AOC wines). Even in its Armagnac stronghold, Baco blanc vines are being uprooted and replanted with Ugni blanc. Similarly, Baco blanc experienced a brief period of popularity in the emerging New Zealand wine industry during the 20th century but as that century drew to a close, New Zealand producers also turned away from the variety to concentrate on vinifera grapes such as M√ºller-Thurgau, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Today, what little Baco blanc is left in New Zealand is used primarily for distillations and spirits. Viticulture and wine styles A 1967 bottle of Armagnac. While Baco blanc does not share Folle blanche's sensitivities to grey and black grape rots, it can be susceptible to powdery mildew. This susceptibility is enhanced due to the tendency of Baco blanc vines to bud early and ripen late, putting at risk to rains and moisture of both early spring and early harvest time. However, while its growing season cycle doesn't bode well for wine production, its tendency to produce high acid, neutral flavor grapes with low sugars does work well for distillation. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, grape-based spirits made from Baco blanc often are not as fine and complex as those made from Folle blanche or Ugni blanc. But they do have a tendency to age quickly, which creates a market for brandies meant for near-term consumption. Synonym Baco blanc and its wines are known under a variety of synonyms including 22 A Baco, Baco 22 A, Baco 22-A, Baco 221, Maurice Baco, and Piquepoul de Pays.Baco blanc, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-11-24 References Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Hybrid grape varieties ","title":"Baco blanc"},{"id":"926389","text":"Harmony, also known as Node 2, is the \\"utility hub\\" of the International Space Station. It connects the laboratory modules of the United States, Europe and Japan, as well as providing electrical power and electronic data. Sleeping cabins for four of the crew are housed here. Harmony was successfully launched into space aboard Space Shuttle flight STS-120 on October 23, 2007. After temporarily being attached to the port side of the Unity node, it was moved to its permanent location on the forward end of the Destiny laboratory on November 14, 2007. Harmony added to the station's living volume, an increase of almost 20 percent, from to . Its successful installation meant that from NASA's perspective, the station was considered to be \\"U.S. Core Complete\\". Origin of name Interior of Harmony The unit formerly known as Node 2 was renamed Harmony in March 2007. The name was chosen from a competition involving more than 2,200 kindergarten through high school students from 32 US states. The Node 2 Challenge required students to learn about the space station, build a scale model, and write an essay explaining their proposed name for the module, which will serve as a central hub for science labs. The winning class was from Browne Academy. Specifications Crew members hanging out of the USOS crew quarters Harmony during assembly at the Space Station Processing Facility Harmony is the second of three node modules on the United States Orbital Segment (USOS). It is composed of a cylindrical, thick 2219-T851 aluminium alloy pressure shell with two endcones and is thermally insulated by a goldised Kapton blanket. It is protected from micrometeoroids by 98 panels, each made from a composite sandwich of stainless steel and 6061-T6 aluminium alloy, and a secondary barrier of Kevlar/resin. The design is based on the existing Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, as well as the European Space Agency's Columbus module (both of which have only one passive Common Berthing Mechanism [CBM]). There are six CBMs on Harmony: the aft CBM that connects it to Destiny is passive; the rest are active. Harmony is managed by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Its deployment expanded the Space Station, allowing it to grow from the size of a three-bedroom house, to the space equivalent of a typical five-bedroom house, once the Japanese Kib≈ç and European Columbus laboratories are attached. The Space Station robotic arm, Canadarm2, is able to operate from a powered grapple fixture on the exterior of Harmony. Harmony is equipped with eight International Standard Payload Racks: four avionics racks and four for stowage or crew quarters. After the cancellation of the Habitation Module, Harmony was chosen to house the American Crew Quarters. The first two were delivered on STS-126 and the second two on STS-128. Construction agreement In an agreement between NASA and the European Space Agency the Italian France-based company Thales Alenia Space built Harmony at its facility in Turin, Italy. Harmony arrived on June 1, 2003 at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida after its flight in an Airbus Beluga oversize cargo vehicle. Following post transportation inspection, the Italian Space Agency formally handed over Harmony to the European Space Agency (ESA). From there, ESA formally transferred ownership of Harmony to NASA on June 18, 2003, taking place in the Space Station Processing Facility of the Kennedy Space Center. The handover of Harmony completed a major element of the barter agreement, between ESA and NASA, that was signed in Turin on October 8, 1997. Paolo A. Nespoli, an ESA astronaut born in Milan, Italy, accompanied the Harmony module aboard STS-120 as a mission specialist. Launch Graphic showing the six CBMs on Harmony. Harmony was launched October 23, 2007 aboard STS-120, as the primary component of assembly mission ISS-10A. On October 26, the station's Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) removed Harmony from the shuttle cargo bay and temporarily mated it to the port side of Unity and, on October 27, the crew entered Harmony. After the Space Shuttle departed Harmony was relocated to the forward dock of the Destiny laboratory. It required three EVAs by the station crew to complete the installation. Connecting modules and visiting vehicles Space Shuttle Discovery while on its way to the ISS. Harmony was the first permanent living space enlargement to the ISS after the Pirs docking compartment was added in 2001. The Expedition 16 crew moved the Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) on November 12, 2007 from Destiny to the forward berth of Harmony. The combined PMA-2/Harmony unit was subsequently berthed to its final destination at the forward end of Destiny on November 14, 2007. All the following Space Shuttle missions would dock at this location. On February 11, 2008, ESA's Columbus laboratory was attached to the starboard hatch of the Harmony module during space shuttle mission STS-122. On March 14, 2008 the Experiment Logistics Module Pressurized Section (ELM-PS) of Kib≈ç was attached to its interim location: the zenith hatch of Harmony. During STS-124 a Space Shuttle mission flown by Space Shuttle Discovery, the Pressurized Module of Kib≈ç was added to the port side of Harmony and the ELM-PS was moved, leaving the zenith hatch empty. The zenith hatch was originally intended to be the permanent docking connector for the now canceled Centrifuge Accommodations Module (CAM). When the Space Shuttle flew the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLMs) to the station, the MPLM would be temporarily berthed to the nadir mechanism of Harmony. The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle and the American Commercial Resupply Service vehicles, Dragon and Cygnus, are temporarily berthed to either the nadir or zenith mechanism. In August 2016, the forward docking port was equipped with the international docking adapter delivered with the CRS-9 mission. This adapter was used for the first time for the automatic docking of the Crew Dragon spacecraft during its uncrewed test mission on March 3, 2019.

Reception In a contemporaneous review, the St. Louis Post- Dispatch stated that the repetition of most techno would be repellent to audiences but that this was not the case with the genre's \\"ambient strain\\", lumping Autechre with groups like The Orb and Ultramarine and artists such as Aphex Twin. The review found little relevance in citing individual tracks as highlights as they ebbed and flowed into each other, but stated that \\"the music is never boring and does inspire fits of introspection.\\" From retrospective reviews, David Stubbs of The Wire discussed both Incunabula and Amber stating the two were \\"terrific adventures in homebrewed Techno but not radically dissimilar in method from the work of their Warp contemporaries.\\" Raggett (AllMusic) stated that \\"despite the relative sameness in the basic arrangements of tracks covering the better portion of the album -- a few song subtractions wouldn't have hurt the 75-minute length any -- Incunabula still stands out as a better effort than many other U.K. techno albums of the early '90s.\\" The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the both Incunabula and Amber two and half stars out of five, describing them as \\"smart if unexciting ambient watercolors\\" that \\"give no indication of the innovations to follow\\". Pitchfork gave a positive review of the album, while echoing Raggett's comment on an excessive 75 minute running time with tracks like \\"Windwind\\" \\"exhausting it's 11-minute runtime\\" while praising tracks such as \\"Bike\\" and \\"Basscadet\\", described as a \\"fan favourite.\\" Fact would place the album at 11th place on their list of best albums of the 1990s, stating that it was a \\"symphony of whirrs, cranks and rattling spokes; its formal ingenuity and sheer, brute intensity have sealed its status as a set text for the ages.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from Incunabula's record sleeve. * Sean Booth ‚Äì writer, producer * Rob Brown ‚Äì writer, producer * Adrian Harrow ‚Äì assistance * Richard Brown ‚Äì assistance * Darrell Fitton ‚Äì assistance * Geoff Pesche ‚Äì mastering * The Designers Republic ‚Äì design * Daniel 72 ‚Äì original images See also * 1993 in music * Music of the United Kingdom (1990s) References External links * Incunabula at the official Warp website Category:1993 debut albums Category:Autechre albums Category:Warp (record label) albums Category:Wax Trax!

It is part of the road B507. This road is best known for the Abbey Road Studios and for featuring on the cover of the Beatles' 1969 album of the same name. Location The north western end of Abbey Road begins in Kilburn, at the junction with Quex Road and West End Lane. The road was once a track leading to Kilburn Priory, and its associated Abbey Farm, and was developed in the beginning of the nineteenth century. It continues south east for roughly a mile, crossing Belsize Road, Boundary Road, and Marlborough Place, ending at the junction of Grove End Road and Garden Road. History The Abbey National Building Society (now Santander UK) was founded in 1874 as, The Abbey Road & St John‚Äôs Wood Permanent Benefit Building Society, in one Baptist Church, on Abbey Road. The album by The Beatles‚Äô, Abbey Road (1969), features the Beatles walking across the northwestern zebra crossing, on the intersection of Abbey Road and Grove End Road. EMI's Abbey Road Studios is located at the south eastern end, at 3 Abbey Road, St John's Wood. The Beatles, Brockhampton, and many other famous popular music performers, have recorded at this studio, and the Beatles named their last studio LP after this street. The album‚Äôs cover photograph, shows the four group members walking across the zebra crossing, just outside the studio entrance. As a result of its association with the Beatles, since 1969, this part of Abbey Road has been featured on the London tourism circuit. The crossing was given status of Grade II Listed Building, by English Heritage, in December 2010. The zebra crossing, featured on the Beatles cover, has become a popular photo opportunity area, despite the road still being the busy thoroughfare for traffic. There have been stories about the zebra crossing, having been shifted from its original location, but these are ungrounded myths, based on the storm water drain, located on the north eastern corner of the crossing, which has been there since the establishment of the sewer system, in the City of Westminster. Abbey Road (street sign) The album cover of the Beatles has been parodied many times over the years. The street sign, on the corner of Grove End Road and Abbey Road, is now mounted high, on the building on the corner, to save the local council the expense of cleaning and replacing the sign, which was frequently defaced, or stolen. The council repaints the wall next to the zebra crossing every three months, to cover fans‚Äô occasional graffiti. Abbey Road is also one ward, of the City of Westminster. At the census of 2011, this ward had a population of 11,250.

His name means \\"the great road\\". He was born the son of Mashobane kaMangethe near Mkuze, Zululand (now known as KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa), and died at Ingama, Matebeleland (near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe). Many consider him to be the greatest Southern African military leader after the Zulu king Shaka. In his autobiography, David Livingstone referred to Mzilikazi as the second most impressive leader he encountered on the African continent. Leaving Zululand Mzilikazi was originally a lieutenant of Shaka but had a quarrel with him in 1823 and rebelled. Rather than face ritual execution, he fled northwards with his followers. He first travelled to Mozambique but in 1826 he moved west into the Transvaal due to continued attacks by his enemies. He absorbed many members of other tribes as he conquered the Transvaal, where he established a military despotism. He attacked the Ndzundza kraal at Esikhunjini, where the Ndzundza king Magodongo and others were kidnapped and subsequently killed at Mkobola river. For the next ten years Mzilikazi dominated the Transvaal. This period, known locally as the Mfecane [\\"crushing\\"] was characterised by devastation and murder on a grand scale. Mzilikazi eliminated all opposition and reorganised the captured territory to suit the new Matabele order. In 1831, after winning a battle against the Griqua people, Mzilikazi occupied the Griqua lands near the Ghaapse mountains. He used scorched earth methods to maintain a safe distance from all surrounding kingdoms. The death toll has never been satisfactorily determined, but it is believed that the region was so depopulated that the Voortrekkers were able to occupy and take ownership of the Highveld area without opposition in the 1830s. Meeting the Boers Voortrekkers began to arrive in Transvaal in 1836, resulting in several confrontations over the next two years during which the Matabele suffered heavy losses. By early 1838, Mzilikazi and his people were forced northwards out of Transvaal altogether and across the Limpopo River. Further attacks caused him to move again, at first westwards into present-day Botswana and then later northwards towards what is now Zambia. He was unable to settle the land there because of the prevalence of tsetse fly which carried diseases fatal to oxen. Mzilikazi therefore travelled again, this time southeastwards into what became known as Matabeleland (situated in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe) and settled there in 1840. After his arrival, he organised his followers into a militaristic system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka; under his leadership the Matabele became strong enough to repel the Boer attacks of 1847‚Äì1851 and persuade the government of the South African Republic to sign a peace treaty with Mzilikazi in 1852. Matebele Kingdom While Mzilikazi was generally friendly to European travellers, he remained mindful of the danger that they posed to his kingdom. In later years he refused some visitors access to his realm. The Europeans who met Mzilikazi include Henry Hartley, hunter and explorer; Robert Moffat, missionary; David Hume, explorer and trader; Andrew Smith, medical doctor, ethnologist and zoologist; William Cornwallis Harris, hunter; and the missionary explorer David Livingstone. During the tribe's wanderings north of the Limpopo, Mzilikazi became separated from the bulk of the tribe. They gave him up for dead and hailed his young heir Nkulumane as his successor. However, Mzilikazi reappeared after a traumatic journey through the Zambezi Valley and reasserted control. According to one account, his son and all the chiefs who had chosen him were put to death on his orders. A popular belief is that they were executed by being thrown down a steep cliff on the hill now called Ntabazinduna [hill of the chiefs]. Another account claims that Nkulumane was not killed with the chiefs, but was sent back to the Zulu Kingdom with a sizeable delegation which included warriors. During his journey south, he passed through the Bakwena territory in the northwestern Transvaal, near Rustenburg. At the time the Bakwena were struggling to repel repeated attacks from a neighbouring king, who laid claim to the territory that they occupied. Nkulumane assisted the Bakwena by leading his impi [regiment] in a battle in which Nkulumane himself killed the neighbouring chief. Following this victory the Bakwena convinced Nkulumane to settle in their territory, arguing that it would be futile to return to the Zulu kingdom as his father's enemies would probably kill him. Nkulumane settled and lived with his family in that area until his death in 1883. His grave, covered in a concrete slab, is on the outskirts of Rustenburg in Phokeng. The site of Nkulumane's grave is incongruously referred to as Mzilikazi's Kop [hill], even though it is his son who is buried there. After resuming his role as chief, Mzilikazi founded his capital from Ntabazinduna and named it ko-Bulawayo [place of slaughter]. Shaka's capital was also called Bulawayo.

Reilly during preparation for the first space walk utilizing the Quest Airlock in July 2001 The Quest Joint Airlock, previously known as the Joint Airlock Module, is the primary airlock for the International Space Station. Quest was designed to host spacewalks with both Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuits and Orlan space suits. The airlock was launched on STS-104 on July 14, 2001. Before Quest was attached, Russian spacewalks using Orlan suits could only be done from the Zvezda service module, and American spacewalks using EMUs were only possible when a Space Shuttle was docked. The arrival of Pirs docking compartment on September 16, 2001 provided another airlock from which Orlan spacewalks can be conducted.  Design  Reisman inside Quest The Quest Airlock consists of two segments, the \\"Equipment lock\\" that stores spacesuits and equipment, and the \\"Crew Lock\\" from which astronauts can exit into space. It was derived from the Space Shuttle airlock, although it was significantly modified to waste less atmospheric gas when used. It was attached to the starboard CBM of the Unity during STS-104. It has mountings for four high-pressure gas tanks, two containing oxygen and two containing nitrogen, which provides for atmospheric replenishment to the American side of the space station, most specifically for the gas lost after a hatch opening during a space walk. Quest was necessary because American suits will not fit through a Russian airlock hatch and have different components, fittings, and connections. The airlock is designed to contain equipment that can work with both types of spacesuits, however, it is currently only able to host American spacewalks because the equipment necessary to work with Russian space suits has not been launched yet, which required the Expedition 9 crew to take a circuitous route to a worksite because of problems with the American space suits.  Camp-out procedure  Quest provides an environment where astronauts can \\"camp out\\" before a spacewalk in a reduced-nitrogen atmosphere to purge nitrogen from their bloodstream and avoid decompression sickness in the low-pressure () pure- oxygen atmosphere of the spacesuit. In April 2006, Expedition 12 Commander Bill McArthur and Expedition 13 flight engineer Jeffrey Williams tested this new method of preparing for spacewalks by spending the night in the Quest Airlock. In the chamber, the pressure was reduced from the normal . Four hours into the Expedition 13 crew's sleep period, an error tone prompted mission controllers to cut short the activity, but the test was still deemed a success. American spacewalk activities thereafter have employed the \\"camp-out\\" pre-breathing technique. The previous method of preparing for spacewalks involved breathing pure oxygen for several hours prior to an EVA to purge the body of nitrogen.  High-pressure gas tanks  Two oxygen and two nitrogen high-pressure gas tanks are attached externally to the airlock. These tanks provide a replenishable source of gas to the atmosphere control and supply system and oxygen for recharging the space suits (EMUs). Recharging the high- pressure tanks was accomplished by the Space Shuttle fleet until its retirement. When an orbiter was docked to the station's Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMA-2 or PMA-3), oxygen was routed through pressure lines from the PMAs to the Quest Airlock. The pumping of the oxygen from the docked spacecraft tanks into Quests high-pressure tank was accomplished by the Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly (ORCA). After the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the Nitrogen Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) and spacecraft from the Commercial Crew Development program will take over this task.  Construction  This module was manufactured by Boeing, under contract by NASA at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 2000. It is made from aluminum and steel alloys.

Parriott that aired on NBC from October 4, 1985 to May 16, 1986.  Plot The show concerned super-powered humans and their madcap adventures. The team is formed by Dr. Billy Hayes, a research scientist at the Humanidyne Institute who specializes in \\"human anomalies\\". He works with shrinking Dr. Elvin \\"El\\" Lincoln, and together they recruit electrically powered Johnny Bukowski, a rock-and-roll musician, and Gloria Dinallo, a telekinetic teen.  Production  A double-length pilot and 15 additional episodes were created; however, one episode did not air before the show was cancelled due to low ratings. The name \\"Misfits of Science\\" and other conceptual ideas were the brainchild of then-president of NBC Entertainment, Brandon Tartikoff. He said of the show \\"We'll rely on the National Enquirer for story ideas. It's loosely inspired by the dynamics we saw in Ghostbusters... sort of a kick-back, Friday type of show.\\" In France, the series was known as Superminds, in Germany, as Die Spezialisten unterwegs (The Specialists on the way), in Brazil, as \\"Curto-Circuito\\" (\\"Short Circuit\\"), in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and rest of Lat√≠n-Am√©rica as Los Cientificos Rebeldes (The Rebel Scientists). Episode 9 was the first paid writing job for Tim Kring, who later originated and produced the thematically similar Heroes in 2006. = Title sequence = The main title sequence and its theme song were unusual for TV shows of the era. Donald Todd, head writer and story editor, described them as follows:  Cast and characters  * Dean Paul Martin as Dr. Billy Hayes, the non-powered leader of the team. He is a young research scientist at the Humanidyne Institute who specializes in \\"human anomalies\\" and a fast-talking but good-hearted schemer full of boyish enthusiasm who often gets the team into as much trouble as he gets them out of. Although easily distracted whenever an attractive woman walks by, he is honestly interested in getting involved in a serious relationship with Jane Miller even after she showed up pregnant by another man. * Kevin Peter Hall as Dr. Elvin \\"El\\" Lincoln, Billy's colleague and close friend. He is a towering man who gives himself the ability to shrink for minutes at a time from his height of seven- foot-four to eleven inches via hormonal treatments which he activates by pressing a nerve on the back of his neck. A recurring joke after such transformations is that he always has to put on the tiny change of clothes he carries with him for his small size. The character is shy and struggles socially, and despite being so tall he is a poor basketball player. * Mark Thomas Miller as Johnny \\"Johnny B\\" Bukowski, a rock-and-roll musician who was electrocuted on stage, thus giving him formidable electrical powers. He continually drains any electrically charged items in his surroundings, forcing him to live in isolation. He wears sunglasses because his eyes glow when he is fully charged. He can hurl lightning bolts and run at superhuman speed, easily outracing in one episode a parody of the Six Million Dollar Man, but he is vulnerable to water which short circuits him and burns his flesh. He is a big Chuck Berry fan, in the pilot singing \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" when he goes into battle. * Courteney Cox as Gloria Dinallo, a troubled telekinetic teen with a history of juvenile delinquency and a mother in a mental institution who claims Gloria's father is from outer space. She has a crush on Johnny. Gloria can only use her telekinesis on things that she can see: using a blindfold on her renders her powerless. * Diane Civita as Miss Nance, the scientists' secretary. Although she usually seems more interested in doing her nails, going on her coffee break, and watching her soap operas, she is actually the one who keeps their department running and is always there at the end of the show to turn off the lights and say good-night to the bunnies in their cages. * Jennifer Holmes as Jane Miller, Gloria's probation officer. Although attracted to Billy, she is often put off by his eccentric behavior. Her character appears only in the earlier episodes. * Max Wright as Dick Stetmeyer, the uptight director of the Humanidyne Institute. Unlike the other cast members, he is not actually considered to be one of the Misfits. * Mickey Jones as Arnold \\"Beef\\"/\\"Ice Man\\" Beifneiter, who got his power to freeze anything he touches from placing himself in an experimental cryogenic suspended animation unit back in 1937 due to grief caused by the loss of his beloved Amelia Earhart. The team drives around in an ice-cream truck (International Metro Mite M-800) because the lumbering and now rather simple- minded Ice Man dies if he gets too warm, so they keep him in the freezer. Beef only appears in the pilot episode due to legal objections from Marvel Comics who published a similarly-named character in X-Men, but the characters continue to use the ice-cream truck.

Haliacmon is the traditional English name for the river, but many sources cite the formerly official Katharevousa version of the name, Ali√°kmon. Today, the only official variant is the demotic Ali√°kmonas. It flows through the Greek regions of West Macedonia (Kastoria, Grevena and Kozani regional units) and Central Macedonia (Imathia and Pieria regional units). Name The name (in Greek) is composite and derives from (salt, sea) and (anvil). In Greek mythology Haliakmon was one of the Potamoi, who were sons of Oceanus and Tethys, according to the allegorical obsessive- anthropomorphic concept familiar to the Ancient Greeks, on geological upheaval after Deucalion's deluge. An ancient tradition says that sheep that drank water from Haliakmon would turn their colour to white. This tradition is confirmed by the following record of the Roman author Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) : Similarly in Macedonia, those who want their sheep to be white go to Haliakmon, while those (who want them to be) black (go) to Axios (Vardar). Ottoman Turks called the river Ince-Karasu (narrow-black water), a name still used in Turkey.

Course and tributaries Before the construction of its diversion dam near the village of Aghia Varvara in the mid-1950s, Haliakmon had no permanent river bed in its lowland course. It often flooded and formed extensive marshes. Its devastating fury in December 1935 remains fresh in memory of the elder inhabitants of the region (Veria and Alexandreia). The Haliacmon rises in the Gramos mountains in northern Greece, near the border with Albania. In its upper course it flows generally towards the east, and turns southeast near Kastoria. It describes a wide curve around the Vourinos mountains, and turns northeast near the village Paliouria. It feeds the large artificial Lake Polyfytos, that was created after the construction of the namesake hydroelectric dam and consists almost its entire course through the Kozani prefecture. Over the bridge runs the Lake Polyfytos Bridge, part of the Athens-Kozani national road. Southeast of Veria, the Haliacmon enters the central Macedonian plains, an area of great importance to agriculture. It flows into the Thermaic Gulf west of the delta of the Axios (Vardar), northeast of the coastal town Methoni. Haliakmon's tributaries include Gramos, Ladopotamos, Pramoritsa, Grevenitikos, Venetikos and Tripotamos. Course of the Haliacmon, as seen from the Terra satellite. (The river course has been highlighted.) bridge (1352 m.) over the Polyphytos artificial lake of the river Aliakmonas near Servia. The Haliacmon flows along the towns (in downstream order) Nestorio, Argos Orestiko, Neapoli, Paliouria, Velventos and Alexandreia. Wetland Haliacmon (Aliakmonas) Haliakmon contains 33 kinds of fish. These include brown trout, gilt-head bream, sardine, carp, pike, eel, european anchovy, nursehound, bogue, garfish, red porgy, saddled seabream, angler, bream, mediterranean sand smelt, sand steenbras, mullus barbatus, freshwater bass, tuna, salmon, Mediterranean moray, weever, longfin gurnard, dogfish, dusky grouper, school shark and turbot. About 30 of them are indigenous, while the rest were introduced by human intervention. Many of them are considered scarce and one, mavrotsironi, lives nowhere else in the world, i.e. it is endemic. Œúost of these kinds of fish have no commercial value but only biological, since they support the food web. Fish found in Haliakmon, like carp and rainbow trout, indicate that its water is still pure. Some eels are found in its estuaries, that cannot migrate, hindered by the dams. For amateur fishermen the river has been enriched with introduced rainbow trout, that is not easy to reproduce, so there is no danger of disturbance of the river's ecosystem. In the place where the river flows into the sea, there has been formed over the years an extended Delta of 4.000 hectares, because of the large dam that was constructed and retains much of the brought matters. As a result, silting has benn greatly reduced and during the summer, when there is no much water, the sea enters and largely overwhelms the river bed. Flathead mullets and European seabasses are found in Haliakmon's Delta. In the shallow marine areas formed there, the fry of many Aegean Sea's fish finds a place to reproduce, while about 90% of Greece's mussels are produced in the Haliakmon- Axios(Vardar) Delta. Aliki Kitrous is an area of 254 hectares, where 15-20.000 tons of salt are produced per year. Many kinds of birds have been observed in Haliakmon's region. They use it for accommodation and overwintering, like the ducks, or to rest on their long migratory journey. There have been observed 215 kinds of birds and about ‚Öì of them nest in the region. Over 10% of the birds are endangered. They include Dalmatian pelican and curlew, that are considered to be among the rarest birds in the world. 27 kinds of rare and protected kinds of birds nest in the region, like purple heron. History In antiquity, Claudius Ptolemy called the chain of mountains in which the river rises (northern Pindus) the Canalovii. According to Julius Caesar, the Haliacmon formed the line of demarcation between Macedon and Thessaly. In the upper part of its course it took a southeast direction through Elimiotis, which it watered; and then, continuing to the northeast, formed the boundary between Pieria, Eordaea, and Imathia. In the time of Herodotus the Haliacmon was apparently joined by the Loudias 7, 127, the discharge of the lake of Pella; but a change has taken place in the course of the Loudias, which no longer joins the Haliacmon, but flows directly into the Aegean Sea. The image below shows a wind gap between the Haliacmon and Loudias watersheds that is the probable ancient course of the Haliacmon. It was the domain of the eponymous river god Haliacmon.

It is, simply stated, a reel played at a slightly slower tempo, with slightly more emphasis on certain beats. This emphasis can be the same measure to measure or vary throughout the tune, depending on the player. Cut-dot snap rhythms, or \\"Scotch snaps\\", are a feature of both. These are short notes before a dotted notes, which in traditional playing is generally exaggerated rhythmically for musical expression. An example of a strathspey would be the song \\"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\\", provided it is sung staccato: > You'll tak the high road, and I'll tak the low road, and I'll be in Scotland > afore ye. Other examples are \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" (based on Sir Alexander Don's Strathspey) and \\"Coming Through the Rye\\" (based on an old strathspey tune called \\"The Miller's Daughter\\"). Because the strathspey rhythm has four strong beats to the bar, it is played quickly (generally ranging from 108 beats per minute, for Highland dance, up to 160 beats per minute, for step dance), and contains many dot-cut \\"snaps\\", it is a rhythmically tense idiom. Traditionally, a strathspey will be followed by a reel, which is in with a swung rhythm, as a release of the rhythmic tension created during the strathspey. It has been hypothesized that strathspeys mimic the rhythms of Scottish Gaelic song.Emmerson, George S. (1971). Rantin' Pipe and Tremblin' String: A History of Scottish Dance Music. London: J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd. p. 145. Among traditional musicians, strathspeys are occasionally transmitted as canntaireachd, a style of singing in which various syllables stand in for traditional bagpipe ornaments. The dance is named after the Strathspey region of Scotland, in Moray and Badenoch and Strathspey. Strathspey refers both to the type of tune and to the type of dance usually done to it (although strathspeys are also frequently danced to pastoral airs played at the same tempo; an example of which would be the dance Autumn in Appin, danced to the tune \\"The Hills of Lorne\\"). The strathspey is one of the dance types in Scottish country dancing. A Scottish country dance will typically consist of equal numbers of strathspeys, jigs and reels. The strathspey step is a slower and more stately version of the skip-change step used for jigs and reels. The strathspey also forms part of the musical format for competing pipe bands. Modern high grade pipe bands are required to play a march, a strathspey and a reel for competition purposes. The strathspey was originally conceived for the fiddle, using a peculiar bowing technique that would produce its characteristic \\"scotch-snap\\" rhythm; many newer strathspeys were written in the 18th and 19th centuries by composers such as William Marshall and James Scott Skinner, who utilised the full range of the fiddle to produce many memorable tunes. Skinner distinguished between dance tunes, which retained the staccato bowing (Laird o Drumblair), and airs which were for listening (Music of Spey). Angus Cumming produced the first collection of strathspeys to be published by a person from Strathspey. More recently, Muriel Johnstone has written some elegant piano strathspeys. These days there are at least four, some would say seven, varieties: the bouncy schottische, the strong strathspey, the song or air strathspey, all three of which can be enjoyed for dancing, and the competition strathspey for the Great Highland bagpipe, primarily intended as a display of virtuosity. Although band and solo competition bagpiping generally involves a complicated, heavily ornamented setting, traditional pipers often play simpler, more rhythmically driven versions. In the Irish tradition, strathspeys are largely relegated to the Scottish-influenced traditions of Donegal, where they are commonly called highlands. Unlike many duple-time tune types in the Irish tradition, Highlands are articulated with four distinct beats to the bar, rather than two. Unlike their Scottish counterparts, highlands are played with a smoother, less-jagged bowing articulation. The Irish repertoire also gravitates to tunes with long passages of triplets.Vallely, F. (1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music. New York: New York University Press. pp. 385‚Äì386. In the New World, the Cape Breton strathspey differs from its Scottish cousins in its rhythm patterns. While the dot-cut snaps are fairly standard in European strathspeys, in the Cape Breton style the dotted note can come before the short note, and the snaps can come at any point in the measure. These changes allow for the rhythmic \\"lift\\" needed for the Cape Breton style of Scottish step dancing. The dot-snap variations have been described as more \\"wild\\" than in Scottish playing.The Strathspey Server. \\"the Cape Breton strathspey connection...\\". Cape Breton dot-snaps often follow the same pattern within any given piece of music, and adhere to a local pattern shared among the community of Cape Breton-style players.Kimberley Fraser (20 February 2011). \\"Strathspeys...What Are They, And Why Are They So Tricky?!\\" The same tune can be played in the Scottish and Cape Breton styles, but will sound different.

History The Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory was a leased territory of the German Empire from 1898 to 1914 located around Jiaozhou Bay, where the village of Qingdao (Tsingtao) developed into a major seaport. Following Germany's defeat in the First World War and the resulting Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost Qingdao and its sphere of influence in Shandong. Instead of restoring Chinese sovereignty over the area, the treaty transferred the leased territory to the Empire of Japan. This resulted in popular dissatisfaction with the outcome, known as the Shandong Problem, and led to the May Fourth Movement. Eventually, Shandong was reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the Washington Naval Conference. However, Japan retained economic influence in the area.

It was developed by the French navy in the 1740s and spread to the British Royal Navy where it was classed as third rate. From here, it spread to the Spanish, Dutch, Danish and Russian navies. The design was considered a good balance between firepower and sailing qualities, but more importantly, it was an appealing ideal for naval administrators and bureaucrats. Seventy-fours became a mainstay of the world's fleets into the early 19th century. From the 1820s, they began to be supplanted by larger two- decked ships mounting more guns, and ultimately in the later 19th century by ironclads. As a standard type, the seventy-four was only an ideal construction. There was great variation between seventy-fours of different navies. In the period 1750‚Äì1790, different ships could measure from just under 2,000 to 3,000 tons burthen. The armament could also vary considerably, with everything from 24-pounder to long 36-pounder guns, and some seventy-fours of the Danish navy actually had only 70 guns.Glete (1993), pp. 83‚Äì86  First 74-gun designs  The first 74-gun ships were constructed by the French as they rebuilt their navy during the early years of the reign of Louis XV. The new ship type was a very large two-decker big enough to carry the largest common type of gun (36-pounders) on the lower gun deck, something only three- deckers had done earlier. This great firepower was combined with very good sailing qualities compared to both the taller three-deckers and the shorter old-style 70-gun two-deckers, making the 74 the perfect combination of the two. A disadvantage of the 74 was that it was relatively expensive to build and man compared to the older type of two-decker. Broadside of a French 74-gun ship from 1755 The 74-gun ship carried 28 (24-pounders- to 36-pounders) on the lower gun deck, 28‚Äì30 (18- to 24-pounders) on the upper gun deck, and 14‚Äì18 (6- to 12-pounders) on the upper works.Glete (1993), p. 84 Crew size was around 500 to 750 men depending on design, circumstances and nationality, with British ships tending to have smaller crews than other navies. The French had large and small seventy-fours, called \\"grand mod√®le\\" and \\"petite mod√®le\\", the waterline length of a \\"grand mod√®le\\" seventy-four could be up to 182 feet.Jean Boudriot, Hubert Berti, Les vaisseaux de 74 √† 120 canons : √©tude historique, 1650‚Äì1850, ANCRE, Paris, 1995, p. 12 This was copied by the Royal Navy in about two dozen such ships of its own, such as where they were known as Large, while the other seventy-fours built to be between were known as Common.Dodds, James & Moore, James, Building the wooden fighting ship, Hutchinson, London, 1984, p. 10 San√©'s design are present, but with a British-style layout. Given the construction techniques of the day, the seventy-four approached the limits of what was possible. Such long hulls made from wood had a tendency to flex and sag over time. Increased maintenance could counter this to some extent, but this was of course costly. This limited the success of the even bigger two-deck 80-gun ships that were built in small numbers after the seventy-four had been introduced. Three-deckers did not have the same problem due to their additional deck giving more rigidity. The significance of the 74s however is hard to overstate, as a summary of the ships of the line for all nations that were in commission at any time during the Revolutionary/Napoleonic Wars period. *1st & 2nd rates (130‚Äì90 guns) 156 *3rd rate 74s (70‚Äì90 guns) 408 *4th rate (60‚Äì68 guns) 199  74s in the Royal Navy  The Royal Navy captured a number of the early French 74-gun ships during the War of the Austrian Succession (for example, , captured at the first battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747) and the Seven Years' War and was greatly impressed by them compared to its own smallish 70-gun ships. As a result, it started building them in great numbers from about 1760, as did most other navies. Navies that were restricted by shallow waters, such as the Dutch and Scandinavian navies, at least early on tended to avoid the 74-gun ship to a certain degree due to its size and draught, preferring smaller two-deckers instead. Even so, the seventy-four was a standard feature in all European navies around 1800. Only a handful of 74-gun ships were commissioned into the United States Navy; the US Navy's early sea power concentrated on its frigates. The type fell into disuse after the Napoleonic Wars, when improved building techniques made it possible to build even bigger two-deckers of 84 or even 90 guns without sacrificing hull rigidity. The last seventy-four, the French Trafalgar veteran Duguay-Trouin, was scuttled in 1949. Her stern ornamentation is on display at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. In addition, dozens of ship models exist, produced as part of constructing the real ships, and thus believed accurate both externally and internally.

It lies partly in the London Borough of Barnet and partly in the London Borough of Brent, the border formed by Watling Street. It was part of Middlesex until it was transferred to Greater London in 1965. History The Lansdowne The name Burnt Oak was first used in 1754Weinreb, Ben; Hibbert, Christopher; Keay, Julia; and Keay, John (2011). The London Encyclopaedia (3rd edition), p. 116. Pan Macmillan. Retrieved 1 May 2014. and from then until the 1850s referred to no more than a field on the eastern side of the Edgware Road (Watling Street). Nor is there evidence that the name implies anything except that the field had once contained a burnt oak tree. In May 1844 Burnt Oak field was sold to a Mr Essex, and by the 1860s plans were in place to build three residential streets: North Street, East Street, and South Street. The application of the field name to the area seems to have followed from this new estate and was in use by the end of the 19th century. However, the area was generally known as Red Hill until the opening of Burnt Oak tube station. There were a handful of shops by the 1890s. There was a post office and grocery run by George and William Plumb, a bakery run by Caller & Poole, as well as James Huggett the greengrocer. A tramway along the Edgware Road to Cricklewood opened in 1905, but the population remained small, by 1921 still only around . Burnt Oak station on the London Underground's Northern line opened on 27 October 1924. It was first open on weekdays with a small booking hall suitable for a rural area. As it was on farmland south-east of the community in Edgware Road, Underground Electric Railways Company of London constructed a new road, Watling Avenue. In the same year news leaked out that the London County Council was to build a housing estate (Watling Estate), which was ready for its first occupants in April 1927. With this and other private estates the area was provided with a new station by 1928, and the population by 1931 had grown to . Along both sides of Watling Avenue shops were built along with a number of schools to serve the area, such as Woodcroft and Goldbeaters. In September 1931 Jack Cohen opened the first Tesco store at 54 Watling Avenue, Burnt Oak.Maurice Corina: Pile It High Sell It Cheap: The Authorised Biography of Sir Jack Cohen, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971Andrew Hosken: Like a Dame: The Scandals of Shirley Porter, Granta, 2007Sarah Ryle: The Making of Tesco: A story of British Shopping, Random House, 2013 In 1930, Dominican nuns established St Rose's Convent on Orange Hill Road, which led to the foundation of St James' Catholic High School in 1934. In 1936 Watling Market opened with a hundred covered shops and stalls, and the Co-op opened its department store at the junction of Stag Lane and Burnt Oak Broadway (now a Peacocks). =Watling Estate= The Watling Estate is one of 12 London County Council cottage estates built between the wars to provide Homes fit for Heroes.  Geography  Demography The 2011 census showed that for the Burnt Oak ward in Barnet, 47% of the population was white (30% British, 14% Other, 3% Irish). 13% was Black African and 12% Other Asian. Religiously, 50% was Christian and 18% Muslim.  Culture  The area is known for its variety of multicultural shops, reflecting the established Indian, Turkish and Nigerian communities. It has recently also attracted a community of Eastern Europeans, mainly from Romania, Poland and Bulgaria. Transport Burnt Oak is well served by buses. London Buses routes 32, 114, 142, 204, 251, 292, 302, 305, and Uno routes 614 and 644 all meet at the junction of Watling Avenue, Stag Lane and Burnt Oak Broadway.

Background and production With Confield, Sean Booth and Rob Brown largely abandoned the warm ambient sounds of their earlier works such as Amber and Tri Repetae in favour of more chaotic and abstract sound palettes and methods of composition that they had been pursuing with LP5, EP7, and Peel Session 2. Confield saw the experimental use of computer programs, specifically Max/MSP, to form the basis of songs instead of stand-alone synthesizers. According to Booth, \\"Most of Confield came out of experiments with Max that weren't really applicable in a club environment.\\" Like EP7 before it and their 2003 release Draft 7.30, Booth and Brown make use of generative sequences on Confield. However, in an interview following the release of Draft 7:30, Booth explained that although the beats they create using generative sequences may seem completely random to some, he and Brown exercised tight control over the limits and rules of what the beats could do. \\"[On Confield] you have something that some people would call random, but I would say is quantifiable,\\" Booth said. \\"It seems that for a lot of people, if they hear something that doesn't sound regular, they assume it's random. If live musicians were playing it, they'd probably call it jazz or something. But the fact that it's coming out of a computer, as they perceive it, somehow seems to make it different. For me it's just messing around with a lot of analogue sequencers and drum machines. It's like saying, 'I want this to go from this beat to that beat over this amount of time, with this curve, which is shaped according to this equation.'\\" Reception Pitchfork gave the album an 8.8/10, claiming that, \\"For those willing to take these times in stride, Confield promises elegant production, accessibility in moderation, and one of the most enveloping, thought-provoking listening experiences to come forth from leftfield this year.\\" However, AllMusic, giving the album only a 3/5, argued that Confield was \\"a record to respect, not enjoy,\\" a viewpoint expressed by other review outlets.

He said many of the songs sounded as though the CD player was skipping, and said the album was more madness than method. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman held a similar view, saying the album sounded like \\"a malfunctioning dishwasher or a CD jumping.

It is one of the strongest European windstorms on record. This storm has received different names as there is no official list of such events in Europe. Starting on the birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns, it caused widespread damage and hurricane-force winds over a wide area. The storm was responsible for 47 deaths (according to the Met Office), although figures have ranged from 89 to over 100 across Europe.  Meteorological history  The storm began as a cold front over the Northern Atlantic Ocean on 23 January. By the 24th, it had a minimum central pressure of 992 mbar and began to undergo explosive cyclogenesis, sometimes referred to as a weather bomb. It made landfall on the morning of the 25th over Ireland. It then tracked over to Ayrshire in Scotland. The lowest pressure of 949 mbar was estimated near Edinburgh around 16:00. After hitting the United Kingdom, the storm tracked rapidly east towards Denmark, causing major damage and 30 deaths in the Netherlands and Belgium. =Winds= The strongest sustained winds recorded were between 70 and 75 mph (110‚Äì120 km/h), comparable to a weak Category 1 hurricane or Hurricane-force 12 on the Beaufort Scale. Strong gusts of up to 104 mph (170 km/h;) were reported, and it was these which caused the most extensive damage. The Great Storm of 1987 contained considerably higher wind speeds across every parameter. Both highest recorded sustained wind speeds of 86mph and highest gust of 135mph for example. Sustained periods of high gust speeds were also far higher in 1987. However, during the 1987 Storm many anemometers stopped recording due to power outages, breakages due to excess wind speeds and measurement maxima being exceeded. By 1990 the meteorological community had newer devices that remained independent of external power and could measure higher wind speeds. The general opinion is that wind speeds measured during the Burns Day Storm provide an accurate picture, while there is a tendency to downplay windspeeds from the 1987 storm due to the patchy data available. =Forecasting= The Burns' Day Storm of 1990 has been given as an example of when the Met Office \\"got the prediction right\\". The model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK. During the day of the storm the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) increased warnings to force 11 and eventually to hurricane force 12. Research conducted by them showed that most of the general public were not able to understand the severity of the warnings. The storm has led to more awareness about the understanding of storminess among the public by the KNMI, who started a teletext page and the introduction of special warnings for extreme weather events in reaction to these findings.  Impacts  Casualties were much higher than those of the Great Storm of 1987, because the storm hit during the daytime. The storm caused extensive damage, with approximately 3 million trees downed, power disrupted to over 500,000 homes and severe flooding in England and West Germany. The storm cost insurers in the UK ¬£3.37 billion, the UK's most expensive weather event to insurers. Most of the deaths were caused by collapsing buildings or falling debris. In one case in Sussex, a class of children was evacuated just minutes before their school building collapsed. Actor Gorden Kaye was also injured during the storm, when a plank of an advertising board was blown through his car's windscreen. See also * Vivian (storm) 25‚Äì28 February 1990, later Wiebke .

Its primary function is anti-aircraft. It is mounted in an enclosed automatic turret and directed by radar. AK-230 is widely used, mounted on big warships as well as small craft. About 1450 guns were produced in the USSR, and about 300 were produced in China as the Type 69. It was succeeded by the more powerful AK-630 from the mid-to-late 1970s. Development and service The rear of an AK-230 on the deck of the ORP Wodnik. Development of the weapon began during the 1950s, with the first trial weapon fitted to the Osa class of fast attack missile boats and Shershen class torpedo boats. The weapon was officially accepted into service in 1969. Its service life was relatively short, due to the fielding of the AK-630 system in the mid-1970s, which uses the same mountings and can be controlled by the same fire control systems. While its 30√ó210 mm round was much more powerful than the AK-630's 30√ó165 mm one, having the muzzle velocity of 1050 m/s (the same as with 30√ó173 mm GAU-8's cartridge), the moderately powered AK-630's round allowed for much higher rates of fire, especially in a Gatling-type weapon, which was considered more advantageous for the anti-aircraft system. Description The weapon consists of two stabilized NN-30 30 mm water-cooled four chamber revolver cannons, which are mounted inside a riveted steel turret. The gun mechanism is gas operated. The guns each weigh 155 kg and have barrels 1930 mm long, and a total length of 2670 mm. The barrels are rifled with 12 grooves. The guns each have a rate of fire of 1,000 round per minute; they are fed by independent 500-round belts of ammunition. The rounds are electrically fired; propellent gases are used to eject the spent shells and belt links into a space between the magazine and the hull. Ballistic maximum range for the weapon is about 6.7 km, but realistic ranges for engaging air targets are quoted as between 2.5 and 4 km. The weapon is remote-directed, typically by a fire-control system linked to either a Drum Tilt or Muff Cobb radar systems. Ammunition The AK-230 fires specially developed 30x210B 30 mm ammunition that is electrically primed. Two rounds were developed: a high-explosive round with an impact fuze, and an armour-piercing round. The Chinese Type 69 fires only a locally produced version of the high-explosive round. Ammunition is also produced in Romania and Serbia. Dummy cartridge {class=wikitable !Type  HE  AP-T - !Designation  OF-83D  BR-83 - ! Weight - ! Round  1.13 kg  1.12 kg - !

A new group branching off of the chav subculture has emerged recently and are now commonly known as \\"roadmen\\". Roadmen (singular: \\"Roadman\\") are often compared to chavs with similar behavior patterns and the usage of Jamaican patois and Multicultural London English slang in common oral communications; however, the usage of jewellery is comparatively lower, with sports apparel such as puffer jackets and track- pants still worn, but in mostly darker colouring, such as dark blues, dark reds and black. Common stereotypes of roadmen include engaging in criminal activities and becoming aggressive when provoked. Etymology Opinion is divided on the origin of the term. \\"Chav\\" may have its origins in the Romani word \\"chavi\\", meaning \\"child\\". The word \\"chavvy\\" has existed since at least the 19th century; lexicographer Eric Partridge mentions it in his 1950 dictionary of slang and unconventional English, giving its date of origin as c. 1860. The word in its current pejorative usage is recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary as first used in a Usenet forum in 1998 and first used in a newspaper in 2002. By 2005 the term had become widespread in its use as to refer to a type of anti-social, uncultured youth, who wear much flashy jewellery, white trainers, baseball caps, and sham designer clothes; the girls expose much midriff. In his 2011 book, Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, Owen Jones argued that the word is an attack on the poor. In the 2010 book Stab Proof Scarecrows by Lance Manley, it was surmised that \\"chav\\" was an abbreviation for \\"council housed and violent\\". This is widely regarded as a backronym. This interpretation of the word was used in a 2012 public statement by Rapper Plan B as he spoke out to oppose the use of the term. In 2013 linguist David Crystal said on BBC Learning English: > People talk about \\"chav behaviour\\" or \\"chav insults\\" and that sort of thing. > Oh, don't believe the popular etymologies that you read sometimes in the > press and on websites. I saw one the other day, people said, \\"It's an > acronym, 'chav', from 'council house and violent'\\"‚Äîwell, no, it isn't, that > was made up in recent times. Stereotype Caricature of a chav Stereotypical image of a chav Besides referring to loutish behaviour, violence, and particular speech patterns (all of which are stereotypes), the chav stereotype includes wearing branded designer sportswear, which may be accompanied by some form of flashy gold jewellery otherwise termed as \\"bling\\". They have been described as adopting \\"black culture\\", and use some Jamaican patois in their slang. In a case where a teenage woman was barred from her own home under the terms of an anti-social behaviour order in 2005, some British national newspapers branded her \\"the real-life Vicky Pollard\\" with the Daily Star running headlines reading, \\"Good riddance to chav scum: real life Vicky Pollard evicted\\", both referring to a BBC comedy character. Created by radio host Matt Lucas for the show Little Britain, the character Vicky Pollard is a teenage girl intended to parody a chav. A 2006 survey by YouGov suggested 70% of TV industry professionals believed that Vicky Pollard was an accurate reflection of white working-class youth. Response to the stereotype has ranged from amusement to criticism, with some saying that it is a new manifestation of classism. The Guardian in 2011 identified issues stemming from the use of the terms \\"hoodies\\" and \\"chav\\" within the mass media, which had led to age discrimination as a result of mass media-created stereotypes. =Commercial effect= In 2005 the fashion house Burberry, whilst deriding chavs, claimed that the widespread fashion in the UK of chavs wearing its branded style (Burberry check) was due to the widespread availability of cheaper counterfeit versions. The large supermarket chain Asda has attempted to trademark the word \\"chav\\" for a line of confectionery. A spokeswoman said, \\"With slogans from characters in shows such as Little Britain and The Catherine Tate Show providing us with more and more contemporary slang, our \\"Whatever\\" sweets ‚Äì now nicknamed chav hearts ‚Äì have become very popular with kids and grown-ups alike. We thought we needed to give them some respect and have decided to trademark our sweets.\\" Criticism of the stereotype A BBC TV documentary suggested that chav culture is an evolution of previous working-class youth subcultures associated with particular commercial clothing styles, such as mods, skinheads, and casuals. In a February 2005 article in The Times, Julie Burchill argued that use of the word is a form of \\"social racism\\", and that such \\"sneering\\" reveals more about the shortcomings of the \\"chav-haters\\" than those of their supposed victims. The writer John Harris argued along similar lines in a 2007 article in The Guardian. The widespread use of the \\"chav\\" stereotype has been criticised. Some argue that it amounts to simple snobbery and elitism. Critics of the term have argued that its users are \\"neo-snobs\\", and that its increasing popularity raises questions about how British society deals with social mobility and class. The Fabian Society considers the term to be offensive and regards it as \\"sneering and patronising\\" to a largely voiceless group. On describing those who use the word, the society stated that \\"we all know their old serviette/napkin, lounge/living room, settee/sofa tricks. But this is something new. This is middle class hatred of the white working class, pure and simple.\\" The Fabian Society have been highly critical of the BBC in using the term in broadcasts. Use of the term 'chav' was reported in The Guardian in 2011 as \\"class abuse by people asserting superiority\\". In the media By 2004, the word was used in national newspapers and common parlance in the UK. Susie Dent's Larpers and Shroomers: The Language Report, published by the Oxford University Press, designated it as the \\"word of the year\\" in 2004. Characters described as \\"chavs\\" have been featured in numerous British television programmes, as well as films. The character, clothing, attitude and musical interests of Lauren Cooper and her friends in the BBC comedy series, The Catherine Tate Show, have been associated with the chav stereotype. The comedy series Little Britain features a character intended as a chav parody, Vicky Pollard. In the British television series Misfits, the character of Kelly Bailey is presented as a stereotypical \\"chav\\". Lauren Socha, the actress who portrays Kelly, has described the character as being \\"a bit chavvy\\". The Times has referred to the character as \\"[a] chavvish girl\\", and the character has been said to possess a \\"chav accent\\". In the \\"New Earth\\" episode of the BBC TV series Doctor Who, the character Lady Cassandra is transplanted into Rose Tyler's body (Billie Piper). When Cassandra sees herself in a mirror, she exclaims \\"Oh my God... I'm a chav!\\" In Kingsman: The Secret Service, the main character Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton) is introduced as a stereotypical chav.

It is classified as an EP by the band despite being long enough to qualify as an album. The record was released in two parts on vinyl, named EP7.1 and EP7.2. The name of this EP prompted Warp Records to give the name LP5 to the previously released untitled album by the band. The fractal on the cover was designed with a circuit board designer. The minisite created by Warp also featured a fractal generator that would create new artwork similar to that featured throughout the liner notes. Reception EP7 received mixed to positive reviews.

Pirs was launched on 14 September 2001, and is located on the Zvezda module of the station. It provides the ISS with one docking port for Soyuz and Progress spacecraft, and allows egress and ingress for spacewalks by cosmonauts using Russian Orlan space suits. Poisk module A second docking compartment, Stykovochniy Otsek 2 (SO-2), was planned with the same design. However, when the Russian segment of the ISS was redesigned in 2001, the new design no longer included the SO-2, and its construction was canceled. After another change of plans the SO-2 module finally evolved into the Poisk module, which was added to the ISS in 2009. Nauka module Pirs was scheduled to be detached from the ISS and deorbited in 2017 by Progress MS-06, to make room for the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module Nauka. However, due to the repetitive delays with the laboratory module, this maneuver was postponed for Progress MS-15 in 2020.  Design and construction  The flight engineer Oleg Kononenko photographs commander Sergey Volkov operating the manual Strela crane holding him. The commander stands on Pirs and has his back to the Soyuz spacecraft. Zarya is seen to the left and Zvezda across the bottom of the image. The docking compartment has two primary functions: provide a docking port for visiting Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and serve as an airlock for Russian EVAs. The docking port can accommodate one Soyuz-TMA or one Progress-M spacecraft. Visiting spacecraft can deliver people and cargo to and from to the space station. In addition, the Docking Compartment can transfer fuel from the fuel tanks of a docked Progress resupply vehicle to either the Zvezda Service Module Integrated Propulsion System or the Zarya Functional Cargo Block. It can also transfer propellant from Zvezda and Zarya to the propulsion system of docked vehicles‚ÄîSoyuz and Progress. The two airlocks are used for spacewalks by cosmonauts wearing Russian Orlan-M spacesuits. The Pirs docking compartment was manufactured by RKK Energia. The Docking Compartment is similar to the Mir Docking Module used on the Mir space station. The docking compartment's planned lifetime as part of the station was five years.  Launch  Pirs was launched on 14 September 2001, as ISS Assembly Mission 4R, on a Russian Soyuz-U rocket, using a modified Progress spacecraft, Progress DC-1, as an upper stage. The 3580 kilogram Pirs Docking Compartment is attached to the nadir (bottom, Earth- facing) port of the Zvezda service module. It docked to the International Space Station on 16 September 2001, and was configured during three spacewalks by the Expedition 3 crew. Two Strela cargo cranes were later added by the STS-96 and STS-101 missions, carried up on Integrated Cargo Carriers and installed during EVAs.  Future  Pirs was originally scheduled to be detached from the nadir (bottom) port of the Zvezda module in 2013 to make room for the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module Nauka. This has been delayed first to 2017 and then to 2018 due to a series of launch failures with the Proton rocket leading to delays in the launch of Nauka. Current ISS flight manifest, drafted in early Summer 2020, has the Progress MS-15 mission extending to 274 days. Progress MS-15 would perform the planned deorbiting of the Pirs module on or around April 23, 2021. Pirs could become the first permanent ISS module to be decommissioned, and would be destroyed during atmospheric re-entry.

The Presentation of Jesus at (or in) the Temple is an early episode in the life of Jesus, describing his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem in order to officially induct him into Judaism, that is celebrated by many Christian Churches on the holiday of Candlemas. It is described in the chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Within the account, \\"Luke's narration of the Presentation in the Temple combines the purification rite with the Jewish ceremony of the redemption of the firstborn ().\\" In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Presentation of Jesus at the temple is celebrated as one of the twelve Great Feasts, and is sometimes called Hypapante (, = \\"Meeting\\" in Greek). In Western Christianity, the additional name for the Service the day, Candlemas, is added. This Feast-day is also known as the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin or the Meeting of the Lord. In some liturgical churches, Vespers (or Compline) on the Feast of the Presentation marks the end of the Epiphany season, also (since the 2018 lectionary) in the Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland (EKD). In the Church of England, the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple is a Principal Feast celebrated either on 2 February or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February. In the Catholic Church, especially since the time of Pope Gelasius I (492-496) who in the fifth century contributed to its expansion, the Presentation is celebrated on 2 February and is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary. In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the Lutheran Church, the episode was also reflected in the once-prevalent custom of churching new mothers forty days after the birth of a child. Scripture Meeting of the Lord, Russian Orthodox icon, 15th century. The event is described in the Gospel of Luke (). According to the gospel, Mary and Joseph took the Infant Jesus to the Temple in Jerusalem forty days (inclusive) after his birth to complete Mary's ritual purification after childbirth, and to perform the redemption of the firstborn son, in obedience to the Torah (, , etc.). Luke explicitly says that Joseph and Mary take the option provided for poor people (those who could not afford a lamb; ), sacrificing \\"a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.\\" indicates that this event should take place forty days after birth for a male child, hence the Presentation is celebrated forty days after Christmas. Upon bringing Jesus into the temple, they encountered Simeon. The Gospel records that Simeon had been promised that \\"he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ\\" (). Simeon then uttered the prayer that would become known as the Nunc Dimittis, or Canticle of Simeon, which prophesied the redemption of the world by Jesus: > \\"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my > eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all > peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your > people Israel\\". (). Simeon then prophesied to Mary: \\"Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed. (). The elderly prophetess Anna was also in the Temple, and offered prayers and praise to God for Jesus, and spoke to everyone there of His importance to redemption in Jerusalem (). In art The event forms a usual component of extensive cycles of the Life of Christ and also of the Life of the Virgin. Often either the Presentation of Jesus or the visually similar Circumcision of Jesus was shown, but by the late Middle Ages the two were sometimes combined. Early images concentrated on the moment of meeting with Simeon, typically shown at the entrance to the Temple, and this is continued in Byzantine art and Eastern Orthodox icons to the present day. In the West, beginning in the 8th or 9th century, a different depiction at an altar emerged, where Simeon eventually by the Late Middle Ages came to be shown wearing the elaborate vestments attributed to the Jewish High Priest, and conducting a liturgical ceremony surrounded by the family and Anna. In the West, Simeon is more often already holding the infant, or the moment of handover is shown; in Eastern images the Virgin is more likely still to hold Jesus.Schiller, 90‚Äì94 File:Presentation at the Temple (Georgia, 12th c.).JPGPresentation of Jesus at the Temple, 12th century cloisonn√© enamel icon from Georgia File:Presentation of Christ in the Temple.jpgPresentation of Christ in the Temple, from the Sherbrooke Missal File:Brooklyn Museum - The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (La pr√©sentation de J√©sus au Temple) - James Tissot - overall.jpgJames Tissot, The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple (La pr√©sentation de J√©sus au Temple), Brooklyn Museum File:Presentation at the Temple St.Michael Toronto.jpgStained glass window at St. Michael's Cathedral (Toronto) depicts Infant Jesus at the Temple File:Menologion of Basil 037.jpgPainting from the Menologion of Basil II (c. 1000 AD) File:Presentation South German Late 15th Century.jpgPresentation of Christ in the Temple, South German, likely altarpiece wing, late 15th century. (Private collection) Music Many motets and anthems have been composed to celebrate this feast and are performed as part of the liturgy, among them an anthem by 16th century German composer Johannes Eccard (1553‚Äì1611), Maria wallt zum Heiligtum, often translated in English as \\"When Mary to the Temple went\\". The Lutheran church of the Baroque observed the feast as \\"Mariae Reinigung\\" (Purification of Mary). Johann Sebastian Bach composed several cantatas to be performed in the church service of the day, related to Simeon's canticle Nunc dimittis as part of the prescribed readings. * Erfreute Zeit im neuen Bunde, BWV 83, 1724 * Mit Fried und Freud ich fahr dahin, BWV 125, 1725 (on Luther's hymn after Nunc dimittis) * Ich habe genug, BWV 82, 1727 Liturgical celebration =Name of the celebration= In addition to being known as the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, other traditional names include Candlemas, the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, and the Meeting of the Lord.\\"Presentation of Christ to the Temple\\", Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America The date of Candlemas is established by the date set for the Nativity of Jesus, for it comes forty days afterwards. Under Mosaic law as found in the Torah, a mother who had given birth to a boy was considered unclean for seven days; moreover she was to remain for three and thirty days \\"in the blood of her purification.\\" Candlemas therefore corresponds to the day on which Mary, according to Jewish law, should have attended a ceremony of ritual purification (). The Gospel of Luke 2:22‚Äì39 relates that Mary was purified according to the religious law, followed by Jesus' presentation in the Jerusalem temple, and this explains the formal names given to the festival, as well as its falling 40 days after the Nativity. In the Roman Catholic Church, it is known as the \\"Presentation of the Lord\\" in the liturgical books first issued by Paul VI,Liturgy of the Hours, 2 February. and as the \\"Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" in earlier editions. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Greek Catholic Churches (Eastern Catholic Churches which use the Byzantine rite), it is known as the \\"Feast of the Presentation of our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ in the Temple\\" or as \\"The Meeting of Our Lord, God and Saviour Jesus Christ\\". In the churches of the Anglican Communion, it is known by various names, including: The Presentation of Our Lord Jesus Christ in The Temple (Candlemas) (Episcopal Church),\\"The Presentation of Our Lord Jesus Christ in The Temple\\", An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church The Presentation of Christ in the Temple, and The Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Anglican Church of Canada), The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Candlemas) (Church of England), and The Presentation of Christ in the Temple (Anglican Church of Australia). It is known as the Presentation of Our Lord in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod observes 2 February as The Purification of Mary and the Presentation of Our Lord.Lutheran Service Book, 2006, xi In some Protestant churches, the feast is known as the Naming of Jesus (though historically he would have been named on the eighth day after the Nativity, when he was circumcised). \\"Candlemas\\" is a northern European name for the festival because there had long been a procession with lighted candles at the mass on this day, reflecting Simeon's proclamation of \\"a light for revelation to the Gentiles\\", which, in turn, echoes Isaiah 49:6 in the second of the \\"servant of the Lord\\" oracles.Toon, Peter. \\"Collect Commentary\\", The Prayer Book Society =Practices= Traditionally, Candlemas had been the last feast day in the Christian year that was dated by reference to Christmas. It is another \\"epiphany\\" type feast as Jesus is revealed as the messiah by the canticle of Simeon and the prophetess Anna.Elliot, Peter J., Ceremonies of the Liturgical Year, Ignatius Press, 2002. It also fits into this theme, as the earliest manifestation of Jesus inside the house of his heavenly Father. Subsequent moveable feasts are calculated with reference to Easter. Western Christianity Candlemas occurs 40 days after Christmas. Traditionally, the Western term \\"Candlemas\\" (or Candle Mass) referred to the practice whereby a priest on 2 February blessed beeswax candles for use throughout the year, some of which were distributed to the faithful for use in the home. In Poland the feast is called ≈öwiƒôto Matki Bo≈ºej Gromnicznej (Feast of Our Lady of Thunder candles). This name refers to the candles that are blessed on this day, called gromnice, since these candles are lit during (thunder) storms and placed in windows to ward off storms. Presentation of Jesus, showing (L to R) Mary, Simeon (holding Jesus), and Joseph with doves as a Temple sacrifice, stained glass window ca. 1896, Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) This feast has been referred to as the Feast of Presentation of the Lord within the Roman Catholic Church since the liturgical revisions of the Second Vatican Council, with references to candles and the purification of Mary de-emphasised in favor of the Prophecy of Simeon the Righteous. Pope John Paul II connected the feast day with the renewal of religious vows. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple is the fourth Joyful Mystery of the Rosary.\\"Presentation of Jesus in the Temple\\", The Newman Connection In the Liturgy of the Hours, the Marian antiphon Alma Redemptoris Mater is used from Advent through 2 February, after which Ave Regina Caelorum is used through Good Friday.Henry, Hugh. \\"Alma Redemptoris Mater.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 5 February 2019 Eastern Christianity In the Byzantine tradition practiced by the Eastern Orthodox, the Meeting of the Lord is unique among the Great Feasts in that it combines elements of both a Great Feast of the Lord and a Great Feast of the Theotokos (Mother of God). It has a forefeast of one day, and an afterfeast of seven days. However, if the feast falls during Cheesefare Week or Great Lent, the afterfeast is either shortened or eliminated altogether. The holiday is celebrated with an all-night vigil on the eve of the feast, and a celebration of the Divine Liturgy the next morning, at which beeswax candles are blessed. This blessing traditionally takes place after the Little Hours and before the beginning of the Divine Liturgy (though in some places it is done after). The priest reads four prayers, and then a fifth one during which all present bow their heads before God. He then censes the candles and blesses them with holy water. The candles are then distributed to the people and the Liturgy begins. It is because of the biblical events recounted in the second chapter of Luke that the Churching of Women came to be practiced in both Eastern and Western Christianity. The usage has mostly died out in the West, except among Western Rite Orthodoxy, very occasionally still among Anglicans, and Traditionalist Catholics, but the ritual is still practiced in the Orthodox Church. In addition, babies, both boys and girls are taken to the Church on the fortieth day after their birth in remembrance of the Theotokos and Joseph taking the infant Jesus to the Temple. Some Christians observe the practice of leaving Christmas decorations up until Candlemas. =Date= Meeting of the Lord, Orthodox icon from Belarus (1731). In the Eastern and Western liturgical calendars the Presentation of the Lord falls on 2 February, forty days (inclusive) after Christmas. In the Church of England it may be celebrated on this day, or on the Sunday between 28 January and 3 February. This feast never falls in Lent; the earliest that Ash Wednesday can fall is 4 February, for the case of Easter on 22 March in a non-leap year. However, in the Tridentine rite, it can fall in the pre-Lenten season if Easter is early enough, and \\"Alleluia\\" has to be omitted from this feast's liturgy when that happens. In Swedish and Finnish Lutheran Churches, Candlemas is (since 1774) always celebrated on a Sunday, at earliest on 2 February and at latest on 8 February, except if this Sunday happens to be the last Sunday before Lent, i.e. Shrove Sunday or Quinquagesima (, ), in which case Candlemas is celebrated one week earlier. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Feast, called \\"The Coming of the Son of God into the Temple\\" (Tiarn'ndaraj, from Tyarn-, \\"the Lord\\", and -undarach \\"going forward\\"), is celebrated on 14 February. The Armenians do not celebrate the Nativity on 25 December, but on 6 January, and thus their date of the feast is 40 days after that: 14 February. The night before the feast, Armenians traditionally light candles during an evening church service, carrying the flame out into the darkness (symbolically bringing light into the void) and either take it home to light lamps or light a bonfire in the church courtyard. =History= The Feast of the Presentation is among the most ancient feasts of the Church. Celebration of the feast dates from the fourth century in Jerusalem. There are sermons on the Feast by the bishops Methodius of Patara (‚Ä† 312),De Simone et Anna quo die Dominico in templo occurrerunt ac de sancta Deipara, in Patrologi√¶ Gr√¶c√¶ vol. 18, pp. 347‚Äì81.

Cyrillo Suppposita\\" in the Patrologi√¶ Gr√¶c√¶ its attribution to Cyril of Jerusalem is dubious, and has been attributed to Cyril of Alexandria by a few, but Faivre guesses that, considering the subjects discussed (Nestorianism, Monophysitism), it must have been someone from Jerusalem but in \\"the late fifth or early sixth century\\", living under the patriarchy of Sallustius (486‚Äì494) or Elias I(494‚Äì416).

Available here on Google Books The earliest reference to specific liturgical rites surrounding the feast are by the intrepid Egeria, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land (381‚Äì384). She reported that 14 February was a day solemnly kept in Jerusalem with a procession to Constantine I's Basilica of the Resurrection, with a homily preached on Luke 2:22 (which makes the occasion perfectly clear), and a Divine Liturgy. This so-called (\\"Pilgrimage Itinerary\\") of Egeria does not, however, offer a specific name for the Feast. The date of 14 February indicates that in Jerusalem at that time, Christ's birth was celebrated on 6 January, Epiphany. Egeria writes for her beloved fellow nuns at home: > XXVI. \\"The fortieth day after the Epiphany is undoubtedly celebrated here > with the very highest honor, for on that day there is a procession, in which > all take part, in the Anastasis, and all things are done in their order with > the greatest joy, just as at Easter. All the priests, and after them the > bishop, preach, always taking for their subject that part of the Gospel > where Joseph and Mary brought the Lord into the Temple on the fortieth day, > and Symeon and Anna the prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, saw him, > treating of the words which they spake when they saw the Lord, and of that > offering which his parents made. And when everything that is customary has > been done in order, the sacrament is celebrated, and the dismissal takes > place.\\" An Armenian miniature illustrating the subject (Mugni Gospels, ca. 1060). About AD 450 in Jerusalem, people began the custom of holding lighted candles during the Divine Liturgy of this feast day. Originally, the feast was a minor celebration. But then in 541, a terrible plague broke out in Constantinople, killing thousands. The Emperor Justinian I, in consultation with the Patriarch of Constantinople, ordered a period of fasting and prayer throughout the entire Empire. And, on the Feast of the Meeting of the Lord, arranged great processions throughout the towns and villages and a solemn prayer service (Litia) to ask for deliverance from evils, and the plague ceased. In thanksgiving, in 542 the feast was elevated to a more solemn celebration and established throughout the Eastern Empire by the Emperor. In Rome, the feast appears in the Gelasian Sacramentary, a manuscript collection of the seventh and eighth centuries associated with Pope Gelasius I. There it carries for the first time the new title of the feast of Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Late in time though it may be, Candlemas is still the most ancient of all the festivals in honor of the Virgin Mary. The date of the feast in Rome was 2 February because the Roman date for Christ's nativity had been 25 December since at least the early fourth century. Though modern laymen picture Candlemas as an important feast throughout the Middle Ages in Europe, in fact it spread slowly in the West; it is not found in the Lectionary of Silos (650) nor in the Calendar (731‚Äì741) of Sainte-Genevi√®ve of Paris. The tenth-century Benedictional of St. √Üthelwold, bishop of Winchester, has a formula used for blessing the candles. Candlemas did become important enough to find its way into the secular calendar. It was the traditional day to remove the cattle from the hay meadows, and from the field that was to be ploughed and sown that spring. References to it are common in later medieval and early Modern literature; Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is recorded as having its first performance on Candlemas Day 1602. It remains one of the Scottish quarter days, at which debts are paid and law courts are in session. =Relation to other celebrations= The Feast of the Presentation depends on the date for Christmas: As per the passage from the Gospel of Luke () describing the event in the life of Jesus, the celebration of the Presentation of the Lord follows 40 days after. The blessing of candles on this day recalls Simeon's reference to the infant Jesus as the \\"light for revelation to the Gentiles\\" ().

However, a connection with Roman (rather than Celtic or Germanic) polytheism is more plausible, since the feast was celebrated before any serious attempt to expand Christianity into non- Roman countries. Presentation of Christ in the Temple, Benozzo Gozzoli, 1460-1461 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) In Irish homes, there were many rituals revolving around welcoming Brigid into the home. Some of Brigid's rituals and legends later became attached to Saint Brigid, who was seen by Celtic Christians as the midwife of Christ and \\"Mary of the Gael\\". In Ireland and Scotland she is the \\"foster mother of Jesus.\\" The exact date of the Imbolc festival may have varied from place to place based on local tradition and regional climate. Imbolc is celebrated by modern Pagans on the eve of 2 February, at the astronomical midpoint, or on the full moon closest to the first spring thaw. Frederick Holweck, writing in the Catholic Encyclop√¶dia says definite in its rejection of this argument: \\"The feast was certainly not introduced by Pope Gelasius to suppress the excesses of the Lupercalia,\\" (referencing J.P. Migne, Missale Gothicum, 691)Holweck, Frederick. \\"Candlemas.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 4 February 2019 The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica agrees: the association with Gelasius \\"has led some to suppose that it was ordained by Pope Gelasius I in 492 as a counter-attraction to the pagan Lupercalia; but for this there is no warrant.\\" Since the two festivals are both concerned with the ritual purification of women, not all historians are convinced that the connection is purely coincidental. Gelasius certainly did write a treatise against Lupercalia, and this still exists. Pope Innocent XII believed Candlemas was created as an alternative to Roman Paganism, as stated in a sermon on the subject: > Why do we in this feast carry candles? Because the Gentiles dedicated the > month of February to the infernal gods, and as at the beginning of it Pluto > stole Proserpine, and her mother Ceres sought her in the night with lighted > candles, so they, at the beginning of the month, walked about the city with > lighted candles.

Retrieved 7 February 2008. There is no contemporary evidence to support the popular notions that Gelasius abolished the Lupercalia, or that he, or any other prelate, replaced it with the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Green, William W., \\"The Lupercalia in the Fifth Century\\", Classical Philology, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 1931), pp. 60-69, University of Chicago Press In Armenia, celebrations at the Presentation have been influenced by pre-Christian customs, such as: the spreading of ashes by farmers in their fields each year to ensure a better harvest, keeping ashes on the roof of a house to keep evil spirits away, and the belief that newlywed women needed to jump over fire to purify themselves before getting pregnant. Young men will also leap over a bonfire. The tradition of lighting a candle in each window is not the origin of the name \\"Candlemas\\", which instead refers to a blessing of candles. On the day following Candlemas, the feast of St. Blaise is celebrated. It is connected to the rite of Blessing of the Throats ‚Äì which is, for to be available to reach more people, also often transferred to Candlemas day. By coincidence, the rite includes crossed candles. Candles on Candlemas Day, Sanok 2013 =Traditions and superstitions= As the poem by Robert Herrick records, the eve of Candlemas was the day on which Christmas decorations of greenery were removed from people's homes; for traces of berries, holly and so forth will bring death among the congregation before another year is out. In Scotland, until a change in the law in 1991 (see Scottish term days), and in much of northern England until the 18th century, Candlemas was one of the traditional quarter days when quarterly rents were due for payment, as well as the day or term for various other business transactions, including the hiring of servants. Blessing of the Candles at Candlemas at Calvary Episcopal Church (Rochester, Minnesota) In the United Kingdom, good weather at Candlemas is taken to indicate severe winter weather later: \\"If Candlemas Day is clear and bright, / winter will have another bite. / If Candlemas Day brings cloud and rain, / winter is gone and will not come again.\\" It is also alleged to be the date that bears emerge from hibernation to inspect the weather as well as wolves, who if they choose to return to their lairs on this day is interpreted as meaning severe weather will continue for another forty days at least. The same is true in Italy, where it is called .

The reference implies that Groundhog Day may have come from a German-American Candlemas tradition: In France and Belgium, Candlemas () is celebrated with cr√™pes. In Italy, traditionally, it () is considered the last cold day of winter. Tenerife (Spain), Is the day of the Virgin of Candelaria (Saint Patron of the Canary Islands). 2 February. In Southern and Central Mexico, and Guatemala City, Candlemas () is celebrated with tamales. Tradition indicates that on 5 January, the night before Three Kings Day (the Epiphany), whoever gets one or more of the few plastic or metal dolls (originally coins) buried within the Rosca de Reyes must pay for the tamales and throw a party on Candlemas. In certain regions of Mexico, this is the day in which the baby Jesus of each household is taken up from the nativity scene and dressed up in various colorful, whimsical outfits. In Luxembourg, Liichtm√´ss sees children carrying lighted sticks visiting neighbors and singing a traditional song in exchange for sweets. Sailors are often reluctant to set sail on Candlemas Day, believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster‚Äîgiven the frequency of severe storms in February, this is not entirely without sense. According to over eight centuries of tradition, the swaddling clothes that baby Jesus wore during the presentation at the Temple are kept in Dubrovnik Cathedral, Croatia.

Physick graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1785, then began the study of medicine under Adam Kuhn, and continued it in London under John Hunter, becoming, on January 1, 1790, house surgeon of St. George's hospital. In 1791 he received his license from the Royal College of Surgeons in London, and was invited by Hunter to assist him in his professional practice, but after a few months went to the University of Edinburgh, where he received his degree in medicine in 1792. He returned to Philadelphia to practice, taking a position at Pennsylvania Hospital. One of the foremost surgeons of the time, Physick was among the few doctors who remained in the city to care for the sick during Philadelphia's decimating yellow fever Epidemic of 1793. In 1795, Physick performed the first human blood transfusion, though he did not publish the information.http://www.aabb.org/tm/Pages/highlights.aspx Physick pioneered the use of the stomach pump, used autopsy as a regular means of observation and discovery, excelled in cataract surgery, and was responsible for the design of a number of surgical instruments, such as the needle forceps, the guillotine/snare for performing tonsillectomies, and improved splints and traction devices for treatment of dislocations; he also innovated many operative techniques. Physick was the first in Western medicine to introduce cataract extraction by aspiration of lens material by applying suction to a tube in 1815. Physick was one of the most sought-after medical lecturers of the 19th century. His lectures prepared a generation of surgeons for service throughout America. It is because of his status as a teacher that he was dubbed the \\"Father of American Surgery\\". His many patients included James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, Chief Justice John Marshall (from whom he removed more than 1,000 kidney stones, effecting a complete cure), and Benjamin Rush. When President Andrew Jackson consulted with Physick about his lung hemorrhages, he was told to stop smoking. Physick died in Philadelphia and was interred at Christ Church Burial Ground.

He was Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1868 to 1869, and an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1872 to 1882. Early life Hunt was the son of Montgomery James Hunt (d. 1871), long-time cashier of the Bank of Utica, and Elizabeth (n√©e Stringham) Hunt. He was a classmate of Horatio Seymour at the Oxford and Geneva Academies, and graduated from Union College in 1828, where he was an early member of the Kappa Alpha Society. Then he studied law with Juge James Gould at Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut and with Hiram Denio in Utica, and was admitted to the bar in 1831. Career He was a Democratic member from Oneida County of the New York State Assembly in 1839, and was Mayor of Utica in 1844. In 1848, he joined the Free Soil Party, and in 1855 he was among the founders of the New York Republican Party. Hunt remained in private practice until 1865, when he was elected to an eight-year term on the New York Court of Appeals on the Republican ticket, to succeed to the seat held by his former law teacher and partner Hiram Denio. Hunt became Chief Judge in 1868 after the sudden death of Chief Judge William B. Wright. In 1870, he was legislated out of office but was appointed one of the Commissioners of Appeals. =U.S. Supreme Court= Hunt was a friend and patron of political boss Roscoe Conkling, who was an associate of President Ulysses S. Grant. When Samuel Nelson retired from the Supreme Court, Conkling asked Grant to nominate Hunt for the vacancy. Hunt was nominated on December 3, 1872, confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 11, and took his seat in January 1873. Hunt had little impact on the court, siding with the majority in all but 22 cases in his ten years on the job and writing only four dissenting opinions. His most notable contribution came while riding circuit in New York, where he presided over The United States v. Susan B. Anthony. Citing the 14th Amendment, Susan B. Anthony argued that she was constitutionally guaranteed the right to vote and had not broken the law when she voted in the 1872 election. Justice Hunt refused to allow Anthony to testify on her own behalf, allowed statements given by her at the time of her arrest to be allowed as \\"testimony,\\" explicitly ordered the jury to return a guilty verdict, refused to poll the jury afterwards, and read an opinion he had written before the trial even started. Hunt found that Anthony had indeed broken the law and fined Anthony $100 (which she refused to pay).Famous American Trials: The Trial of Susan B. Anthony, University of Missouri (Kansas City) Law School In 1878, Hunt suffered a severe paralyzing stroke, which prevented him from attending court sessions or rendering opinions. Nonetheless he did not retire, because at the time in order to retire with a full pension a person had to put in at least ten years of government service and a minimum age of 70. To encourage him to retire, Congress passed a special provision under which he could receive a pension if he would retire within 30 days. Hunt did so on January 27, 1882, and enjoyed his pension until his death in Washington, D.C., four years later. Personal life In 1837, Hunt was married to Mary Ann Savage (1819‚Äì1846), the daughter of U.S. Representative and Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court John Savage, with whom he had three children, one of whom died in childhood. Together they were the parents of: * Elizabeth Stringham \\"Eliza\\" Hunt, who married Arthur Breese Johnson (1829‚Äì1883). After his wife's death, he remained a widower for eight years until 1853 when he married the daughter of James Taylor, the former Cashier of the Commercial Bank of Albany.

Retrieved 2010 or kurbitsFolk Art and Folklore in Sweden (Dala/Art) Retrieved 2010-04-06 are the names of a traditional form of decorative folk art that originated in Scandinavia. Rosem√•ling is a style of Scandinavian decorative painting on wood that uses stylized flower ornamentation, predominantly primary and secondary colors, scrollwork, lining and geometric elements, often in flowing patterns. Landscape and architectural elements are also common. Many other decorative painting techniques were used such as glazing, spattering, marbleizing, manipulating the paint with the fingers or other objects. Etymology Norwegian for \\"decorative painting\\", (applied decoration or embellishment, decorative, decorated [rosut, rosute, rosete, rosa] and \\"√• m√•le, √• male\\" to paint). \\"Rose\\" can be interpreted as a reference to the rose flower, but the floral elements are often so stylized that no specific flower is identifiable, and are absent in some designs. History in Norway Rosem√•ling in Norway originated in the low-land areas of eastern Norway particularly in the Telemark and Hallingdal, but also in Numedal and Setesdal and in other valleys in Vest-Agder, Hordaland, Sogn og Fjordane and Rogaland. It came into existence around 1750, when Baroque and Rococo, artistic styles of the upper class, were introduced into Norway's rural culture. Rosem√•ling designs use C and S strokes and feature scroll and flowing lines, floral designs, and both subtle and vibrant colors. Script lettering, scenes, animal and human figures may also be included. Artists who specialized in rosem√•ling often came from poorer classes in the countryside. They would travel from county to county painting churches, homes and furnishings for a commission of either money or merely room and board. Thus rosem√•ling was carried over the mountains and toward Norway's western coast. Once farther away from the influence of the painters' guild, these artists tried new ideas and motifs. Rosem√•ling became widespread as amateur artists in rural areas often imitated this folk art. Soon strong regional styles developed and today the three main styles are Telemark, Hallingdal and Rogaland, named after the regions in which each originated.History of Rosemaling (Velkommen til rosemalingens hjemmeside) Rosem√•ling is, in a sense, the two-dimensional counterpart of acanthus carving, since it is clear that the C and S curves in rosem√•ling take their inspiration from the acanthus carvings of Baroque and Rococo art and the acanthus carvings in the rural churches (e.g., the altar reredoses and pulpits) and homes (e.g., cupboards) were painted in the same bright colors as used in rosem√•ling. While in the cities these acanthus carvings were generally gilt, the rural artisans did not have ready access to gold leaf as their urban counterparts and so painted their carvings in the bright colors popular in rural communities (e.g., Norwegian rural dress, Cf. bunad). Like rosem√•ling, acanthus carving has had a cultural revival in recent times as both a means of interior design (e.g., on furniture, picture frames, door and window frames, etc.) and as a personal hobby, although most modern day acanthus carving is left unpainted and unvarnished. An anecdote about the Nazi occupation of Norway (1940‚Äì1945) is that at a time when the public display of the Norwegian flag or the State Coat of Arms could bring imprisonment or even death, the Norwegians discovered that they could display the 'H' overlapping the '7' of the Royal cypher of their exiled king, Haakon VII, at the center of a rosem√•ling design without the German occupation forces seeing anything but a colorful peasant design. Christmas cards with the Royal cypher at the center of a rosem√•ling design were especially popular; many have survived and their history documented.

History in America Norwegian immigrants brought the art of Rosem√•ling to the United States since many of the immigrants came from parts of Norway where rosem√•ling was well established. They often carried their belongings in beautifully painted trunks. Some of the immigrants were Rosem√•ling painters. This generation, however, contributed little to the development of American rosem√•ling in the 20th century, because rosem√•ling began to go out of style starting in 1860.The Norwegian Art of Rosemaling (Sons of Norway Atlanta Lodge) Rosem√•ling experienced its revival in America in the 20th century. Norwegian-Americans became interested in the rosem√•ling decorated possessions of their ancestors. American rosem√•ling began to develop and flourish. The revival of Rosem√•ling in the United States is often credited to Per Lysne who was born in Norway and trained in the craft. He came to America in the early 20th century and was employed as a wagon painter in Stoughton, Wisconsin. When business slowed during the Great Depression, he began Rosem√•ling again. Today Norwegian rosem√•ling is taught in many areas of the USA.

The feast is associated with an event recounted not in the New Testament, but in the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James. According to that text, Mary's parents, Joachim and Anne, who had been childless, received a heavenly message that they would have a child. In thanksgiving for the gift of their daughter, they brought her, when still a child, to the Temple in Jerusalem to consecrate her to God. Later versions of the story (such as the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew and the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary) tell us that Mary was taken to the Temple at around the age of three in fulfillment of a vow. Tradition held that she was to remain there to be educated in preparation for her role as Mother of God. In Eastern Orthodox tradition, this is one of the days when women named Mary ( in Greek) and Despoina () celebrate their name day. Story The account of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Temple is principally based on the Protoevangelium of James, which has been dated by historians prior to the year 200 AD. The story relates that in thanksgiving for the birth of their daughter Mary, Joachim and Anne decide to consecrate her to God, and bring her, at the age of three years, to the temple in Jerusalem. Mary‚Äôs presentation in the temple draws parallels to that of the prophet Samuel, whose mother Hannah, like Anne was also thought to be barren, and who offered her child as a gift to God at Shiloh. Mary remained in the Temple until her twelfth year, at which point she was assigned to Joseph as guardian. According to Coptic tradition, her father Joachim died when Mary was six years old and her mother when Mary was eight. It is from this account that arose the feast of Mary's Presentation. Feast day Detail from The Presentation of the Virgin Mary by Titian (1534-38, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice). The feast originated as a result of the dedication of the Basilica of Saint Mary the New, built in 543 by the Byzantines under Emperor Justinian I near the site of the ruined Temple in Jerusalem. This basilica was destroyed by the Sassanid Persians under Khosrau II after the Siege of Jerusalem (614). The first documented celebration of the feast in any calendar is the mention of the Œï·º¥œÉŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ±œÇ ŒòŒµŒøœÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÖ (Entry of the All-Holy Theotokos, i.e., into the Temple) in the Menologion of Basil II, an 11th-century menology of the Eastern Roman (also known as Byzantine) emperor Basil II. The feast continued to be celebrated throughout the East, was celebrated in the monasteries of Southern Italy by the ninth century, and was introduced into the Papal Chapel in Avignon in 1372 by decree of Pope Gregory XI.\\"The Saint Andrew Missal, with Sundays and Feasts,\\" by Dom Gaspar LeFebvre, O.S.B., Saint Paul, MN: The E.

The feast was included in the Roman Missal in 1472, but was suppressed by Pope Pius V in 1568. As a result, it did not appear in the Tridentine Calendar. Pope Sixtus V reintroduced it into the Roman Calendar in 1585.\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 108‚Äì109 Pope Clement VIII made this feast a greater double in 1597. The feast also continued as a memorial in the Roman Calendar of 1969. Liturgical celebration The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates it on November 20 (Third Friday of November) as one of its twelve Great Feasts. For those churches which follow the Julian Calendar, November 21 falls on December 4 of the modern Gregorian Calendar. In the Orthodox Church the feast always falls during the Nativity Fast, and on the day of the feast the fasting rules are lessened somewhat so that fish, wine, and oil may be eaten. For the Roman Catholic Church, on the day of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, \\"we celebrate that dedication of herself which Mary made to God from her very childhood under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit who filled her with grace ... .\\"\\"The Divine Office\\" (for use in Australia, England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland), 21 November In the 1974 encyclical Marialis Cultus, Pope Paul VI wrote that \\"despite its apocryphal content, it presents lofty and exemplary values and carries on the venerable traditions having their origins in the Eastern churches\\". The three feasts of the Birthday of Our Lady, the Holy Name of Mary, and her Presentation in the Temple correspond in the Marian cycle with the first three feasts of the cycle of feasts of Jesus: namely, Christmas, the Holy Name of Jesus, and His Presentation at the Temple. November 21 is also a \\"Pro Orantibus\\" Day, a day of prayer for cloistered religious \\"totally dedicated to God in prayer, silence, and concealment\\".Angelus Address of Pope Benedict XVI, November 19, 2006.

St. Peter's Basilica contains the (Presentation Chapel); the altar is dedicated to St. Pius X. The Presentation of the Virgin Mary Orthodox Monastery was located in Marshfield, Missouri, before the nuns relocated to Holy Archangel Michael and All Angels Skete in Weatherby, Missouri. The Presentation Sisters, also known as the Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary (PBVM for short), a religious institute of Roman Catholic women, was founded in Cork, Ireland, by Honora (Nano) Nagle in 1775. The congregation of the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary, dedicated to the education of youth, was founded November 21, 1796, in Thueyts, France, by Anne-Marie Rivier.Sisters of the Presentation of Mary. . The Sisters of Mary of the Presentation is a Catholic religious institute founded in 1828 in Broons, France, known for schools and hospitals in Europe, Africa, and North America. In art Testa Western depictions of the subject usually focused on the lone figure of the child Mary climbing the steep steps of the Temple. Having left her parents at the bottom, she is to be received by the High Priest and other Temple officials waiting at the top of the steps. The Presentation was one of the usual scenes in larger cycles of the Life of the Virgin, although it was not usually one of the scenes shown in a Book of Hours. One of the most important illustrations of this event was Pietro Testa's famous painting.

It is a white crystalline compound that is slightly soluble in water, and freely soluble in many organic solvents. Classified as an unsaturated carboxylic acid, it occurs naturally in a number of plants. It exists as both a cis and a trans isomer, although the latter is more common. Occurrence and production =Biosynthesis= Cinnamic acid is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of myriad natural products include lignols (precursors to lignin and lignocellulose), flavonoids, isoflavonoids, coumarins, aurones, stilbenes, catechin, and phenylpropanoids. Its biosynthesis involves the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) on phenylalanine. =Natural occurrence= It is obtained from oil of cinnamon, or from balsams such as storax. It is also found in shea butter. Cinnamic acid has a honey-like odor; it and its more volatile ethyl ester (ethyl cinnamate) are flavor components in the essential oil of cinnamon, in which related cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent. =Synthesis= Cinnamic acid was first synthesized by the base- catalysed condensation of acetyl chloride and benzaldehyde, followed by hydrolysis of the acid chloride product. In 1890, Rainer Ludwig Claisen described the synthesis of ethyl cinnamate via the reaction of ethyl acetate with benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium as base. Another way of preparing cinnamic acid is by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The reactants for this are benzaldehyde and malonic acid in the presence of a weak base, followed by acid-catalyzed decarboxylation. It can also be prepared by oxidation of cinnamaldehyde, condensation of benzal chloride and sodium acetate (followed by acid hydrolysis), and the Perkin reaction. The oldest commercially used route to cinnamic acid involves the Perkin reaction, which is given in the following scheme :Synthesis of cinnamic acid via the Perkin reaction. Uses Cinnamic acid is used in flavorings, synthetic indigo, and certain pharmaceuticals. A major use is as a precursor to produce methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and benzyl cinnamate for the perfume industry. Cinnamic acid is a precursor to the sweetener aspartame via enzyme-catalysed amination to give phenylalanine. Cinnamic acid can dimerize in non-polar solvents resulting in different linear free energy relationships.

Jim Lange was the host, and the program was produced by Jack Barry and Dan Enright. Jay Stewart was the announcer for the first season, and Charlie O'Donnell announced for the second season. The series' executive producer was Ron Greenberg. Gameplay =Main game= Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed. The game began with the champion stopping three spinning windows, set up in a triangular fashion, by hitting a plunger in front of him/her. The top two windows contained eight different categories‚Äîfour in each window‚Äîwith dollar amounts ranging from $50 to $200, representing the value of each question in the category. The bottom window was the contract window, and displayed numbers from one to five as well as a bullseye. When the windows stopped spinning, the contestant chose either of the displayed categories, and had to fulfill the contract by correctly answering the number of questions indicated in the contract window. Each correct answer added the dollar value of the category to a pot. The bullseye represented an unlimited contract, which allowed the contestant who spun it to continue answering questions as long as he/she desired. If a contestant answered incorrectly at any point, the opponent was given a chance to take control of the contract with a right answer. An incorrect answer on a bullseye immediately ended the contract, but the opponent could still take control by giving the correct response. If both contestants missed the same question, it was thrown out and control reverted to the contestant who had originally tried to answer it. The contestant who completed the contract could choose to bank the money in the pot and give up control of the next spin to the opponent, or leave the money in the pot and spin again. Originally, the first contestant to bank $1,000 or more won the game. During the two-week period of November 24 to December 5, 1980, the same amount won by a champion in the main game would also be donated to a children's charity. To ensure the charities would receive more money, the question values were doubled to $100 to $400, with a total of $2,000 or more needed to win, and these increased amounts remained in place for the rest of the series. Contestants kept any money banked during a game, regardless of the outcome, making Bullseye one of the few Barry & Enright shows to allow losing contestants to keep winnings from the game. Since the champion always spun first, it was possible for him/her to win without giving the challenger an opportunity to play. If this happened, the challenger returned to play again in the next game. As was the case with most Barry & Enright game shows, a contestant won a new car after every fifth victory, and players competed until beaten in the main game. =Bonus Island= The champion advanced to play the bonus round, referred to as \\"Bonus Island.\\" Once again, the object for the contestant was to use his/her plunger to stop the spinning windows. For this round, however, the windows contained various dollar amounts ($100‚Äì$150‚Äì$200 originally, later increased to $100‚Äì$200‚Äì$300 during the fifth week). All three windows also contained bullseyes, and one contained a lightning bolt. The contestant's task was to spin three bullseyes, which resulted in an automatic win, or survive a particular number of spins without having the lightning appear. With each spin, whatever money the contestant accumulated was added to the pot for this round. Originally, if a bullseye appeared, the contestant had the option to freeze that window and put it out of play; this option was later removed and a window was automatically frozen after a bullseye appeared. A contestant could choose to stop at any time and keep the accumulated money, but if the lightning appeared, he/she lost the round and the money. The location of the lightning was not revealed until after the round was over, so the contestant had no way of knowing whether it had been put out of play behind a bullseye. Spinning three bullseyes awarded double the money in the pot, or $10,000 (originally $5,000) if the contestant did so in a single spin. Surviving all spins (originally ten, later reduced to seven) awarded either $5,000 or the total amount in the pot, whichever was greater. The contestant also won a prize package, usually worth between $2,000 and $4,000, by either spinning three bullseyes or surviving the required number of spins. Except for the Celebrity Bullseye episodes (which did not offer a prize package), the same prize package was at stake throughout a particular episode until won. Production information The show featured a bombastic music package from Barry and Enright's in-house music composer Hal Hidey, including a main theme strongly reminiscent of the Santa Esmeralda disco hit \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,\\" which had been used itself on the pilot. An eerie sound effect was used while the swirls were in motion, as well as during the window reveals following a bonus round win. The game board itself was run by slide projectors, similar to other game shows such as The Joker's Wild, Blockbusters, and Press Your Luck. Bullseye first originated from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, taping in stages 2, 3, and 4 at different times. In 1981, production of Bullseye moved to Studio 31 of CBS Television City in Los Angeles, California. Later that same year, production of Bullseye was moved to Television City's Studio 33; the show briefly returned to Studio 31 in early 1982, but returned to Studio 33 for the remainder of its run. =Celebrity Bullseye= On December 7, 1981, the show changed its name to Celebrity Bullseye and featured celebrity contestants playing for their favorite charities. The celebrities played a best two-out- of-three game. A $500 value was added to the main game, the categories were no longer announced by Lange before the game began and most questions were multiple-choice, containing three possible answers. Otherwise, gameplay was unchanged; the first celebrity to win two games became champion and continued playing until beaten. Celebrities who played included Daryl Anderson, F. Lee Bailey, Meredith Baxter, Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, Jack Coleman, Doug Davidson, Phyllis Diller, Max Gail, Lynda Goodfriend, Shecky Greene, Rosey Grier, Richard Kline, Harvey Korman, Diane Ladd, Gloria Loring, Tina Louise, Jerry Mathers, Rue McClanahan, Brian S. Mitchell, Rita Moreno, Greg Morris, Donna Pescow, Lynn Redgrave, Roxie Roker, Nipsey Russell, Lilibet Stern, Fred Travalena & Patrick Wayne. =Episode status= All episodes exist, with reruns airing on CBN Cable (1982‚Äì1984) and USA Network (April 1, 1985 ‚Äì June 26, 1987) with Game Show Network doing so in more recent years (as recent as November 2007 for a \\"Viewers' Choice\\" marathon).

Frequently found at museums, amusement parks and schools, a lost and found will typically be a clearly marked box or room in a location near the main entrance. Some lost and found offices will try to contact the owners of any lost items if there are any personal identifiers available. Practically all will either sell, give away, or discard items after a certain period has passed to clear their storage. History In Japan, the lost-and-found property system dates to a code written in the year 718. The first modern lost and found office was organized in Paris in 1805. Napoleon ordered his prefect of police to establish it as a central place \\"to collect all objects found in the streets of Paris\\", according to Jean-Michel Ingrandt, who was appointed the office's director in 2001. However, it was not until 1893 that Louis L√©pine, then prefect of police, organized efforts to actively track down the owners of lost items. Organization Lost and found offices at large organizations can handle a large and varied collection of articles. Transport for London's lost property offices (which handle items lost on the city's Tube, buses and taxis) handles over 130,000 items a year, including 24,000 bags and 10,000 mobile phones. Among the more peculiar items that have been handed in include a wedding dress, ashes in an urn, a longcase clock, a kitchen sink, and several wheelchairs. In Japan, a combination of infrastructure, laws and cultural norms result in a very strong lost & found system; Tokyo's lost & found system processes over 4 million items annually. Other large organizations may lack a central lost and found office but have several offices attached to different administrative units. This is the case, for instance, at the University of Illinois, where different campus units have both distinct offices and different unofficial retention and resolution policies (rules for how long to keep items and what to do with them once that period has expired). In addition to such distributed offices, a cross-unit office might also exist; again referring to the University of Illinois, this cross-functional unit rests in the Campus Police (Division of Public Safety). Computing Some file systems contain a special directory, called \\"lost+found\\" under Unix, where a file system check places lost and potentially corrupted files when the correct location cannot be determined, and so requires manual intervention by the user.

Marks =Current= Runnelstone buoy A buoy currently marks the position of the Runnel Stone. Until May 2012 it was topped with a flashing light, a bell which peals with the movement of the waves and was also fitted with a whistle set in a tube, which emitted a moaning sound when there was a good swell running. This mournful noise could be heard clearly from Gwennap Head, drifting in from the sea, and added to the eerie atmosphere on the cliffs in foggy conditions. In a gale during the 1960s, the buoy became tangled in a drifting cargo ship's anchor line, and the buoy was towed into Mount's Bay. On 13 May 2012, the buoy was replaced by THV Patricia with a larger one, with a whistle to replace the bell.

These are day markers warning vessels of the hazard of the Runnel Stone. The cone to the seaward side is painted red and the inland one is black and white. When at sea the black and white one should always be kept in sight in order to avoid the submerged rocks nearer the shore. If the black and white cone is completely obscured by the red cone then the vessel would be directly on top of the Runnel Stone. The landmark was erected by the Corporation of Trinity House in 1821 ‚Äì an event recorded on a plaque on the back of the black and white marker. =Historic= Beacons In 1795, following numerous petitions from mariners for dangers around Land's End to be marked by lights and beacons, Trinity House built a lighthouse on the Longships, and beacons on Wolf Rock and the Rundlestone. The latter, a bare wrought iron pole, was 'soon carried away by the sea'. In 1841, work began on erecting a replacement beacon (designed by James Walker, chief engineer at Trinity House). The process was one of 'great difficulty and danger': only a small portion of the rock protruded from the water, and landing by boat was only ever achievable during spring tides; even then 'the sea was seldom smooth enough to admit of a footing on the rock'. The beacon was completed on 27 June 1843: a wrought iron mast of diameter standing some above mean high water springs and topped by a ball-shaped top-mark, wide (which had been reduced in size from 6 ft after heavy seas were observed to submerge the top of the mast). In October the following year the beacon was snapped off in a gale, leaving a stump (which was itself carried away, following a ship collision, before repairs could be effected). A replacement, high with a top-mark, was installed the following summer and remained in place until 1854, when it too was carried off in a storm. Another replacement was therefore erected, by James Douglass in the spring of 1856, but it too was destroyed in December that same year. Thereafter the decision was taken to mark the hazard with a buoy. Buoys There had been previous attempts to attach buoys, with the first led by the naval Lieutenant Hugh Goldsmith (nephew of the famous poet Oliver Goldsmith) aboard the cutter HMS Nimble in 1824. (After several unsuccessful attempts Lt Goldsmith and a number of his crew turned their attention to, and succeeded in toppling the famous rocking stone, Logan Rock from its precarious perch on the Treryn Dinas headland east of Porthcurno, much to the dismay of local people.) Buoys were also placed from time to time in the absence of the beacon. Douglass designed the first permanent Rundlestone bell buoy following the destruction of his 1856 beacon; it had a ball-shaped top-mark and the bell was struck by four clappers. Various buoys have since been attached, as in December 1880 when the local newspaper (The Cornishman) reported that the Trinity House vessel, Stella put into Penzance with about 30 tons of mooring- chain, etc. for the Sevenstones Lightship and the Rundlestone buoy. A second buoy was attached in June 1881 with a bell and four large iron balls which ran in grooves. As one side of the buoy was raised by a wave, the movement sent one of the balls against the bell. The buoy and the mooring costs was paid for by the blacksmith who designed it. People living at Tol-pedn and Porthgwarra were asked to listen for the two ‚Ä≥bell-buoys‚Ä≥ as a means to test the new buoy. Another buoy, Sherwell's patent bell-buoy, was placed nearby in Autumn 1881 and was substituted for the original bell-buoy in March 1882. The Cornishman newspaper reported in March 1883 that the spherical buoy was removed and replaced with a bell buoy. Other When the Longships Lighthouse was rebuilt in the early 1870s, its fixed white light was provided with a pair of red sectors to indicate nearby hazards, one of which was angled towards the Runnel Stone. Shipwrecks Between 1880 and 1923 over thirty identified steamships were wrecked, stranded or sank in the area. On a calm mid-summer day during World War I, a Royal Navy minesweeper hit the rock despite a local fisherman serving on board as a rating. He was aware that the ship was on a collision course, but was advised to keep quiet by a colleague in case he might be disciplined for criticising his superiors. On a foggy day at 3pm, 8 October 1923, the 6,000 ton SS City of Westminster bound from Belfast to Rotterdam with a cargo of South African maize knocked the top of the reef clean off. A total of seventy-two people were taken off by the Sennen and Penlee lifeboats. Today, the remains of the ship lie in of water, jammed into a gully on the eastern side of the stone. The rock is now less dangerous and there have been no wrecks since. Diving Due to its exposure to the ocean currents and its relative accessibility of slipways at Porthgwarra and Lamorna, the Runnel Stone is known as one of the best dive sites in the whole of Cornwall. Diving must be carried out at slack water, which is about one and a half hours before high water at Newlyn. The highlights include visibility of up to 20m, numerous wrecks, and anemones in a vast array of colours. Marine Conservation Zone The Runnel Stone Marine Conservation Zone (also known as Land's End (Runnel Stone)) was designated on 29 January 2016 and covers 20 km¬≤. The Conservation Zone boundary is a 3.5 km arc based on and to the south of the National Coastwatch Institution lookout on Gwennap Head. Included is the coast from Gwennap Head to Hall Dinas on the east side of Treryn Dinas. As well as protecting deep sea rocks on the Runnel Stone reef, the MCZ also protects other habitats ranging from exposed rock on the coast to soft sediments on the sea floor. Animals within the zone include sea anemones, sea fans and sponges. Literature The Cones of Runnel are used as a clue in the 1940 World War II thriller The Trojan Horse by Hammond Innes.

It was the band's only studio album with vocalist Jon Bunch, formerly of Sense Field, who had replaced Jason Gleason when the latter left the band due to interpersonal tensions. A music video was filmed for the song \\"Light Up Ahead.\\" Background In early January 2004, the band was reportedly recording with James Paul Wisner at his studio in Florida for their third album. Gleason got as far as recording vocals for one track, before leaving the band in late January. He cited that they \\"spent too much time\\" together \\"packed in a box\\". Though he initially agreed to finish working on the album, he backed out, leaving the group to complete it amidst financial pressure. Drummer Steve Kleisath said the manner that Gleason \\"went about things was horrible and it affected a lot more people than just us, as far as the bad timing of it.\\" Despite an announcement that they planned to break up, the band revealed former Sense Field frontman Jon Bunch as their new vocalist on February 29. Recording concluded by the end of April and was being mastered in early May. Composition Musically, the sound of Hide Nothing has been described as emo with elements of progressive metal and pop. Kleisath said it combined elements from the group's first two albums The Moon Is Down (2001) and How to Start a Fire. He said Bunch's lyrics were \\"a lot less metaphorical and more up front\\". The opening track \\"Light Up Ahead\\" tackles the theme of spiritual salvation. The closing track \\"For All We Know\\" is an acoustic-and-piano track with a string section. Release The band played their first show with Bunch in early May 2004. On June 17, Hide Nothing was announced for release in August. In addition, \\"Light Up Ahead\\" was posted online. On July 19, the title-track was posted online. In early August, leading up to the album's August 24 release, several songs were made available through the band's website. In September and October, the band went on a west coast US tour. In February 2005, the band embarked on a major US tour with the Starting Line, Days Away and JamisonParker. They performed at The Bamboozle festival in May with original vocalist Chris Carrabba, before emarking on a UK tour the following month. In August, the group embarked on an North American tour with Number One Gun and Project 86. In early January 2006, the band announced they would be breaking up. Five of the album's tracks ‚Äì the title-track, \\"Light Up Ahead\\", \\"Like Someone You Know\\", \\"Bleed\\" and \\"For All We Know\\", as well as the acoustic version of \\"Light Up Ahead\\" ‚Äì later appeared on the group's compilation album Hope This Finds You Well (2006). Reception Christian Broadcasting Network included the album as an honorable mention on their best albums of 2004 list. Jesus Freak Hideout ranked it at number 81 on their list of the top 100 Tooth & Nail releases. Jesus Freak Hideout staff member Josh Taylor said Bunch's vocals were \\"much more melodic and ambient\\" than Gleason's or Carrabba's, though not as emotional as the latter, \\"but the power is there.\\" Most of the time, it was a \\"mellow, yet sonic\\" release, with the tracks \\"pick[ing] up on occasion.\\" Cross Rhythms writer Haydon Spenceley said the group \\"have struck gold\\" with the inclusion of Bunch: \\"This boy can SING.\\" The group offered their \\"most immediate material to date\\", which could \\"see Further Seems Forever cementing their place at the centre of the underground rock scene.\\" With the album, AllMusic said the band furthered their developing brand of \\"appealing ... melodic emo-core\\", coming across as \\"a more finely tuned sense of songcraft\\" than How to Start a Fire. The resultant mixture of confessional singer-songwriter elements, aggressive guitar work and harmonies \\"should appeal to both the hardcore set and lovers of emo-tinged indie rock.\\" Kaj Roth of Melodic said the record showed the band \\"has new fuel for their engines and feels more rocking and vital than before.\\" He noted its short length, where \\"only 2 songs are longer than 3 minutes\\", was one of its strengths, \\"so you get to know all the songs much faster than the average rock album.\\" Technique Gopinath Jayaprakash said it had \\" very little to offer for its fans or for that matter, anyone who appreciates rock.\\" He criticized the short running time, and said it was \\"not something worth listening to more than once.\\" Track listing All lyrics written by Jon Bunch; all music written by Josh Colbert, Chad Neptune, Steve Kleisath and Derick Cordoba. #\\"Light Up Ahead\\" ‚Äì 3:08 #\\"Hide Nothing\\" ‚Äì 2:56 #\\"Already Gone\\" ‚Äì 3:52 #\\"Like Someone You Know\\" ‚Äì 3:16 #\\"Make it a Part\\" ‚Äì 2:41 #\\"All Rise\\" ‚Äì 2:49 #\\"Call on the Life\\" ‚Äì 2:52 #\\"Lead the Way\\" ‚Äì 2:32 #\\"Bleed\\" ‚Äì 2:57 #\\"For All We Know\\" ‚Äì 5:21 #\\"Bleed\\" (acoustic)* ‚Äì 3:23 #\\"Light Up Ahead\\" (acoustic)* ‚Äì 3:02 #\\"Make it a Part/All Rise\\" (acoustic)* ‚Äì 4:25 *Tracks 11-13 are BestBuy exclusive tracks.

Crash diving from the surface to avoid attack has been largely rendered obsolete with the advent of nuclear-powered submarines, as they normally operate submerged. However, the crash dive is also a standard maneuver to avoid a collision. A crash dive in a diesel- powered submarine requires careful orchestration of the crew. On German U-boats of World War II, a crash dive began with the Captain or senior lookouts giving the order \\"Alarm!\\" which led to a bridge officer activating the alarm bell. All crew members then immediately stopped what they were doing and proceeded to their diving stations. Once the lookouts were below deck and the upper deck hatch was secured, the Captain or Chief Engineer shouted the order, \\"Fluten\\" (\\"flood the tanks\\"). With the bow planes at a maximum down angle, the crew then flooded the forward ballast tanks. Often, all available crew members moved as far forward in the boat as practical (a \\"trim party\\"). This extra weight forward gave the boat a bow-down angle so its momentum helped pull it below the surface. A few seconds later, the crew would flood the rear ballast tanks to prevent the bow-down angle from lifting the boat's stern out of the water.An accident during the first patrol of U-505 caused just that when she crash dived to avoid an aircraft. Fortunately for the crew, the boat was not spotted during the moments before the crew could regain full control. The crewman who delayed in flooding the rear ballast tanks was subsequently given the nickname \\"Ostrich,\\" a reference to the popular myth that the ostrich, when frightened, buries its head in the sand and thereby raises the position of its tail relative to its body. The entire crash dive was generally coordinated by the Chief Engineer. Before hatches and air induction vents fall below the surface they must be closed. Before that, the diesel engines must be stopped or they will suck the air out of the boat in a matter of seconds. On submarines with direct drive, the crew disengages the diesel engines from the propeller shafts and switches to electric motor propulsion. The motors run at high speed to maintain the forward momentum. Once all hatches and induction vents are closed, the diving planes (like the control surfaces of an airplane) pull the boat below the surface and level it out at the desired depth‚Äîtypically between . In a World War II-era boat, the whole operation could take as little as 30 seconds with a well-trained crew. In contrast, an ballistic-missile submarine may take as long as five minutes to reach periscope depth from the surface. However, it is capable of doing so faster if required; the smaller, more agile attack submarines can dive quite rapidly. The crash diving rate of a missile submarine is also not relevant since it can stay submerged for very long periods of time, and is not expected to ever cruise on the surface when in range of enemy units of any type. A WWII era submarine (technically a submersible since it is only capable of diving for limited periods of time) is by design forced to spend much of its time on the surface, and therefore needs to be able to \\"escape\\" by diving when an enemy is spotted. A WWII-era submarine is also very small, with a periscope depth of only a dozen or so feet, compared to a modern ballistic-missile submarine, which has a periscope depth of up to 100 or more feet deep. In extreme emergencies, submarines have had to crash dive so quickly that lookouts were left on-deck. Such was the only survivor of U-68 when the four lookouts were left top-side as she crash dived among exploding aerial bombs. Commander Howard Gilmore earned the Medal of Honor posthumously during World War II by ordering a crash dive (\\"Take her down!\\") while wounded and unable to leave the bridge of .

Early life Born in Paris to a working-class family of Huguenot background, he was raised in an atmosphere of secularity and Republican socialism. He was the pupil of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, who sponsored him for the Petite √âcole (future √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs), where he sympathized with Alphonse Legros and Fantin-Latour. Maurice Dreyfous, Dalou, sa vie et son ≈ìuvre, Paris, Laurens, 1903, p.3 (Online) In 1854 he attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris in the Fran√ßois-Joseph Duret classroom. He combined the vivacity and richness of Carpeaux, for \\"he was, technically, one of the most distinguished modellers of his time\\",Kenneth Romney Towndrow, \\"A Note on the Portrait Busts of Jules Dalou\\" The Burlington Magazine 90 No. 545 (August 1948, pp. 234-235) p 234. with the academic insistence on harmonious outlines and scholarly familiarity with the work of Giambologna, Pierre Puget, Peter Paul Rubens and others.

His politics obstructed his career under the Second Empire: he was repeatedly refused the Prix de Rome that opened sculptors' careers to future official commissions. He started to work for decorators, and through this work met Auguste Rodin and began their friendship. Gustave Coquiot, Rodin √† l'H√¥tel de Biron et √† Meudon, Ollendorff, Paris, 1917, p.109.(Online) He made a quiet living providing decorative sculpture for the structures that lined Paris's new boulevards and providing wax models for jewelry. He married Irma Vuillier, a partnership that sustained him throughout his life; they had one daughter, Georgette, who was mentally handicapped and required constant care. Dalou's Daphnis and Chloe shown at the Paris salon of 1869, was purchased by the State. Having identified himself too publicly with the Paris Commune of 1871, as curator at the Mus√©e du Louvre under Gustave Courbet, he took refuge in England in July 1871, staying at first with his friend the painter and engraver Alphonse Legros. He rapidly made a name through his appointment teaching at the South London Technical Art School and the South Kensington School of Art, also in London. He was convicted in absentia by the French government of participation in the Commune, and given a life sentence. The Reader, plaster statuette, circa 1871‚Äì1879. Petit Palais Museum =English exile= Bust of Albert Ludovici, Sr., 1873, at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco In his eight- year English exile, Dalou's association with City and Guilds of London Art School, the National Art Training School Maurice Dreyfous, Dalou, sa vie et son ≈ìuvre, Paris, Laurens, 1903, p.70 (Online) and the artists of the New Sculpture movement laid the foundation for new developments in the post- classical British school of sculpture. He also recommended his friend and colleague √âdouard Lant√©ri to move from France to England. At the same time Dalou executed a remarkable series of terracotta statuettes and groups, such as A French Peasant Woman and The Reader; a series of Boulogne women, such as A Woman of Boulogne telling her Beads; and a series of informal terracotta portrait busts of friends and acquaintances, rarely signed. He was commissioned to produce the large public fountain called Charity, erected at the back of the Royal Exchange (1878), and for Queen Victoria a monument to two young granddaughters in her private chapel at Windsor (1878). =Return to France= He returned to France in 1879, after the declaration of amnesty, and produced a number of masterpieces. His great relief of Mirabeau replying to Dreux-Br√©z√© illustrating an encounter of 23 June 1789, which was exhibited in 1883 and later at the Palais Bourbon, and the highly decorative panel Fraternity were followed in 1885 by The Triumph of Silenus. For the city of Paris he executed his most elaborate and splendid achievement, the vast monument, The Triumph of the Republic (pictured left), erected, after twenty years work, in the Place de la Nation, showing a symbolical figure of the Republic, aloft on her car, drawn by lions led by Liberty, attended by Labour and Justice, and followed by Abundance. It is somewhat in the taste of the Louis XIV period, ornate, but with a forward thrust to the ensemble and exquisite in every detail. Within a few days, his great Monument to Alphand (1899), which almost equalled the success achieved by the Monument to Delacroix in the Luxembourg Garden, was inaugurated. The last of his works, cast posthumously, were a statue of Lazare Hoche in Quiberon (1902), the Monument to Gambetta in Bordeaux (1904), the Monument to √âmile Levassor (1907) and the Monument to Scheurer-Kestner (1908) in Paris. Le Triomphe de Sil√®ne, 1885, Luxembourg Garden, Paris Dalou, who was awarded the Grand Prix of the Exposition Universelle (1889), was made a commander of the Legion of Honor.

Established in 1998, the band has so far released ten studio albums. History =1998-2004= Edenbridge was formed in 1998 by guitarist and keyboardist Lanvall, singer Sabine Edelsbacher, and bassist Kurt Bednarsky. The line-up was completed when drummer Roland Navratil joined the band. Edenbridge entered the recording studio in 1999, signing a recorded contract with Massacre Records the same year. In the following year, their debut album Sunrise in Eden was released. The band added a second guitarist, Georg Edelmann, to its line-up in February 2000, but his stay with the band was to be a short one. When he left in January 2001, he was replaced by Andreas Eiblar. Under this line-up, Edenbridge released the album Arcana (2001). During a tour in 2002, Edenbridge's bassist and founding member Kurt Bednarsky left the band. In December 2003, the album Aphelion was released. Their next album, recorded live and entitled A Livetime In Eden, was released in August 2004, followed by the studio album Shine in October. At that time, a new bassist, Frank Bindig, joined the band. In December the same year, guitarist Andreas Eibler left the band and was replaced by Martin Mayr. =Napalm Records, more personnel changes= Sabine Edelsbacher and Frank Bindig in 2006 The Grand Design (2006), their fifth studio album, was recorded at Lanvall's studio Farpoint Station and was released on 19 May 2006 in Europe, and on 30 January 2007 in America. The single \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" was released on 21 April 2006 featuring the album track \\"Evermore\\" and a cover version of the James Bond theme of \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", the first cover the band ever recorded. The following year, Edenbridge signed a worldwide deal with Napalm Records. Edenbridge released MyEarthDream in April 2008. The album features the Czech Film Orchestra, with arrangements by Enrique Ugarte. In November 2008 bass player Frank Bindig left, and he was replaced the next year by Simon Holzknecht; Dominik Sebastian joined on guitar. A few days later, on 4 May 2009, Edenbridge released LiveEarthDream, a limited-edition live album recorded in 2008. Solitaire was released on 2 July 2010 and charted at #95 in Germany. In February 2010, bassist Simon Holzknecht left the band. In 2012, the band asked fans to help sponsor the new album's orchestra recordings. In late 2012, all orchestra and drum recordings had been completed. Bassist Wolfgang Rothbauer who formerly played for Disbelief and Zombie Inc. joined Edenbridge in 2013. The eighth studio album The Bonding was released in June 2013. Lanvall and Sabine began a side project, \\"Voiciano\\", in February 2014. It focuses exclusively on acoustical music and released their first album, Everflow, in 2014. In November 2014 the band announced their first video album, called A Decade and a Half... The History So Far to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The video album contains early beginnings of the band, tour and studio documentaries and live concerts from 1998 to 2014. The album was released on 8 May 2015. The ninth studio album, The Great Momentum, was released on 17 February 2017. It reached position 80 in the Swiss album charts and 82 in Germany.

He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach, one of four to be so honored. After playing quarterback at the University of Tennessee, he served as an assistant coach under William Alexander at Georgia Tech beginning in December 1930. Alexander made the hire while Dodd was still a student at Tennessee. Dodd succeeded Alexander in 1945 as the third head coach at the Institute. He retired from coaching after the 1966 season, compiling a 165‚Äì64‚Äì8 record. He also served as athletic director from 1950 until 1976. All together, Dodd served Georgia Tech 57 years in various capacities. Bobby Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta, Georgia. Early life Robert Lee \\"Bobby\\" Dodd was born in 1908 in Galax, Virginia. He was named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Dodd was the youngest of Edwin and Susan Dodd's four children. In the fall of 1921, the Dodd family relocated to Kingsport, Tennessee. When Dodd was twelve and weighed only 100 pounds, he made the seventh-grade team of Kingsport's first organized football program. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from end to quarterback and kicker. Dodd is in the school's hall of fame. However, the happiness of Bobby Dodd's early life came to a sad end in 1924 when his father committed suicide due to business failure and financial troubles. The family was forced to move, but was held together by the perseverance of Dodd's mother. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and was admitted to the University of Tennessee with a football scholarship. Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship. Player at Tennessee Dodd at the University of Tennessee depicted on a football card Dodd played quarterback for the Tennessee Volunteers football team from 1928 to 1930, under coach Robert Neyland. He also won varsity letters in baseball, basketball, and track during his time at Tennessee. Dodd stood 6'1\\", weighed 170 pounds, and on the football team wore number 17. In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee, the Vols held a record of 27‚Äì1‚Äì2. He led Tennessee to back-to-back unbeaten seasons with identical 9-0-1 records his sophomore and junior years, leading the \\"Hack and Mack\\" backfield of Buddy Hackman and Gene McEver. Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there: \\"In Dodd we trust\\". Dodd twice earned All-Southern honors, in his junior and senior years. \\"It is doubtful if any quarterback in the south can match Dodd on all-around ability. He is a fine passer, a punter of ability, and the greatest field general to ever grace southern turf since the days of the one and only Pooley Hubert\\", according to one newspaper article of this era. In 1959, Dodd was named to the University of Tennessee's Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player. He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1920‚Äì1969 era team. =1928= During his sophomore year, his first year on the varsity, Dodd was the difference in the rivalry game against Alabama in Tuscaloosa, \\"Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama, 13‚Äì13. Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win, 15‚Äì13.\\" To close the season, Dodd led the Vols to a victory in the mud over previously undefeated Florida, replacing the injured starter Roy Witt. =1929-1930= Dodd in 1930 The Vols went 33 games without a loss until an 18-6 setback against national champion Alabama in 1930, which ranks as the longest unbeaten streak in UT history. After the loss, Dodd and his teammates helped start a 28-game unbeaten streak that ranks as the second longest. \\"The Dodger\\" again showed his versatility in a 13-0 win against Vanderbilt. Dodd finished with 14 punts with a 42-yard average, had nine carries for 39 yards, was 7-of-12 passing for 159 yards and two touchdowns and intercepted two passes. During that game, Dodd gained 212 all-purpose yards, collecting all but 14 of Tennessee's team total of 226. Another instance in Dodd's career foreshadowed the creativity he would use in his coaching career. > \\"Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them > about a play he had used in high school. When the ball was snapped, it was > placed on the ground unattended. The players ran in one direction. Then the > center returned, picked up the ball, and waltzed to the winning touchdown.\\" The Vols finished the 1930 season with a 9-1 record. Dodd was named to Grantland Rice's All-American team in 1930, making him the second ever granted that honor at Tennessee (following Gene McEver). Coach and athletic director at Georgia Tech Dodd, c. 1943 After being recognized as 1928 national champions, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team struggled during the next two seasons. Georgia Tech football coach William Alexander began looking for a new assistant. During the 1930 football season, Alexander sent his line coach, Mack Tharpe, to scout future opponent North Carolina, playing Tennessee in Knoxville. Tharpe's car broke down and by the time he reached Knoxville, the game was over. Tharpe asked Tennessee head coach Bob Neyland for information, who suggested that he talk to Dodd. When Tharpe returned to Atlanta he told Alexander: \\"Dodd's analysis of Carolina is better than any scouting report that I could have made.\\" Tech managed to tie the Tar Heels. =Assistant (1931-1944)= Alexander was also impressed by reports of Dodd's performance during games. Dodd joined Alexander's staff as an assistant coach on December 28, 1930. Dodd served as an assistant coach at Tech for 14 years, even though he received many offers for head coaching positions from other schools during that time frame. Dodd lionized Coach Alexander which was later reflected in his coaching style. \\"He taught me to treat athletes as men, not boys ‚Äì to never use their failings as an alibi for a loss\\", Dodd said. =Head coach (1945-1966)= Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program in 1945 following Coach Alexander's retirement as head football coach. Dodd's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd's philosophy translated to winning; he set the record for career wins at Tech with 165, including a 31-game unbeaten streak from 1951‚Äì1953. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and the 1952 national title, which concluded a perfect 12‚Äì0 season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss. Under Dodd's leadership, Tech played in 13 major bowl games, winning 9, including six in a row. Bobby Dodd compiled a 165‚Äì64‚Äì8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech. Dodd in 1952 Football was Dodd's lifelong passion, but at Tech he was just as obsessed with the notion that his players should get an education as he was with teaching them how to play football. Other coaches and sportswriters of his era were united in their puzzlement that anyone could coach with such a light hand and still win so many games. However, Coach Dodd knew that his \\"Books First\\" reputation caused parents to favor Georgia Tech over his competition. 1952 GT Football National Championship Georgia Tech football was Atlanta's one major sports franchise during this time frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as in the 1952 game against Georgia, when Georgia Tech seemed about to be upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd. Rivalries =Alabama= Georgia Tech had an intense rivalry with the University of Alabama which ended during Bobby Dodd's tenure as head football coach. Until that time, the matchup between the Crimson Tide and the Yellow Jackets was a fall football classic. The two teams have met on the gridiron a total of 52 times with Georgia Tech coming away victorious in 21 of those matchups, with 3 ties. Bobby Dodd's football teams won 7 of 17 games played against Alabama. The contests were annual events until Georgia Tech withdrew from the SEC. Dodd considered his two biggest victories to have come against Alabama, including a 7‚Äì3 victory in 1952 and a 7‚Äì6 victory in 1962. The former victory secured a perfect season for Georgia Tech which led to a national title. The latter victory came against a top ranked Alabama team and cost the Crimson Tide another national title. Alabama head coach Bear Bryant once said that he would rather look across the field and see anyone other than Bobby Dodd. =Georgia= Dodd also understood the deep-seated rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1949‚Äì1956, outscoring the Bulldogs 176‚Äì39. This 8‚Äìgame winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series and commonly referred to as \\"The Drought\\" by UGA football fans. Dodd would finish his career with a 12‚Äì10 record against the Bulldogs. \\"Dodd's luck\\" By the end of his coaching career, Dodd had built a reputation not only as a good coach, but also as a lucky one. Georgia Tech often played teams that were physically superior but Bobby Dodd would still find a way to win. The experts called it \\"Dodd's luck\\", but his success actually came from an understanding of motivational psychology, football strategy, and innovative game-planning. University of Georgia's longtime football coach Wallace Butts once said \\"If Bobby Dodd were trapped in the center of an H-Bomb explosion, he'd walk away with his pockets full of marketable uranium.\\" However, the following describes Dodd's perspective regarding his luck: =Athletic director (1950-1976)= In 1967, Dodd stepped down as head football coach due to health concerns, and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950 from William Alexander. Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the position by Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser for Georgia Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team. =Legacy= Statue of Bobby Dodd at Georgia Tech Dodd was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993. He was voted Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year by his fellow coaches in 1951, and \\"National Coach of the Year\\" by the New York Daily News poll in 1952. After retiring, he was awarded a special \\"Citation of Honor\\" by the Football Writers Association of America for his accomplishments and contributions to football. Dodd also developed 22 recognized All-America football players as head football coach. Dodd was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1973. Coach Dodd has also received honors not related to football. The Bobby Dodd Institute is an organization that helps people with disabilities; it is named in honor of Coach Dodd for his assistance to the disabled. Bobby Dodd Stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium at Grant Field Bobby Dodd Trophy Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of the legendary coach in April 1988, two months before he died. In 1989 part of Third Street located next to Bobby Dodd Stadium was rechristened Bobby Dodd Way. On Friday September 14, 2012, Georgia Tech provided another honor for the former coach by unveiling the Bobby Dodd statue in Callaway Plaza on the Georgia Tech campus, which was funded by former players for Coach Dodd. In attendance for the unveiling were the athletic director, members of the 1952 national championship squad, President of the Institute Bud Peterson, Head Coach Paul Johnson, and Bobby Dodd's son and daughter. Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award While Bobby Dodd was a determined competitor, he cared deeply for those who played for him. Unlike some other coaches, he did not believe in winning at any costs; he truly believed that the most important aspect of college football was the college football player. As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation. Georgia Tech's withdrawal from SEC Dodd's tenure included Georgia Tech's withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference (SEC) after the 1963 season. =Feud with Bear Bryant= The initial spark for Dodd's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was playing the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Graning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Graning's face, causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Graning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Graning; but Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd's interest in withdrawing from the SEC. (Georgia Tech lost that game 10‚Äì0, and Alabama went on to win its first Associated Press national championship.) =Over-recruitment= Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama's and other SEC schools' over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than available space on their rosters. During the summer the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day. This practice prevented the cut players from being able to play for other colleges during the following football season. Dodd appealed to the SEC administration to punish the \\"tryout camps\\" of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC after the 1963 football season. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final three years of Dodd's coaching tenure. Dodd insisted the only reason he left the SEC was due to the \\"140 Rule\\", which allowed colleges to over-recruit. The 140 Rule stated a college program could only have 140 football and basketball players on scholarship at any one time, but the teams were still allowed to sign up to 45 players a year. Therefore, if a school recruited its full allotment of players each year it would exceed the 140 maximum even with normal attrition. Dodd would sign about 30‚Äì32 football players a year to meet the guidelines, but the other schools in the SEC were offering 45 scholarships a year, and most were allotting all but a nominal amount to football. Players not good enough to fall under the 140 Rule had their scholarships withdrawn before the end of each year by the other schools. Dodd insisted the recruiting of athletes by this method amounted to nothing more than a tryout for a scholarship. Dodd would not allow any of the football players choosing Tech to be dismissed from Tech, just because they were not the best players. Dodd said, \\"It is not the recruit's fault for not making the squad, it was the coaches' fault for misjudging their talents.\\" If a recruit came to Tech, he would stay on a football scholarship until he graduated. Dodd wanted the SEC to limit the amount of scholarships to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6‚Äì6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC. Integration During Bobby Dodd's tenure, Georgia Tech played against several integrated football teams while the South was resisting integration. Georgia Tech played against Notre Dame in 1953 with Wayne Edmonds starting at offensive tackle and defensive end for the Irish. Edmonds was the first black player to win a monogram at Notre Dame. Georgia Tech lost to Notre Dame 27-14. Bobby Grier at the controversial 1956 Sugar Bowl Georgia Tech also participated in the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt should be allowed to play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played, which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South. Georgia Tech won the 1956 Sugar Bowl by the score 7-0. As athletic director Dodd oversaw the integration of Georgia Tech's football team. Eddie McAshan was the first African American football player to start for Georgia Tech. Bud Carson started McAshan in 1970 at quarterback as a sophomore and McAshan would go on to set several career records for Georgia Tech (which have since been broken by Shawn Jones and Joe Hamilton). McAshan's first career start was on September 12, 1970 against South Carolina. His start marked the first time that an African American had ever started at quarterback for a major Southeastern university and McAshan did not disappoint. He rallied Tech from a fourth-quarter deficit, defeating the Gamecocks 23-20 with two late touchdown drives. McAshan threw for 32 touchdowns during his college football career, and Georgia Tech had a 22-13-1 record during that time frame. Plaque at Georgia Tech honoring Dodd Coaching tree Many coaches have been influenced by Dodd's style and approach to the game, including Vince Dooley, University of Georgia's longtime football coach, who was the first recipient of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. In addition, several assistant coaches for Bobby Dodd went on to have successful careers as head football coaches for other colleges, including Frank Broyles with Arkansas. Broyles led the Razorbacks to a 14-7 victory over the Yellow Jackets in the 1960 Gator Bowl, which was the first bowl game Georgia Tech had lost with Bobby Dodd as head coach. Dodd's coaching tree includes: #Frank Broyles, Dodd assistant, coached at Arkansas #Vince Dooley, influenced by Dodd's style, coached at Georgia #Ray Graves, Dodd assistant, coached at Florida #Pepper Rodgers, Tech quarterback, coached at Kansas Head coaching record Family and personal life Bobby Dodd Jr. football card Dodd married Alice Davis in 1933, and they had two children, Linda Dodd Thompson and Robert Lee Dodd Jr., who played quarterback for the University of Florida from 1960‚Äì61. Dodd Jr. had wanted to play for Georgia Tech, but Dodd thought it would be best if he played for another college. On October 1, 1960, Dodd Jr. contributed to Florida's 18‚Äì17 upset of the Yellow Jackets at Florida Field with Ray Graves, Dodd's former assistant, as Gator head coach. Alice Davis was a younger sister to Wink Davis, who played halfback at Georgia Tech. Dodd met Alice in 1931 through Ed Hamm, who was the track coach. They went on a few double dates together before Bobby started dating Alice. They postponed their wedding until after the 1933 football season since Dodd was coaching his future brother-in-law. Bobby Dodd and Bear Bryant ended their feud in 1975 after Bill Curry helped negotiate a peace settlement between the two old football coaches. As a result, Georgia Tech and Alabama resumed their series from 1979‚Äì84. Dodd stayed in touch with many of his former football players over the years and he was like a father to them until his death. \\"The record I am most proud of\\", he said, \\"is from all those years of coaching I probably don't have five former players who are bitter at me or Georgia Tech....means more than the number of games we won.\\" Alice Dodd was named honorary alumnus of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association in 1967. After her husband's death in 1988, she continued to attend Homecoming functions and special events, such as the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl which led to Georgia Tech winning its fourth national championship.

About the size of a bus, the module was canceled after its pressurized hull was complete. If named and sent into space, the Habitation Module would have been berthed to Tranquility. History In order to accommodate more than three people on the ISS, a lifeboat craft other than a single Soyuz TMA would be needed and such a Crew Return Vehicle was not there at that time. Later in the project, budget constraints and delays to the space station due to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster led to it cancellation. On 14 February 2006 it was decided to recycle the Habitation Module for ground- based Life Support Research for future missions. With the cancellation of the Habitation Module, sleeping places are now spread throughout the station. There are two in the Russian segment and four in the US segment. It is however not necessary to have a separate 'bunk' in space at all; many visitors just strap their sleeping bag to the wall of a module, get into it, and sleep. At various points in the design of the International Space Station, an inflatable TransHab module with several times the space of the initial design was considered as an alternative to the Habitation module. This concept is similar to the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was brought to the ISS in May 2016 by a Dragon cargo spacecraft to test the concept. Some engineers in Britain have also proposed a Habitation Extension Module which could be attached to Node 3.

It runs from Interstate 5 in the San Joaquin Valley near Lathrop through Yosemite National Park, to its end at U.S. Route 6 in Mono County, eastern California. While the route is signed as a contiguous route through Yosemite National Park, the portion in park boundaries is federally maintained, and is not included in the state route logs. The portion at Tioga Pass is the highest paved through road in the California State Route system. This part is not maintained in the winter and is usually closed during the winter season. Route description Tioga Pass Entrance Station SR 120 as Tioga Road by Tenaya Lake in Yosemite National Park. SR 120 begins as a freeway intersecting Interstate 5 to extend Interstate 205 through Manteca. In east Manteca the freeway ends at SR 99 and becomes a highway which continues to head east through Escalon, Oakdale and other various small towns. East of Oakdale there are no highly populated areas for 90 miles (144 km) as it heads into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and into Yosemite National Park. Entering Yosemite, SR 120 is known as Big Oak Flat Road as it heads towards Crane Flat. After leaving Crane Flat, Big Oak Flat Road turns southeast towards Yosemite Valley, while SR 120 continues east as Tioga Pass Road (or often simply Tioga Road). The highway retains that name as it travels through Tuolumne Meadows, over Tioga Pass at an elevation of 9,945 feet, and through the Lee Vining Canyon on its journey to its intersection with U.S. Route 395, at Lee Vining. After a jog to the south along US 395, it continues east as Mono Mills Road, skirting the south end of Mono Lake and providing access to the Mono Lake South Tufa as well as the historical site of Mono Mills before cresting Sagehen Summit and ending with the intersection of U.S. Route 6 at Benton. Both the portions through Yosemite National Park and the stretch south of Mono Lake are subject to winter closure. Usually the highway is open through Tioga Pass by the Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, and typically closes for the winter sometime in November. Tioga Road/Big Oak Flat Road is officially both a National Scenic Byway and a National Forest Scenic Byway. The segment through the Lee Vining Canyon between the eastern edge of Yosemite and US 395 is designated as the Lee Vining Canyon Scenic Byway, a separate National Forest Scenic Byway. SR 120 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and both the western portion and the eastern portion west of US 395 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 120 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. California State Route 120 Markers at Yosemite National Park Tioga Road, 1921. Photo by Robert Sterling Yard. Tioga road and Tenaya Lake viewed from Pywiack Dome. History During the Gold Rush, SR 120 was originally known as Big Oak Flat Road, after the village of Big Oak Flat through which it passes in the Sierra foothills. It was a pack trail from Stockton which became popular with prospectors about 1849. By 1874 it was a wagon road which extended to Yosemite Valley. In 1921, the California State Assembly authorized San Joaquin County to transfer the county road connecting Manteca with then-Route 5 (now I-5) at Mossdale to the state.Statutes 1921 p. 1627: State highway in San Joaquin County It was numbered Route 66, as was a 1933 extension from Manteca east to Route 13 in Oakdale. Also in 1933, Route 40 was extended east from Mono Lake to Route 76 (US 6) at Benton.California Department of Transportation, State Highway Routes: Selected Information, 1994 with 1995 revisions The route from Manteca to Benton was marked as Sign Route 120 in 1934, and was soon extended west to Mossdale,H.M.

He developed Bellard's formula for calculating single digits of pi. In 2012, Bellard co-founded Amarisoft, a telecommunications company, with Franck Spinelli.  Life and career  Bellard was born in 1972 in Grenoble, France and went to school in Lyc√©e Joffre (Montpellier), where, at age 17, he created the executable compressor LZEXE. After studying at √âcole Polytechnique, he went on to specialize at T√©l√©com Paris in 1996. In 1997, he discovered a new, faster formula to calculate single digits of pi in binary representation, known as Bellard's formula. It is a variant of the Bailey‚ÄìBorwein‚ÄìPlouffe formula. Bellard's entries won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest three times. In 2000, he won in the category \\"Most Specific Output\\" for a program that implemented the modular Fast Fourier Transform and used it to compute the then biggest known prime number, 26972593‚àí1. In 2001, he won in the category \\"Best Abuse of the Rules\\" for a tiny compiler (the source code being only 3 kB in size) of a strict subset of the C language for i386 Linux. The program itself is written in this language subset, i.e. it is self-hosting. In 2018, he won in the category \\"Most inflationary\\" for an image decompression program. In 2004, he wrote the TinyCC Boot Loader, which can compile and boot a Linux kernel from source in less than 15 seconds. In 2005, he designed a system that could act as an Analog or DVB-T Digital TV transmitter by directly generating a VHF signal from a standard PC and VGA card. In 2011, he created a minimal PC emulator written in pure JavaScript. The emulated hardware consists of a 32-bit x86 compatible CPU, a 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller, a 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer, and a 16450 UART. On 31 December 2009 he claimed the world record for calculations of pi, having calculated it to nearly 2.7 trillion places in 90 days.

At the Lutheran Church Pittsburgh Synod convention in Greensburg in 1869, it was decided that Thiel Hall would become a college and serve western Pennsylvania. Thiel College began its corporate existence on September 1, 1870. It was originally located in Philipsburg, now Monaca. It moved to Greenville in 1871.\\"The History of Thiel College 1866-1974\\", Dr. Roy H. Johnson. Thiel College, Greenville, Pennsylvania On August 1, 2016, Susan Traverso left her position as provost of Elizabethtown College and became the first female president of Thiel College. Today, Thiel is home to about 110 full- and part-time faculty members. According to the US Department of Education, the school has just under 1,000 students in attendance. In 2016 and 2018, Forbes Magazine rated Thiel among the top ROI colleges in the U.S. In 2018, Colleges of Distinction recognized Thiel overall for the third consecutive year, and its Business and Education programs were singled out for their excellence for the second straight year. Thiel College awarded Amelia Earhart an honorary degree in 1932. In his book ‚ÄúThe Search for Amelia Earhart,‚Äù author Fred Goerner said, ‚ÄúThe most satisfying recognition, however, came from her father‚Äôs alma mater, Thiel College of Greenville, Pennsylvania in the form of an honorary Doctor of Science degree.‚Äù Thiel was also the first institution to grant an honorary degree to Fred Rogers in 1969. Rogers‚Äô address at Thiel was titled \\"Encouraging Creativity.\\" According to the Fred Rogers Archive, the presentation was so popular that to meet the requests for it, they had copies printed in advance for immediate distribution. In his address, he admonished educators and society in general for forcing conformity on children and encouraged understanding and tolerance as children endeavored to find their gifts. Thiel College also presented an honorary degree to Richard M. Nixon in 1959, when he was U.S. Vice-President.

It is about east of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, to which it is linked by a 20-minute ferry service. It has a land area of about and a resident population of slightly over 4,000. Gabriola has public beaches and forests, shopping centres, restaurants, a library, an elementary school and a museum. Its is known as the Isle of the Arts due to its high percentage of working artists, and its many cultural events include annual festivals related to art, poetry, gardens, music, boating and fishing. The Gabriola Arts Council produces three large annual events: the Isle of the Arts Festival (April), Gabriola Theatre Festival (August) and Thanksgiving Studio Tour (October). History =Pre-contact= Gabriola is part of the traditional territory of the Snun√©ymux (of whose name the nearby city of Nanaimo was given an anglicized form). The earliest archeological record on Gabriola is a cave burial dated to about 1500 BCE. The pre-contact population of Gabriola is difficult to estimate, but in mid-Marpole times‚Äîbetween about 0 and 1000 CE‚Äîseveral thousand people lived in the village at False Narrows, the site of today's El Verano Drive. Archaeologists have found that infant mortality at that time was surprisingly low and that the population was well adapted to its environment. Other smaller villages on Gabriola were scattered around the coast. After contact, and perhaps as early as 1500 CE, the population of the Snun√©ymux declined drastically from smallpox and other diseases brought to North America by Europeans. The island is famous for its petroglyphs, which, while commonly believed to be thousands of years old, are almost impossible to date. Because they are carved in relatively soft sandstone, they are eroding rapidly. =Post-contact= The first European visit to Gabriola was by the Spanish schooner Santa Saturnina under Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez in 1791. Narv√°ez is said to have given the name Punta de Gaviola to the southeastern end of the island. It may also have been Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, rather than Narv√°ez, who bestowed the name. Over time, \\"Gaviola\\" may have been corrupted into \\"Gabriola\\" and applied to the whole island. Gaviola is sometimes said to be a misspelling of gaviota (\\"seagull\\"), but it may refer to the Spanish surname Gaviola. In 1792, the island was again visited by a Spanish expedition, under Galiano and Vald√©s. Galiano and Vald√©s stayed at Pilot Bay for several days, to repair their vessels and explore the vicinity of what is now Nanaimo. They called the anchorage Cala del Descanso (\\"Cove of Rest\\"). This site was later wrongly identified as the present Descanso Bay by British cartographers. The British expedition of George Vancouver may also have visited the island very briefly in 1792. While the Spanish explored and charted the Strait of Georgia, they left no permanent settlements. In 1827, fur traders of the Hudson's Bay Company established a post at Fort Langley on the Fraser River, but no Europeans settled in the Nanaimo area until the discovery of coal there in 1852. From the mid-1850s on, coal miners and ex- gold miners began to move to Gabriola, where they started farms to supply the growing population of Nanaimo. By 1874, 17 settlers were working the land on Gabriola, and two-thirds of those had First Nations wives and young families. Portuguese settler John Silva, for whom Silva Bay was named, married \\"Louise,\\" the daughter of a Cowichan chief, in 1873. Three of their sons volunteered to fight in the First World War; one was killed, another wounded. The name of Frank Silva, missing in action on Vimy Ridge in 1917, is inscribed on the Vimy Memorial in France. In the early 20th century, the population of Gabriola grew slowly. By the 1950s, fewer than 400 people lived full-time on the island. Electricity came to Gabriola in 1955, but even then the population grew only about one percent a year until the 1970s. In roughly the next 10 years, the population tripled, in part due to hippie immigration from the United States. By the mid-1980s, the population was 2,000, half the current figure. In summer, the island's population greatly increases. Even in the first half of the 20th century, families came from Nanaimo or Vancouver to spend weeks or months living a simpler, rural life on the island. In the 21st century, about come to Gabriola each year for the sun, music, art, and relaxed pace, and they raise the population temporarily to about 6,000. Apart from farming, Gabriola experienced industrial development in the 20th century. A brickyard produced a day in the early part of the century, and they were sent principally to Victoria and Vancouver. The brickyard ceased functioning in the 1950s. In the 1890s and early twentieth century, sandstone blocks were cut from a quarry near Descanso Bay and shipped for architectural use in public buildings in Vancouver and Victoria. In the early- to mid-1930s, millstones were cut from the sandstone and sent to towns along the west coast and as far away as Finland for use in the pulp and paper industry. A small diatomaceous earth industry also flourished in the 1930s. After World War II, the shipyard at Silva Bay became the major employer on the island until the 1970s. Geography Gabriola, part of the Regional District of Nanaimo, is the most northerly of the Southern Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia between mainland BC to the east and Vancouver Island to the west. The Gulf Islands are an archipelago consisting of hundreds of islands of various sizes stretching from the San Juan Islands in the United States to the Northern Gulf Islands, north of Gabriola. The biggest of the Southern Gulf Islands are Gabriola Island, Galiano Island, Kuper Island, North and South Pender Island, Saltspring Island, Saturna Island, Thetis Island, and Valdes Island. The Southern Gulf Islands consist mainly of former seabed sediments crumpled and gradually thrust upward by tectonic plate movement between ago. Subsequent periods of glaciation scraped away topsoil and some of the bedrock. During the peak of the Fraser Glaciation, ago, Gabriola was covered with ice up to thick. Though melting glaciers left deposits of sand, gravel, and boulders, the main rocks exposed on Gabriola's surface are sandstone and shale. Differential erosion of relatively soft shales and relatively hard sandstones helped create cliffs, points, and bays along Gabriola's shoreline. Gabriola is about long by wide on average with a land area of . The topography varies from flat sandy beaches at sea level to forested hills rising to on Stoney Ridge in the centre of the island. Gabriola lies about east of Nanaimo, the second largest city on Vancouver Island, to which it is linked by BC Ferries. The ferry, which takes 20 minutes for the crossing, runs almost hourly from 6:15 a.m, starting at the Gabriola side, to about 11:00 p.m. ,from Nanaimo, daily. Residents of Gabriola who work or attend high school in Nanaimo use the ferry to commute. Gabriola may also be reached by float plane or small boat. Malaspina Galleries Islands and islets near Gabriola include Snake Island and Entrance Island to the north, the Flat Top Islands, Breakwater Island, and Valdes Island to the east, and Mudge Island, Link Island, and DeCourcy Island to the south. The North Road-South Road loop of is the main island highway. It passes near most parts of the island, including the ferry terminal at Descanso Bay. The island has three provincial parks‚ÄîGabriola Sands Provincial Park on the northwest shore, Sandwell Provincial Park on the northeast shore, and Drumbeg Provincial Park on the east shore‚Äîas well as Descanso Bay Regional Park and an adjacent community park near the ferry terminal. Large coastal sandstone formations known as the Malaspina Galleries are preserved in this community park. The formations were named after the 18th-century Spanish explorer Alejandro Malaspina. Demographics The population of Gabriola rose by 15 percent, from 3,522 to 4,050, between 2001 and 2006. This growth rate was higher than that for BC as a whole, which grew at a rate of 5.3 percent. The population density was 70.3/km¬≤ (182.1 mi¬≤) in 2006 compared to 4.4/km¬≤ (11.4 mi¬≤) for all of BC. The total number of private dwellings on Gabriola was 2,744 in 2006, of which 1,998 were occupied by the usual residents. The median age of the population was 52.9 years compared to the BC median of 40.8. Of the total population, 1,960 were male and 2,090 were female. Climate Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, the island has a cool summer Mediterranean climate due to its dry summers. Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place it firmly in the Oceanic zone (Do).Global Ecological Zoning for the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2000 Cool and moist, the island averages 138 rainy days per year and seven days with snowfall greater than . Days with high temperatures of or higher are rare, averaging less than one per year. Days with temperatures below occur about 25 times per year. Winters are cool and wet with the average temperature in January being and an average precipitation of . Due to its mild winters, the average annual snowfall is low at during the season. Summers, on the other hand are dry and mild with a July average of with only of precipitation. Community Island festivals include the annual Isle of the Arts Festival in April, Gabriola Theatre Festival in August, and the Thanksgiving Weekend Studio and Gallery Tour, all three events produced by the Gabriola Arts Council. The Shipyard School \\"Launch Festival\\" is held mid April in Silva Bay to celebrate the graduation of the students - this is a well-attended, two-day event high on the list for anyone interested in traditional wooden boats and their construction. The Concert on the Green and the Annual Salmon Barbecue occur in August. From May to October, the great Saturday Market at the Agricultural Hall features local produce and baked goods from the island, as well as crafts and high-quality artwork. Habonim Dror Camp Miriam, a Jewish summer camp, operates on the island from the end of June through the end of August. Arbutus tree and sandstone beach Folklife Village, on North Road a few minutes beyond the ferry terminal, is the island's main shopping centre. It was bought and transferred to Gabriola after its role as the Folklife Pavilion, a tribute to Canada's native and settler cultures, in Expo 86 in Vancouver. Other shopping areas can be found at Twin Beaches Mall on the north end of the island and Silva Bay on the south end. The island has a strong connection to the city of Nanaimo. Gabriola residents often refer to Gabriola as Gabe\\", Vancouver Island as The Big Island and Vancouver as \\"The Mainland\\". Gabriola and surrounding islands have more than 70 known petroglyphs - sandstone carvings, some of which may be as old as 2,000 years or more. A small park at the Gabriola Museum contains reproductions of some of these petroglyphs. Flora and fauna A few of the plants common to the island include the trees Douglas-fir, Western red cedar, arbutus, Garry oak, big leaf maple, and red alder; the shrubs Oregon-grape, and red-flowering currant; the perennial bulb small camas (common camas); the semi-aquatic or terrestrial herb Western skunk cabbage (swamp lantern), and the evergreen perennial Western sword fern. Sea creatures near Gabriola include orcas (killer whales), sea lions, seals, otters, oysters, mussels, clams, wolf eels, octopuses, and salmon. Deer and raccoons are among the island's more common land animals. In the winter months, the coast of Gabriola is visited by many species of waterfowl such as the scoter, bufflehead, Barrow's goldeneye, and harlequin duck. Shorebirds such as the black turnstone and ruddy turnstone frequent the island as do garden birds such as the ruby- crowned kinglet, golden-crowned kinglet, thrushes, warblers, pileated woodpeckers, and flickers. The bald eagle, common raven, European starling, peafowl and turkey vulture are common year round. More than 250 bird species live in or migrate through the Nanaimo‚ÄìGabriola area.

It is at . It is about long and about wide. The land area is . Annette Island is located west across the Revillagigedo Channel from the Alaska mainland and south of Revillagigedo Island. The Island was named in 1879 by William Healey Dall, an American naturalist and explorer in Alaska, in honor of his wife Annette Whitney Dall. The meaning of the Tlingit name for the island is Winter Town. Since the late 19th century, it has been the base of the Annette Island Reserve of the Metlakatla Alaska Native Community, composed mostly of Tsimshian people. This is the only remaining Indian reservation in Alaska, as the Metlakatla voted to opt out of giving up their lands under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of the 1970s. In 2016 they elected Audrey Hudson as their first Tribal Chairwoman. Community and demographics The largest settlement on the island is Metlakatla. The federally recognized Metlakatla Indian Community was founded by Anglican missionary William Duncan and Tsimshian followers who moved with him from their community of Metlakatla in British Columbia after he developed new doctrine and schismatized from his church. Fish trap on Tamgas Stream, Annette Island, July 1910 Since the late 19th century, the entire island has been an Indian reservation, a status enacted by Congress when the Tlingit agreed to let the Tsimshian use this territory. Government The Tsimshian set up their government under the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), writing a constitution for electoral government. They have a twelve-person Council. \\"The mayor, secretary, and treasurer are elected by the general voting membership of the community. Each of these is elected for a two-year term. Council seats are staggered, resulting in the election of six Council seats each year and three executives every second year.\\" Since the late 1970s, this has been the only remaining reservation in Alaska, as the Metlakatla opted out of giving up their lands for payment under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.Dennis Zotigh, \\"Audrey Hudson: NMAI‚Äôs Meet Native America Series\\" , Indian Country Today, 26 June 2016; accessed 27 June 2016 In 2016 its Tribal Chairwoman is Audrey Hudson, the first woman to be elected to this role.

It is a cultural crossroads for Tlingit and Haida Natives as well. Infrastructure A network of unimproved roads and trails on the island were developed during years of logging. More than 50 years after the United States made a treaty with the Metlakatla Community that promised a cross-island road in exchange for their allowing construction and operation of an airfield on the island, it made good on its word. A joint armed forces task force constructed a 15-mile road across the island, completed from 1997 to 2007, which connected Metlakatla on the ocean side to the side facing Ketchikan, where a ferry landing has been built.

After the war the airfield was used as a United States Coast Guard Search and Rescue base. It served commercial aircraft as well until the 1970s, when the new Ketchikan Airport was built at Gravina Island in the Inside Passage.

In Staffordshire, England. Hednesford adjoins The Chase to the north, and Cannock to the south. It is also southwest of Rugeley. The town comprises three district council electoral wards whose populations in the 2011 census totalled 17,343. It also comprises the civil parish of Hednesford and part of the civil parish of Brindley Heath. History Hednesford was an important coal mining community for over a century. This is commemorated in the town centre, where a Miner's Lamp has been erected, surrounded by a wall with individual bricks giving the names of former miners. The oldest sections of the town surround the hilltop areas of the existing town; however, the lower part of the town became the focal point as the community grew with the mining industry. Between 1914 and 1918 two huge army training camps were built in the area and over a quarter of a million British and Commonwealth troops passed through destined for the Western Front. In 1938 a Royal Air Force training camp was established to train technicians in maintenance and repair of airframes and engines. No. 6 School of Technical training became better known as RAF Hednesford. The camp was later used for resettlement of Hungarian refugees fleeing from the Russian invasion of Budapest, in 1956. The site is now a part of Cannock Chase Country Park. The urban area of Hednesford now spreads across a swathe of the northern fringe of Cannock, from Pye Green across to Heath Hayes, and is the southern gateway to Cannock Chase AONB. Economically Hednesford has suffered since the 1980s as more people travel to the larger towns and cities nearby and due to the absence of redevelopment it retains a traditional street scene with many sole traders operating speciality shops. However, the area around Anglesey Square has been landscaped to provide a pleasant public space with a public clock as a central feature. A¬£50 million regeneration of the town centre has taken place, with an 80,000sq ft Tesco store being the centre piece. Also, a new drill hall for the local Army Cadet Force Detachment, shops and bingo hall were constructed in 2012. The Tesco site is known as Victoria Shopping Park and the Bingo/Aldi site as Chase Gateway. Currently, a ¬£2.2 million grant, from Heritage Lottery Fund Grant, is being used to fund a massive refurbishment of Hednesford Park.

Contestants answer questions based on categories determined randomly by a mechanism resembling a slot machine. The show's title refers to the game's slot-machine mechanism also having jokers. The show was billed as \\"the game where knowledge is king and lady luck is queen\\", and was notable for being the first successful game show produced by Jack Barry after his company's role in the quiz show scandals during the late 1950s. The success of the series led in part to the reformation of Barry & Enright Productions in the 1970s, which reunited Barry with his partner Dan Enright. The show aired on CBS from 1972 to 1975, and from 1977 to 1986 in broadcast syndication. A children's version, titled Joker! Joker!! Joker!!!, aired from 1979 to 1981, also in syndication. Barry's sons, Jonathan and Douglas Barry, were co-executive producers for a revival of the series that aired in 1990 and 1991, which was produced in association with Richard S. Kline and billed as \\"a Kline and Friends production in association with Jack Barry Productions\\". The series returned in 2017 on TBS, with Snoop Dogg as host. He is also co-executive producer with Michael Strahan. In December 2018, it was announced that the show would be moving to TNT in 2019. Personnel Series creator Jack Barry hosted the show from 1972 to 1984. Jack Barry, who created the show and eventually used it to revive his partnership with longtime producer Dan Enright, hosted all versions of the show up until his death in May 1984. Barry was not the original choice to host, due to his past involvement in the 1950s quiz show scandals. As a result, Allen Ludden hosted the first two pilots for CBS. Barry hosted the local KTLA series in 1971, but CBS was still hesitant to let him host the network run in 1972. Tom Kennedy, Wink Martindale, and Ludden were the three top choices to host, but each was already committed to other shows (Kennedy was tied to Split Second for ABC, Ludden had just started hosting a revival of Password, and Martindale was to host Gambit which was to premiere the same day as Joker on CBS). They even offered it to Dennis James, who had originally been the favorite to land the host job for the upcoming Mark Goodson‚ÄìBill Todman Productions' game show The New Price Is Right. When CBS agreed to a weekday daytime version of The New Price Is Right, Vice President of Daytime Programming B. Donald \\"Bud\\" Grant wanted 15-year Truth or Consequences host Bob Barker to host New Price instead of James. Barker originally said he would gladly host Joker, but Grant convinced him to take the hosting role on Price instead. With no alternatives after Grant pushed Barker to The New Price Is Right (a position he would hold for 35 years) and James was hired by Goodson to host a nighttime syndicated version of the same program, Barry was given the green light to host. Barry's contract, however, was only for sixty-five episodes (thirteen weeks, a standard run for a daytime game show). By January 1973, with no complaints from the viewers or the network and good ratings, Barry signed a regular contract to host the program and continued in that role up to its cancellation in June 1975. Enright was brought on as executive producer of Joker during its final CBS season, and was mentioned by Barry himself on the program's final CBS episode. In 1981, Barry hired Jim Peck to serve as a regular substitute host for when he was unavailable. Peck subbed for Barry several times between 1981 and 1984, and the original plan set forth by Barry and producer Ron Greenberg was to have Barry end the 1983‚Äì84 season as host, announce his retirement on the first episode of the next season, and hand the show over to Peck on a permanent basis. When Barry died of cardiac arrest in May 1984, Enright posthumously overruled his partner and selected Bill Cullen, who had just completed five months of hosting the cancelled Hot Potato for the company, to take over the series. Cullen hosted for the final two seasons and Peck subbed for him for one week in 1986. Pat Finn hosted the 1990‚Äì91 version. =Announcers= Johnny Jacobs, a longtime friend of host Jack Barry, was the original announcer of The Joker's Wild. Jacobs served through most of its CBS run, with Johnny Gilbert and Roy Rowan filling in for Jacobs on occasion. When the series returned to first-run syndication in 1977, Jacobs, Gilbert, and Jay Stewart alternated the primary announcer position. Stewart became the exclusive announcer for The Joker's Wild (as well as for all Barry & Enright- produced game shows at the time) during the 1978‚Äì79 season; Bob Hilton and Art James were substitutes for Stewart for the 1980‚Äì81 season whenever he was unavailable. In 1981 Stewart was replaced as Barry & Enright lead announcer by Charlie O'Donnell, who announced for the remainder of the series' run. Johnny Gilbert and John Harlan filled in for O'Donnell on occasion. Ed MacKay, a local Los Angeles radio DJ and one-time overnight news anchor at KNX radio, announced the 1990‚Äì91 revival. =Other personnel= Richard S. Kline served as the director on all incarnations of the show. =Music= The first two seasons of the CBS version, as well as the first season of the syndicated version, used \\"The Savers\\" by Perrey and Kingsley from their 1967 album Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out as its theme music. The final CBS season instead utilized an original composition, \\"Joker's Jive,\\" composed by Alan Thicke. The second syndicated season introduced a brand-new music package by Hal Hidey, including a re-recording of \\"The Savers\\" that was utilized as the opening theme. Gameplay =Main game= Two contestants, one a returning champion, played. The challenger began the game by pulling a lever to set a slot machine in motion. The game's slot machine consisted of three modified slide projectors which used six-slotted metal discs similar to the wheels used in ViewMaster toys. The discs were spun by electric motors, and unused categories were removed from the board by shutting off the projectors for those windows. The wheels on the machine each contained five different categories, which were revealed to the contestants before the game, and a joker, which served as a wild card and could represent any category. After the wheels stopped, the contestant chose one of the displayed categories and was asked a question in it. If the contestant answered correctly, the dollar value of the question was added to his or her score. An incorrect response or a failure to answer within an unspecified time limit allowed the opponent a chance to answer and steal the money. Certain special categories gave the contestant in control a chance to win extra money, by either increasing the question value or allowing them to answer more than one question on their turn, or involved the participation of both contestants. Question values The values of the questions were determined by the spin. Categories were worth $50, $100, or $200 if they appeared in one, two, or all three windows, respectively. A pair without a joker, if chosen, was played for $100. A \\"natural triple\\" required the contestant to answer a question in that category for $200. In addition, beginning in 1974, spinning a natural triple (three of a kind with no jokers) awarded a bonus prize, which the contestant kept no matter how he/she finished in the game. The bonus initially consisted of a single prize (up about $500 in value), but by late 1983, it had been changed to the natural triple jackpot, an accumulating collection that saw one prize added to it for every day it went unclaimed. Special categories * Mystery: This category was always played for double normal value ($100 as a single, $200 as a pair or $400 as a triple). The contestant selected one of seven numbered question cards in a rack mounted on the host's podium; each card was in a different category, none of which were the same as any of the other four in play. *Pot Luck: A question which could be about almost anything; usually from one of the other 4 categories. * Stumpers: This category consisted of questions that were missed by both contestants in previous episodes. After the host read the question, the contestant could choose to hear the two previous wrong answers and play for the normal value, or decline the help and play for double value (originally it was a straightforward question played for an extra $100). * Fast Forward: The contestant could answer multiple questions if desired, each worth the amount spun, and stop after any correct answer. Missing a question forfeited all money earned on that turn and gave the opponent a chance to claim the money for only that question. * Bid: The contestant had to decide at the outset how many questions he/she wanted, with a minimum of two. Completing the bid awarded the full value of all questions answered (for example, three questions at $100 each awarded $300), but a miss gave the opponent a chance to take control with a correct answer and complete the bid him/herself. If the champion selected this category but did not bid enough questions to tie or surpass a challenger who had already reached $500, the champion immediately forfeited the game. * Fact or Foto: The contestant could either hear a fact about a subject or see a photograph of it, then try to identify it. If he/she was wrong, the opponent got both the fact and the photo. * Just One More: Given a question with multiple answers, the contestants bid back and forth as to how many they could name. The high bidder won control; if he/she gave an incorrect answer, the opponent could steal the money with one correct response. * How Low Will You Go?: A question was read, with eight clues available to help the contestants, and they bid back and forth as to how few clues they would need. The low bidder won control, but if he/she answered incorrectly, the opponent got to hear all the clues before responding. * Take a Chance: After hearing the question, the contestant could either answer it him/herself or pass it to the opponent. An incorrect answer awarded the money to the contestant who did not receive the question. * Choose the Clues: The opponent decided whether the contestant would receive one clue and play for double value, or two clues for the normal value. If the contestant was given only one clue and missed, the opponent got both clues and played for the normal amount. Jokers In this image, a contestant has just spun three jokers. Doing this enabled contestants to win the game simply by correctly answering one question in any of the categories in play. When one or two jokers came up during a spin, a contestant could use them to match any displayed category and create a pair or triple, increasing the value of the question. They could also substitute a joker for a category in play but not displayed on the wheels (which was referred to as going \\"off the board\\") for $50 using one joker or $100 using two jokers. In addition, if a contestant spun a natural pair and a joker, he or she could discard the pair but use the joker to go off the board in another category for $50. Spinning three jokers allowed the contestant to choose any of the categories in play during the game. A correct answer automatically won the game, regardless of the contestant's score or whether a full round had been played or not. The winner received either $500 or the total amount he or she had accumulated to that point, whichever was greater. If unsuccessful, however, the opponent could not steal and the game continued as normal. Using jokers was optional, and contestants occasionally declined to use them if enough money was at stake for their opponent to win the game or take the lead (e.g., spinning a natural pair and a joker, then playing the pair for $100 instead of turning it into a $200 triple). By playing this way, the opponent had less of an advantage if the contestant missed the question and the opponent answered it correctly. Winning the game The game was played in rounds, with each contestant guaranteed one turn per round unless the outcome of the challenger's turn made it unnecessary for the champion to take his/her own. If the challenger reached or surpassed $500 on the first turn of the round, the champion had one last chance to spin either three jokers or a combination that would tie or beat that score. Either contestant could win the game by reaching $500 with a correct answer to a question missed by the other, or by spinning three jokers and correctly answering a question in any category. If a round ended with the scores tied at $500 or more, the game continued until the tie was broken. Contestants received a new car after every fifth victory. Champions usually played until defeated, but from 1981 to 1984, there was a specified winnings threshold that would force a contestant to retire if it was passed. This was a common practice at the time, as some syndicated programs had what was referred to as a network-of-record; in such a case the network in question would treat the show like it was airing on their network schedule and would subject the program to the same set of regulations, such as a cap on winnings. In this case, the network in question was CBS, which was affiliated with many of the stations airing The Joker‚Äôs Wild and later added the show for the stations it owned outright. During this period, there was only one instance where a champion was retired due to the limits imposed by the network, with clinical psychologist Joe Dunn winning a total of $66,200 in cash and prizes during his appearance in 1983. On the episode where he was officially retired as champion, Jack Barry opened the program by explaining in detail the rules the show had to follow at the request of CBS. He also noted that Barry & Enright Productions had been negotiating with the network to extend the limit for Dunn, with the two sides agreeing to a $50,000 cap; as per the rules, any overage went to a charity of his choice. =Endgame (\\"Face the Devil\\")= The wheels now contained 12 slides each, displaying various amounts of money ($25, $50, $75, $100, $150 and $200). One wheel contained a slide depicting the devil. If the devil did not appear on a spin, the total of the displayed amounts was added to the pot. The object was to score $1,000 or more without spinning the devil; doing so won the money accumulated plus a prize package worth anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000. Spinning a natural triple automatically awarded the prize package, along with either $1,000 or the total in the pot plus the value of the triple, whichever was greater. (For example, a contestant who had $850 and spun a triple of $100's would receive $1,150.) If the devil came up, the round ended and the contestant lost the accumulated money. After every safe spin, the contestant had the option to stop and keep the money won up to that point. Contestants who chose this option were often invited to take an unofficial spin to see if the devil would have come up next. For the 1974‚Äì75 CBS daytime episodes, as well as the first six syndicated seasons, the same prize package was at stake for the entire show until won, but this was changed to a different prize package for each bonus round for the final three seasons. During the last season of the CBS run, a special \\"Lucky $100\\" symbol was added to each of the bonus reels. If a contestant spun all three of these symbols in one turn, he/she won not only the prize package and the $1,000, but also a $3,000 cash bonus and a trip around the world worth approximately $7,000. The bonus increased by $100 per day until it was won or the combined value of the bonus and trip reached $15,000. After the extra prizes were claimed, the Lucky $100 symbols were removed and the bonus game reverted to its standard format. It was also during this time that audience members were selected to play the bonus game, except that they only played if the main contestant chose to quit the bonus game and take the cash in the pot. Broadcast history In the late 1960s, Jack Barry pitched the concept of Joker to Goodson-Todman Productions. The company was not impressed, and Barry continued tinkering with the format over the next few years. The Joker's Wild debuted on CBS September 4, 1972, incidentally on the same Labor Day as the modern incarnation of The Price Is Right as well as Gambit. It ran until June 13, 1975, on that network, airing at 10:00 AM Pacific (9:00 Central). A total of 686 episodes were produced. For the first two years, it faced NBC's Dinah's Place, the talk vehicle for singer/actress Dinah Shore, which gave way to the Dennis James revival of Name That Tune, which Joker easily defeated in the ratings. However, when NBC moved its panel game Celebrity Sweepstakes to 10:00/9:00 in early 1975, Joker went into steep decline, ending a nearly three-year run in the summer. However, some big- market independent stations gave the game another chance the next year. After a syndicated rerun cycle of the last CBS season proved successful in 1976, the show returned to first-run syndication from September 5, 1977, to May 23, 1986 (airing back-to-back with sister show Tic-Tac-Dough in some markets, especially so during the aforementioned period where CBS' O&Os; added both series). Additionally, repeats of the CBS era were also seen on KTLA in Los Angeles from March 6 to September 8, 1978, in a double-run with the concurrent first-run syndicated episodes, replacing another Barry & Enright series, Hollywood Connection. A second revival for syndication was one of five game shows sold to local stations for the 1990‚Äì91 season. Premiering on September 10, 1990, the new Joker ran into the same ratings trouble that the other four series did and was the third, following a revival of its sibling show Tic-Tac- Dough and The Quiz Kids Challenge, to be cancelled before the end of the television season. The last new episode aired on March 8, 1991. =Taping locations= From 1972 to 1975, the program was taped at CBS Television City. From 1977 until 1986‚Äîwith the exception of the 1984‚Äì85 season, which was taped at the Production Group Studios near Columbia Square in Hollywood‚Äîthe taping location was moved to the La Brea Avenue studios of KCOP-TV. Taping returned to CBS Television City for the 1990‚Äì91 version. The current version of the show tapes at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. Versions =1971: KTLA= A tryout series aired locally on Los Angeles' KTLA for about three months and was hosted by Jack Barry. The rules were similar to the regular 1972‚Äì86 versions with the following exceptions: Three contestants competed in each game, with the champion spinning first to begin the game. Spinning three different categories and answering a question in any of the three categories was worth $25, while pairs were worth $50 and triples were worth $100. $250 was needed to win, and as before an equal number of turns was given. A three-joker spin resulted in an automatic win with a correct response to a question from any of the five categories in play. In the event of a tie, the lowest scorer was eliminated and play continued until one was ahead after each round. The bonus round was similar to that of the Ludden pilots but had more elaborate prizes. Highlights of this version were shown during promos of the eventual series, which began production on CBS in 1972. =1972‚Äì75= For the first two weeks, triples were worth $150 and a three-joker spin resulted in an automatic win for a contestant without having to answer a question. From the premiere until around May 1974, the champion went first. Bonus Round The bonus round went through a few different permutations: * Prize Round #1: Contestants received two spins and could take whatever prizes they spun the first time or could spin a second time, but were forced to keep the prizes that were spun on the second spin. There were black circles around some of the prizes' icons, and if all three prizes in a spin were circled, the contestant also won a new car. This format was only used on the first two episodes. * Prize Round #2: Beginning with the third aired episode, the circles were eliminated and the car became a regular prize on the wheels (other big prizes, including a boat or a trip, were also added to the board). * Jokers and Devils: Beginning with the third week, the wheels contained only jokers and devils. The contestant was given up to three spins, and each time three jokers came up, a different prize was won, increasing in value with each spin taken. If a devil appeared, the contestant lost it all. Originally the winning contestant received four spins, with the last spin being worth a larger prize such as a car or trip. For a brief period, the prize was not told until after the reels had been spun. In 1973, to avoid confusion between the category wheels and the bonus game reels, the jokers featured on the wheels in this format were marked with the word \\"Joker\\" instead of the word \\"Wild\\". * Face the Devil: Starting around May 1974, the Face the Devil round described above had been implemented. Joker's Jackpot Early in the show's run, returning champions were competing for a chance to win the Joker's Jackpot, an accruing cash jackpot that started at $2,500. Contestants won this jackpot if they won three (originally four) consecutive games. After the jokers and devils bonus round stopped offering a fourth prize, a new automobile was added to the jackpot. However, if the champion was defeated, all of his or her cash winnings were forfeited to the jackpot; though prizes won in the bonus round were his or hers to keep. After every game, the champion decided whether to play on for a chance to win the jackpot or play it safe and retire from the show with his or her current winnings. The jackpot continued to build until it reached $25,000, which was at the time CBS's maximum winnings for game show contestants. Originally, after winning the Joker's Jackpot, the champion was retired undefeated, but in February 1973 the rules were changed to allow champions to continue playing until either being defeated or reaching the maximum CBS winnings limit. Upon implementation of the Face the Devil bonus round, the Joker's Jackpot was abandoned. Contestants kept whatever they earned while still retiring after winning $25,000. Winning five straight games, in multiples of five, won a car. Tournament of Champions From 1977 through 1980, an annual tournament of champions was held. The first tournament was won by Frank Dillon, a contestant on the CBS network series who won $25,000 in his initial run, and the top prize was $50,000 in cash and prizes. Dillon returned for the second annual tournament and won that as well, taking an additional $100,000 prize. In the 1979 tournament, Dillon advanced to the finals where he faced Eileen Jason, who had previously won over $55,000 in cash and prizes in her reign as champion. Jason defeated Dillon to end his two-year reign as tournament champion, winning the $250,000 prize. Immediately after the game (on-air), host Jack Barry offered Dillon a job as a writer for the show, though it remains unknown if he ever accepted it. In 1980, The Joker's Wild became the first television program to advertise that it was giving away a $1,000,000 prize. It was the total purse for a special 16-contestant tournament of champions. The eventual winner received $500,000 ($250,000, paid $25,000 annually for 10 years, plus $250,000 to the charity of his or her choice), and the runner-up received $200,000 ($100,000, paid $10,000 annually for 10 years, plus $100,000 to the charity of his or her choice). The remainder of the money was divided among the other participants in the tournament, depending on how they performed, with once again half of their winnings going to charity. Those eliminated in the preliminaries received $15,000 (with $7,500 going to charity), the quarter-final losers pocketed $25,000 (with $12,500 going to charity), and the two losing semifinalists collected $40,000 (with $20,000 going to charity). Rob Griffin won the grand prize winning three games to none, half of which went to the March of Dimes. Cassandra Dooley won $200,000 for second place, half of which went to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. Other tournaments of champions ($50,000 in 1977, $100,000 in 1978, and $250,000 in 1979) were held prior to this, but no tournaments were held after the $1,000,000 tournament due to winnings cap limitations. Different rules applied to Tournament of Champions play. Contestants played for points instead of dollars, with 500 points the target number to win. In the championship game, winning two games out of three was needed to claim the top prize (three out of five games for both the $250,000 and $1,000,000 tournaments). No special categories other than visual categories were used. In the event a natural triple was spun, a $500 bonus was awarded to that contestant (later, it was a $500 donation to the contestant's favorite charity). Contestants drew numbers to determine who spun the wheels first. In the $1,000,000 tournament, contestants also drew numbers to determine who played first in each individual game. If the contestant at the challenger's lectern spun three jokers and answered a question correctly, that contestant's score was increased to 500 points. The contestant at the champion's lectern was given one final turn to tie the game or win the game if trailing by less than 200 points. The contestant who was ahead after each completed round once the target score of 500 points was reached was declared the winner, but as in non-tournament episodes, both contestants received an equal number of turns. Also, no bonus game was played throughout the tournament; after one game was completed, another game began. Other special weeks over the years included \\"College Week\\", \\"Couples Week\\", \\"Teen Week\\", and \\"Children's Week\\". Audience Game An audience game was played beginning with the 1981‚Äì82 season. Three members of the studio audience were selected to win money and a chance to spin against the devil. Each audience member had one spin to get as much money as possible. The wheels contained money amounts ($10, $20, $30, $40, $50 and $100), with $300 the highest amount possible in one spin. All three audience members kept whatever totals they spun; the high scorer went on to play Face the Devil for a bonus prize and cash, using the same rules and dollar amounts as the onstage contestants. Ties were broken with an additional spin, and the tied members kept the money they scored on this spin in addition to their previous winnings. When Bill Cullen began hosting in fall 1984, two audience members were chosen along with a home viewer who played by pressing a key on their touch-tone telephone to spin the wheels. The game was played onstage instead of in the audience, since a childhood attack of polio and a motorcycle accident as a teenager had greatly limited Cullen's mobility. When the audience game was first introduced, it was played at least once every week (usually on the Friday episode). Each audience member was allowed a maximum of two spins, and could either stop after the first or decline that score in hopes of improving it on the second. These rules were later changed to those described above and began appearing daily halfway through the 1981‚Äì82 season. =Joker! Joker!! Joker!!! (1979‚Äì81)= Joker! Joker!! Joker!!! was a special once-weekly version of The Joker's Wild in which children competed with appropriately-themed subject matter. Prior to its debut, beginning in 1973 The Joker's Wild featured children playing every year around Easter. The format was essentially the same, with some slight alterations. In the main game the children played for points instead of money, with 500 points needed to win. The winning contestant received a $500 education bond, while the loser received a $100 bond. The special categories \\"Mystery\\" and \\"Fast Forward\\" were not used in this version, but \\"Multiple Choice\\" was. As before, full rounds were played, and the contestant who reached 500 points or more after each completed round won; if the score was tied at 500 or more, additional rounds were played to break the tie. A three- joker spin still was worth an automatic win with one correct answer from any of the five categories in play. More jokers were also added to the wheels, which Barry himself pointed out during one episode. The joker cards contained a more juvenile-looking animated joker performing a handstand (with the word Joker written below the design), and the children played the Face the Devil round under the same rules as the adults on The Joker's Wild, except that members of their family joined them onstage for assistance. During the CBS era, the jokers and devils round was in play; however, prizes already won were not at risk when going for future prizes. Also, both the winner and loser got to spin for prizes; the loser got to spin one time, while the winner got to spin up to three times. Additionally, children were allowed to confer with their parents/relatives when choosing categories, but were required to answer questions themselves. =1990‚Äì91= Game play was changed dramatically when the series returned to syndication in 1990. In particular, the regular questions were replaced with terms that the contestants had to define. This version lasted only one season and was hosted by Pat Finn. A memorial plaque was placed on the slot machine as a tribute to Jack Barry. Format #1 =Round 1= In the first round, three contestants (one a returning champion) competed to be the first to reach $500. The game began with a toss- up clue, and whoever buzzed in first with the correct answer gained control of the machine. The wheels contained various dollar amounts (generally $5 to $50 in each window), with a joker in the third window tripling the value of the first two if it came up (and giving that contestant 15 seconds to come up with as many correct answers as possible). After spinning, the contestant was given a series of rapid-fire clues and had to provide a definition to those clues. Each correct answer earned the current value of the wheels. If a clue was missed, the other two contestants buzzed in and attempt to steal the money and control of the board. After this, the wheels were spun again, either by the contestant with the last correct answer or the controller of the last question if no one had answered correctly. When one contestant reached the $500 target number, the round ended and that contestant and the second place contestant advanced to the second round. The lowest scorer was eliminated and left with parting gifts. =Round 2= The two remaining contestants advanced to the second round, which was played much like the first but with higher dollar amounts on the wheels (generally $10‚Äì$75 in each window). The contestants built on their scores from the first round and were able to choose from two categories after each spin. Additionally, an \\"Opponent's Choice\\" card appeared in the third window; this allowed the other contestant to choose the category from which the spinner answered definitions. Contestants were not guaranteed the same number of spins as their opponent as on the original version of the show. The first contestant to reach $2,000 or more won the game and kept the money, while the loser left with parting gifts. Format #2 On January 7, 1991, the front game format was reworked to incorporate elements of the original Joker's Wild game. Although still played with the definition format, the categories and multiple jokers returned to the wheels with spins worth $25 per correct answer for a single category, $50 for a double, or $100 for a triple. In this format, the contestant in control continued answering questions until he or she answered incorrectly or took too long to answer, at which point an opponent attempted to steal the money and control by supplying the correct answer. Spinning three jokers automatically added $250 to his/her score and the right to pick one of three categories for $100 a question. However, unlike with the classic version where contestants went off the board and chose any of the categories in the round, jokers only represented categories on the wheels and the value of the question had to be taken for $50 with one joker and $100 with either a pair and a joker or two jokers and a category. Additionally, no bonus was awarded for spinning a natural triple. The winning score for Round 1 was increased to $1,000 at this point. In addition, the pace of the game was changed to allow games to straddle between shows if there was not enough time to play the bonus game in that particular show. Tie-breaker In either format, if at the end of round 1, the first player reached their target score and the other two players were tied for second place, then each player will be asked as many general knowledge clues as they can. Whoever had the most correct answers won the right to move on to the second round. Bonus Round The champion was given up to three definitions to different words, all starting with the same letter. Each correct answer given within a 60-second time limit earned one spin of the wheels. The wheels this time contained prizes, cash amounts ranging from $500 to $2,000, and jokers. The object was to get three of a kind of any prize. After each earned spin, the contestant had the option of freezing windows containing a prize they wanted to win. For future turns, only the unfrozen windows continued to spin. Jokers could be used to match any prize showing; spinning three jokers won a jackpot that started at $5,000 and increased by $500 each time until won. However, this could only be done in one spin, as jokers could not be frozen and had to be converted into other prizes on the board when they appeared. The largest Joker Jackpot won was $36,000 in 1991. 1990s audience game Like the previous version, the revival also had audience members spin the wheels for money ‚Äì however, this was only done when games ended sooner than expected, being used to fill remaining time and avoid straddling. Each audience member was given three spins to get three of the same bonus prize or cash amount on the wheels; if successful, $100 was awarded; otherwise, the contestant received a Joker T-shirt as a consolation prize. Final week change During the final first-run week of this version (March 4‚Äì8, 1991), the format reverted to the original format without categories. =2017= On May 17, 2017, it was announced that TBS would reboot the show with Calvin \\"Snoop Dogg\\" Broadus acting as host and serving as the executive producer along with Michael Strahan. The revival premiered on October 24, 2017. In January 2018, the show was renewed for a second season. On December 21, 2018, Broadus announced that the show would be moving to fellow WarnerMedia network TNT starting with its third season premiering in 2019. Jeannie Mai served as hostess in the first season. Beginning in the second season, there is no co-host. Each episode is self-contained, with no straddling games or returning champions. The front game consists of two rounds, each of which uses a separate set of five categories. Both contestants receive four spins in the first round and three in the second. In the first round, singles, pairs, and triples are worth $100, $200, and $300 respectively; spinning three jokers earns the contestant a separate question worth $500. Dollar values are doubled for the second round, with the trailing player or, in case of a tie, the player that went last, spinning first. Jokers may not be used to go off the board, but must be matched to a displayed category, and the game can end early if one contestant attains an insurmountable lead. If one contestant misses a question, his/her opponent is not given a chance to steal. If the scores are tied after two rounds, each player takes one last spin and the high scorer becomes the champion. In the second season, the game is played in three rounds. Both players get two spins in each round, with all values doubled for the second round and tripled for the third. New categories are only introduced at the start of the second round. Additionally, in the third round, a player may challenge his or her opponent to answer the question (\\"Slang That Thang\\"); the opponent receives the money with a correct response, while the player scores on a miss. If the scores are tied after three rounds, each player chooses one of three face-down cards and the one with the higher draw becomes the champion; if the cards match, further tiebreakers are played until there is a winner. The winner plays Face the Devil, with values from $300 to $1,500 and jokers worth $2,000 on the wheels. If the player either spins three jokers or accumulates at least $10,000 without seeing the Devil, his/her total is increased to $25,000 in season 1 or $50,000 in season 2, in addition to the money won in the main game. In season 2, the host occasionally offers extra cash in addition to the accumulated total as an incentive for the player to quit the round. Gettin' Wild with Snoop Dogg Prior to the shows' premiere, an all- exclusive six episode documentary series aired on TBS app, TBS social media handles including Facebook Watch tab along its very own website at TBS.com. Directed by Rory Karpf, the show chronicles Snoop Dogg's transition to a game show host as it explores his creative processes behind the show's reboot. The six episodes were posted on the official Facebook and YouTube page every Friday at 4:20 p.m. ET. Merchandise Board game manufacturer Milton Bradley produced three editions of The Joker's Wild home game from 1973 to 1975, as well as a kids‚Äô version of Joker! Joker!! Joker!!! in 1979. The standard editions of the game included the ‚ÄúJokers and Devils‚Äù bonus round, while the kids‚Äô edition replicated the ‚ÄúBeat the Devil‚Äù bonus. Plans for an Atari 2600 and Mattel Intellivision version of The Joker's Wild were announced by The Great Game Company in 1983, but due to the video game crash of 1983, it was never released for either console. In 1994, Philips produced two editions for its CD-i platform based on The Joker's Wild, licensed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, who owned the franchise at that point. These games featured television game show hosts and were based more or less on the first syndicated series, while the sets on both games resembled the 1990 version. Wink Martindale hosted the first edition, while Marc Summers could be found on a special \\"Junior\\" edition of the game. The late Charlie O'Donnell served as the announcer for both games. Martindale was among the first candidates to host the original series when CBS was still not entirely sold on Jack Barry as host, due to his involvement in the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. However, Martindale already chose to host Gambit, another of the three game shows that premiered on the same day in 1972 on CBS (New Price also debuted that day). O'Donnell was an announcer on the series in question also. The theme music in these games was a remix of the 1977‚Äì86 theme. In 2003, a mobile game based on The Joker's Wild was released by Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment. In 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009, IGT released video slot machines based on the 1970s version of the show. =Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker's Wild= A Snapchat video lens was released on October 18, 2017, where Snoop would dance in the lens next to the snapchat user who would act as the dancing joker. The lens features custom green screen footage of Snoop Dogg that was shot exclusively for the lens experience. An online game was released on October 24, 2017, where fans of the show can play along via the TBS Android and iOS apps, or on TBS.com. Episode status The status of the KTLA series is unknown; only brief footage is known to survive through 1972 CBS promos. For many years, only the third season of the CBS run was known to exist, as the first two seasons were presumed to be wiped due to network practices of the era (although CBS was way less prone to master tape wiping than ABC and NBC). In 2000, a search of New York's WCBS-TV found the original master tapes of both the first two seasons (restoring the full 686-episode run of the original CBS Daytime run series) and the entire series of Spin-Off (which replaced Joker in 1975) in a tape storage room. A clip from a January 1974 celebrity week was used during the network's anniversary special CBS At 75. This version of the show is currently held by Sony Pictures Television & CBS Television Distribution. The 1977‚Äì1986 syndicated episodes exist, and were rerun (with the exceptions of the 1980‚Äì81, 1981‚Äì82, 1983‚Äì84, and 1984‚Äì85 seasons) on GSN, as were the first few months of the CBS era.

The island has a population of about 300 members of the Penelakut Band. The island has an area of . There is frequent car and passenger ferry service to Penelakut from Chemainus on Vancouver Island. A Mediterranean climate of mild winters and warm, dry summers supports a unique ecosystem and an ideal living environment. The island is in the rain shadow of Vancouver Island, with an annual rainfall of about . There is a Roman Catholic Church and a longhouse, but no commercial establishments on the island. From 1890 to 1978, the Catholic Church operated a Residential School on the island. There is still much bitterness in the community over the violence and sexual abuse suffered by Aboriginal children who attended the school. One of the priests has been tried and convicted of sexual assault charges dating from his time running the school, and former attendees say the abusive practices were widespread. The present comprehensive school is run by the Penelakut. Because it is an Indian reserve, property is not available for purchase. (There is one private lot dating from the events of 1863). History Britain's Royal Navy, surveying the area in 1851, cruised into a group of five islands in the Strait of Georgia, declaring the colonial name of the two largest islands to be Kuper and Thetis, after their Captain Augustus Leopold Kuper R.N. (1809‚Äì1885) and his frigate, HMS Thetis, a 36-gun Royal Navy frigate on the Pacific Station between 1851 and 1853. In 1861 about 300 Bella Bella Indians in 19 large canoes were ordered away from Victoria by Governor Douglas. On their return journey north, they staged a surprise attack at dawn on the Penelahut Natives of Kuper Island, a tribe of about 400 in number. About 225 Penelahuts were murdered in one of the worse massacres recorded. A Nanaimo chief named Winni- win-chin was visiting Kuper Island. He escaped to Nanaimo and reported the massacre to Mr. A.G. Horne, in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company Post. Mr. Horne dispatched canoe men to Victoria to report the act. On April 20, 1863, the British gunboat HMS Forward attacked the native village on the then-named Kuper Island. The captain believed that the village harboured individuals of the separate Lamalchi tribe involved in two recent assaults in the Gulf Islands in which three Europeans had been killed in combat. The gunboat fired on the village but, unprepared for a naval landing, withdrew with one casualty after a fierce battle with island warriors. Following the event, the colonial government responded with one of the largest military assaults in British Columbia's history, which took place on the east coast of Vancouver Island and extended throughout the waters and islands of Active Pass, Trincomali Channel and Stuart Channel. Subsequently, having gained control of the region, the government publicly hanged four Indigenous men in Victoria and ultimately established colonial governance in the region, ultimately forming the Province of British Columbia.

One program (channel) is displayed on the full TV screen at the same time as one or more other programs are displayed in inset windows. Sound is usually from the main program only. Picture-in-picture requires two independent tuners or signal sources to supply the large and the small picture. Two-tuner PiP TVs have a second tuner built in, but a single-tuner PiP TV requires an external signal source, which may be an external tuner, videocassette recorder, DVD player, or a cable box. Picture-in-picture is often used to watch one program while waiting for another to start, or advertisements to finish. History Adding a picture into an existing picture was done long before affordable PiP was available on consumer products. The first PiP was seen on the televised coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics where a Quantel digital framestore device was used to insert a close- up picture of the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony. In 1980, NEC introduced its \\"Popvision\\" television (CV-20T74P) in Japan with a rudimentary picture-aside-picture feature: a separate 6\\" (15 cm) CRT and tuner complemented the set's main 20\\" (50 cm) screen. It was pricey: its ¬•298,000 MSRP was equal to about $1,200 (at $1 = ¬•250 ), and $1,200 in 1980 had the approximate buying power of $3,000 in 2007 . An early consumer implementation of picture-in-picture was the Multivision set-top box; it was not a commercial success. Later PiP became available as a feature of advanced television receivers. The first widespread consumer implementation of picture-in-picture was produced by Philips in 1983 in their high-end television sets. A separate video or RF input was available on the back of the set and displayed in black and white in one of the four corners of the screen. Televisions at the time were still analog format, and earlier versions of the PiP implemented in analog were too costly. New digital technology allowed the second video signal to be digitized and saved in a digital memory chip then replayed in a mini version. While the new technology was not good enough for color or full-screen viewing, it did provide a low-cost PiP feature. The Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD specifications included picture in picture, allowing viewers to see, say, the director's comment on a film they are watching. All of the Blu-ray Disc titles in 2006 and 2007 that had a PiP track used two separate HD encodings, with one of the HD encodings including a hard-coded PiP track. Starting in 2008 Blu-ray Disc titles started being released that use one HD and one SD video track which can be combined together with a Bonus View or BD-Live player. This method uses less disc space allowing for PiP to be more easily added to a title. Several studios have released Bonus View PiP Blu-ray Disc titles in 2008 such as Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Resident Evil: Extinction, V for Vendetta, and War. Some streaming video websites may minimize a video stream in a similar manner when browsing outside of the playback page. Some web browsers (including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) provide APIs or similar functions that allow a playing video to be opened in a pop-up overlay atop other applications. In 2011, after DirecTV released the HR34 Home Media Center HD DVR, Picture in Picture was introduced to all HD DVR models onwards, The feature has five options: Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Right, Lower Left, and Side-by-Side. In 2020, Apple released iOS 14 which includes Picture in Picture for select iPhone and iPad models. It is supported by Android since version 8.0.

Its Indigenous name is Cootharinga, sometimes written as Cooderinga. It rises to a height of some above sea level and dominates the city skyline. It is one of the most distinctive natural features on the Queensland coast. There are a number of vantage points from which to view the city below and also across Cleveland Bay to nearby Magnetic Island. Castle Hill (as a hill) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1993.

There are several buildings and installations on the hill. On the southern face was a two-storeyed octagonal building of concrete block work, which formerly housed the Panorama Restaurant, which has now been demolished. A carpark associated with the former restaurant is located nearby to the north. Other structures on the site include several water reservoirs and three radio communication installations. On the northernmost peak of the summit is a 1942 observation post, a low, square, concrete bunker with observation apertures. =Robert Towns monument= Plaque explaining the origins of the Robert Towns monument In 1873, Robert Towns, the founder of Townsville, died in Sydney and was buried in Balmain Cemetery. In 1940, the Municipality of Leichhardt decided to replace that cemetery with parkland (called Pioneers Memorial Park). The plans were advertised and families were invited to arrange for re-interment of bodies or removal of memorials. In 1941, the Leichhardt Council offered the memorial from the grave of Robert Towns to the Townsville City Council. In January 1942, Townsville City Council voted to accept the memorial and transport it to Townsville at a cost of but it as not unanimous with two councillors opposing the plan, one claiming that Robert Towns had done nothing for Townsville and it was only sheer good luck that caused the city to bear his name. A local resident, Tom Gleeson, proposed \\"high on the peak of Castle Hill, overlooking the harbour\\" would be a suitable location for the monument. Having arrived in Townsville, the monument was then placed in storage for a number of years. It was not until October 1947 that the Council discussed where to place the monument. A number of locations were considered: Castle Hill, the Botanic Gardens, in front of the Queens Hotel, the Anzac Memorial Park and the Railway Oval, but Castle Hill was ultimately the council's choice. In February 1948, the Queensland Government gave its approval to the council to place the monument in the centre of the car parking area on the top of Castle Hill. Over two years later, in November 1949, the monument was finally placed on Castle Hill, where it stands to the present day. A plaque was added to explain the origins of the monument. Flora The vegetation, largely regenerative, is dominated by indigenous plant species. Approximately 300 plant species have been identified. Of particular importance are: *Sarcochilus ceciliae (Orchidaceae), for which Castle Hill is the type locality, first described by renowned German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1865; * Aristida sp. nov. (Poaceae) * Arthragrostis sp. nov. (Poaceae), both endemic to Castle Hill and currently being examined for description as new species; and Trodia stenostachya (Poaceae), a hummock grass community which represents an unusual coastal occurrence of this more typically inland spinifex. The plant communities are predominantly mixed Eucalyptus spp. (E. drepaniphylla, E. dolichocarpa, E. tessellaris, E. Platyphylla, E. papuana) with variable woody understorey. Small areas of semi- evergreen notophyll vine thickets, not native to the site, occur in mesic areas such as gullies. On the gentler slopes kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) is the dominant herbaceous species, while giant spear grass (Heteropogon triticeus) dominates on the steeper slopes. Specialised flora also occur on the cliffs and rocky outcrops, in particular the Triodia hummock grass community, Ficus spp. (five species) and orchids (two species). Introduced flora comprised almost 50 species, including Ficus benghalensis (Banyan). Fauna The fauna, which has not been surveyed comprehensively, includes the unadorned rock-wallaby. The avifauna had been surveyed, with over 50 bird species either visiting or residing on the hill. Peregrine falcons and brahminy kites nest here. Echidna, death adder and quail have been seen. Activities View from Castle Hill towards the Townsville Port Many locals walk up Castle Hill for regular exercise. There are many different routes to the top, by road or by goat track. The Goat Track is a rough path that consists of 758 individual stairs from start to finish. Castle Hill is also a popular tourist site. Education groups regularly using the reserve to study natural environments, community history and urban geography. The North Queensland Conservation Council is undertaking a voluntary bush rejuvenation program of the site. History =Early records and creation of a Reserve= Castle Hill has formerly also been known locally as Cutheringa, Cudtheringa, Cootharinga, and Mt Cutheringa. The Aboriginal history associated with Cutheringa has not been recorded, but its name survives as one of only two known Australian Indigenous place names in the Townsville region, the other being Pallarenda. Castle Hill was one of the earliest sites named by Andrew Ball who, together with MW Reid, were the first Europeans to explore the Ross River area in April 1864. The settlement established here was known initially as Castletown, until the name was replaced by Townsville in 1865. The hill became a much admired local landmark, evoking aesthetic delight and a unique sense of identity. This prominent link between urban life and nature largely determined the disordered layout of Townsville's streets and in the late 19th century was frequented for recreational pursuits such as botanising and nature study. Townsville residents also illegally plundered timber and firewood from Castle Hill. Wild goats further ravaged the native vegetation. By the late 1880s the Townsville Herald (1822‚Äì97) voiced considerable public outrage at the continued denudation of Castle Hill. These concerns were part of Queensland-wide debates on forest resource use and conservation. In an innovative approach to conservation, the Townsville Municipal Council applied to the Crown to establish the Hill as a reserve under their protective trusteeship, and on 30 June, Castle Hill was gazetted a Recreation Reserve of . However, despite the appointment of Crown Land Rangers and later, a Conservator of Trees for Castle Hill, the council was able to do little to restore the tree cover of the reserve during the depression years of the 1890s. Alderman Edward Downs and EJ Banfield privately planted various trees through the 1890s, including the surviving banyans, but by the 20th century, popular interest in preserving the natural vegetation of Castle Hill had waned. Small areas of the reserve were excised in the 1890s for water reserves and quarrying, but by 1900 it remained an unimproved reserve of close to . Only into the 1930s did the Council appear to directly address the Castle Hill environment. The goats were removed, permitting natural revegetation and in 1935-36 a road to the summit was constructed as an employment generating scheme, partly funded by the Main Roads Commission. Hynes Road (now Castle Hill Road) and Lookout were named after the then Minister for Labour and Industry, Hon. MP Maurice Hynes. =World War II= Ammunition magazine, situated below road up Castle Hill 1952 photograph of the quarry near Sturt Street During the Second World War Castle Hill was used as a communications and observation post. Infantry and field regiments of the 5th Australian Division were deployed on the hill, and the observation post they constructed remains. In 1942 a radar station was established on the summit, and searchlights extended halfway up the hill. The road up Castle Hill was closed to traffic on 12 March 1942 to enable the construction of the above-ground Green Street Bunker near Sidney Street, West End. Unconfirmed reports indicate approval was given for the construction of an underground Area Combined Headquarters in Castle Hill in 1943.Tunnels/Bunkers under Castle Hill in World War 2. Peter Dunn's Australia @ War. Retrieved 12 June 2013. =Development= Since the 1950s areas from within the recreation reserve, including the summit, were excised for a variety of purposes: further water reserves and quarrying, a restaurant, car parking, communications installations and residential subdivision. By 1972 the Recreation Reserve had been reduced to about . In 1983 a further were granted to Yarrawonga Pty Ltd under special lease as a potential development site. The Yarrawonga subdivision is situated in the foothills of Castle Hillviews of North Ward and Magnetic Island; it has been described as the most expensive real estate outside south-east Queensland and is noted for its elevation and large homes, precariously placed on the foothills. Since 1974 radio communications installations erected at the summit have serviced the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, ambulance, fire brigade, police, state emergency services and customs.

Location of river Vecht (in dark blue). The Vecht is a Rhine branch in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is sometimes called Utrechtse Vecht to avoid confusion with its Overijssel counterpart. The area along the river is called the Vechtstreek. Geography The Vecht originates in the city of Utrecht, where the Kromme Rijn stream forks into two branches: the Leidse Rijn/Oude Rijn branch to the west and the Vecht to the north. Originally the Vecht branched off south of the city near the Roman fort Fectio, flowing eastwards around the city, but in the 12th century a northern shortcut was dug out. The Vecht meanders north past the towns and villages of Maarssen, Breukelen and Nigtevecht, crosses the border into the province of North Holland, passes the city of Weesp and discharges into the IJmeer (Lake IJ, part of the former Zuiderzee) at Muiden. The Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (Amsterdam-Rhine Canal) was dug in the Vecht basin. The Roman historian Tacitus tells us that in the first century CE a Roman fleet sailed due north down a Rhine branch, then sailed past Lake Flevo (now the Markermeer and IJsselmeer lakes) into the North Sea.

It is midway between the Lower Mainland of BC and Vancouver Island, and has a population of 1,071. Mount Parke in the south- central heart of the island is its highest peak at 255 metres (837 feet). History Mayne Island was inhabited by members of the Tsartlip First Nation prior to European colonization. Several middens are present on the island, along with period articles ‚Äì most notably including a stone bowl which was stolen in 1982 and again, in 2007. In 1794 Captain George Vancouver camped on Georgina Point where his crew left a coin and a knife found over a century later by early settlers. In 1857 Captain George Richards of the Royal Navy surveyed the area as captain of the Royal Navy vessel HMS Plumper, naming the island after his Lieutenant Richard Charles Mayne, son of the first commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police. His journals concerning his explorations of British Columbia are important sources for early British Columbia history, as are those of his colleague in many of those explorations, Royal Engineer Lieutenant Henry Spencer Palmer. During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1860 and after, Vancouver Island miners gathered on Mayne Island before rowing across Georgia Strait to the mainland of BC in search of their fortunes. The earliest homesteaders registered land claims in the Miners Bay area in 1859. During the late 19th century, Mayne Island was the commercial and social centre of the Gulf Islands. The port at Miners Bay was always busy due to the steady stream of marine traffic travelling through Active Pass, the narrow, curving strait separating Mayne from Galiano Island to the north, which is the main ferry route between the Mainland and Vancouver Island today. The historic village at Miners Bay remains the commercial centre of the island, with the annual Fall Fair still being held at the old Agricultural Hall like so many years before. Miners Bay is also the site of the Springwater Lodge which was built in 1892 and remains the oldest continuously operated hotel in British Columbia. Nearby Active Pass still throbs with a steady stream of marine traffic, a bustling contrast to the island's quiet interior byways. Village Bay, with its BC Ferries terminal, has several late 19th- century to 1930s buildings. Active Pass is named after the American survey ship USCS Active, the first steam vessel to navigate the pass. The Japanese- Canadian community on Mayne Island played a historical role in the island's economics and society from the turn of the 20th century until World War II. The community had close ties to the European-Canadian population throughout the Gulf Islands and was involved in major economic initiatives such as greenhouse farming. In 1941 the Japanese Canadians living on Mayne Island were interned by the government and resettled in New Denver for the duration of World War II. Many of the families would never return to the island after the loss of land and their community. Today, the Japanese Gardens, near Dinner Bay, are dedicated to the memory and legacy of the Mayne Island's Japanese- Canadian community. The Mayne Island community holds a Farmers' Market every Saturday morning throughout the summer months. Islanders sell their local produce, handicrafts, baked goods, and art work. Transportation A view of Mayne Island from the ferry BC Ferries operates a vehicle and passenger scheduled ferry service from Tsawwassen (Vancouver) on the mainland and Swartz Bay (Victoria) on Vancouver Island as well as to the other major southern Gulf Islands. SeaAir Seaplanes operates a scheduled float plane service calling at Mayne Island from Vancouver downtown and the airport.

Stromberg Proposed bridge In 2002, it was proposed that a for-profit prison corporation, Cornell Corrections, build a prison on the island. To connect the island with Ketchikan, it was originally planned that the federal government spend $175 million on building a bridge to the island, and another $75 million to connect it to the power grid with an electrical intertie. The Ketchikan Borough Assembly turned the proposal down when the administration of Governor Tony Knowles also expressed its disfavor to the idea. Eventually, the corporation's prison plans led to the exposure of the wide-ranging Alaska political corruption probe, which eventually ensnared U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. The bridge idea persisted.

Making his debut in Mortal Kombat 3 in 1995, he is a member of the Lin Kuei clan of assassins who underwent transformation into cyborgs. Along with counterparts Cyrax and Smoke, Sektor was assigned to hunt down the rogue former clansman Sub-Zero. Unlike Cyrax and Smoke, Sektor never rediscovered his human side and pledged his complete loyalty to the Lin Kuei. He battled with Sub-Zero over leadership of the clan before forming his own faction, the Tekunin; composed entirely of other cybernetic warriors. His backstory prior to his transformation is expanded upon in the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, in which he is officially seen as a human prior to automation for the first time. Sektor has also been featured in other Mortal Kombat media such as the 1996 animated series, Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, and the 2011 web series, Mortal Kombat: Legacy. The character has received mostly positive reception, particularly for his Fatality finishing moves and personality, but a response to his gameplay has been decisively mixed. Appearances =In video games= When the Lin Kuei decide to automate their ninja in the events leading up to Mortal Kombat 3, Sektor was the first volunteer to undergo the process, which he did out of loyalty to the clan. Designated as unit LK-9T9, he was sent to find and kill the rogue defector Sub-Zero, who had quit the clan after refusing to be mechanized. Future events would leave Sektor as the only active cyborg remaining out of the original three created, with Smoke having been captured and shut down in an Outworld prison before he was subsequently enslaved by Noob Saibot while Cyrax joined Sonya Blade and Jax Briggs as a member of the Outer World Investigation Agency after his human soul was restored. During his many violent battles against Outworld forces, Sektor's programming became corrupted to the point that he believed the Lin Kuei Grandmaster to be inferior and killed him, but he was stopped from claiming the Dragon Medallion, the proof of the clan's leadership, by a returning Sub-Zero, who defeated Sektor in battle and claimed the title of Grandmaster for himself. Sektor fled to Japan thereafter and formed the Tekunin, his own clan of cyborg ninja warriors. Sektor returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), but he plays a minor role in the game's Konquest mode when he captured the Edenian demigod Taven while he was searching his father, Argus', temple for a weapon he left behind and imprisoned him in a Tekunin warship. Sektor tried to interrogate Taven about a message he had received from Argus, but failed to glean anything from him. Before he could try further, the warship was attacked by Sonya Blade and the Special Forces, Taven escaped in the ensuing chaos, and while Sektor confronted him before he could leave, the Edenian defeated him in battle. Following this, Sektor escaped from the warship before it self- destructed. In Mortal Kombat (2011), an alternative-timeline retelling of the first three games, Sektor is depicted as the son of the Lin Kuei Grandmaster, a position the former hoped to usurp from him.Sektor Biography - Mortal Kombat Warehouse. Retrieved July 25, 2014. He is introduced during the Shaolin Tournament as a human Chinese member of the clan who, along with Cyrax, was paid handsomely by tournament organizer Shang Tsung to compete and kill Earthrealm's fighters. Sektor and Cyrax had conflicting views over the Lin Kuei's impending \\"Cyber Initiative\\", which called for all of its members to be transformed into cyborgs. Sektor wholly supported the proposition while Cyrax was reluctant to surrender his humanity. Sektor later came to blows with Cyrax when the latter refused to kill Johnny Cage in battle, but was defeated by his comrade, who quit the clan soon after. During the second Mortal Kombat tournament, a cyberized Sektor attacked Smoke and attempted to kidnap him so he could be cyberized as well, only to be prevented by the thunder god Raiden. However, in a reversal of Smoke and Sub-Zero's storylines from MK3, the Lin Kuei captured Sub-Zero inside Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's arena and eventually cyberized him, with Sektor pledging his services to the Kahn in exchange. When Shao Kahn launched an invasion of Earthrealm, Sektor and the rest of the cyberized Lin Kuei launched their own attack on the Earthrealm defenders to stop them from interfering with the Kahn's plans, only to be thwarted by defeated by the warrior Nightwolf. Despite this, Shao Kahn's wife Sindel completed the clan's objective of slaughtering the Earthrealm warriors. Sektor makes a cameo in Mortal Kombat X. After the previous game, as shown in the comic book prequel, Sektor completely cyberized the Lin Kuei and made clone robots in his image to bolster the ranks. After the revenant Sub-Zero was revived and returned to human form, Sektor sent his robots to capture the wayward warrior again. Apparently, it failed due to Sub-Zero's being turned into Chaosrealm cleric Havik's slave by a dagger he tried to retrieve for Raiden. After Sub-Zero recovered from both the curse and his injuries, he infiltrated the Lin Kuei to stop Sektor for good. During the ensuing fight, Sektor captured Sub-Zero, but the latter outwitted him by uploading a virus into the cyber Lin Kuei's systems, restoring Cyrax's humanity and causing him to turn on Sektor. With Cyrax's help, Sub-Zero killed Sektor by decapitating him, though he kept his parts to access his memory files. In doing so, he discovered that the Lin Kuei had aided the sorcerer Quan Chi in the slaughter of the Shirai Ryu clan and Hanzo Hasashi's murder. The Lin Kuei were to pledge loyalty to fallen Elder God Shinnok as part of the agreement, but when the time came, Sektor and the Lin Kuei refused due to Quan Chi resurrecting Hanzo as the undead revenant Scorpion; an act that Sektor felt violated the terms as Hanzo was still \\"alive\\". Sektor also appeared as a variation for the downloadable character Triborg. A time-displaced Sektor appears in Mortal Kombat 11 as an NPC. Sektor and his Cyber Lin Kuei army are revived by the keeper of time Kronika and brought into her ranks. They are joined by Sub- Zero‚Äôs former apprentice, Frost, who became Sektor‚Äôs trusted second-in-command and later successor after undergoing the cyberization process. He, Cyrax, and Frost, backed by Noob Saibot, kidnapped all of Sub-Zero‚Äôs Lin Kuei warriors and forcibly converted them into cyborgs. After learning of what they had done, Sub-Zero and Hanzo arrived at the Cyber Lin Kuei's factory to shut it down. Sektor confronted them after Cyrax is freed from his control, revealing he contributed to Hanzo becoming Scorpion, but is defeated and later deactivated when Cyrax shuts down the factory. Noob and Frost escape with Sektor's body, which Kronika's allies use to revive him and the Cyber Lin Kuei. Once they were ready, the cyborgs joined the Black Dragon crime cartel in storming the Special Forces base, where Kano used a kill-switch installed in Sektor's systems to destroy it. When the joint Earthrealm/Outworld armies launched an attack on Kronika's keep, the Cyber Lin Kuei attempted to stop them under Frost's leadership, but Raiden destroyed them. In Sub-Zero‚Äôs arcade ending, he discovers Sektor was responsible for corrupting Bi-Han before he eventually became Noob Saibot. Design and gameplay Sektor (voiced by Andrew Kishino) during the first tournament in MK2011s story mode, which marked his first official human appearance in the MK series As a byproduct of all the costumes worn for the filming of Mortal Kombat 3 being red, Sektor, played by Sal Divita, was the first of the three cybernetic ninjas to be conceived, during which he was simply called \\"Cyber-Ninja.\\"Video Games The Ultimate Gaming Magazine #75 (April 1995) When Cyrax was later added to the roster, he and Sektor were nicknamed \\"Mustard\\" and \\"Ketchup,\\" respectively, before their final names were determined.Mortal Kombat 3 - In Development - MKSecrets. net. Retrieved July 24, 2014. John Tobias said that Cyrax and Sektor's design was in part inspired by Boba Fett and the Predator. According to Ed Boon, he proved the most difficult of the new MK3 characters to name, a decision that extended late into the development process until \\"Sektor\\" was finally chosen because it was the name that the team \\"didn't hate the most.\\"Sektor's Armageddon Kombat Card - Kamidogu via YouTube, July 1, 2008.

In an April 1995 feature about the game by VideoGames magazine while it was still in production, Boon gushed about Sektor's \\"great\\" then-unnamed \\"Compactor\\" Fatality: \\"He stands in front of you and all this machinery comes out of his chest and just crushes you.\\" In the 1995 television special about the making of MK3 that was shot while the game was in production, a brainstorming session among the development team was filmed in which they were discussing the cyber-ninja characters; rejected names included \\"Saibot X-11\\" and \\"Defcon,\\" while special effects designer John Vogel joked that the game would have a secret character named \\"Mayo,\\" in reference to Cyrax and Sektor's development names. Divita was also shown in one segment putting on Sektor's helmet before engaging series graphic artist Carlos Pesina (Raiden) in a mock fight.Making of Mortal Kombat 3: Into the Outworld - Midway Games/Williams Entertainment, 1995. Sektor's development name is referenced in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance as the name of one of Sektor's combos in his Sambo fighting style, and he also has a special in Armageddon called \\"Ketchup's Revenge.\\" Like Scorpion's sprite being multiplied for the series' human ninjas, palette swaps of Sektor were used to create Cyrax and the robotic Smoke. Being a cyborg, Sektor has the abilities to shoot out missiles from his chest and project fire from implements attached to his wrists, which he uses for certain special moves and Fatalities. He also utilizes a teleport uppercut for one of his special moves. When Fatalities are performed on him, his corpse and contents are human, although he bleeds oil when hit. From MK3 and its updates to Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), Sektor's appearance originally resembled an armored ninja, but the series' transition into full 3D allowed for more mechanical design possibilities, the cyber-ninja template having first changed with Cyrax in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Sektor received an exact replica of Cyrax's design change with a red recolor; the lower body appears more mechanical, yet the head remains the same. Sektor retained this appearance in Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition. He finally received his own original design in Armageddon, leaving his helmet design as the only visual link to Cyrax. The Krypt in Armageddon has concept art of Sektor holding a weapon similar to a polearm (it is referred to as a \\"2-hand pulse blade\\"); the concept was dropped in favor of giving him two lightsaber-like swords in the game. Sektor's Fatalities in MK2011 involve the dismemberment of his opponents, whether through an implement fired from his chest (\\"Scarecrow\\"), or cutting of them into several pieces before blowing the segments up with missiles (\\"Robo-Sek\\"). His and Cyrax's MK3 costumes were released together in June 2011 as downloadable content for the reboot game. =In other media= Sektor is briefly seen in two episodes of the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. In the series premiere (\\"Kombat Begins Again\\"), he and Cyrax led an attack on Earthrealm that was thwarted by the Earthrealm defenders. He individually challenges Kitana but is defeated, during which Kitana deflects one of his missiles with her fans. During a brief flashback scene at the Lin Kuei compound in the fifth episode (\\"Old Friends Never Die\\"), he was unmasked and depicted as a black man with long dreadlocks. They are also shown in their present forms as working for the Grandmaster in attempting to apprehend Sub-Zero while fighting the Earth warriors before they later retreat from battle by exiting through a portal.MK Characters Unmasked - Sektor at The Kombat Pavilion Sektor did not appear in the 1997 film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, which instead saw Smoke utilizing his chest missiles during a fight scene with Liu Kang. He makes one appearance in the 2011 first season of director Kevin Tancharoen's Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series and is played by Peter Shinkoda. In the ninth episode, he and Cyrax are first shown in their human forms and are being trucked to a nondescript warehouse that serves as the Lin Kuei headquarters. After a successful test battle pitting them against cyborgs disguised as human fighters, Sektor and Cyrax themselves are seen undergoing automation, the process of which is shown in detail for the first time in any type of MK media while featuring moderately graphic imagery. They then fight two against one in hand-to-hand combat against another cybernetic named Hydro, who decisively pounds Sektor until Cyrax gains the upper hand that enables them to team up and finish Hydro off by decapitating him, all while the Grandmaster and a pre-injury Kano watch from inside a laboratory. =In promotion and merchandise= Sektor made his official debut when a close-up of Divita in costume was featured on the April 1995 cover of VideoGames with the tagline, \\"Johnny Cage is dead.

Burley tobacco is a light air-cured tobacco used primarily for cigarette production. In the United States it is produced in an eight-state belt with approximately 70% produced in Kentucky. Tennessee produces approximately 20%, with smaller amounts produced in Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Burley tobacco is produced in many other countries, with major production in Brazil, Malawi and Argentina. History Field of burley tobacco, drying and curing barn in the background, farm of Russell Spears, Lexington, Kentucky, 1940 Harvesting burley tobacco, 1940 Fields at the George Barkley Farm near Augusta, Kentucky, where Webb and Fore obtained the first white burley seed The origin of white burley tobacco was credited to George Webb and Joseph Fore in 1864, who grew it on the farm of Captain Frederick Kautz near Higginsport, Ohio, from seed from Bracken County, Kentucky. He noticed it yielded a different type of light leaf shaded from white to yellow, and cured differently. By 1866, he harvested 20,000 pounds of burley tobacco and sold it in 1867 at the St. Louis Fair for $58 per hundred pounds. By 1883, the principal market for this tobacco was Cincinnati, but it was grown throughout central Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. In 1880 Kentucky produced 36 percent of the total national tobacco production, and was first in the country, with nearly twice as much tobacco produced as by Virginia, then the second-place state.J.M. Stoddart, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. American Supplement (Stoddart's Encyclopaedia Americana: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, and Companion to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. (9th ed.) and to All Other Encyclopaedias, Volume 1), 1883, pp. 120‚Äì123. Retrieved 5 February 2011. Later the type became referred to as burley tobacco, which is air-cured. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April. Transplanting begins in May and progresses through June with a small percentage set in July. Producers must contend with major diseases such as black shank and blue mold and insects like aphids, tobacco hornworms and budworms. Plants are topped by removing the developing flower head at approximately 60 days from transplanting, and treated to prevent the growth of side shoots called suckers. Topping allows energy that would have produced a bloom to promote leaf expansion. Many of the benefits in topping at the appropriate bloom stage and leaf number are lost if suckers are not controlled. Suckers grow vigorously immediately after topping and can severely reduce yield and quality if not effectively controlled. Some varieties, such as KY 14xL8 and Narrowleaf Madole, are known to have more rapid sucker growth than other varieties and may require more aggressive sucker control strategies. Three types of chemicals are available for controlling sucker growth on tobacco. At approximately four weeks after topping, the tobacco is stalk-cut, using a knife that is shaped like a tomahawk. Each plant is speared, spiked or spudded (the terminology depending on the geographic location) onto a stick topped by a metal spear, spike or spud that fits over the stick. Each stick will contain five or six stalks. Sticks of green-cut tobacco are most often allowed to field-wilt for three or four days prior to hanging in a barn. Tobacco is allowed to air-cure for eight or more weeks, turning from the normal pale green to yellow and then to brown. Burley that cures too quickly will retain some of the yellow pigments, as well as chemicals that normally break down with a slower cure. The quality achieved by U.S. burley producers is primarily due to natural curing conditions. Once fully cured burley is taken down, sticks are removed and leaves are stripped from the plant into grades by stalk position. Leaves are baled by grade and taken to a receiving station run by a tobacco manufacturer or leaf dealer. Sweetening Burley contains little sugar, and has generally been cased (sweetened) with humectants, sugars, or other flavors for uses such as in American blend cigarettes. As a result, a broad ban enacted by Canada and proposed in many other countries would block the import of nearly all tobacco products containing burley. The situation resembles a dispute between Asian producers and the United States, which banned clove cigarettes. For each nation, banning components typical of tobacco manufactured abroad provides a powerful trade advantage, but may be prohibited by GATT trade agreements. The effect on American producers is limited, but not negligible, as most Canadian imports were already of flue-cured Virginia tobacco.

With affordable rents, easy availability, and location near the Hervanta campus of Tampere University, it is a popular dwelling for first year students and exchange students. Mikontalo was built during the period 1978-1980. Representing brutalism, it consists of 4 blocks with 12 floors where 767 dwellings are situated. Mikontalo offers for its inhabitants saunas (two per building), a free gym, public lounge with a TV-set, Nintendo Wii, Soundsystem, board games, coffee machine and microwave; laundry room (5 washing and 2 drying machines), cable TV, and connection to the Internet. According to word of mouth, Mikontalo is the biggest dwelling building in Finland, and even within the Nordic Countries. This is however hard to confirm. The building went through major renovations from Summer 2007 until Summer 2009. During the renovation juliet balconies were added to some of the apartments. Also the fa√ßade panels were painted with bluish grey color, replacing red, orange and yellow colors.

The Zoo Hypothesis states that alien civilizations refrain from contacting Earth, so as to not interfere in natural evolution and cultural development, or to minimize risk for themselves. Certain technological, political or ethical thresholds and standards could be implemented for other civilizations to pass, after which contact would be established. In the likely case that more than one sufficiently developed alien civilizations exist, a Uniformity of Motive with legal policy concerning the contact of newly developing civilizations would have to be established and maintained. A ‚ÄúGalactic Club‚Äù would be formed and maintained, possibly by an early advanced civilization. The size of a club like this would influence the likelihood of compliance by all members, since any member could break the contact rules at any point in time, making large Galactic Clubs unlikely to succeed in their goals.  Plausibility of the assumption  The concept of Uniformity of Motive is not a widely researched topic, as it would only resolve Fermi's paradox when all extraterrestrial civilizations would abide by the rule to not contact ‚Äòlesser developed‚Äô civilizations, such as Earth. Additionally, the Uniformity of Motive is purely based on assumptions and is therefore a hard hypothesis to scientifically confirm or reject. The Arecibo message from 1974 is an example of a message that represents humankind. It was broadcast into globular star cluster M13. Thomas Hair (2011) researches the idea that, given that Earth is a relatively young planet, older extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow the lead of an even older civilization - the first civilization to come up with a Uniformity of Motive (as originally proposed by Ronald Bracewell). He calculates using Monte Carlo simulations that there would be an enormous time gap between the first civilization and the emergence of Earth, During that time span, a first civilization could spread its rule throughout the galaxy. Still, the uniformity of motive is a difficult galactic rule to uphold when most extraterrestrial civilizations are scattered over thousands of light years, restricted by natural speed laws. Due to the amount of civilizations that could be present in our galaxy, the assumption of a uniformity of motive would be arguable, proposes Duncan Forgan. Forgan reconsiders this idea that the galaxy would be rather made up of Galactic Cliques with similarly evolved cultural norms than one big Galactic Club.  Convergent cultural evolution  Convergent cultural evolution could explain the emergence of uniform motives in a possible Galactic Club. This convergence on a certain set of cultural norms and ethics might be a necessary condition for civilizations to reach sufficient developmental stages for space exploration and communication, since the environmental pressures of intergalactic travel and communication are similar for all alien civilizations. Under this assumption, the concept of a Galactic Club with Uniformity of Motive would gain plausibility.  Earth law on extraterrestrial contact  Space can be explored and used freely by all United Nations States according to the Outer Space Treaty from 1967. However, the United Nations have no specific laws on initiating contact with other extraterrestrial civilizations, apart from three important principles to follow when doing so (as quoted from the source): # The decision on whether or not to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence should be made by an appropriate international body, broadly representative of Humankind. # If a decision is made to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence, it should be sent on behalf of all Humankind, rather than from individual States or groups. # The content of such a message should be developed through an appropriate international process, reflecting a broad consensus. There have been multiple attempts to contact alien civilizations, of which the most notable examples are the Voyager probes. The International Academy of Astronautics has prepared a SETI detection protocol to follow that is in accordance with all International Space Law of the United Nations. The detection of possible alien life should first be validated. If the detection appears to be real, then the discoverer should seek contact with the national authorities and other research organizations so they can conduct independent research on the observations. The United Nations and consequently the public will be contacted after.

She is known for her co-starring roles as Annette in the 1977 film Saturday Night Fever, Angie Falco Benson in the 1980s sitcom Angie, Donna Garland in the sitcom Out of This World, and Eileen Stevens in the Disney Channel sitcom Even Stevens. Early life Pescow was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 24, 1954 to a Jewish family. Her father Marty owned and ran a newsstand in downtown New York City at 17 Battery Place. Pescow attended Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn, and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In approximately 1973, she had a leading role in an Off-Off Broadway musical entitled Poor Old Fool. It had a brief run, closing after just a few weeks. Career In 1977, Pescow played Annette in the John Travolta film Saturday Night Fever. For this role, she had to relearn her Brooklyn accent (which she had significantly reduced for professional reasons). While her role, and the film, were huge successes, she later went on to appear in television roles for most of her career. For this role, she was the New York Film Critics' third place choice for their award for Best Supporting Actress. Also in 1977, Pescow joined the cast of the ABC soap opera One Life to Live, portraying Celena Arquette. The role proved to be brief, lasting under a year, but it helped to launch a successful television career for Pescow, including roles on two other ABC soap operas in later years. In 1978, Pescow portrayed one of Judy Garland's older sisters in the television biographical film Rainbow, directed by Jackie Cooper. Pescow starred in her own television series, Angie, which ran for two seasons from 1979 to 1980 on ABC. Her primary castmates were Robert Hays, Debralee Scott, and fellow New Yorker Doris Roberts. In 1982, Pescow was cast in a groundbreaking role, that of Dr. Lynn Carson on the soap opera All My Children, which she portrayed from 1982 to 1983. Her character was the first lesbian on a daytime serial. After her run on All My Children ended, Donna decided to continue her run on television. She later landed the role of Donna Garland, the mother of Evie Ethel Garland, in the first-run syndication children's comedy series Out of This World (1987‚Äì1991), along with Maureen Flannigan and Joe Alaskey. Donna portrayed this role for the show's entire run, from its premiere in 1987 until its cancellation in 1991. After Out of This World ended, Donna went on to have a series of smaller roles, before returning to prominent television roles. She appeared in an episode of Clueless in addition to making guest appearances on NYPD Blue, Pauly, and Ivory Tower. In 1998, she had a role in the television film Dead Husbands. Pescow appeared on the ABC soap opera General Hospital from 1999 to 2001. Hers was a villainous role ‚Äî that of Gertrude Morgan, the evil aunt of Chloe Morgan (Tava Smiley) - and lasted for Smiley's entire run on the series (1999‚Äì2001). In 2001, Smiley was released from her contract at General Hospital, resulting in Pescow's character being written off along with on-screen niece Chloe, in 2001. During her run on General Hospital, she also had a small role in the television film Partners and guest starred on the television series Philly. In 1999, Disney contacted Pescow about appearing in a half-hour kids/teen sitcom for the network. A pilot was filmed in 2000, and the series went on to become Even Stevens. It aired for three seasons, the norm for Disney Channel series of the time, from 2000-2003. She also directed three episodes of the series. The series became a flagship for the network, and after it ended in 2003, Donna and the rest of the cast returned for The Even Stevens Movie, which served as the finale. After taking several years off after the finale of Even Stevens, Donna returned to work when she signed on to appear in the film One Sung Hero alongside Nicole Sullivan. After appearing in the film, Donna once again took a small break from acting, but she did appear in a 2006 episode of Crossing Jordan. In 2007, Donna made an appearance in the series finale of The Sopranos, performing the role of Donna Parisi, the wife of the mobster Patsy Parisi.

This carries a distinct smell, either from that or various specially cultivated bacteria. Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. Blue cheeses are typically aged in a temperature-controlled environment such as a cave. Blue cheese can be eaten by itself or can be spread, crumbled or melted into or over a range of other foods. Blue cheese is known for its pungent creamy texture. The characteristic flavor of blue cheeses tends to be sharp and salty. The smell of this food is due to both the mold and types of bacteria encouraged to grow on the cheese: for example, the bacterium Brevibacterium linens is responsible for the smell of many blue cheeses, as well as foot odour and other human body odors.  History  Blue cheese is believed to have been discovered by accident when cheeses were stored in natural temperatures and moisture-controlled caves which happen to be favorable environments for many varieties of harmless mold. It was moist in the cave so the mold would form. According to legend, one of the first blue cheeses, Roquefort, was discovered when a young boy, eating bread and ewes' milk cheese, abandoned his meal in a nearby cave after seeing a beautiful girl in the distance. When he returned months later, the mold (Penicillium roqueforti) had transformed his cheese into Roquefort. Gorgonzola is one of the oldest known blue cheeses, having been created around AD 879, though it is said that it did not contain blue veins until around the 11th century. Stilton is a relatively new addition, becoming popular sometime in the early 1700s. Many varieties of blue cheese that originated subsequently, such as the 20th century Danablu and Cambozola, were an attempt to fill the demand for Roquefort-style cheeses that were prohibitive due to either cost or politics.  Production  Cambozola, a German variety of blue cheese Similarly to other varieties of cheese, the process of making blue cheese consists of six standard steps. However, additional ingredients and processes are required to give this blue-veined cheese its particular properties. To begin with, the commercial scale production of blue cheese consists of two phases: the culturing of suitable spore-rich inocula and fermentation for maximum, typical flavor.Watts, j. C. Jr.. Nelson, J. H. (to Dairyland Food Laboratories, Inc.), U.S. Patent 3,072,488 (Jan. 8, 1963). = Penicillium roqueforti inoculum = In the first phase of production, a Penicillium roqueforti inoculum is prepared prior to the actual production of blue cheese. Multiple methods can be used to achieve this. However, all methods involve the use of a freeze-dried Penicillium roqueforti culture. Although Penicillium roqueforti can be found naturally, cheese producers nowadays use commercially manufactured Penicillium roqueforti. First, Penicillium roqueforti is washed from a pure culture agar plants which is later frozen. Through the freeze drying process, water from the frozen state is evaporated without the transition through the liquid state (sublimation). This retains the value of the culture and is activated upon the addition of water. Salt, sugar or both are added to autoclaved, homogenized milk via a sterile solution. This mixture is then inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti. This solution is first incubated for three to four days at . More salt and/or sugar is added and then aerobic incubation is continued for an additional one to two days. Alternatively, sterilized, homogenized milk and reconstituted non-fat solids or whey solids are mixed with sterile salt to create a fermentation medium. A spore-rich Penicillium roqueforti culture is then added. Next, modified milk fat is added which consists of milk fat with calf pre-gastric esterase. This solution is prepared in advance by an enzyme hydrolysis of a milk fat emulsion. The addition of modified milk fat stimulates a progressive release of free fatty acids via lipase action which is essential for rapid flavor development in blue cheese. This inoculum produced by either methods is later added to the cheese curds. = Production and fermentation = Gorgonzola cheese First, raw milk (either from cattle, goats or sheep) is mixed and pasteurized at for 15 seconds. Then, acidification occurs: a starter culture, such as Streptococcus lactis, is added in order to change lactose to lactic acid, thus changing the acidity of the milk and turning it from liquid to solid. The next step is coagulation, where rennet, a mixture of rennin and other material found in the stomach lining of a calf is added to solidify the milk further. Following this, thick curds are cut typically with a knife to encourage the release of liquid or whey. The smaller the curds are cut, the thicker and harder the resulting cheese will become. After the curds have been ladled into containers in order to be drained and formed into a full wheel of cheese, the Penicillium roqueforti inoculum is sprinkled on top of the curds along with Brevibacterium linens. Then, the curds granules are knit in molds to form cheese loaves with a relatively open texture. Next, whey drainage continues for 10‚Äì48 hours in which no pressure is applied, but the molds are inverted frequently to promote this process. Salt is then added to provide flavor as well as to act as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil through the process of brine salting or dry salting for 24‚Äì48 hours. The final step is ripening the cheese by aging it. When the cheese is freshly made, there is little to no blue cheese flavor development. Usually, a fermentation period of 60‚Äì90 days are needed before the flavor of the cheese is typical and acceptable for marketing. During this ripening period, the temperature and the level of humidity in the room where the cheese is aging is monitored to ensure the cheese does not spoil or lose its optimal flavor and texture. In general, the ripening temperature is around eight to ten degrees Celsius with a relative humidity of 85‚Äì95%, but this may differ according to the type of blue cheese being produced. At the beginning of this ripening process, the cheese loaves are punctured to create small openings to allow air to penetrate and support the rich growth of the aerobic Penicillium roqueforti cultures, thus encouraging the formation of blue veins. Throughout the ripening process, the total ketone content is constantly monitored as the distinctive flavor and aroma of blue cheese arises from methyl ketones (including 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone) which are a metabolic product of Penicillium roqueforti.. Once the specified level of total ketone production is attained, the blue cheese is sterilized at ultra high temperature/short time at for four seconds. This heat treatment also inactivates the Penicillium roqueforti, inhibiting further fermentation.  Toxins from the production of blue cheese  Penicillium roqueforti, responsible for the greenish blue moldy aspect of blue cheese, produces several mycotoxins. While mycotoxins like roquefortine, isofumigaclavine A, mycophenolic acid and ferrichrome, are present at low levels, penicillic acid and PR toxin are unstable in the cheese. Because of the instability of PR toxin and lack of optimal environmental conditions (temperature, aeration) for the production of PR toxin and roquefortine, health hazards due to Penicillium roqueforti metabolites are considerably reduced. Additionally, mycotoxin contamination occurs at low levels and large quantities of cheese are rarely consumed, suggesting that hazard to human health is unlikely.  Physicochemical properties  = Structure = The main structure of the blue cheese comes from the aggregation of the casein. In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the ‚Äúhairy layer.‚Äù The hairy layer consists of Œ∫-casein, which are strings of polypeptides that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle. The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the entropy of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the enzyme, rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the Œ∫-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese. Characteristic blue veins in blue cheese. = Mold growth = Penicillium roqueforti and Penicillium glaucum are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow. Therefore, initial fermentation of the cheese is done by lactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid bacteria, however, are killed by the low pH and the secondary fermenters, Penicillium roqueforti, take over and break the lactic acid down, maintaining a pH in the aged cheese above 6.0. As the pH rises again from the loss of lactic acid, the enzymes in the molds responsible for lipolysis and proteolysis are more active and can continue to ferment the cheese because they are optimal at a pH of 6.0. Penicillium roqueforti creates the characteristic blue veins in blue cheese after the aged curds have been pierced, forming air tunnels in the cheese. When given oxygen, the mold is able to grow along the surface of the curd-air interface. The veins along the blue cheese are also responsible for the aroma of blue cheese itself. In fact, one type of bacteria in blue cheese, Brevibacterium linens, is the same bacteria responsible for foot and body odor. B. linens was previously thought to give cheeses their distinct orangish pigmentation, but studies show this not to be the case and blue cheese is an example of the lack of that orange pigmentation. In pressing the cheese, the curds are not tightly packed in order to allow for air gaps between them. After piercing, the mold can also grow in between the curds. Blue cheese platter = Flavour = A portion of the distinct flavour comes from lipolysis (the breakdown of fat). The metabolism of the blue mold further breaks down fatty acids to form ketones to give blue cheese a richer flavour and aroma.  Regulation  = European Union = In the European Union, many blue cheeses, such as Cabrales, Danablu, Gorgonzola, Roquefort and Blue Stilton, carry a protected designation of origin, meaning they can bear the name only if they have been made in a particular region. Similarly, individual countries have protections of their own such as France's Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e and Italy's Denominazione di Origine Protetta. Blue cheeses with no protected origin name are designated simply \\"blue cheese\\". = Canada = Under the regulation of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, it requires manufacturers to produce blue cheese with a 47 maximum percentage of moisture and 27 percent minimum percentage of milk fat. Salt is allowed to be used as a preservative; however, the amount of the salt or combination of salts shall not exceed 200 parts per million of the milk and milk products used to make the cheese. Other than that the regulation of Canadian Food Inspection Agency does not limit producers to use bacterial cultures to aid further ripening and flavoring preparations other than cheese flavoring.  Properties  Gorgonzola, Stilton, and Roquefort are considered to be favored blue cheeses in many countries. These cheeses all have a protected designation of origin in which they may only be called their respective name if produced a certain way in a certain location. = Gorgonzola = Gorgonzola cheese Gorgonzola blue cheese takes its name from the village of Gorgonzola in Italy where it was first made. Belonging to the family of Stracchino cheeses, Gorgonzola is a whole milk, white, and \\"uncooked\\" cheese. This blue cheese is inoculated with Penicillium glaucum which, during ripening, produces the characteristic of blue-green veins. The odor of Gorgonzola varies between natural and creamy Gorgonzola cheese. 63 components in natural Gorgonzola cheese and 52 components in creamy Gorgonzola cheese contribute to odor with 2-nonanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-heptanol, ethyl hexanoate, methylanisole and 2-heptanone being the prominent compounds for odor in both cheeses. = Stilton = Stilton blue cheese Stilton blue cheese was first sold in the village of Stilton in England but there is little evidence it was ever made there. Different from Stichelton, which is made from raw milk, Stilton cheese is made from pasteurized milk. In addition to being inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti to give it the blue vein characteristic, research has shown that other microbiota which are relatives of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Staphylococcus equorum, and Staphylococcus sp. can also be found in Stilton cheese. Some important microbiota contribute to the aromatic profile such as those of the Lactobacillus genus due to their production of volatile compounds. During ripening, free fatty acids increase in amount which contribute to the characteristic flavor of blue cheeses due to fat breakdown by Penicillium roqueforti. = Roquefort = Roquefort cheese Roquefort blue cheese originates from the village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. Its flavors come from the use of unpasteurized sheep's milk, inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti, and the special conditions of the natural caves of Roquefort-sur- Soulzon in which they are ripened. Penicillium roqueforti is the cause of the blue veins in Roquefort cheese. In addition to Penicillium roqueforti, various yeasts are present, namely Debaryomyces hansenii and its non-sporulating form Candida famata, and Kluyveromyces lactis and its non-sporulating form Candida sphaerica. Similarly to other kinds of blue cheeses, Roquefort's flavor and odor can be attributed to the particular mixture of methyl ketones such as 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, and 2-nonanone.

Hall conducted thermoelectric research at Harvard and also wrote numerous physics textbooks and laboratory manuals.  Biography  Hall was born in Gorham, Maine, U.S.. Hall did his undergraduate work at Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, graduating in 1875. He was the principal of Gould Academy in 1875‚Äì1876 and the principal of Brunswick High School in 1876‚Äì1877. He did his graduate schooling and research, and earned his Ph.D. degree (1880), at the Johns Hopkins University where his seminal experiments were performed. The Hall effect was discovered by Hall in 1879, while working on his doctoral thesis in Physics. Hall's experiments consisted of exposing thin gold leaf (and, later, using various other materials) on a glass plate and tapping off the gold leaf at points down its length. The effect is a potential difference (Hall voltage) on opposite sides of a thin sheet of conducting or semiconducting material (the Hall element) through which an electric current is flowing. This was created by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the Hall element. The ratio of the voltage created to the amount of current is known as the Hall resistance, and is a characteristic of the material in the element. In 1880, Hall's experimentation was published as a doctoral thesis in the American Journal of Science and in the Philosophical Magazine. Hall was appointed as a professor of physics at Harvard in 1895, and succeeded John Trowbridge as Rumford Professor of Physics in 1914. Hall retired in 1921 and died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. in 1938. The Hall effect is used in magnetic field sensors, present in a large number of devices, as well as high efficiency electric propulsion systems on spacecraft. In the presence of large magnetic field strength and low temperature, one can observe the quantum Hall effect, which is the quantization of the Hall resistance. This is now the official standard for electrical resistance.

Due to the growing interest, he was added by the series developers to the roster of playable characters in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a red palette swap of Scorpion. Ermac has become a recurring character in the Mortal Kombat games after playing a central role in Mortal Kombat: Deception, in which he had a distinctive redesign and joined forces with series protagonist Liu Kang, but he has had smaller roles in subsequent series releases. The character has appeared in alternative Mortal Kombat media such as the animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm and the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy. Critical and public reception has been mainly positive, with appearances on multiple lists of the top characters and Fatality finishing moves in the Mortal Kombat franchise from video game and mainstream publications, while his origins have been rated among the most memorable legends of general video gaming. History and conception In the diagnostics menu of the 1992 original Mortal Kombat game, an audits screen displayed a macro that had been created by Mortal Kombat co-creator and programmer Ed Boon in order to catch coding errors. This practice had been employed by series developer Midway Games since their 1990 arcade release Smash TV. It was spelled as ERMACS‚Äîa pluralized contraction of error macro‚Äîas in the number of times the program would execute. In early revisions of the game, it appeared on the audits screen beneath a counter titled \\"Shang Tsung Beaten\\" (in reference to the game's final boss fight). However, when Boon added the hidden character Reptile into the third revision, ERMACS was listed on the menu below the counters \\"Reptile Appearances\\" and \\"Reptile Battles\\", which provoked players into searching for a second secret character called Ermac. Midway removed the ERMACS listing from the game's fifth and final update in March 1993, but speculation about the character intensified after Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) published a submitted screenshot from the first Mortal Kombat game and a letter from \\"Tony Casey\\" that claimed he had played against a red ninja named Ermac and taken a Polaroid of the screen as evidence. Unbeknownst to the magazine, the photo was a doctored image of yellow ninja character Scorpion in a victory pose on the \\"Warrior Shrine\\" stage from the Super Nintendo version of the game, tinted red and with a superimposed center-screen phrase that read \\"Ermac Wins.\\" Reader responses printed two issues later contained varying complex instructions for accessing the character. With the still-nonexistent Ermac now visualized as a red ninja, players claimed sightings of a random glitch that would cause the game's ninja characters' graphics to flash red, with \\"Error Macro\\" or \\"Ermac\\" replacing their name in their energy bar. However, such an occurrence was not possible as the macro counter could not increase in the event of a genuine glitch, while no red palette for the character existed. Though Midway included a scrambled message in the 1993 sequel Mortal Kombat II that read \\"Ermac does not exist\\", neither Boon nor Midway marketing director Roger Sharpe denied outright the character's presence in the game. In October 1995, two years after the EGM incident, Ermac was added to the selectable roster of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995; an upgrade of Mortal Kombat 3), as the developers felt that he had transformed from myth to urban legend and therefore warranted his inclusion in the series. Boon clarified the rumors on Twitter in 2011, and said he had kept the meaning of the ERMACS listing secret in hopes of stirring up fan speculation about the character. NetherRealm Studios (formerly Midway Games) has inserted allusions to the rumors and EGM hoax in subsequent Mortal Kombat games and related media. Ermac appeared on one panel in a Mortal Kombat II comic book prequel that was written and illustrated by Mortal Kombat co- creator John Tobias and published by the company in 1994. Mortal Kombat: Deception's training mode contained a message that read, \\"It is a little-known fact that 'Ermac' is short for 'Error Macro'\\", an homage to his origins that was revived in Mortal Kombat X for a pre-match introduction sequence between Ermac and series newcomer Takeda. (Takeda: \\"Error Macro.\\" / Ermac: \\"We are Ermac.\\" / Takeda: \\"We're not impressed.\\") He was an Easter egg boss hidden at the Warrior Shrine level in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, a 2005 beat 'em up spinoff title that spans the events of Mortal Kombat II. Skarlet, a nonexistent female ninja character from MKII with a similar background, was included by NetherRealm Studios as a playable character in the 2011 reboot game in what the company considered a second instance of turning fan rumors into reality. Design and portrayal Debuting in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 as a palette swap of Scorpion, Ermac received his own unique redesign for Mortal Kombat: Deception following an eight-year absence from the series Ermac was played by actor John Turk in the digitized games Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation title Mortal Kombat Trilogy. As a palette-swapped character, he was physically identical to the Mortal Kombat games' other male ninjas, save for his red coloring. For Mortal Kombat: Deception, which marked Ermac's return to the series as a playable character after an eight-year absence, he was given a distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series' lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that his objective of remaking old characters was to greatly differentiate them from their previous incarnations. His Deception design was maintained for the 2011 reboot game, but with an increased black palette. For Mortal Kombat X, Ermac was designed with a slimmer figure and his mask exposing more of his face, revealing decaying skin. According to NetherRealm Studios, his emaciated appearance is the result of his losing control of the souls inside his body, with a metal talisman modeled after his chest design from Deception affixed to his chest in order to keep his physical form intact. The talisman initially covered his face, \\"securely nailed deep into the skull\\", in concept artwork by character artist Justin Murray. Early designs by Murray had Ermac unmasked with a stockier figure and a solid black palette. Ermac's \\"Inner Workings\\" Fatality (a finishing move that executes defeated opponents) in the game has him levitate his opponent, break their spine in midair, and then telekinetically pull their gastrointestinal tract out from their mouth. The finisher was conceived by the game's lead designer, John Edwards: \\"I remember sitting in the pitch meeting for it. People were like, 'That's hilarious and disgusting.' I'm pretty proud of it.\\" Sound effects used in depicting the graphic violence of his finishers were created with slime and a plunger. =Gameplay= Ermac was the lone player character in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 who had not appeared in any previous Mortal Kombat games, and he was one of three hidden characters who were selectable after they were unlocked by players. As a palette swap, Ermac had a standard projectile attack, while sharing Scorpion's teleport- punch move and Smoke's uppercut-decapitation Fatality. His characteristic special move is the \\"Telekinetic Slam\\", which has him levitate his opponents and then slam them onto the ground; it has become his signature attack in the Mortal Kombat series. Ed Boon considered Ermac one of the strongest characters in UMK3 on the basis of the maneuver, and GamePro opined that it was best used on downed opponents. His main fighting style in Deception and Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is Choy Lay Fut, a martial art that specializes, as depicted in his Deception ending, in warding off multiple attackers. GameSpy described his combo (a timed succession of attacks) abilities therein as \\"strong\\" but felt his special moves were less effective used individually. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Ermac is a boss hidden inside a statue at the Warrior Shrine level. GameFront's Mitchell Saltzman described Ermac in the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot game as a novice-friendly character that experts could use to inflict heavy-damage combos. In Mortal Kombat X, Ermac floats across the playfield instead of walking, and his gameplay style is split into three fighting variations like those of the game's other playable characters. Bryan Dawson of Prima Games wrote that the character was ideal for distance fighting and pressuring downed opponents. Appearances =In video games= Ermac is an amalgam of the souls of deceased warriors, crafted to serve as an enforcer for Shao Kahn, the evil emperor of the otherworldly dimension of Outworld. The concentration of souls results in his possession of telekinetic powers and referring to himself in plural form. In Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (UMK3), which expanded on the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 to accommodate the upgrade's new characters, Ermac emerges from hiding to prove his existence by participating in Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm and in the third tournament. He disappears from the series continuity until Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), in which Shao Kahn is killed along with Liu Kang by the evil sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, but Ermac remains under his control and wanders Outworld without instructions until an encounter with blind swordsman Kenshi, who breaks him free of Kahn's spell out of pity. As a token of gratitude, Ermac teaches Kenshi the Telekinetic Slam. (\\"Kenshi sympathized with the plight of the enigmatic kombatant, Ermac. The Outworld warrior spirits that had manifested themselves in the form of a ninja had been violated by Shao Kahn in much the same way that Kenshi's ancestors had been enslaved by Shang Tsung. Kenshi was taught the Telekinetic Slam by Ermac in return for freeing him from the control of the emperor.\\") In Mortal Kombat: Deception (2004), Ermac becomes a force for good to atone for his crimes committed in Kahn's name. He allies himself with the spirit of Liu Kang and helps free the imprisoned souls of his friends‚ÄîJohnny Cage, Jax, Sonya Blade, Kitana, and Kung Lao‚Äîwho had been killed by the Deadly Alliance and then resurrected and controlled by the game's main boss character, the Dragon King Onaga. In a subplot that has not been explored further in the series, he then senses that Onaga is being controlled by an unseen, more powerful influence. In the game's training mode that is set before the main storyline, Ermac is dispatched to the Netherrealm by Shao Kahn to defeat the demon Ashrah, but since he is bound by magic, the dark realm drains his powers. He encounters the game's protagonist Shujinko, who locates the monolithic \\"Soul Stone\\" that restores his strength, and Ermac trains Shujinko as compensation. When Ermac confronts Ashrah, she wrongly believes he also is a demon and seeks to kill him, but he defeats her. Ermac fights alongside the Earthrealm heroes in the opening cinematic sequence of the 2006 compilation game Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, in which a battle royal commences among the combatants at the Pyramid of Argus in the fictional realm of Edenia. He and Nightwolf are overpowered by Sheeva until Kenshi intervenes, and after Quan Chi attacks Kenshi, Ermac hurls Quan Chi off the pyramid but stomps on Kenshi before revealing himself as Shang Tsung in disguise. Midway created a computer-animated concept biography showing Ermac performing a kata routine over the soundtrack of a voiceover of his Deception biography, but he was not among the seventeen characters who received an official biography for Armageddon and he therefore played no part in the storyline. He returns to his original role of Shao Kahn's enforcer in Mortal Kombat, the 2011 reboot of the continuity of the first three titles, and is present at the Shaolin Tournament from the first game, where he is beaten by Liu Kang. In the game's revised storyline, he uses his telekinetic powers to obliterate Jax's arms, causing Jax to receive bionic arm implants. In his tower ending, it is revealed that one of the souls trapped inside Ermac's being is that of Edenian ruler King Jerrod, Sindel's husband and Kitana's father, who asserts control over the warring souls after Kahn is killed. Ermac plays a supporting role in the plot of Mortal Kombat X (2015), in which he remains loyal to Shao Kahn's successors to the Outworld throne, first Mileena and then Kotal Kahn as they fight for the realm's rule in the midst of a civil war. He ultimately sides with Kotal Kahn upon the revelation that Mileena is not the true heir to the throne, as she is a genetic creation and not Shao Kahn's biological daughter. Ermac joins forces with Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr, and during a battle between the Outworlders and Cassie Cage's Special Forces unit, he is immune to Kenshi's son Takeda's telepathy due to the cacophony of souls inside his body, but he is then beaten by Takeda. Near the conclusion, Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs exacts revenge on Ermac for destroying her father's arms when she defeats him in combat. (Ermac: \\"You are spawn of Jackson Briggs.\\" / Jacqui: \\"And damn proud of it! I know what you did to him.\\" / Ermac: \\"We took your father's arms. We will take all of you.\\") In his ending, Ermac returns to Shao Kahn's abandoned fortress in search of a voice summoning him when his souls are suddenly consumed by a resurrected Shang Tsung, leaving Ermac in a weakened state. He additionally appears in the closing panel of Kotal Kahn's ending as one of Kahn's chosen warriors (alongside Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr) who fight in Mortal Kombat every decade in attempt to regain Kahn's Outworld sovereignty from Raiden. =Other appearances= Kim Do Nguyen as Ermac in the promotional trailer for the 2013 second season of Mortal Kombat: Legacy, which made changes to the character's design and his backstory from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Ermac appeared in two episodes of the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. He has a minor role in the 1997 feature film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, in which he was played by assistant stunt coordinator John Medlen and is identified by name only in the closing credits. Though the script and print media publications such as SciFi Entertainment and Black Belt mentioned his telekinetic powers,Brent V. Friedman and Bryce Zabel, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, first draft (May 22, 1996), p. 1. they were not seen in the film. His association with Kenshi in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance was loosely adapted for two episodes in the 2013 second season of director Kevin Tancharoen's Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series. Under Shao Kahn's orders, he serves as the guardian of \\"the sword of Sento\\" that is hidden in a cave, and strikes Kenshi blind when he attempts to take the sword. The following episode shows Ermac battling Kenshi in the Mortal Kombat tournament in attempt to repossess the sword before Kenshi fatally impales him with the weapon. Ermac was played by stuntman and martial artist Kim Do Nguyen, and he was depicted as a decaying, hooded demon outfitted in a tattered black robe, with his makeup designed by Christien Tinsley. Ermac briefly appears in the novelization of Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and he plays a supporting role in several issues of DC Comics' 2015 Mortal Kombat X comic miniseries that is set before the events of the game. The character was licensed in 2011 for a set of action figures by toy manufacturer Jazwares, and a life-sized standee by Advanced Graphics. Syco Collectibles released a limited-edition (250 units) eighteen-inch polystone Ermac statue in 2012. Reception GamesRadar executive editor Eric Bratcher, in a 2009 Electronic Gaming Monthly retrospective, credited the magazine hoax with Ermac's addition into the Mortal Kombat series, while Rudie Obias of Mental Floss considered it the result of fans' passion for the character. The Escapist's William Bloodworth likened the fan reaction to Ermac to that of the MissingNo. glitch from the Pok√©mon franchise. Steve Watts of 1UP.com wrote in 2011 that supposed video game glitches like Ermac \\"go on to live as legends until the creators have no choice but to make it a reality.\\" The staff of GameTrailers unsuccessfully attempted to access Ermac in the first game, per the reader instructions published in EGM, in an episode of their PopFiction web series that premiered at PAX Prime 2012. The character has been positively received for his development in Mortal Kombat: Deception, while several gaming media outlets have rated him among the top characters of the Mortal Kombat series. GamesRadar commented in 2014: \\"This red-clad ninja might not be as iconic as Sub-Zero or Scorpion, but it's hard not to love Ermac for his ... supernatural, Sith-like powers of telekinesis.\\" While Ermac and Mortal Kombat's other male ninjas ranked third on GamePro's 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer wrote in 2010 that he did not want these characters, aside from Scorpion and Sub-Zero, in future series installments, while Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot felt the unlocking of Ermac in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was \\"a hassle\\". Evan Narcisse of Time described Ermac's costume update in the 2011 reboot as differentiating from that of Sub-Zero. Ermac's \\"Pest Control\\" Fatality from the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, in which he shrinks his opponent and then crushes them underfoot, has been positively received by critics with some citing its humorous elements. When NetherRealm Studios posted a trailer of the \\"Inner Workings\\" Fatality from Mortal Kombat X on YouTube in March 2015, it accumulated over 850,000 views in less than a month, and garnered publicity due to its graphic imagery. Ryan Smith of Chicago Reader spotlighted the finisher in an April 2015 article titled \\"Has Mortal Kombat Finally Gone Too Far?\\", describing it as \\"an act of medieval torture as imagined by Tolkien.\\" Response to Ermac's alternate-media incarnations has been negative. His appearance in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was dismissed as \\"useless\\" by Seth Robison of Newsarama. Nathan Birch of Uproxx described him as a \\"red Scorpion clone\\" and his fight against Sonya Blade in the film as \\"nondescript\\". Carl Lyon of Fearnet censured the character's design in Mortal Kombat: Legacy and his role therein as having \\"little development outside of an opponent ... that gets quickly dispatched\\".

He was the son of Tekle Giyorgis. He was largely a figurehead, with real power in the hands of the Enderase or Regent, Ras Ali II a princeling of the Yejju Dynasty. Ras Ali's mother was the Empress Menen Liben Amede. Life During the various wars between Ras Ali and his leading rival for power, Dejazmach Wube Haile Maryam of Semien, Emperor Yohannes was deposed and restored several times between 30 August 1840 and 1851, alternating with his cousin Sahle Dengel. Yohannes was deposed the first time (October 1841) for showing himself a friend to Dejazmach Wube; he was restored briefly in 1845, then restored once again \\"by some unknown means\\" in 1850, according to E. A. Wallis Budge. Budge portrays Yohannes as a contemptible character, \\"only tolerated because he belonged to the Solomonic line. He was a glutton and a wine bibber, and was usually drunk, and when he was not in his banquet hall he was in his harim.\\"E. A. Wallis Budge, A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia, 1928 (Oosterhout, the Netherlands: Anthropological Publications, 1970), p. 483. He also states that Yohannes died in 1851 \\"during an attack of acute indigestion\\"; it may be that, in one of his frequent act of carelessness, Budge confused Yohannes with his relative Sahle Dengel and these vices properly belong to Sahle Dengel. On the other hand, according to Donald Crummey, he came under the influence of Catholic missionaries working with bishop Justin de Jacobis, converting to Roman Catholicism in 1851.Donald Crummey, Priests and Politicians, 1972 (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2007), p. 79 His ultimate fate is unclear‚Äîas well as many of the details of his reign. He is said to have been ruling as Emperor 18 June 1847 when Empress Mennen was defeated in combat near the northern shores of Lake Tana by Kassa of Qwara (the future Tewodros II), who captured Yohannes and Mennen and traded them to Ras Ali for the title of Dejazmach and the territories of the deceased Ras Kinfu in Gojjam.Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: The Era of the princes (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 128f Another source states that when Kassa finally usurped the Imperial throne, Yohannes agreed to step down from the throne on the condition that the new Emperor guarantee that he would not ever be made to reunite with his much hated wife, Empress Mennen. After this, Yohannes lived as a commoner. In 1856, the Catholics in Ethiopia tried to interest him in returning to the throne, but he was far more interested in undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; two years later he joined the court of Emperor Tewodros and returned to the Ethiopian Church.Crummey, Priests and Politicians, p. 100.

These are a print analog of the slight dot caused by pausing one's brush ( ), the \\"pause technique\\", used to reinforce the beginning or ending of a stroke, which is characteristic of regular script. * Overall geometrical regularity Possessing variable line weight and characteristic decorations at the end of lines similar to serifs, this type style is comparable to Western serif typefaces, as opposed to East Asian gothic typefaces which are comparable to Western sans-serif. = Variations = Often there are different ways to write the same Chinese character; these are collectively referred to as variant Chinese characters. Some of the differences are caused by character simplification, while others are purely orthographic differences such as stroke styling. The styling of the strokes used in old Ming typefaces came from the style used in the Kangxi Dictionary. In mainland China, the modern standardized character forms are specified in the List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese. Some characters in the list differ from the Kangxi forms solely because they are Simplified while others differ because they use a different variant or orthography. In Taiwan, the Standard Form of National Characters specifies the modern standardized forms. Unlike the mainland standard, the Taiwan standard uses mostly preexisting character forms but reference back to the style of regular script and reform Ming typefaces based on regular script style extensively, which had attracted criticism from many peoples. After the postwar kanji reforms in Japan, most of the Kangxi style characters were called (old style), while the reformed characters were called , causing newer dictionaries to either incorporate both styles or omit the Kangxi styles. In Korea, most typefaces use the Kangxi forms. There are differences between print and script forms of many Chinese characters, just as there are differences between copperplate and most people's handwriting. Some of these differences are persistent and specific to a style, but others may be no more significant than variations between individual typefaces. None of these variations usually hinder reading.

Motoki then created, based on Gamble's frequency studies of characters in the Chinese Bible, a full set of type with added Japanese characters; in addition to Chinese and Latin characters, Japanese text uses the syllabaries hiragana and katakana. = Korea = In Korean, a similar category of typefaces for the Korean alphabet hangul was called myeongjo (the Korean reading for the same Chinese characters ‚Äú‚Äù) until recently, influenced by the Japanese term.

It is about long. The North Branch Meduxnekeag River rises from the outlet of a small pond () in Maine and runs to its confluence with the Meduxnekeag in Wakefield, New Brunswick. The South Branch Meduxnekeag River rises from the outflow of Johnson Pond () in Linneus, and runs to its confluence with the Meduxnekeag River two miles upstream from Houlton, Maine. The Meduxnekeag joins the Saint John in Woodstock, New Brunswick. The earliest mention of the name is in the narrative of John Gyles. He states that in 1689 he visited a branch of the St. John river about ten miles to a branch called Medeockseenecasis. The suffix \\"asis\\" is a diminutive so it is possible that the name is a form of Little Meductic. The current spelling was first seen in 1840. In New Brunswick, the watershed of the Meduxnekeag is home to the richest, most diverse, and highest concentration of remnant sites of mature Appalachian Hardwood Forest in Atlantic Canada, containing many understorey plants rare or uncommon in the province. These include black raspberry, wild ginger, maidenhair fern, showy orchis, wild coffee, and numerous others. The non-profit Meduxnekeag River Association Inc., based in Woodstock, has purchased, since 1998, approximately 2.25 square kilometres (500 acres) of forest, with more than of undeveloped shoreline. This Meduxnekeag Valley Nature Preserve has more than of well- marked, low impact walking trails. Animals commonly found in the watershed include the moose, white-tailed deer, black bear, eastern coyote, red fox, raccoon, beaver, eastern chipmunk, striped skunk, red squirrel, snowshoe hare, mink, weasels, porcupine, and various mice, voles, and shrews. Significant sections of the Meduxnekeag are easy to canoe or kayak in high or medium water conditions (generally in May and June, and in September and October; also in July/August in wet summers). Annual canoe races are held in both Maine and New Brunswick in May. Recreational canoeists traditionally put in just below the bridge on the North Branch (just above the confluence) and take out in downtown Woodstock, a half-day canoe depending on lingering time, passing through scenic, mostly forested country. The final 2 km before Woodstock is through an extensive wetland. The intervales and islands of the Meduxnekeag are locally celebrated for the edible fiddlehead ostrich fern, harvested in May.

Created by writers Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, and Gerry Conway and artist Gray Morrow, the character first appeared in Savage Tales #1 (May 1971), and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including Adventure into Fear, which introduced the character Howard the Duck. Steve Gerber's 39-issue run on the seriesGerber's run is continuous from Fear #11-19, and Man-Thing #1-22, as well as the concurrent Giant-Size Man-Thing #1-5, and Monsters Unleashed #8-9, and these were followed quickly by a story in The Rampaging Hulk #7 for a total of 39 issues. In addition, Gerber also wrote the Man-Thing as a guest- starring character into Marvel Two-in-One #1, Daredevil #113-114 and Iron Man Annual #3. is considered to be a cult classic. The Man-Thing is a large, slow- moving, empathic, humanoid swamp monster living in the Florida Everglades near a Seminole reservation and the fictitious town of Citrusville in Cypress County, Florida. Conan Stevens portrayed the character in the 2005 film Man- Thing. Publication history As described in the text featurette \\"The Story Behind the Scenes\\" in Savage Tales #1 (cover-dated May 1971), the black-and- white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, the Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and writer Roy Thomas, and that together they created five possible origins. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel's early science-fiction/fantasy anthology Tales of Suspense #7 (Jan. 1960) and #81 (Sept. 1966),Tales of Suspense #7 (Jan. 1960): \\"I Fought the Molten Man-Thing!\\", writer unknown, at the Grand Comics Database as well as the concept of the man losing sentience. As Thomas recalled in 2002: Thomas worked out a detailed plotThe three-page, single- spaced plot for the 11-page story is reprinted in Alter Ego #81 (October 2008), pp. 22‚Äì23 and gave it to Gerry Conway to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with Gray Morrow as artist. A second story, written by Len Wein and drawn by Neal Adams, was prepared at that time, but, upon Savage Tales' cancellation after that single issue,The magazine was later revived, beginning with issue #2 (Oct. 1973) \\"took a year or two to see print\\", according to Thomas.Thomas interview, p. 21 That occurred in Astonishing Tales #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature \\"Ka-Zar\\", starring Marvel's jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to the Man-Thing's introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar's antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first penciled by John Buscema and the second by Buscema and Rich Buckler). The Wein-written Man- Thing story appeared in between Wein's firstThe character Alexander \\"Alex\\" Olsen, introduced in DC's House of Secrets #92 (July 1971) and secondThe character Alexander \\"Alec\\" Holland, introduced in DC's Swamp Thing #1 (Nov. 1972) version of his DC Comics character the Swamp Thing. Wein was Conway's roommate at the time and as Thomas recalled in 2008, The Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by Howard Chaykin), in Adventure into Fear #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthology title with reprinted 1950s horror/fantasy stories. Steve Gerber, who would become the Man-Thing's signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by Jim Starlin), became 16 pages two issues later and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel superhero comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In Fear #11 (Dec. 1972), p. 11, Gerber created the series' narrative tagline, used in captions: \\"Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!\\" The Man-Thing #1 (Jan. 1974). Cover art by Frank Brunner. After issue #19 (Dec.1973), the Man-Thing received a solo title The Man-Thing, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974 ‚Äì Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series' primary pencillers were, successively, Val Mayerik, Mike Ploog, John Buscema, and Jim Mooney. A sister publication was the larger, quarterly Giant-Size Man-Thing #1-5 (August 1974 ‚Äì August 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s science fiction/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a two-part Howard the Duck co-feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional double entendre in this sister series' title has become a recurring joke among comics readers.As Thomas, for one, recalled: \\"Giant-Size Man-Thing later had a decidedly funny ring to it, but not Man-Thing in itself\\". (Thomas interview, p. 21) In the final issue (#22), writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing's adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series Marvel Comics Presents #1-12 (Sept. 1988 ‚Äì Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in The Evolutionary War, coming to the aid of Spider-Man.Web of Spider-Man Annual #4. Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that Kevin Nowlan spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published. A second Man-Thing series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979 ‚Äì Jan. 1981). Writer Michael Fleisher and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher's work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer Chris Claremont and illustrators Don Perlin (breakdowns) and Bob Wiacek (finished pencils). Claremont's stories introduced the Man-Thing and Jennifer Kale to Doctor Strange (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville's new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents' yacht is attacked. These characters' stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own War Is Hell series.Man-Thing (vol. 2) #10-11, guest starring John Kowalski. Black and white Man-Thing stories, and some color covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine Monsters Unleashed as well. Simon Jowett provided a Man-Thing story in Marvel Comics Presents #164‚Äì168 (Early Oct.‚ÄìLate Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis' transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard personal computer with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the floating timeline effect. J.M. DeMatteis began writing the character in a backup story in Man-Thing (vol. 2) #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie. DeMatteis would go on to write Man- Thing stories in Marvel Team-Up, The Defenders, Marvel Fanfare, and the miniseries Daydreamers, as well as Man-Thing (vol. 3) #1-8 (Dec. 1997 ‚Äì July 1998), illustrated by Liam Sharp. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in Strange Tales (vol. 4) #1-2 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99, also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.Ellen Brandt at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel UniverseK'Ad-Mon of the Fallen Stars at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel UniverseCleito at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe In the 2000s, the Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in one-shots and miniseries, including Marvel Knights Double Shot #2 (July 2002) by Ted McKeever, and Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing #1 (May 2007) by Charlie Huston and Klaus Janson. In 2008, writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa retold Man- Thing's origin in Dead of Night featuring the Man-Thing #1-4 (April‚ÄìJuly 2008), from the Marvel MAX imprint.Aguirre-Sacasa talks \\"Dead of Night featuring Man-Thing\\", Comic Book Resources, February 13, 2008 This was followed by an eight-page story in Marvel Comics Presents (vol. 2) #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck. The Man-Thing appeared regularly during The Punisher's Franken-Castle story arc and became a regular member of Thunderbolts with issue #144. The series was retitled Dark Avengers with #175, and the Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber's posthumous Man-Thing story \\"The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man\\", with art by Kevin Nowlan, originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist, was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled The Infernal Man- Thing (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012).Infernal Man-Thing at the Grand Comics Database The story was a sequel to Gerber's \\"Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man\\" in Man- Thing #12 (Dec. 1974). Author R.L. Stine made his comics debut with a five- issue Man-Thing miniseries in 2017.

Web of Spider-Man (vol. 2) #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside Dr. Curtis Connors shortly after Connors' arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the Lizard. Though warned that the technological terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, Ellen Brandt (referred to here as \\"Miss Brandt\\", but later retconned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed by two thugs and learns that Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where scientific and, as Man-Thing #1 later explained, magical forces combine to instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes.They were yellow in Fear #10-13, but red in the Astonishing Tales issues, and all subsequent issues from Fear #14 onward. Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid that he now secretes in the presence of negative emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.Savage Tales #1 (May 1971) / Astonishing Tales #12 (June 1972); Wein/Adams segment. Marvel Comics. Sallis' mind was apparently extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in Doctor Strange (vol. 2) #41 (June 1980), The Defenders (vol 1) #98 (August 1981), and Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual '99, and even to his human form, as in Adventure into Fear #13 (April 1973), Marvel Two-in-One #1 (January 1974), Marvel Comics Presents #164 (October 1994), and Man-Thing (vol. 3) #5 and 7-8 (April 1998, June‚ÄìJuly 1998). Under writer Steve Gerber, the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress Jennifer Kale, with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in Fear #11-13 ‚Äì the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in Fear #19, he meets Howard the Duck, who becomes stranded in this reality. The Man-Thing became the guardian of the Nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts and time- traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes and common criminals. He formed a bond with young radio DJ Richard Rory and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12's \\"Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man\\", about an crazed writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber's posthumously published 2012 sequel, \\"The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man\\", in the three-issue miniseries The Infernal Man-Thing. In Man-Thing (vol. 2) #1-11 (November 1979 ‚Äì July 1981), writer Chris Claremont introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily became the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters' deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the War Is Hell series lead, John Kowalski, now an aspect of Marvel Comics' manifestation of Death. In Man-Thing (vol. 3) #1-8 (December 1997 ‚Äì July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area and encounters a little boy, Job Burke, who is actually the Sallises' son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in Strange Tales (vol. 4) #1-2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis' unillustrated scripts appear on the K'Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages in Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe.

Powers and abilities The Man-Thing is a former scientist who was transformed into a creature composed of vegetable matter through the synergistic interaction of mystical energy and swamp mutagens. Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various crime and horror scenarios. In the pages of The Thunderbolts, Dr. Henry Pym has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with. For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address).As demonstrated in such issues as Fear #10, Man-Thing (vol. 2) #9, and Heroes Reborn: The Return #1. Marvel Comics. He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell,Fear #10. Marvel Comics. how to put an arm in a sling,Fear #12. Marvel Comics. and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch.Astonishing Tales #13. Marvel Comics. The change in the Man-Thing's intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human's; for instance, the Man-Thing's auditory receptors are in his forehead.Fear #17. Marvel Comics. Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person's motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.Fear #12; Man-Thing #1, etc. Marvel Comics. The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers, described below, that are derived from the combined interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of Realities. It is able to sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a powerful corrosive; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series' tagline: \\"Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing's touch!\\" Though fear is understandably most people's response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands. Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt,Savage Tales #1, Monsters Unleashed #5, Man-Thing (vol. 3) #1-8. Marvel Comics. Kurt \\"Nightcrawler\\" WagnerNightcrawler (vol. 3) #10. Marvel Comics. (whom he does not even scar),Nightcrawler (vol. 3) #12. Marvel Comics. and Mongu, whose hand he permanently attaches to his axe,Fear #14. Marvel Comics. either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the \\"brain\\" cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions like anger, hatred and fear, cause the Man- Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand this potent acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces a type of foamy, soapy mucus that neutralizes the acid. Although the Man-Thing's superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, and immortality, give the monster his powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America, but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe-to-toe with much stronger villains. He is able to lift a 2,000 pound automobile when sufficiently moved to do so.Man- Thing #1. Marvel Comics. The Man-Thing's body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing's body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. The Devil-Slayer once sliced him nearly in half,Man-Thing (vol. 3) #4. Marvel Comics. and he has survived being incinerated by a Celestial,Heroes Reborn: The Return #1 / Marvel Team-Up (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics. although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.Marvel Team-Up (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics. Due to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing is able to ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass through. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This abilityFirst demonstrated in Astonishing Tales #13. Marvel Comics. can be defeated mystically. The Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plantMan-Thing #17 (May 1975). Marvel Comics. greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off of his own waste products.Man-Thing #19. Marvel Comics. He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance.

Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, Owen Reece, Ben Grimm, Thog the Nether-Spawn, Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told or written to about it. His identity as the Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that. In-universe, knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.Shadows & Light #2; Man-Thing (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics.

Comic book character spin- offs Dr. Barbara \\"Bobbi\\" Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in Astonishing Tales #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero Mockingbird in Marvel Team-Up #95 and went on to become a prominent member of Avengers West Coast, eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, Clint \\"Hawkeye\\" Barton, from Mephisto.Avengers West Coast #100Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his version of Hell;Thunderbolts Annual '00; Hellcat #1-3 (2000, miniseries). Marvel Comics. however, she has appeared alive during the Secret Invasion crossover event. At the end of Secret Invasion, Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls. Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye. Jennifer Kale debuted in Adventure into Fear #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, The Legion of Night, created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh's Witches in which she teamed with Satana the Devil's Daughter and Topaz under the tutelage of Doctor Strange. Gerber introduced Howard the Duck in a Man-Thing story in Adventure into Fear #19. Howard, who was displaced from Duckworld, an alternate Earth of anthropomorphic ducks in another dimension, via the swamp's Nexus of Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues. The Foolkiller, a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone that he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying disc jockey Richard Rory, introduced in the previous issue. When Rory was serving time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in Man-Thing (vol. 1) #2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber's Omega the Unknown, while David Anthony Kraft made Rory a potential love interest for the She-Hulk. A third version of the character, who was in Internet communication with the second, starred in Gerber's 1990 Foolkiller miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.

D'Spayre, working for the Dweller-in-Darkness, is burned by the Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D'Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with the Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from the Man-Thing, destroys the M'Kraan Crystal, and in doing so, ends the universe.

The first light truck ever sold by Pontiac, the Trans Sport (a pun on transport) was sold across two generations from the 1990 to 1999 model years. The Trans Sport was slotted between the Chevrolet Lumina APV (replaced by the Chevrolet Venture) and the Oldsmobile Silhouette. The first Pontiac since the T1000 to have no direct predecessor, the Trans Sport took on the role of the 6000 Safari station wagon (in line with the Lumina APV replacing the Celebrity wagon). Introduced a year before the second-generation Chrysler minivans, the Pontiac Trans Sport and its counterparts marked an industry shift in the minivan segment towards adopting the form factor used by Chrysler. Though the APV minivans used a model- specific chassis, the vehicles used a front-wheel drive, transverse-engine configuration, sharing mechanical commonality with sedans. During its production, the Trans Sport was assembled by GM at North Tarrytown Assembly (Tarrytown/Sleepy Hollow, New York), shifting production to Doraville Assembly (Doraville, Georgia) for its second generation. For the 1998 model year, Pontiac renamed the Trans Sport the Pontiac Montana, deriving the name from an exterior trim package introduced for 1997; the Montana was sold in two generations through 2009 (2006 in the United States). Background The Trans Sport and its siblings were created by General Motors in order to compete with the then-dominant Chrysler minivans. The larger Chevrolet Astro and corporate cousin GMC Safari were based on a body-on-frame, rear wheel drive truck platform, and thus did not appeal to the same market segment as Chrysler's vans. Concept 1986 Trans Sport concept A Trans Sport concept was first presented in 1986, and included futuristic styling and features such as gullwing doors, a built-in Nintendo Entertainment System, and a glass roof. This concept was well-received, and a production Trans Sport was greenlit in 1987. Most of the concept's standout features were not translated to the production Trans Sport, with the gullwing doors being deemed too expensive to produce, and the glass roof being traded for gloss black paneling due to weight and cost issues. Two other GM marques, Chevrolet and Oldsmobile, were also given vehicles based on the same platform as the Trans Sport, the Lumina APV and Silhouette respectively. In accordance with those brands' images, the Trans Sport was targeted at sport- and style-oriented buyers, while the Lumina and Silhouette targeted the value and premium markets respectively. Technology 1995 Trans Sport dashboard The Trans Sport, along with the Lumina APV and Silhouette, rode on the U-body platform and was constructed from a galvanized steel space frame, featuring dent and rust resistant polymer plastic body panels on the side and a galvanized steel roof. Similar construction was employed on the Pontiac Fiero, as well as some GM Saturn vehicles. The Trans Sport had three seating options. The base trim featured a five-seat configuration, with three removable bucket seats in the second row (in contrast to the bench seats more commonly found in five-passenger vehicles). A seven-seat configuration, adding two removable bucket seats in a third row, was also offered. The Trans Sport in SE and GT trims offered a six- seat configuration, with two buckets per row. Air suspension was offered as an option. The 1994 Trans Sport featured the first powered sliding side door in a production vehicle; this was initially intended to debut in 1993, but was pushed back due to technological difficulties. The Trans Sport also added a driver's-side airbag in 1994. For model years 1994 and 1995, traction control was optional with the 3800 engine, and became standard in 1996 with the 3.4-liter V6. Reception Side view of the Trans Sport; \\"dustbuster\\" styling visible A focal point of the U-body minivans at the time of their release was their styling. The Chrysler minivans with which they competed had more traditional, conservative styling cues, and GM felt that there existed an untapped market for a sport-styled van. This styling was received negatively by automotive critics, and the vans came to be called \\"dustbusters\\" colloquially, after the handheld vacuum cleaner of the same name. Moreover, the unusually long and harshly sloped windshield, and resultant long distance to the windshield's base from the driver's position, made the vehicles disconcerting to drive for someone without prior experience. Thanks to these criticisms, as well as mediocre sales and mockery in Chrysler advertisements, the Trans Sport and Lumina APV were facelifted in 1994. The nose was shortened by 3 inches, some cladding was removed, and the interior dashboard received a ridge to lessen the perceived distance to the windshield's base. The European market did not receive this facelift, as the vans' initial styling had not been negatively received there. For model years 1994 and after, the European Trans Sport became an Oldsmobile Silhouette (which had not been facelifted in the U.S. market) with Pontiac badging. At launch, the Trans Sport's 3.1-liter V6 was received as underpowered for the relatively large vehicle. This was rectified in the 1992 model year, with a 3.8-litre V6 offering improved torque and acceleration becoming optional. In 1995, a 1.9-liter turbodiesel by PSA became an option in the European market. First generation (1990-1996) =1990= *All new model. *Available as Trans Sport (with silver cladding) and Trans Sport SE (monochromatic), both offered the 120-hp 3.1L V6 and three- speed automatic. *Launched in Europe with minor differences in exterior trim required for regulatory concerns as well as engine and transmissions appropriate for Europe's differing fuel cost and vehicle taxation structure. In some European countries sold through Opel dealers. =1991= *Customer complaints regarding glare reflected on the interior of the windshield from the massive expanse of the dashboard led to the addition of black carpeting in lieu of the more reflective plastic used in the previous year. *Power windows and door locks made standard on American models. *A manual sunroof was newly available. =1992= *Base model was discontinued and a sporty GT model was added. *Newly available for 1992 was GM's 3800 V6 engine coupled with a Hydra- Matic 4T60 4-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission. It was standard on the GT, optional for SE. *With the departure of the base model, silver cladding was no longer available. *Leather seating became available as an option on the GT model. Previously, leather seating was an Oldsmobile Silhouette exclusive within the U-body minivans. *The cowl-mounted fixed radio antenna mast was eliminated, and an integrated roof antenna was installed, sandwiched between the roof and the headliner. *Side view mirrors were changed to the folding type and were enlarged to provide better rear-ward visibility. *Brakes were enlarged and anti-lock brakes (ABS) was added as standard equipment. *Steering wheel-mounted controls for the stereo system were added as an option on SE and standard on GT. =1993= *Due to very slow sales in 1992, the Trans Sport GT was dropped after one year. Trans Sport SE continues; it would be the only trim level available from 1993 to 1996. The SE model could be outfitted with any of the GT's options. *The text badges were changed from black to the van's colours. *A remote controlled power sliding side door was announced for 1993, but failed to actually make it into production that year due to quality control problems. *A new color scheme with gold cladding, gold wheels and a body-colored roof behind the C-pillar was available as an extra-cost option with certain exterior colors. *A redesigned center console was added this year with revamped, larger climate controls, a large storage cubby and a large storage bin at its base. =1994= 1995 Pontiac Trans Sport SE *The exterior styling was revamped, three inches (76 mm) were trimmed off the nose. Headlights taken from the Pontiac Bonneville were installed with Bumper-mounted fog lamps added as standard equipment and cladding was made less flamboyant and stylized. *In an effort to lessen the perceived distance to the base of the windshield, a ridge was added to the interior dash finishing panel. *The power sliding door became available as an option, after being introduced in 1993. *Built-in child seats for the second row became available as an option. *A traction control system became available as an option with the 3.8L V6. *Rear deep-tinted windows now featured a darker tint than previously used. *A driver's side airbag became standard equipment. =1995= *Automatic power door locks that engaged/disengaged with the transmission shifting into or out of \\"park\\" added as a standard feature of the power door lock option package. *Rear portion of the roof, behind the C-pillar previously painted black as standard with body color as a no-cost option, would be only available painted body color as a further effort to \\"normalize\\" the vehicles' looks as compared to competitors. =1996= *Both 3.1 and 3.8 L V6 engines dropped, a 3.4 L V6 3400 engine became the only power plant available. *There were few other changes, due to a completely redesigned 1997 model, to debut in summer 1996. =European Market= Pontiac Trans Sport (Europe). For the European market, the Oldsmobile Silhouette was sold as the Pontiac Trans Sport by replacing the Oldsmobile badging with Pontiac badging, along with Pontiac wheels. Sales in Europe were good for an American import, but did not represent enough volume to make a fourth, distinct model economically feasible. The Pontiac Trans Sport of Europe was discontinued in 1997. Its successors were both the Chevrolet Trans Sport (Second gen Pontiac Trans Sport rebadged as a Chevrolet) (LWB), and the Opel Sintra (SWB). In the United Kingdom, it was sold as the Vauxhall Sintra. Second generation (1997-1999) =1997‚Äì1999= In the 1997 model year, the Trans Sport and its siblings got their first major redesign, ditching the one-of-a-kind construction and look to create a more conservative, conventional minivan. Gone were spaceframes, plastic body panels, and sleek styling. The new minivans were of unibody steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional to such an extent that contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market. During the development of this generation of the U-body minivan, General Motors extensively benchmarked the then current Chrysler minivans. The resultant vehicles more closely resembled the immensely successful trio; However, Chrysler would launch a completely redesigned minivan line a year before GM. The last model year for the Trans Sport was 1998 in the U.S. and 1999 in Canada. The Doraville, Georgia assembly plant that produced the Trans Sport closed on September 26, 2008. =Safety criticism= The 1997 Trans Sport crash-tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS A crash test video of the 1997-2004 Trans Sport/Montana resulted in criticism because of extreme damage to the vehicle in the crash test. The minivan received a \\"Poor\\" rating by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), and some comments made by the IIHS were * Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver. * Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy's head backward. * The unnatural position of the dummy's left foot indicates that an occupant's left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity. * The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy's metal foot broke off at the ankle. =European market= This version of the Pontiac Trans Sport was also sold in Europe as a Chevrolet, alongside the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra; however, unlike the Sintra, which was based on the Pontiac Trans Sport, Pontiac Montana, Chevrolet Venture, Oldsmobile Silhouette and the previous generation Buick GL8, but wore the European Opel or British Vauxhall badges and trim, the Chevrolet Trans Sport (as it was known) was trimmed and badged exactly like the Pontiac Trans Sport, the only differences being where Chevrolet badges were used in place of the Pontiac badges. In all cases, the European-market vans used different front, side and rear lighting equipment, different seat belts and sundry other safety items, to comply with ECE regulations which differ from US safety standards. These models were discontinued between 2003 and 2005, depending on the market. Despite limited sales in most of Europe, the vehicle was particularly successful in Sweden - where it was the best selling minivan for a while. While production ended in 2005, European stock lasted until 2007. Chevy trans sport europe.jpgChevrolet Trans Sport (Europe). =1997‚Äì2005= For the 1997 and 1998 model year (1999 in Canada), along with the roll out of this new generation of minivans, the Pontiac (Trans Sport) Montana was debuted, which had special cladding and wheels intended to give it a more rugged SUV-like appearance. In the 1999 model year (2000 in Canada), the name \\"Trans Sport\\" was dropped due to the popularity of the \\"Montana\\" appearance package. By the time the \\"Trans Sport\\" moniker was dropped, the \\"Montana\\" package accounted for over 80% of total Trans Sport sales. This also had to do with the fact that Montana become popular as an advertising name for several products in general around this time. Pontiac-Trans-Sport.jpgPontiac Trans Sport Montana.

(The others were the 32nd and the 41st in the Pacific on New Guinea, Carlson's Raiders on Makin Island, the 1st Marine, and the Americal on Guadalcanal, and, alongside the 9th in North Africa, were the 1st Infantry, 3rd Infantry and the 2nd Armored Divisions.) The 9th saw its first combat on 8 November 1942, when its elements landed at Algiers, Safi, and Port Lyautey, with the taking of Safi by the 3rd Battalion of the 47th Infantry Regiment standing as the first liberation of a city from Axis control in World War II. With the collapse of French resistance on 11 November 1942, the division patrolled the Spanish Moroccan border. The 9th returned to Tunisia in February and engaged in small defensive actions and patrol activity. On 28 March 1943 it launched an attack in southern Tunisia and fought its way north into Bizerte, 7 May. In August, the 9th landed at Palermo, Sicily, and took part in the capture of Randazzo and Messina. After being sent to England for further training, the division landed on Utah Beach on 10 June 1944 (D plus 4), cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, drove on to Cherbourg and penetrated the port's heavy defenses.

After a brief rest in July, the division took part in the St. Lo break- through and in August helped close the Falaise Gap. Turning east, the 9th crossed the Marne, 28 August, swept through Saarlautern, and in November and December held defensive positions from Monschau to Losheim. Moving north to Bergrath, Germany, it launched an attack toward the Roer, 10 December, taking Echtz and Schlich. From mid-December through January 1945, the division held defensive positions from Kalterherberg to Elsenborn. On 30 January the division jumped off from Monschau in a drive across the Roer and to the Rhine, crossing at Remagen, 7 March. After breaking out of the Remagen bridgehead, the 9th assisted in the sealing and clearing of the Ruhr Pocket, then moved 150 miles (240 km) east to Nordhausen (where it assisted in the liberation of the local concentration camp) and attacked in the Harz Mountains, 14‚Äì20 April. On 21 April the Division relieved the 3d Armored Division along the Mulde River, near Dessau, and held that line until VE-day. = Assignments in Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) = *previous: II Corps *May 1943: I Armored Corps = Assignments in European Theater of Operations (ETO) = *20 November 1943: First Army *25 November 1943: VII Corps *1 August 1944: VII Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group *26 October 1944: V Corps *6 December 1944: VII Corps *18 December 1944: V Corps *20 December 1944: Attached, with the entire First Army, to the British 21st Army Group *18 January 1945: V Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group *17 February 1945: III Corps *31 March 1945: VII Corps *4 April 1945: III Corps *14 April 1945: VII Corps = Order of battle = * Headquarters, 9th Infantry Division *39th Infantry Regiment *47th Infantry Regiment *60th Infantry Regiment * Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 9th Infantry Division Artillery **26th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **34th Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) **60th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **84th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) * 15th Engineer Combat Battalion * 9th Medical Battalion * 9th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized) * Headquarters, Special Troops, 9th Infantry Division ** Headquarters Company, 9th Infantry Division ** 709th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company ** 9th Quartermaster Company ** 9th Signal Company ** Military Police Platoon ** Band * 9th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment  Statistics  = Chronology = *Activated 1 August 1940 *Arrived UK 27 November 1943 *Arrived Continent (D+4) 10 June 1944 *Entered Combat 14 June 1944 [First elements in combat in North Africa 8 November 1942; entire division entered combat NATOUSA 26 March 1943] *Days in Combat 264 = Casualties = *Total battle casualties: 23,277Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths in World War II, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 3,856 *Wounded in action: 17,416 *Missing in action: 357 *Prisoner of war: 1,648 = Campaigns = * Algeria-French Morocco (Arrowhead device) * Tunisia * Sicily * Normandy * Northern France * Rhineland * Ardennes-Alsace * Central Europe = Individual awards = Medal of Honor: 4 #Distinguished Service Cross: 86 #Legion of Merit: 6 #Silver Star: 1,789 #Soldier's Medal: 55 #Bronze Star: 5,518 #Distinguished Flying Cross: 1 #Air Medal: 124 = Prisoners of war taken = *Total: 130,000  Post World War II  The 9th Infantry Division was reactivated on 15 July 1947 at Fort Dix, New Jersey and assumed a peacetime readiness and training role.

On deployment the division was assigned to the III Corps Tactical Zone of Vietnam where it commenced operations in Dinh Tuong and Long An Provinces (6 January-31 May 1967) in Operation Palm Beach. Its area of operations was in the rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta from 1967 to 1972. Operating deep within the Viet Cong (VC)‚Äìcontrolled Delta, the Division was charged with protecting the area and its population against VC insurgents and ensuring the success of the South Vietnamese government's pacification program. Faced with unrelenting physical hardships, a tenacious enemy and the region's rugged terrain, the Division established strategies and quantifiable goals for completing their mission.Hunt Jr, Ira \\"The 9th Infantry Division In Vietnam\\" 2010.

Other experimental units were the 1st and 2nd Airboat Platoons, which operated Hurricane Aircat airboats. M·ªπ Tho, Vietnam. A Viet Cong base camp being burned down. From 1967 on, one of the division's brigades (the 2d Brigade) was the Army contingent of the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF). This brigade lived on the ships of Navy Task Force 117, and were transported on their infantry missions throughout the Mekong Delta on Tango boats (converted World War II landing craft) supported by various other armored boats. The MRF was often anchored near the South Vietnamese city of M·ªπ Tho, or near the Division's ƒê·ªìng T√¢m Base Camp and they conducted operations in coordination with the Navy SEAL teams, the South Vietnamese Marines, units of the ARVN 7th Division and River Assault Groups. Following the Tet offensive in 1968, General Westmoreland stated that the Division and the MRF saved the Delta region from falling to the People's Army of Vietnam forces. In 1969, the division also operated throughout IV Corps. Chuck Hagel, former Secretary of Defense, served in the 9th ID from 1967 to 1968. Holding the rank of Sergeant (E-5), he served as an infantry squad leader.Experiencing War, Stories from the Veterans History Project, Charles Timothy Hagel, Library of Congress, accessed 12 December 2012. Hagel served in the same infantry squad as his younger brother Tom, and they are believed to be the only American siblings to do so during the Vietnam War.\\"The private war of Chuck and Tom Hagel\\" by Myra MacPherson, Salon, 30 April 2007. In the 1994 film Forrest Gump, the eponymous main character was a member of the 9th Infantry Division in Vietnam, notably: 4th Platoon, Company A, 2nd Battalion, 47th Infantry. The Division's major units departed South Vietnam on 27 August 1969 (HHC & 1st Brigade) to Hawaii; 27 August 1969 (2nd Brigade) to Fort Lewis, Washington; 12 October 1970 (3rd Brigade) to Fort Lewis.  Post Vietnam  = 9th Infantry Division = Following the Vietnam War the division was stationed at Fort Lewis in Washington. The formal actication ceremony was held on 26 May 1972. Initially the division was organized under the army's Reorganization Objective Army Division system. Parts of the division between 1972 - 1983 were organized as follows: ** 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Attack) (activated 18 December 1980) *** 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry *** 9th Aviation Battalion (activated 21 April 1972) *** 268th Attack Helicopter Battalion (activated 1 September 1981) *** Company A, 214th Aviation Battalion (activated 1 July 1981) ** Division Artillery (activated 21 June 1972) *** 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery (activated 21 October 1972) *** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (activated 21 July 1972) *** 3rd Battalion, 34th Field Artillery (activated 21 October 1972) *** 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery (activated 21 October 1972) *** Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery (activated 21 November 1977) ** Division Support Command *** Division Material Management Center *** 9th Medical Battalion *** 9th Supply & Transportation Battalion *** 709th Maintenance Battalion *** 9th Adjutant General Company *** 9th Finance Company *** 9th Division Band *** 100th Ordnance Detachment ** 1st Battalion, 67th Air Defense Artillery (activated 13 September 1972 - 1 April 1979) ** 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery (activated 1 April 1979) ** 9th Signal Battalion (activated 21 June 1972) ** 15th Engineer Battalion (activated 21 June 1972) ** 109th Military Intelligence Battalion (activated 1 October 1981) *** Company A (former 335th Army Security Agency Company (activated 21 December 1977 - reorganized 1 October 1981) *** Company B (former 9th Military Intelligence Company (activated 21 December 1972 - reorganized 1 October 1981) ** 9th Chemical Company (activated 1 September 1981) ** 9th Military Police Company = 9th Infantry Division (Motorized) = U.S. Navy SEALs operate Desert Patrol Vehicles (DPV), the successor to the Fast Attack Vehicle pioneered by the 9th ID (Motorized). From 1983 the division served as the High-Technology Test-Bed (HTTB) for the army. This led to the division to develop the concept of \\"motorized infantry\\" from 1983 onward. The motorized infantry division was to be equipped with enhanced technology to give it deployability and fire power and fill the gap between light and heavy divisions. The idea was to create a lighter version of the armored and mechanized divisions, which could be deployed easily by aircraft, while providing more firepower than a light infantry division. Initially the vision was to create three motorized brigades with three new types of infantry battalion: * Light Attack Battalion * Combined Arms Battalion Light * Combined Arms Battalion Heavy The light attack battalions utilized the Fast Attack Vehicles (FAV - later re-designated the Desert Patrol Vehicle). Essentially a Volkswagen-engined dune buggy mounted with either a 40mm Mk 19 grenade launcher or .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun. The FAV was designed to provide highly mobile firepower that could attack the flanks of heavier mechanized units. Some variants also mounted TOW missiles. All of these weapons systems were attached to the FAV by a mount designed to break away if the vehicle rolled over, which they were prone to do. The FAVs were problematic at best and were eventually replaced by various versions of the Humvee/HMMWV light truck. The combined arms battalions were organized as a mix of assault gun companies and light motorized infantry companies, with the heavy battalions fielding two assault gun companies and one light motorized infantry company, while the ratio was reversed in the light battalions. The assault gun companies were to be equipped with the Armored Gun System (AGS), but because of delays in the AGS program they were initially equipped with M551 Sheridan light tanks and later with Humvees with TOW missiles or Mk 19 grenade launchers. Light motorized infantry companies were equipped with Humvees mounting a Mk 19 grenade launcher. Each combined arms battalion also fielded a combat support company equipped with mortars, scouts, and an anti-armor platoon slated to be equipped with Humvees mounting a ground version of the Hellfire missile. As this Hellfire version never entered service, the platoons were later also equipped with Humvees with TOW missiles. The division's first and third brigade were to field one of each of the three new battalions, while the second brigade would field three combined arms battalions heavy. The third brigade was to field one light and one heavy combined arms battalion and the 9th Cavalry Brigade two attack helicopter battalions, one combat support aviation battalion, and one cavalry reconnaissance squadron. The division artillery would consist of three battalions equipped with M198 155mm towed howitzers, one light artillery rocket battalion with M102 105mm towed howitzers and M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and one target acquisition battery. The division support command would field three forward support, one cavalry support and one main support battalion. However, because of the delay of the Armored Gun System the division did only activate four of the envisioned five combined arms battalions heavy and retained the 2nd Battalion, 77th Armor instead. Parts of the division were organized at the end of the 1980s as follows: ** 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Attack) *** 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry *** 9th Aviation Battalion *** 268th Attack Helicopter Battalion *** Company A, 214th Aviation Battalion ** Division Artillery *** 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery *** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery *** 3rd Battalion, 34th Field Artillery *** 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery *** Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery ** Division Support Command *** 1st Support Battalion (Forward) *** 2nd Support Battalion (Forward) *** 3rd Support Battalion (Forward) *** 4th Support Battalion (Aviation) *** 5th Support Battalion (Main) ** 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery ** 9th Signal Battalion ** 15th Engineer Battalion ** 109th Military Intelligence Battalion ** 9th Chemical Company ** 9th Military Police Company ** 9th Division Band In case of war with the Warsaw Pact the division's would have reinforced the Allied Forces Baltic Approaches Command defending Denmark. By 1984 the 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Attack) was testing motorcycles for reconnaissance work in its reconnaissance squadron, the 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry Regiment.Marr and Kingsley, New Roles for Combat Motorcycles, Armor Magazine, September‚ÄìOctober 1984, 33-36. And the 9th Infantry Division (MTZ) tested motorized infantry doctrine at the Yakima Firing Center in Eastern Washington, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin California and in Korea during the annual Team Spirit exercise. While the motorized units performed well they were vulnerable to heavier mechanized forces, particularly if forced to stand and fight. They were also extremely vulnerable to indirect (artillery) fires. On 1 April 1984, Echo Company of the 15th Engineer Battalion reorganized to form the 73rd Engineer Company (Assault Ribbon Bridge), which was assigned to I Corps, which in turn attached it as separate company to the 15th Engineer Battalion. With the switch from Combat Arms Regimental System to the United States Army Regimental System the division saw a few of its units reflagged or inactivated: * 15 September 1986: Company A, 214th Aviation Battalion inactivated * 2 October 1986: 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery to 3rd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery * 2 October 1986: 3rd Battalion, 34th Field Artillery to 6th Battalion, 11th Field Artillery * 16 March 1987: 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry to 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry * 16 April 1987: 2nd Battalion, 77th Armor to 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor * 1987: 9th Aviation Battalion to 1st Battalion, 9th Aviation * 1987: 268th Attack Helicopter Battalion to 2nd Battalion, 9th Aviation * 16 March 1988: 1st Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery to 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery * unknown date: ** 1st Support Battalion (Forward) to 99th Support Battalion ** 2nd Support Battalion (Forward) to 109th Support Battalion ** 3rd Support Battalion (Forward) to 209th Support Battalion ** 4th Support Battalion (Aviation) to 3rd Battalion, 9th Aviation ** 5th Support Battalion (Main) to 709th Support Battalion (Main) During fiscal year 1987 the army decided to inactivate the division's 2nd brigade, which would be replaced by the 81st Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of the Washington Army National Guard. The 2nd brigade was inactivated on 15 August 1988 along with the following units: * 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 47th Infantry * 3rd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 60th Infantry * 6th Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (inactivated 15 September 1988) * 209th Support Battalion On the same date the 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, which until then had been attached to the division, was assigned to the division. With the inactivation of the 2nd brigade the remaining units were reassigned among the remaining brigades: 1st brigade now consisted of 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 2nd Infantry, 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, and 4th Combined Arms Battalion Light, 23rd Infantry. 3rd brigade consisted of 2nd Light Attack Battalion, 1st Infantry, 3rd Combined Arms Battalion Light, 47th Infantry, and 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 60th Infantry. The 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 23rd Infantry was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Brigade. = Organization 1988 = McGrath writes that the 9th Infantry Division was organized as follows in 1988:McGrath, 'The Brigade,' p.84. * 9th Infantry Division (Motorized), Fort Lewis, WA ** Headquarters & Headquarters Company ** 1st Brigade *** Headquarters & Headquarters Company *** 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor *** 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 2nd Infantry *** 4th Combined Arms Battalion Light, 23rd Infantry ** 3rd Brigade *** Headquarters & Headquarters Company *** 2nd Light Attack Battalion, 1st Infantry *** 3rd Combined Arms Battalion Light, 47th Infantry *** 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 60th Infantry ** 81st Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), (Washington Army National Guard), Seattle, WA *** Headquarters & Headquarters Company *** 1st Battalion, 303rd Armor *** 1st Battalion, 803rd Armor *** 1st Battalion, 161st Infantry (Mechanized) *** 3rd Battalion, 161st Infantry (Mechanized) *** 2nd Battalion, 146th Field Artillery (M109 155mm self-propelled howitzers) *** 181st Support Battalion *** Troop E, 303rd Cavalry *** 898th Engineer Company *** Battery D, 216th Air Defense Artillery (Minnesota Army National Guard) ** 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) *** Headquarters & Headquarters Troop *** 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry (8 √ó AH-1F Cobra, 12 √ó OH-58C Kiowa, 2 √ó UH-60A Black Hawk) *** 1st Battalion, 9th Aviation (30 √ó UH-60A Black Hawk & 16 √ó CH-47D Chinook) *** 2nd Battalion, 9th Aviation (21 √ó AH-1F Cobra & 13 √ó OH-58C Kiowa, a second attack helicopter battalion was scheduled to be activated) *** 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 23rd Infantry ** Division Artillery *** Headquarters & Headquarters Battery *** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (18 √ó M198 155mm towed howitzers) *** 3rd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (18 √ó M198 155mm towed howitzer) *** 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery (12 √ó M102 105mm towed howitzer & 9 √ó M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems) *** Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery (Target Acquisition, AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder & AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radars) ** Division Support Command *** 3rd Battalion, 9th Aviation *** 99th Support Battalion (Forward) (supports 3rd Brigade) *** 109th Support Battalion (Forward) (supports 1st Brigade) *** 709th Support Battalion (Main) ** 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery ** 15th Engineer Battalion ** 9th Signal Battalion ** 109th Military Intelligence Battalion ** 9th Chemical Company ** 9th Military Police Company ** 73rd Engineer Company (Assault Ribbon Bridge) ** 9th Division Band In fiscal year 1989 Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Carl E. Vuono approved the conversion of the division's two combined arms battalions light to standard mechanized infantry battalions.  Inactivation  The division was the first to undergo full inactivation following the end of the Cold War. Army leadership at first decided that inactivating units would turn in all of their equipment at \\"10/20\\" standard ‚Äì in ready and reusable condition. The division struggled to meet this standard. It required both extensive work on the part of the division's soldiers and high costs in repair parts. While the remaining 9th ID soldiers were ultimately successful, later inactivating units were not required to attain this goal. The inactivation of the division began on 28 September 1990 with the inactivation of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, and 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry. The 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery inactivated on 15 January 1991. On 16 February 1991 the 3rd Brigade was reflagged as 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized)Dinackus 2000, page 11-3 with the following units: * 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized), Fort Lewis ** Headquarters & Headquarters Company ** 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor ** 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry ** 3rd Battalion, 47th Infantry ** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery ** 99th Support Battalion (Forward) ** Troop A, 9th Cavalry (rest of 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry disbanded on the same date) ** 102nd Engineer Company (Company D, 15th Engineer Battalion) ** 9th Chemical Company ** Battery E, 44th Air Defense Artillery (rest of 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery disbanded on the same date) The remainder of the division's units inactivated on the following dates: * 15 February 1991: 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry * 15 April 1991: 15th Engineer Battalion * 15 May 1991: 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry * 15 July 1991: 9th Signal Battalion and Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery * 15 September 1991: 109th Military Intelligence Battalion With the support and aviation units inactivating in the same timeframe. The divisional headquarters remained active until 15 December 1991.Dinackus 2000, page 11-3. The 3rd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery became a General Support battalion of I Corps Artillery. Though it was inactivated, the division was identified as the second highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History's lineage scheme due to its numerous accolades and long history. All of the division's flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia following its inactivation. Should the U.S. Army decide to activate more divisions in the future, the center will most likely suggest the first new division be the 9th Infantry Division, then the 24th Infantry Division, the 5th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Armored Division. The 7th Infantry Division, previously inactivated, resumed service as an administrative headquarters at Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord in 2012.

Introduction From the founding of the Republic in 1902 to the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the Cuban Liberal Party held the presidency on numerous occasions. Since the triumph of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, there have been three liberal parties in existence. Those parties are: the Liberal Democratic Party (Partido Liberal Democr√°tico, observer LI), the Democratic Solidarity Party (Partido Solidaridad Democr√°tica, observer LI) and the illegal Cuban Liberal Movement (Movimiento Liberal Cubano). In exile the Cuban Liberal Union (Uni√≥n Liberal Cubana, member LI) is active. The timeline =Cuban Revolutionary Party (PRC)= *1892: Left-wing classical liberals formed the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Cubano), to fight for Cuban independence and liberal democracy. *1902: The PRC is dissolved. =Liberal Party= *1902: The Liberal Party of Cuba was founded by many of those who had formerly been members of the PRC. *1925: The Liberal Party wins the elections with Gerardo Machado as their candidate. *1929: Machado runs for a second term by altering the Constitution, and is fraudulently elected. The Liberal Party splits between \\"machadistas\\" and those against Machado. *1933: The Revolution takes place, in which a group of students, the FEU, led by Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n, a Professor of Physiology at the University of Havana, seek to overthrow Machado, and later, the US backed provisional government of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. Allying themselves with a group of soldiers led by Fulgencio Batista, the provisional government is overthrown and Grau is made President. =The Second Cuban Revolutionary Party (PRC), the Party of the Cuban People (PPC) and the Liberal Party= *1934: After Grau's removal from the presidency by Batista, a group of former students, Grau, and several former members of the Liberal Party form the new Authentic Cuban Revolutionary Party, or PRC (Partido Revolucionario Cubano- Autentico) to fight for their beliefs. The PRC begins to compete with the traditional Liberal Party, which was stained by its support of Machado. *1940: Fulgencio Batista is elected President of Cuba with the support of the Liberal Party. The new Constitution is promulgated later that year, with Carlos M√°rquez Sterling as President of the Convention. *1944: Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n is elected President of Cuba, with the support of several former Liberal Party members, as the PRC wins its first elections. *1947: Eduardo Chibas breaks off from the PRC to protest the corruption of the Grau government and forms the Partido del Pueblo Cubano-Ortodoxo (PPC) or the Party of Cuban People-Orthodox. Several former PRC and Liberal Party members, including M√°rquez Sterling, join. *1948: Carlos Prio Socarras of the PRC is elected President of Cuba. *1951: Eduardo Chibas dies from an accidental suicide. Had he survived, the PPC would most likely not have fragmented as it did during the 1950s. =Batista's coup and second government= *1952: The Liberal Party of Cuba supports Batista's coup of 1952 and joins the provisional government, and later Batista's second government. By now the Liberal Party is a shell of its former self, controlled by Batista. *1952-1958: The PRC and PPC split between those who argue for revolution and support Castro, and those who seek compromise with Batista and support free and fair general elections. *1958: The General Elections of 1958 fail, as Batista rigs the elections to ensure the victory of the government candidate Andr√©s Rivero Ag√ºero and a member of the Liberal Party, against Carlos M√°rquez Sterling running for the Partido del Pueblo Libre. *1959: Castro takes power and outlaws all political parties except the Communist Party. The traditional Liberal Party, PRC, and PPC legally cease to exist. The Liberal Party continues underground and extralegally.

The child of Iranian Jews, he was born in Turkey and grew up in Italy. After receiving a BA in political economics at Bocconi University, Milan and a doctorate in international economics at Harvard University, he became an academic at Yale and a visiting researcher/advisor at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Federal Reserve, World Bank, and Bank of Israel. Much of his early research focused on emerging markets. During the administration of President Bill Clinton, he was a senior economist for the Council of Economic Advisers, later moving to the United States Treasury Department as a senior adviser to Timothy Geithner, who was Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama. Early life and education Nouriel Roubini was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Iranian Jewish parents. When he was an infant, his family lived briefly in Iran and Israel. From 1962 to 1983 he resided in Italy, especially in Milan, where he attended the local Jewish school and then the Bocconi University, earning a B.A., summa cum laude, in economics. He received his Ph.D. in international economics from Harvard University in 1988, where his adviser was Jeffrey Sachs. He is a U.S. citizen and speaks English, Persian, Italian, Hebrew, and conversational French.\\"Fame and Fortune: Nouriel Roubini\\" Times Online, June 21, 2009 He is a cousin of leading technology expert and former PC Magazine lead technology analyst Jonathan Roubini.\\"Lab Reviews: Jonathan Roubini\\" Lab Reviews\\" In 2009 he was named Bocconian of the Year (Alumnus of the Year since 2011) from his alma mater Bocconi University in recognition of his work. Career Roubini at the Global Governance event of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City For much of the 1990s, Roubini combined academic research with policy making by teaching at Yale and then in New York, while also being employed at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve, World Bank, and Bank of Israel. Currently, he is a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. Long study of emerging market blowouts in Asia and Latin America helped him spot the looming disaster in the U.S.(in 2008). \\"I've been studying emerging markets for 20 years, and saw the same signs in the U.S. that I saw in them, which was that we were in a massive credit bubble,\\" he said. By 1998, he joined the Clinton administration first as a senior economist in the White House Council of Economic Advisers and then moved to the Treasury department as a senior adviser to Timothy Geithner, then the undersecretary for international affairs, who in 2009 became Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. Roubini returned to the IMF in 2001 as a visiting scholar while it battled a financial meltdown in Argentina. He cowrote a book on saving bankrupt economies entitled, Bailouts or Bail-ins? and launched his own consulting firm. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2007. =Role models= He credits a number of economists for his understanding of economics. He said, > One person who has had a great impact on me intellectually was my adviser at > Harvard, Jeffrey Sachs. For me he's the model of a great intellectual. He is > both a rigorous academic and very human, involved in big picture issues such > as poverty, AIDS, and Africa. He's someone with a great mind that is also > very engaged with the world. Another intellectual hero is Larry Summers, the > former President of Harvard, an amazing intellectual and academic, who is > very deeply involved with the policy world. I worked for him for many years > in the US Treasury during the Clinton Administration. =Global nomad= Roubini likes to refer to himself as a \\"global nomad\\", and says, \\"You can be sitting still surfing the Internet, and experience other worlds, ideas and societies. But I've found that there is nothing better than visiting a different country, even if for three days. ... [Y]ou can't only be a virtual Global Nomad, with goggles on, in a virtual reality. You have to be there. You have to see it, smell it and live it. You have to see people, travel, and interact.\\" Partly to fulfill this need, he formed Roubini Global Economics, an economic consultancy for financial analysis. In describing the purpose of RGE Monitor, he said, \\"the world is my home, so everything about society and culture‚Äîno matter how ‚Äîis worth knowing. I am an information junkie and created RGE Monitor to collect information about what's happening around the world.\\" Speaking of his early influences, Roubini said, \\"I was born into a relatively orthodox Jewish family in Iran, lived in Israel and Turkey, and then moved to Italy as a child. By the age of six, instead of going to a yeshiva, I went to a secular Jewish school where I interacted with kids from all sorts of different backgrounds. Had I gone to an orthodox Jewish school, I would perhaps be orthodox now and may have never become a Global Nomad.\\" Roubini announced on Twitter in early 2014 his new practice of Transcendental Meditation.‚ÄòDr. Om‚Äô or ‚ÄòDr. Doom‚Äô? Roubini gets meditative in Davos Roubini is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council. =Personal investments= During an interview in June 2009, he was asked about his personal lifestyle expenses and other investments. He said, \\"I regularly save about 30% of my income. Apart from my mortgage, I don't have any other debts. The credit crunch hasn't affected me much. ... I've always lived within my means and, luckily, have never been out of work. I would say I'm a frugal person‚ÄîI don't have very expensive tastes. ... You don't need to spend a lot to enjoy things.\\" Asked whether he invests in stocks, he replied, \\"Not as much these days. I used to have a lot in equities‚Äîabout 75%‚Äîbut over the past three years, I've had about 95% in cash and 5% in equities. You're not getting much from savings these days but earning 0% is better than losing 50%. ... I don't believe in picking individual stocks or assets. ... Never invest your money as though you are gambling at the casino. Buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time.\\" =Economic forecast= Roubini is one of few economists who predicted the housing bubble crash of 2007-2008. He warned about the crisis in an IMF position paper in 2006. Roubini's predictions have earned him the nicknames \\"Dr. Doom\\" and \\"permabear\\" in the media. In 2008, Fortune magazine wrote, \\"In 2005 Roubini said home prices were riding a speculative wave that would soon sink the economy. Back then the professor was called a Cassandra. Now he's a sage\\".\\"Eight Who Saw it Coming . . . and eight who didn't\\" Fortune, Aug. 2008 The New York Times notes that he foresaw \\"homeowners defaulting on mortgages, trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities unraveling worldwide and the global financial system shuddering to a halt\\". In September 2006, he warned a skeptical IMF that \\"the United States was likely to face a once-in-a-lifetime housing bust, an oil shock, sharply declining consumer confidence, and, ultimately, a deep recession\\". Nobel laureate Paul Krugman adds that his once \\"seemingly outlandish\\" predictions have been matched \\"or even exceeded by reality.\\" By highlighting some of his many past predictions as being accurate, Roubini has promoted himself as a major figure in the U.S. and international debate about the economy, and spends much of his time shuttling between meetings with central bank governors and finance ministers in Europe and Asia. Although he is ranked only 985th in terms of lifetime academic citations,Ideas he was #4 on Foreign Policy magazine's list of the \\"top 100 global thinkers.\\" In 2011 and 2012, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers. In December 2013 Roubini was awarded by Global Thinkers Forum the honorary GTF 2013 Award for Excellence in Global Thinking. He has appeared before Congress, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the World Economic Forum at Davos. U.S. economy In the 1990s, Roubini studied the collapse of emerging economies. He used an intuitive, historical approach backed up by an understanding of theoretical models to analyze these countries and came to the conclusion that a common denominator was the large current account deficits financed by loans from abroad. Roubini theorized that the United States might be the next to suffer, and as early as 2004 began writing about a possible future collapse. Business Week magazine writer Michael Mandel, however, noted in 2006 that Roubini and other economists often make general predictions which could happen over multiyear periods.March 21, 2006 \\"The Problem With Prediction Registries\\" In September 2006, he foresaw the end of the real estate bubble: \\"When supply increases, prices fall: that's been the trend for 110 years, since 1890. But since 1997, real home prices have increased by about 90 percent. There is no economic fundamental‚Äîreal income, migration, interest rates, demographics‚Äîthat can explain this. It means there was a speculative bubble. And now that bubble is bursting.\\" In the Spring 2006 issue of International Finance, he wrote an article titled \\"Why Central Banks Should Burst Bubbles\\"Article Abstract, International Finance, Spring 2006 in which he argued that central banks should take action against asset bubbles. When asked whether the real estate ride was over, he said, \\"Not only is it over, it's going to be a nasty fall.\\"\\"The Descent\\", New York Magazine, Sept. 24, 2006 By May 2009, he felt that analysts expecting the U.S. economy to rebound in the third and fourth quarter were \\"too optimistic\\".\\"Global Crisis ‚ÄòVastly Worse‚Äô Than 1930s, Taleb Says\\" Bloomberg, May 7, 2009 He expected the full recession to last 24 or 36 months, and believed in the possibility of an \\"L-shaped\\" slow recovery that Japan went through in The Lost Decade.\\"Roubini Says Recession May Continue Until End of 2010\\" Bloomberg, March 6, 2009 In his opinion, much of the current recession's cause is due to \\"boom-and-bust cycles,\\" and he feels the U.S. economy needs to find a different growth path in the future. \\"We've been growing through a period of time of repeated big bubbles,\\" he said. \\"We've had a model of 'growth' based on overconsumption and lack of savings. And now that model has broken down because we borrowed too much.\\" He feels that too much human capital went into financing the \\"most unproductive form of capital, meaning housing\\" and would like to see America create a model of growth in more-productive activities. He feels that \\"sustainable growth may mean investing slowly in infrastructures for the future, and rebuilding our human capital,\\" by investing in renewable resources. \\"We don't know what it's going to be,\\" he says, \\"but it's going to be a challenge to find a new growth model. It's not going to be simple.\\" ;Recovery from recession In August 2009, Roubini predicted that the global economy would begin recovering near the end of 2009, but the U.S. economy is likely to grow only about one percent annually during the next two years, which is less than the three percent normal \\"trend.\\" He noted that the Fed is \\"now embarked on a policy in which they are in effect directly monetizing about half of the budget deficit,\\" but that now \\"monetization is not inflationary,\\" as banks were holding much of the money themselves and not relending it. When these attitudes reverse at the end of the recession, that would be time for an \\"exit strategy, of mopping up that liquidity\\" and taking some of the money back out of circulation, \\"so it doesn't just bid up house prices and stock values in a new bubble. And that will be 'very, very tricky indeed,'\\" he stated. Also, in late July, he warned that if no clear exit strategy is outlined and implemented, there was the potential of a perfect storm: fiscal deficits, rising bond yields, higher oil prices, weak profits, and a stagnant labor market, which combined could \\"blow the recovering world economy back into a double-dip recession.\\"\\"Roubini Sees Risk of ‚ÄòDouble Dip‚Äô Global Recession\\" Bloomberg News, July 23, 2009 Global economy =2006= In the summer of 2006, Roubini wrote that the U.S. was headed into a long and \\"protracted\\" recession due to the \\"collapse\\" of house prices, which he noted were already in freefall.\\"Recession will be nasty and deep, economist says\\" , Wall Street Journal, August 23, 2006 With regards to Europe, Roubini predicted that Italy, and possibly a series of other eurozone countries (Portugal, Spain, Greece) might have to exit the eurozone if they did not implement \\"serious economic reforms.\\" \\"[It] is not a foregone conclusion but, if Italy does not reform, an exit from EMU within 5 years is not totally unlikely. Indeed, like Argentina, Italy faces a growing competitiveness loss given an increasingly overvalued currency and the risk of falling exports and growing current account deficit. The growth slowdown will make the public deficit and debt worse and potentially unsustainable over time. And if a devaluation cannot be used to reduce real wages, the real exchange rate overvaluation will be undone via a slow and painful process of wage and price deflation.\\" =2009= As of January 2009, he remained pessimistic about the U.S. and global economy. He said in September, 2008, \\"we have a subprime financial system, not a subprime mortgage market\\".\\"Bailout: No cure for recession\\", CNN Money, Sept. 24, 2008 \\"As the U.S. economy shrinks, the entire global economy will go into recession. In Europe, Canada, Japan, and the other advanced economies, it will be severe. Nor will emerging market economies‚Äîlinked to the developed world by trade in goods, finance, and currency‚Äîescape real pain.\\" He was quoted in South Africa's 2009 budget speech for his role in predicting the current financial crisis in the developed markets. Roubini notes that the subprime issues are a global, and not just a U.S. problem. In an interview with author James Fallows in late spring of 2009, he stated, \\"People talk about the American subprime problem, but there were housing bubbles in the U.K., in Spain, in Ireland, in Iceland, in a large part of emerging Europe, like the Baltics all the way to Hungary and the Balkans. It was not just the U.S., and not just 'subprime.' It was excesses that led to the risk of a tipping point in many different economies.\\"Fallows, James. \\"Dr. Doom Has Some Good News\\", The Atlantic magazine, July/August, 2009 His pessimism is focused on the short-run rather than the medium or long-run. In Foreign Policy (Jan/Feb 2009), he writes, \\"Last year's worst-case scenarios came true. The global financial pandemic that I and others had warned about is now upon us. But we are still only in the early stages of this crisis. My predictions for the coming year, unfortunately, are even more dire: The bubbles, and there were many, have only begun to burst\\".Roubini, Nouriel. Warning: More Doom Ahead Foreign Policy, January/February, 2009 At a conference in Dubai in January, 2009, he said, the U.S. banking system was \\"effectively insolvent.\\" He added that the \\"systemic banking crisis. ... The problems of Citi, Bank of America and others suggest the system is bankrupt. In Europe, it's the same thing.\\"\\"Roubini Predicts U.S. Losses May Reach $3.6 Trillion\\" Bloomberg News, January 20, 2009 To deal with this problem, he recommends that the U.S. government \\"do triage between banks that are illiquid and undercapitalized but solvent, and those that are insolvent. The insolvent ones you have to shut down.\\" He adds, \\"We're in a war economy. You need command-economy allocation of credit to the real economy. Not enough is being done,\\" he felt at the time.\\"Roubini Sees More Economic Gloom Ahead\\", Time, March 3, 2009 =2010= In 2010, he again warned that despite an improved economy with rising stock markets, the crisis was not over and new bubbles were on the horizon: > We are just at the next stage. This is where we move from a private to a > public debt problem ... We socialised part of the private losses by bailing > out financial institutions and providing fiscal stimulus to avoid the great > recession from turning into a depression. But rising public debt is never a > free lunch, eventually you have to pay for it. In late May 2010, markets around the world began dropping due partly to problems in Greece and the Eurozone. \\"Roubini believes Greece will prove to be just the first of a series of countries standing on the brink,\\" writes the Telegraph. Roubini explains the new issues governments must deal with: > We have to start to worry about the solvency of governments. What is > happening today in Greece is the tip of the iceberg of rising sovereign debt > problems in the eurozone, in the UK, in Japan and in the US. This ... is > going to be the next issue in the global financial crisis. ;China Roubini met officials in China during spring 2009, and pointed out that many Chinese commentators blame American \\"overborrowing and excess\\" for dragging them into a recession. However, he stated that \\"even they realize that the very excess of American demand has created a market for Chinese exports.\\" He adds that although Chinese leaders \\"would love to be less dependent on American customers and hate having so many of their nation's foreign assets tied up in U.S. dollars,\\" they're now \\"more worried about keeping Chinese exporters in business. ... I don't think even the Chinese authorities have fully internalized the contradictions of their position.\\" =2011= Roubini and political scientist Ian Bremmer have described the 21st century world as fragmenting economically and politically, where the \\"old models of understanding global dynamics are struggling\\" to keep up with rapid changes. In an article in Foreign Affairs magazine, they describe what they call a \\"G-Zero world,\\" where the United States no longer has the resources to continue as the primary provider of global public goods. As a result, there is likely to be more conflict than cooperation between countries, creating a \\"zero-sum game,\\" a \\"game in which my win is your loss.\\" They explain their rationale: > Europe is fully occupied for the moment with saving the eurozone. Japan is > likewise tied down with complex political and economic problems at home. > None of these powers' governments has the time, resources, or domestic > political capital needed for a new bout of international heavy lifting. > Meanwhile, there are no credible answers to transnational challenges without > the direct involvement of emerging powers such as Brazil, China, and India. > Yet these countries are far too focused on domestic development to welcome > the burdens that come with new responsibilities abroad. > > We are now living in a G-Zero world, one in which no single country or bloc > of countries has the political and economic leverage‚Äîor the will‚Äîto drive a > truly international agenda.

He pointed to an improving European economy and stronger euro, steadying of the economy in Japan, and a marked improvement in the United States. He praised the Federal Reserve for its unconventional monetary policy, which he forecast would last for a few more years, supporting equity markets. =2017= At the start of 2017, Roubini speculated that the election of Donald Trump as President may portend a geopolitical shift away from globalization and more toward isolationism, a change which he feels could lead to global instability and rising military conflicts among other countries.Roubini, Nouriel. \\"'America First' and Global Conflict Next\\", Project Syndicate, Jan. 2, 2017 =2018= Roubini delivered a blistering attack on cryptocurrency to a U.S. Senate Banking Committee.Roubini Senate Blockchain Testimony =2019= In November 2019, he wrote \\"Nine Reasons Why the Stock Markets Are Far Too Optimistic\\". =2020= On Feb. 17 he warned of financial vulnerabilities that \\"could trigger severe economic, financial, political, and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.\\" Two days later, the market peaked prior to what would become the 2020 stock market crash. Following a relatively minor decrease, on the 24th Roubini warned that the markets were still too complacent about coronavirus, predicting a government response to the followed by positive market reaction, which would then fizzle.  Political views  Roubini is identified as a Democrat in his profile on Wall Street Economists.. He is a frequent critic of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

These antibodies are transported from the plasma cells by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system to the site of the target antigen (foreign substance), where they initiate its neutralization or destruction. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell. Structure Plasma cells are large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and a characteristic appearance on light microscopy. They have basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus with heterochromatin in a characteristic cartwheel or clock face arrangement. Their cytoplasm also contains a pale zone that on electron microscopy contains an extensive Golgi apparatus and centrioles (EM picture). Abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum combined with a well-developed Golgi apparatus makes plasma cells well-suited for secreting immunoglobulins. Other organelles in a plasma cell include ribosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane. =Surface antigens= Terminally differentiated plasma cells express relatively few surface antigens, and do not express common pan-B cell markers, such as CD19 and CD20. Instead, plasma cells are identified through flow cytometry by their additional expression of CD138, CD78, and the Interleukin-6 receptor. In humans, CD27 is a good marker for plasma cells; naive B cells are CD27-, memory B-cells are CD27+ and plasma cells are CD27++. The surface antigen CD138 (syndecan-1) is expressed at high levels. Another important surface antigen is CD319 (SLAMF7). This antigen is expressed at high levels on normal human plasma cells. It is also expressed on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma. Compared with CD138, which disappears rapidly ex vivo, the expression of CD319 is considerably more stable.  Development  After leaving the bone marrow, the B cell acts as an antigen-presenting cell (APC) and internalizes offending antigens, which are taken up by the B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and processed. Pieces of the antigen (which are now known as antigenic peptides) are loaded onto MHC II molecules, and presented on its extracellular surface to CD4+ T cells (sometimes called T helper cells). These T cells bind to the MHC II-antigen molecule and cause activation of the B cell. This is a type of safeguard to the system, similar to a two-factor authentication method. First, the B cells must encounter a foreign antigen and are then required to be activated by T helper cells before they differentiate into specific cells. Upon stimulation by a T cell, which usually occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, the activated B cell begins to differentiate into more specialized cells. Germinal center B cells may differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells. Most of these B cells will become plasmablasts (or \\"immature plasma cells\\"), and eventually plasma cells, and begin producing large volumes of antibodies. Some B cells will undergo a process known as affinity maturation. This process favors, by selection for the ability to bind antigen with higher affinity, the activation and growth of B cell clones able to secrete antibodies of higher affinity for the antigen. = Immature plasma cells= The most immature blood cell that is considered of plasma cell lineage is the plasmablast. Plasmablasts secrete more antibodies than B cells, but less than plasma cells. They divide rapidly and are still capable of internalizing antigens and presenting them to T cells. A cell may stay in this state for several days, and then either die or irrevocably differentiate into a mature, fully differentiated plasma cell. Differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells is dependent upon the transcription factors Blimp-1/PRDM1 and IRF4. Function After the process of affinity maturation in germinal centers, plasma cells have an indeterminate lifespan, ranging from days to months. Recently they have been shown to reside for much longer periods in the bone marrow as long-lived plasma cells (LLPC). They secrete high levels of antibodies, ranging from hundreds to thousands of antibodies per second per cell. Unlike their precursors, they cannot switch antibody classes, cannot act as antigen-presenting cells because they no longer display MHC-II, and do not take up antigen because they no longer display significant quantities of immunoglobulin on the cell surface. However, continued exposure to antigen through those low levels of immunoglobulin is important, as it partly determines the cell's lifespan. The lifespan, class of antibodies produced, and the location that the plasma cell moves to also depends on signals, such as cytokines, received from the T cell during differentiation. Differentiation through a T cell-independent antigen stimulation (stimulation of a B cell that does not require the involvement of a T cell) can happen anywhere in the body and results in short-lived cells that secrete IgM antibodies. The T cell- dependent processes are subdivided into primary and secondary responses: a primary response (meaning that the T cell is present at the time of initial contact by the B cell with the antigen) produces short-lived cells that remain in the extramedullary regions of lymph nodes; a secondary response produces longer-lived cells that produce IgG and IgA, and frequently travel to the bone marrow. For example, plasma cells will likely secrete IgG3 antibodies if they matured in the presence of the cytokine interferon-gamma. Since B cell maturation also involves somatic hypermutation (a process completed before differentiation into a plasma cell), these antibodies frequently have a very high affinity for their antigen. Plasma cells can only produce a single kind of antibody in a single class of immunoglobulin. In other words, every B cell is specific to a single antigen, but each cell can produce several thousand matching antibodies per second. This prolific production of antibodies is an integral part of the humoral immune response. Plasma cells with Dutcher and Russell bodies (H&E;, 100x, oil) Clinical significance Plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia and plasma cell leukemia are malignant neoplasms (\\"cancer\\") of the plasma cells. Multiple myeloma is frequently identified because malignant plasma cells continue producing an antibody, which can be detected as a paraprotein. Common variable immunodeficiency is thought to be due to a problem in the differentiation from lymphocytes to plasma cells. The result is a low serum antibody level and risk of infections. Primary amyloidosis (AL) is caused by the deposition of excess immunoglobulin light chains which are secreted from plasma cells.

The program is a collaboration between local residents, non-profit organizations (NPO), businesses, and the local government to invigorate the local economy and community. Residents pay an application fee of ten dollars, and when they volunteer at a participating NPO, earn ten community service dollars (C$D) per hour, which is credited to their card. Participating stores agree to contribute 5 to 20% of the price of a purchase. If a member makes a purchase, the store unconditionally refunds 40% of its commitment to the member; another 40% is refunded if community service dollars are used, and contributed to NPOs if not. The remaining 20% is contributed to NPOs in the program. In addition, a fee of 25 cents is charged for each card use. Community service dollars must be spent within 180 days or be automatically contributed to NPOs. As of August 1999, participants included 2,100 individuals, 43 NPOs, and 70 businesses. The HERO card is a patented invention. The invention was carried to a business plan by Gary Austin of Atlanta, Georgia in 1991 through the late 1990s. The HERO card is a tool for consumers to create savings and wealth by depositing cash rebates into a private account in the name of the card holder. HERO cards were to be distributed free to all credit card holders and even those who preferred cash purchases. When a purchase was made by the consumer (either credit cards, debit or cash), a rebate would have been deposited into the HERO account for accrual and interest. The exciting concept was that rebates would be available to even cash purchasing consumers and not just credit card users, and the card did not require a credit check to distribute, as it was a \\"deposit\\" reward card, and not a credit purchase card. The HERO card idea was pitched to all the major credit card companies, which initially were excited by the idea, but did not buy into the plan (though some are now offering similar \\"savings reward\\" cards now in 2006) see: Money Central Article Startup stock offerings reached into the millions of dollars for HEROcard, but the company eventually closed its doors after a local card launch in Atlanta did not garner the critical mass to sustain itself.

The medallists of the ladies' single figure skating: Mao Asada (left, silver), Yuna Kim (center, gold), Joannie Rochette (right, bronze).An orchestra conductor stands on a podium so he can both see and be seen by the musicians A podium (plural podiums or podia) is a platform used to raise something to a short distance above its surroundings. It derives from the Greek œÄœåŒ¥Œπ (foot). In architecture a building can rest on a large podium. Podia can also be used to raise people, for instance the conductor of an orchestra stands on a podium as do many public speakers. Common parlance has shown an increasing use of podium in North American English to describe a lectern. In sports, a type of podium can be used to honor the top three competitors in events. In the modern Olympics a tri-level podium is used. Traditionally, the highest platform is in the center for the gold medalist. To their right is a lower platform for the silver medalist, and to the left of the gold medalist is a lower platform for the bronze medalist. At the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, the Silver and Bronze podium places were of equal elevation. In many sports, results in the top three of a competition are often referred to as \\"podiums\\" or \\"podium finishes\\". In some individual sports, \\"podiums\\" is an official statistic, referring to the number of top three results an athlete has achieved over the course of a season or career. The word may also be used, chiefly in the United States, as a verb, \\"to podium\\", meaning to attain a podium place. First use at modern Olympics Podia were first used at the 1930 British Empire Games (now Commonwealth Games) in Hamilton, Ontario and subsequently during the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid and the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

In motorsport The winner stands in the middle, with the second placed driver to their right and the third place driver to their left. Also present are the dignitaries selected by the race organisers who will present the trophies. Le Mans winners' podium, 2015 In many forms of motorsport, the three top-placed drivers in a race stand on a podium for the trophy ceremony. In an international series, the national anthem of the winning driver, and the winning team or constructor may be played over a public address system and the flags of the drivers' countries are hoisted above them. The recordings are short versions of the national anthems, ensuring the podium ceremony does not exceeded its allocated time. Should a driver experience problems with his car on a slow lap in Formula One, that driver is transported to the pit lane via road car by the Formula One Administration security officer. Following the presentation of the trophies, the drivers will often spray Champagne over each other and their team members watching below, a tradition started by Dan Gurney following the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The drivers will generally refrain from spraying champagne if a fatality or major accident occurs during the event. Also, in countries where alcohol sponsorship or drinking is prohibited, alcoholic beverages may be replaced by other drinks, for example rose water.F1 will have Arab flavour - Roland Hughes, The National, Abu Dhabi, 10 July 2008 The term has become common parlance in the media, where a driver may be said to \\"be heading for a podium finish\\" or \\"just missing out on a podium\\" when he is heading for, or just misses out on a top three finish. The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, the highest level of stock car racing in the United States, does not use a podium in post-game events or statistics. Instead, the winning team celebrates in victory lane, and top-five and top-ten finishes are recognized statistically. Those finishing second to fifth are required to stop in a media bullpen located on pit lane for interviews. The INDYCAR Verizon IndyCar Series does not use a podium at either the Indianapolis 500 or at Texas Motor Speedway. The Indy 500 has a long tradition of the winning driver and team celebrating in victory lane, while Texas Motor Speedway president Eddie Gossage has stated that victory lane should be reserved for the winner of the race.Thatsracin.com Dixon looks forward to next week's break Retrieved 6/19/2009 However, the series does use a podium at all other races, particularly road course events.

Scareware is part of a class of malicious software that includes rogue security software, ransomware and other scam software that tricks users into believing their computer is infected with a virus, then suggests that they download and pay for fake antivirus software to remove it. Usually the virus is fictional and the software is non-functional or malware itself.'Scareware' scams trick searchers. BBC News (2009-03-23). Retrieved on 2009-03-23. According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, the number of scareware packages in circulation rose from 2,850 to 9,287 in the second half of 2008. In the first half of 2009, the APWG identified a 585% increase in scareware programs.Phishing Activity Trends Report: 1st Half 2009 The \\"scareware\\" label can also apply to any application or virus which pranks users with intent to cause anxiety or panic.  Scam scareware  Internet security writers use the term \\"scareware\\" to describe software products that produce frivolous and alarming warnings or threat notices, most typically for fictitious or useless commercial firewall and registry cleaner software. This class of program tries to increase its perceived value by bombarding the user with constant warning messages that do not increase its effectiveness in any way. Software is packaged with a look and feel that mimics legitimate security software in order to deceive consumers. Some websites display pop-up advertisement windows or banners with text such as: \\"Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs. Immediate removal may be required. To scan, click 'Yes' below.\\" These websites can go as far as saying that a user's job, career, or marriage would be at risk. Products using advertisements such as these are often considered scareware. Serious scareware applications qualify as rogue software. Some scareware is not affiliated with any other installed programs. A user can encounter a pop-up on a website indicating that their PC is infected. In some scenarios, it is possible to become infected with scareware even if the user attempts to cancel the notification. These popups are specially designed to look like they come from the user's operating system when they are actually a webpage. A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising. Starting on March 29, 2011, more than 1.5 million web sites around the world have been infected by the LizaMoon SQL injection attack spread by scareware. Research by Google discovered that scareware was using some of its servers to check for internet connectivity. The data suggested that up to a million machines were infected with scareware. The company has placed a warning in the search results of users whose computers appear to be infected. Another example of scareware is Smart Fortress. This site scares people into thinking they have many viruses on their computer and asks them to buy the professional service. = Spyware = Dialog from SpySheriff, designed to scare users into installing the rogue software Some forms of spyware also qualify as scareware because they change the user's desktop background, install icons in the computer's notification area (under Microsoft Windows), and claiming that some kind of spyware has infected the user's computer and that the scareware application will help to remove the infection. In some cases, scareware trojans have replaced the desktop of the victim with large, yellow text reading \\"Warning! You have spyware!\\" or a box containing similar text, and have even forced the screensaver to change to \\"bugs\\" crawling across the screen. Winwebsec is the term usually used to address the malware that attacks the users of Windows operating system and produces fake claims similar to that of genuine anti- malware software. SpySheriff exemplifies spyware and scareware: it purports to remove spyware, but is actually a piece of spyware itself, often accompanying SmitFraud infections.spywarewarrior.com filed under \\"Brave Sentry.\\" Other antispyware scareware may be promoted using a phishing scam. Uninstallation of security software Another approach is to trick users into uninstalling legitimate antivirus software, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, or disabling their firewall.theregister.co.uk Since antivirus programs typically include protection against being tampered with or disabled by other software, scareware may use social engineering to convince the user to disable programs which would otherwise prevent the malware from working. Legal action In 2005, Microsoft and Washington state successfully sued Secure Computer (makers of Spyware Cleaner) for $1 million over charges of using scareware pop-ups. Washington's attorney general has also brought lawsuits against Securelink Networks, High Falls Media, and the makers of Quick Shield. In October 2008, Microsoft and the Washington attorney general filed a lawsuit against two Texas firms, Branch Software and Alpha Red, producers of the Registry Cleaner XP scareware. The lawsuit alleges that the company sent incessant pop-ups resembling system warnings to consumers' personal computers stating \\"CRITICAL ERROR MESSAGE! - REGISTRY DAMAGED AND CORRUPTED\\", before instructing users to visit a web site to download Registry Cleaner XP at a cost of $39.95. On December 2, 2008, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\\"FTC\\") filed a Complaint in federal court against Innovative Marketing, Inc., ByteHosting Internet Services, LLC, as well as individuals Sam Jain, Daniel Sundin, James Reno, Marc D‚ÄôSouza, and Kristy Ross. The Complaint also listed Maurice D‚ÄôSouza as a Relief Defendant, alleged that he held proceeds of wrongful conduct but not accusing him of violating any law. The FTC alleged that the other Defendants violated the FTC Act by deceptively marketing software, including WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus. According to the complaint, the Defendants falsely represented that scans of a consumer's computer showed that it had been compromised or infected and then offered to sell software to fix the alleged problems.  Prank software  Another type of scareware involves software designed to literally scare the user through the use of unanticipated shocking images, sounds or video. * An early program of this type is NightMare, a program distributed on the Fish Disks for the Amiga computer (Fish #448) in 1991. When NightMare executes, it lies dormant for an extended and random period of time, finally changing the entire screen of the computer to an image of a skull while playing a horrifying shriek on the audio channels.Contents of disk #448. Amiga-stuff.com - see DISK 448. * Anxiety-based scareware puts users in situations where there are no positive outcomes. For example, a small program can present a dialog box saying \\"Erase everything on hard drive?\\" with two buttons, both labeled \\"OK\\". Regardless of which button is chosen, nothing is destroyed.Dark Drive Prank * This tactic was used in an advertisement campaign by Sir-Tech in 1997 to advertise Virus: The Game.

Royal Caribbean Group was formed as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line purchased Celebrity Cruises. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises. A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets. In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded rapidly with the creation of Azamara Cruises in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises.

It is located from the center of Paris. Geography The town is crossed by and named after the Yvette River. The total area is and is green spaces and woods. Place names The town of Gif-sur-Yvette is composed of sections: * in the valley: The Rougemonts, The M√©rantaise, The Mairie, The F√©verie, Coupi√®res, Damiette, Courcelle, l'Abbaye, les Coudraies; * on the Moulon Plateau: The Moulon (uninhabited, aside from a research and educational institute); * on the Hurepoix Plateau: The Hacquini√®re, Belleville (created before the war) and Chevry (created in the 1970s, and equipped with infrastructure). Also, the commune's territory includes many forests such as the Hacquini√®re Wood and the d'Aigrefoin Wood. Commune's neighbors The neighboring communes of Gif-sur-Yvette are Villiers-le-B√¢cle, Saint-Aubin, Saclay, Orsay, Bures-sur-Yvette, Gometz-le-Ch√¢tel, Gometz-la-Ville, and Saint- R√©my-l√®s-Chevreuse. History The human presence on the Moulon Plateau originates in Neolithic times. Agriculture was developed, notably during the Roman era. Between the 12th and the 18th century, an important Benedictine abbey was built in Gif. In the 19th century, Gif remained very agricultural (in particular, operating mills). In 1867, Gif was linked to the path of the Sceaux train (which later became the south branch of the RER B). After the First World War, the Gif commune experienced an important demographic change. The town took the name Gif-sur-Yvette in 1930. Just after the Second World War, Gif-sur-Yvette acquired an international scientific reputation, with the construction of the CNRS and of the CEA. The French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission discovered radioactive contamination in a private home in 1974. The home had been built upon a site where needles containing radon gas were once manufactured, starting in 1915. The needles were used to sterilize infected tissue‚Äîan idea developed by Marie Curie. The town was extended in 1975, with the creation of the Chevry section, from areas ceded by the Gometz-la-Ville and Gometz-le-Ch√¢tel communes. Main sights The Saint- R√©mi Church was constructed in the 12th century and remained until the 15th century, a structure of Roman and Gothic architecture. It was registered in 1938. Some ruins remain of a Benedictine abbey which was built in the 12th century and became a national property in 1789. It was officially registered in 1963. Population Inhabitants of Gif-sur-Yvette are known as Giffois. Economy Gif-sur-Yvette is situated in the \\"Science Valley\\" of the Yvette River. Numerous research organizations exist in this area, such as the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), the CEA (Commissariat √† l'√ânergie Atomique), Sup√©lec (√âcole Sup√©rieure d'√âlectricit√©), the LGEP (Laboratoire de G√©nie √âlectrique de Paris, associated with Sup√©lec), SOLEIL Synchrotron (Source Optimis√©e de Lumi√®re d'Energie Intermediaire du LURE) and the Institute of Plant Biotechnology. Also, Gif is home to the Centre National d'√âtudes and of the National Police Academy. The CGT operates, since 1950, a permanent central college of Gif-sur-Yvette, the Beno√Æt Frachon Center, situated along the Yvette River. Transport Gif-sur-Yvette is served by two stations on Paris RER line B: Gif-sur-Yvette and Courcelle-sur-Yvette. Like all the train stations on this line, one train goes towards/past Paris (A√©roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV or Mitry-Claye) and the other goes towards the other end of the line : Saint-R√©my-l√®s-Chevreuse. The trains arrive generally at 15-minute intervals.

It can also indicate that a woman is considered unlikely to ever marry. The term originally denoted a woman whose occupation was to spin. A synonymous but more pejorative term is old maid.\\"Spinster\\". WordReference.com. Retrieved 2 April 2016. The closest equivalent term for males is \\"bachelor\\" or \\"confirmed bachelor\\", but this generally does not carry the same pejorative connotations in reference to age and perceived desirability in marriage. Etymology and history The Spinner by William-Adolphe Bouguereau shows a woman hand-spinning using a drop spindle. Fibers to be spun are bound to a distaff held in her left hand. Long before the Industrial Age, \\"spinster\\" denoted girls and women who spun wool. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, spinning was \\"commonly done by unmarried women, hence the word came to denote\\" an unmarried woman in legal documents from the 1600s to the early 1900s, and \\"by 1719 was being used generically for 'woman still unmarried and beyond the usual age for it'\\". As a denotation for unmarried women in a legal context, the term dates back to at least 1699, and was commonly used in banns of marriage of the Church of England where the prospective bride was described as a \\"spinster of this parish\\". The Oxford American Dictionary tags \\"spinster\\" (meaning \\"...unmarried woman, typically an older woman beyond the usual age for marriage\\") as \\"derogatory\\" and \\"a good example of the way in which a word acquires strong connotations to the extent that it can no longer be used in a neutral sense.\\" The 1828 and 1913 editions of Merriam Webster's Dictionary defined spinster in two ways: By the 1800s, the term had evolved to include women who chose not to marry. During that century middle-class spinsters, as well as their married peers, took ideals of love and marriage very seriously, and spinsterhood was indeed often a consequence of their adherence to those ideals. They remained unmarried not because of individual shortcomings but because they didn't find the one \\"who could be all things to the heart\\". One 19th-century editorial in the fashion publication Peterson's Magazine encouraged women to remain choosy in selecting a mate ‚Äî even at the price of never marrying. The editorial, titled \\"Honorable Often to Be an Old Maid\\", advised women: \\"Marry for a home! Marry to escape the ridicule of being called an old maid? How dare you, then, pervert the most sacred institution of the Almighty, by becoming the wife of a man for whom you can feel no emotions of love, or respect even?\\" Current use The Oxford American English Dictionary defines spinster as \\"an unmarried woman, typically an older woman beyond the usual age for marriage\\". It adds: \\"In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply 'unmarried woman'; as such, it is a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed.\\" Currently, Merriam-Webster's Dictionary defines the \\"unmarried woman\\" sense of the term in three ways: (1) an archaic usage meaning \\"an unmarried woman of gentle family\\", (2) a meaning related to (1) but not tagged as archaic: \\"an unmarried woman and especially one past the common age for marrying\\" and (3) \\"a woman who seems unlikely to marry\\". Dictionary.com describes the \\"woman still unmarried beyond the usual age of marrying\\" sense of the term as \\"Disparaging and Offensive\\". A usage note goes on to say that this sense \\"is ... perceived as insulting. It implies negative qualities such as being fussy or undesirable\\". Also included is a sense of the word used specifically in a legal context: \\"a woman who has never married\\". Wordreference.com describes the \\"woman still unmarried\\" sense of spinster as \\"dated\\".\\"Spinster\\". WordReference.com. Retrieved 19 October 2016. Age is a crucial part of the definition, according to Robin Lakoff's explanation in Language and Woman's Place: \\"If someone is a spinster, by implication she is not eligible [to marry]; she has had her chance, and been passed by. Hence, a girl of twenty cannot be properly called a spinster: she still has a chance to be married\\". Yet other sources on terms describing a never-married woman indicate that the term applies to a woman as soon as she is of legal age or age of majority (see bachelorette, single). The title \\"spinster\\" has been embraced by feminists like Sheila Jeffreys, whose book The Spinster and Her Enemies (1985) defines spinsters simply as women who have chosen to reject sexual relationships with men. In her 2015 book, Spinster, Making a Life of One's Own, Kate Bolick has written, \\"To me, the spinster is self-reliant and inscrutable. We think we know what the wife is up to and what the mother is up to but the single woman is mysterious. I like that mystery. So the term is a useful way to hold onto the idea of autonomy that can get so easily lost inside of marriage or motherhood\\".Bielski, Zosia (7 May 2015). \\"In her new book, Kate Bolick argues why there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a 'spinster'\\". The Globe and Mail. In 2005, in England and Wales, the term was abolished in favour of \\"single\\" for the purpose of marriage registration. In the United States, \\"spinster\\" is the legal term used to refer to a woman who has never married, just as the male counterpart of \\"bachelor\\" refers to a man who has never married. Once men and women are married, they can never revert to the state of \\"never married\\". These legal terms bear no other connotations. Research A 2009 University of Missouri study of 32 women found that modern spinsters feel a social stigma attached to their status and a sense of both heightened visibility and invisibility. \\"Heightened visibility came from feelings of exposure and invisibility came from assumptions made by others\\". Reasons women do not marry Women may not marry for a variety (and/or combination) of reasons, including personal inclination, a dearth of eligible men (whose numbers can decrease dramatically during wartime), and socio- economic conditions (that is, the availability of livelihoods for women). Writer and spinster Louisa May Alcott famously wrote that \\"liberty is a better husband than love to many of us\\". Social status issues could also arise where it was unacceptable for a woman to marry below her social rank but her parents lacked the funds to support a marriage within their social rank. In the early 19th century, particularly in England, women would fall under Coverture, stating that all property and contracts in their name would be ceded to their husbands. This was particularly common in women who owned businesses. The First World War prevented many within a generation of women from experiencing romance and marriage or having children. In modern peacetime societies with wide opportunities for romance, marriage and children, there are other reasons that women remain single as they approach old age. Psychologist Erik Erikson postulated that during young adulthood (ages 18 to 39), individuals experience an inner conflict between a desire for intimacy (i.e., a committed relationship leading to marriage) and a desire for isolation (i.e., fear of commitment). Other reasons women may choose not to marry include a focus on career, a desire for an independent life, economic considerations, or an unwillingness to make the compromises expected in a marriage. Some writers have suggested that to understand why women do not marry, one should examine reasons women do marry and why it may be assumed they should marry in the first place. According to Adrienne Rich, \\"Women have married because it was necessary, in order to economically, in order to have children who would not suffer economic deprivation or social ostracism, in order to remain respectable, in order to do what was expected of women because coming out of 'abnormal' childhoods they wanted to feel 'normal', and because heterosexual romance has been represented as the great female adventure, duty, and fulfillment\\".\\"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence.\\" Signs, Vol. 5, No. 4, Women: Sex and Sexuality. (Summer, 1980), pp. 631‚Äì660. Popular culture Spinsters have been a focus of attention from the media and mainstream culture for centuries. They are called \\"aanissat\\" in Arabic, \\"spinsters\\" or \\"old maids\\" in English, \\"vieilles filles\\" in French, \\"zitelle\\" in Italian, \\"alte Jungfer\\" in German, \\"stara panna\\" in Polish or \\"dakhtar torsheedeh\\" in Persian.Flah, Loubna (18 August 2012). \\"'Bayrat' or 'Spinsters', Single Women Trapped in Social Stigma\\". Morocco World News. =Events= In Australia, parties are held for young single people to meet and socialize (particularly in the rural areas). These events are known as Bachelor and Spinster Balls or colloquially \\"B and S Balls\\". There is also a philanthropic group of women between the ages of 21 and 35 called the Spinsters of San Francisco who organize events. =Media= By the 2010s, interest developed in this word as a form of reappropriation from third-wave feminists. Recent examples include several blogs/videos, such as reclaimingthepejorative, a Bitch Magazine article, and the Spinster House YouTube channel. Film Many classic and modern films have depicted stereotypical spinster characters. For example: *In the classic Now, Voyager (1942), Bette Davis portrayed Charlotte Vale, an unattractive, overweight, repressed spinster whose life is dominated by her dictatorial mother, an aristocratic Boston dowager whose verbal and emotional abuse of her daughter has contributed to the woman's complete lack of self-confidence. *Bette Davis played another spinster named Charlotte in Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). *Katharine Hepburn specialized in playing spinsters in the 1950s, such as Rosie in The African Queen (1951), Jane Hudson in Summertime (1955), and Lizzie in The Rainmaker (1956). *The fictional character Bridget Jones often refers to herself as a spinster in the film Bridget Jones's Diary (film) (2001). *The documentary Cat Ladies (2009) spins a tale of four spinsters whose lives have become dedicated to their cats.Cat Ladies *Maureen O'Hara played Mary Kate Danaher in The Quiet Man (1952) *In The Great Train Robbery (1978), Edward Pierce's (Sean Connery) courting of Edgar Trent's plain spinster daughter Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd) is a plot point regarding Pierce's acquisition of the first of four keys needed for the heist. Literature In both The Taming of the Shrew (early 1590s) and Much Ado About Nothing (late 1590s), William Shakespeare referred to a contemporary saying that it was the fate of women who died unmarried to lead apes into hell. By the time of the British Regency, ape leader had become a slang term for an old maid. It is often used in that context in Regency romances and other literature set in that period. The word thornbacks was used to refer to old maids in Peter Anthony Motteux's 1694 English translation of Fran√ßois Rabelais' 16th century novels Gargantua and Pantagruel. In one of the earliest examples of autobiographical writing in English, John Dunton wrote in 1705 that unmarried women in Boston were called thornbacks at the age of thirty. A thornback (Raja clavata) is a commonly eaten species of ray fish, the female young of which were called maids, and in Scotland maiden-skates. The books Washington Square and The Heiress have old maid heroines who ultimately choose to remain spinsters and embrace the freedom of not having to enter marriage. One stereotype of spinsters that appears in literature is that they are downtrodden or spineless women who were victims of an oppressive parent. This stereotype is played out in William Faulkner's classic short story \\"A Rose for Emily\\" (1930), in which Emily's father is confident that no man is worthy of his daughter's hand in marriage. Other stereotypes include women who were relegated to lifetime roles as family caretaker for their family of origin or for a married sibling's children, \\"poor relations\\" who would work \\"to earn their keep\\" as nannies or unpaid domestics. For example, being a governess was the fate expected by the rejected titular orphan in Charlotte Bront√´'s novel Jane Eyre (1847); Eyre retained that status until the man she loved was widowed and available. A common theme in the fiction writings of author/poet Sandra Cisneros is marital disillusionment; for example. in the poem \\"Old Maids\\" (1994). In the Charles Dickens' classic Great Expectations, the primary antagonist is Miss Havisham, a spinster embittered by being defrauded and abandoned on her wedding day; an event that shaped the rest of her life, and by extension, those around her. Another stereotype of the spinster that has appeared in literature is the quick-witted and sometimes quick-tempered independent woman, who has remained unmarried by choice, as in \\"Spinster Thurber's Carpet\\" (1897), Pauline Phelps's popular short story and play about an unmarried woman who decides during the Revolutionary War that she'd rather have a carpet than a husband.Phelps, Pauline, Spinster Thurber's Carpet, Peterson's Magazine, 1897 The popular and shrewdly intelligent detective Miss Marple was a spinster heroine in Agatha Christie's series of crime novels, which later became a television series. In Jane Austen's Emma, the character Miss Bates is a spinster and Austen (who never married) gives her stereotypical negative characteristics such as garrulousness. Music The Kingston Trio's \\"Take Her Out of Pity\\", included on their 1961 album Close-Up, is based on the traditional American folk song, \\"The Old Maid's Song\\". Bob Dylan's song \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" (1963) tells the true story of a murder at a spinsters' ball in Baltimore in 1963. Paul McCartney, while in the Beatles, composed the hit song \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (1966) about the loneliness and death of a spinster (though he never used the term in the lyrics). The country song \\"Delta Dawn\\", made famous by Tanya Tucker, overviews the plight of a woman focused on a single lost love, destined to go unmarried unless the lover returns. Television Tina Fey's portrayal of her character Liz Lemon, on the hit NBC series 30 Rock, exemplifies another classic spinster stereotype. Lemon, a 40-something single woman whose relationships never seem to work out, has unrealistically high expectations for a male partner: her dream husband is the archetypal \\"Astronaut Mike Dexter\\", and for much of the series her character is holding out on settling on a man until she can score an astronaut. =Other uses= Unpopped popcorn kernels have been dubbed \\"old maids\\" in popular slang, since like unmarried women who never had children, the kernels do not \\"pop\\".

It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ‚áí denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party. Background Liberals became active since 1860 in Dalmatia and since 1904 in the rest of Croatia. It never became a major political party. History After the restoration of democracy in 1989 liberalism became very divided. At the moment (August, 2017) one could distinguish five parties: the right of center Croatian Social Liberal Party (Hrvatska socijalno-liberalna stranka, member LI, ELDR), two center liberal parties: Croatian People's Party-Liberal Democrats (Hrvatska narodna stranka - liberalni demokrati, observer LI, member ELDR) and People's Party - Reformists (Narodna stranka ‚Äì reformisti, member EDP), while left of center is Civic Liberal Alliance (Graƒëansko-liberalni savez, GLAS).

A last is a mechanical form shaped like a human foot. It is used by shoemakers and cordwainers in the manufacture and repair of shoes. Lasts typically come in pairs and have been made from various materials, including hardwoods, cast iron, and high-density plastics.  Production  Shelf with lasts in a shoemaker's workshop in Hamburg Lasts come in many styles and sizes, depending on the exact job they are designed for. Common variations include simple one-size lasts used for repairing soles and heels, durable lasts used in modern mass production, and custom-made lasts used in the making of bespoke footwear. Though a last is made approximately in the shape of a human foot, the precise shape is tailored to the kind of footwear being made. For example, a boot last would be designed to hug the instep for a close fit. Modern last shapes are typically designed using dedicated computer-aided design software. Historically, lasts were typically made from hardwoods and cast iron because these materials retain their shape, even when in contact with wet materials (like leather) and subjected to the mechanical stresses of stretching and shaping shoes on them. Today, wooden lasts are generally used only for bespoke shoemaking, particularly in Europe and North America. The materials used in modern lasts must be strong enough to withstand the forces of mass production machinery, such as that applied by pullover machines when bottoming the shoe, and must also be able to hold tacks (known as \\"lasting tacks\\"), which are used to hold shoe parts together temporarily before the sole is added. Although hardwoods satisfy these criteria, modern lasts, especially those used by mass production factories in places such as China, are often made from high-density polyethylene plastic (HMW-HDPE), which allows for many tack holes before needing repair. Such plastics also have the benefit that they can be recycled and remoulded when they wear out.  Custom lasts  Cordwainers, or bespoke shoemakers, often use lasts that are specifically designed to the proportions of individual customers' feet. Made from various modern materials, they don't need to withstand the pressures of mass production machinery, but they must be able to handle constant tacking and pinning, and the wet environment associated with stretching and shaping materials such as leather.

It was renamed as the Club Sportif MAA or just MAA (Montreal MAA) in 1999 after a brush with bankruptcy, but is still widely known as the MAAA. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the MAA was one of the most important sporting institutions in Canada, and North America, with affiliated teams winning ice hockey's Stanley Cup and Canadian football's Grey Cup. Mr. McLeod, Bicycle Club, Montreal, QC, 1885 History The Montreal Amateur Athletic Association came into existence June 1881 and began as a confederation of three sporting clubs: The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, The Montreal Bicycle Club, and The Montreal Lacrosse Club. These founding clubs shared the club space of the Montreal Gymnasium, located at Mansfield Street and de Maisonneuve Boulevard. In the 1880s, the MAAA organized the famous annual Montreal Winter Carnival. The Winter Carnival featured a temporary \\"ice castle\\" or \\"ice fort\\", which would be \\"stormed\\" in a mock attack, as well as several events, such as snowshoe races, toboggan slides, skating carnivals and ice hockey tournaments. The Sir Vincent Meredith Trophy was awarded to the best all-round athlete in the MAAA. The current clubhouse was opened in 1905, on Peel Street in downtown Montreal, in the current commercial district. Due to problems with an aging population, the club switched from being solely member-financed during the revival of 1999. The high taxes on the clubhouse property in central Montreal exacerbated their problems. Historic teams =Ice hockey= The Montreal Hockey Club as the first Stanley Cup champions The Montreal Hockey Club (MHC) was an ice hockey team that played in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) 1886‚Äì1898, the Canadian Amateur Hockey League 1898‚Äì1905 and the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association 1905‚Äì1908, the Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union from 1908 afterward. The team won the AHAC title from 1888 until 1894, and won the Canadian Amateur Hockey League title in 1902. It was the first club to be presented with the Stanley Cup, in 1893. They won again in 1894, March 1902 and February 1903. The 1902 team was known as the \\"Little Men of Iron\\". After the 1903 season, players from the team formed the core of the Montreal Wanderers professional club, who took on the \\"Little Men\\" nickname. After withdrawing from play with professional teams, the MHC club continued as an amateur club after 1908, winning the Allan Cup in 1930. The club eventually became the Montreal Royals ice hockey team.

It was the final version of the series of aircraft that began with the Caproni Ca.1 in 1914. Development By late World War I, developments in aircraft technology made older bomber designs unable to penetrate targets defended by modern fighters. Caproni's response to this problem was to significantly uprate the power on the existing Ca.3 design, with some versions of the Ca.5 eventually carrying engines with nearly five times the total power that the first Ca.1 had. Apart from greater power, various refinements were made to the design, including modifications to the main nacelle and undercarriage, and completely new wings. The first prototype flew in late 1917 and the type remained in production until 1921. Some 659 of all versions were built by Caproni, and another three were licence-built in the US (two Ca.44s by Standard, and one Ca.46 by Fisher). Planned licensed production in France was cancelled with the end of the war. During the war, Caproni designated these aircraft according to the total power of their engines. Afterwards, the company redesignated them. Description The Ca.5 was a three-engine biplane of a wooden construction, covered with fabric. The crew of four was placed in an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, standing upon the central engine in a protective \\"cage\\", just before a propeller. Armament consisted of two to four Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns, one on a front ring mount and one, two or sometimes even three on an upper ring mount. Bombs were suspended under the hull. Variants * Ca.44 - main production version, originally powered by three Fiat A.12 engines of 149 kW (200 hp) each, hence the name Caproni 600 hp. Later, the A-12bis was used, and aircraft so equipped were known as Caproni 600/900 hps * Ca.45 - variant selected for French service, powered by three Isotta Fraschini V.6s of 186 kW (250 hp) each. (Caproni 600/750 hp, or simply Caproni 750 hp) * Ca.46 - late- war variant with three 269 kW (360 hp) Liberty engines. * Ca.47 - (or I.Ca) seaplane version of Ca.44 (ten built) * Ca.50 - Ca.44s modified as air ambulances * Ca.57 - (or Breda M-1) - airliner conversion of war-surplus Ca.44s.

Now written and drawn by Gately's nephew, Peter Gallagher, it is distributed to over 1,000 newspapers by Creators Syndicate, who took over the comic from McNaught Syndicate in 1988. The strip is usually presented in single-panel gag frames on weekdays. On Sundays, though, the strip is expanded to multiple panels and titled Sunday with Heathcliff. A regular feature in the Sunday strips is Kitty Korner, where unusual cats in the real world are described. Heathcliff daily comics can be currently read online on GoComics. Setting Writer/artist Peter Gallagher at the 2015 East Coast Comicon in Secaucus, New Jersey The strip takes place in a port town called Westfinster. Heathcliff as seen in the strip is predisposed to annoying Mr. Schultz, the manager of the local fish store, called the Elite Fish Market; tipping over, and much more often somersaulting garbage cans into the air, to the annoyance of the local sanitation workers; annoying the milkman to get milk (usually by tricking them into dropping a milk bottle or two); bothering the hard-working sailors who work on the Tuna Fleet; harassing and abusing the dog population; being an informant to the local Dog Catchers; and pursuing female cats. His girlfriend is a girl cat named Sonja; but he has been the target of unrequited affection by another female cat named Crazy Shirley. Sonja's owner, Herb Jablonski, sees Heathcliff as a nuisance, especially when he brings Sonja home late; but his wife sees Heathcliff as a cat who truly loves Sonja and treats her like a queen, and is often pointing out Heathcliff's gallantry to her oblivious husband. While Sonja is showered with gifts and adoration by Heathcliff, Mrs. Jablonski drops not so subtle hints to Herb, who doesn't take them seriously. Heathcliff is also involved in an occasionally difficult relationship with Mr. Nutmeg, the moustached owner of the house he lives in. He is, however, loved by the young grandson, Iggy, whom he sees as his friend and owner (although he too can be annoyed with him, especially when Heathcliff hides his trombone); and Mrs. Nutmeg, Iggy's grandmother, overindulges him. He is also a friend of Iggy's playmates Willy, Iggy's brainy best friend; and Marcy, a neighborhood girl whom Heathcliff (dressed in baby clothes) has played play doll carriage with. Another character is Muggsy Faber, Westfinster's local bully and his bulldog, Spike, whom Heathcliff usually (and very easily) outwits. Another dog named Chauncey, unlike Spike, is friendly and lovable, and constantly licks Heathcliff's face. An occasional visitor is Heathcliff's father Pops Heathcliff who wears a black and white striped prison uniform. In other media =Comic books= Starting in 1985, Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, began producing comic books titled Heathcliff. The series ran for 56 issues, changing to the Marvel Comics brand with issue #23. Star Comics added an additional spin-off title in 1987 called Heathcliff's Funhouse (which also switched over to Marvel with issue #6). It was a combination of new material and reprinted stories that first appeared in the original Heathcliff title. In the comics, Heathcliff had a far better relationship with Mr. Nutmeg, and much of his adventures were done with Mr. Nutmeg's grandson. Heathcliff's reputation for adventurism was even noted by the local police, who recruited him for a sting operation against a gang of cats stealing purses, in exchange for them forgiving the fact Heathcliff swiped shellfish, of course. * Heathcliff (56 issues, Star/Marvel) * Heathcliff Annual (1 issue, Star) * Heathcliff's Funhouse (10 issues, Star/Marvel) * Heathcliff Spring Special (1 issue, Marvel UK) * Star Comics Presents: Heathcliff (1 issue, ashcan) * Star Comics Magazine (AKA Star Comics Digest) (13 issues, Star) =Animated series= Two animated TV series based on the strip, both simply named Heathcliff, were created. Although Heathcliff did not speak in the comic strip, both animated versions were voiced by Mel Blanc. Heathcliff was one of the last original characters Blanc would voice before his death in 1989. The first Heathcliff was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions and debuted in 1980. The first season featured segments with Dingbat and the Creeps (Dingbat is the vampire dog (Frank Welker) accompanied by Spare Rib the skeleton and Nobody the jack-o-lantern who were both voiced by Don Messick), which were created by Ruby-Spears for the show, and the second season featured fellow comic strip character Marmaduke (voiced by Paul Winchell). This version is sometimes seen on Boomerang. In 1984, the second Heathcliff debuted, which was produced by DiC Entertainment. This series featured segments with the Catillac Cats (AKA Cats and Co. by the end credits of the show), which is why this version is sometimes referred to as Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats. In 2005, Shout! Factory released a Volume 1 DVD for the show, featuring the first 24 episodes of the series. Since then Mill Creek Entertainment has gained the license and released the show on DVD, with a ten-episode 'best of' compilation entitled 'King of the Beasts' and two volumes that cover Season 1, volume 1 contains 32 episodes, while volume 2 has the remaining 33. =Film= In 1986, Heathcliff: The Movie debuted in theaters. It was an anthology film, which consisted of seven episodes from the 1984 series. The film was released on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1988. In the 2007 Argentine-Italian film Noah's Ark, Heathcliff made a cameo along with the other animals by Noah's attention. Additionally a CGI animated film has been in development for many years.

The effect was also noticeable on MSX software and in some Commodore 64 titles. Workarounds to prevent this limit from becoming apparent have since been considered an element of Spectrum programmer culture. This problem also happens with the \\"semigraphic modes\\" (text modes with graphics features) of the Color Computer and Dragon, but those computers also have non-attributed graphics and with better resolution. Several video game consoles of the era had such video modes that caused such limitations, but usually allowed more than two colours per tile: the NES (Famicom) had only one mode, which was also \\"semigraphic\\", and allowed four colours per 16√ó16 \\"block\\" (group of four 8√ó8 tile) but 16 per screen. The Super NES allowed 16 colours per tile but 256 per screen (among other improvements), and this made the artefact much harder to notice, if at all (except for those who had to program the device). Causes Attribute clash on the ZX Spectrum was caused by its idiosyncratic display memory layout, designed in such a way as to minimise memory use of the frame buffer, and optimise for text display instead of graphics. Rather than limit the colour palette to conserve memory, Sinclair's design stored pixel bitmap and colour information in separate areas of memory. While the bitmap specified the state of individual pixels (either on or off), the colour information (or \\"attributes\\") corresponded to the text character matrix‚Äî24 rows of 32 columns‚Äîwith one byte per 8x8 pixel character cell. This byte encoded two 3-bit values, known as INK (foreground colour) and PAPER (background colour) after the BASIC instructions used to define the colour values. Two other binary values were included in an attribute; a BRIGHT bit indicating one of two brightness levels for the two colours, and a FLASH bit, which, when set, caused the two colours to be swapped at regular intervals. This scheme provided 15 different colours: the eight combinations of red, green and blue at two brightness levels (except for black, which appeared the same at both brightness). Thus, each 8x8 pixel block could only contain 2 colours from the 15 available, which must both be from either the BRIGHT or non-BRIGHT halves of the palette. Trying to add a third colour in an 8x8 pixel area would overwrite one of the previous colours. The ZX Spectrum used 6144 bytes for the bit map, with one byte representing eight pixels, and used 768 bytes for the colour attributes. This gives a total of 6912 bytes for the entire graphics display, a relatively small total for a computer of the Spectrum's era with \\"colour\\" capabilities. This graphics architecture was retained right through to Sinclair and Amstrad's later redesigns of the Spectrum, up until Amstrad's final model, the ZX Spectrum +3, despite subsequent models having contained 128 KiB of RAM, reducing the need to save memory in this manner. The architecture was retained to prevent loss of backward compatibility. Attributes were used by a variety of other computers and consoles, including the Commodore 64, the MSX and NES, although the size of the attribute blocks and the number of colours per block varied. However, with the use of hardware sprites, attribute clash could be avoided. The Thomson MO5 and TO7 microcomputers, the Oric 1, the MSX 1 architecture, and other systems based on the Texas Instruments TMS9918 video display controller display a very similar constraint: for each group of eight pixels horizontally, only two colours out of 16 are available. giving a similar but less severe effect than with the Spectrum. The MSX 1 did not have just one single colour attribute byte available for a whole 8x8 pixel area, as was the case with the Sinclair Spectrum, but eight, with one attribute byte for each 8√ó1 pixel group. Thus, while the Spectrum was limited to one colour pair for a square area of 8x8 pixels, the MSX 1 was only limited to one colour pair for a \\"line\\" of eight adjacent pixels. In addition MSX1 could use sprites which were not bound to any attribute clash problems (although MSX 1 sprites did have their own limitations, such as being monochrome). In practice this technical advantage often did not help MSX 1 systems to produce better pictures. The problem for the MSX 1 was that many European software companies who converted Spectrum games to MSX 1 ignored all the improvements the MSX 1 had over the Spectrum, and thus the resulting MSX 1 versions had the same amount of attribute clash as the original Spectrum games. (Jack the Nipper II: In Coconut Capers is one example of this.) To ease conversion, the software developers simply copied the single attribute byte value of the Spectrum to all eight corresponding attribute bytes of the MSX 1. For the same reason, the software companies also ignored the sprite capabilities of the MSX 1, and because the video display capabilities were otherwise quite similar (256√ó192 resolution, 16 colours), both systems produced virtually identical displays for the same game. In contrast, Japanese MSX 1 games did use all the capabilities of MSX 1, often resulting in better looking games. Effects To avoid attribute clash, static graphic displays had to be constructed with care. Finely-detailed colour graphics were impossible, as colour could only be applied in 8√ó8 pixel blocks. Careful design could achieve impressive results, as could synchronising colour changes to the refresh rate of the display‚Äîusually a television set. However, animated displays were more difficult‚Äîa distinct drawback in a machine whose primary use was playing video games. If just one pixel in an 8√ó8 block was recoloured because a moving part of the display touched it, the entire block would change colour. Thus detailed moving graphics caused large ugly fringes of rapidly changing colours to follow them around. Workarounds Early software simply ignored the problem. Later, the standard workaround was to use colour for static display elements‚Äîsuch as a decorative border around the edges of the screen, which might include score displays and so on, or some form of instrumentation‚Äîwith a smaller central monochrome area containing all the animated graphics. This also made graphics faster, as less of the screen had to be updated‚Äîboth a smaller region, plus only changing pixel information and leaving the colour area untouched. Some late Spectrum software, such as FTL's Light Force, used extremely careful graphics design to achieve full-colour moving graphics, essentially by limiting both the design of the onscreen elements and their paths of motion to 8√ó8 colour resolution boundaries. The moving elements were thus relatively large and rather blocky or squarish, and their movement was constrained, but this was not visually obvious and the sight of moving full- colour graphics was hugely impressive to Spectrum owners. No mainstream developers were able to find a suitable all-round fix for the attribute clash problem, instead preferring to use the monochrome graphics method when fast, clear graphics were needed, and full-colour graphics when the situation permitted. It was possible by paying careful attention to timing to modify the attribute area of RAM at certain specific times as the display was drawn - let the display hardware draw one line of the display, then change the attribute RAM before the next line is drawn to give the effect of different attributes for each individual line. These changes had to be done in software and were time-consuming to program, meaning that this technique was usually limited to special effects. This technique was also very popular in the demoscene. The problem and solutions Most games before 1987 ignored attribute clash. Some later games, such as Knight Tyme and Three Weeks in Paradise allowed players to select between two modes of attribute clash: one which ignored main character attributes, blending the character into the background and vice versa, prioritising the characters colour scheme over the background imagery. Another workaround was to simply render the graphics in two colours, otherwise known as monochrome, as done with the Spectrum version of Knight Lore in 1984. Many games used full-colour backgrounds and \\"character scrolling\\" (where the environment was scrolled eight pixels at a time), but monochrome sprites that were effectively transparent, as in Double Dragon, were drawn in such a way so they stand out, avoiding dependence on colour. Many games used this method with smooth pixel-by-pixel scrolling, but the attribute clash as elements of one character block were \\"passed\\" to the next were clearly visible. A prominent (and less successful) example of the use of full-colour graphics was the Spectrum conversion of Altered Beast. The game suffers from considerable attribute clash. Programmer Don Priestley developed a distinctive style for several of his games by using large, cartoon-like sprites which were carefully designed to span whole character blocks without appearing unduly square. A disadvantage of this technique was that the gameplay had to be designed around the graphics, and so it was not useful for ports from other platforms. Games that used this technique included Popeye, The Trap Door, Through the Trapdoor, and Flunky. Other developers who used a similar technique included Mike Singleton, with Dark Sceptre, and Gang of Five, with Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future. In 1994 programmer Igor Maznitsa developed a multi-CPU concept platform \\"ZX-Poly\\" based on ZX-Spectrum-128, the platform allows to avoid attribute clash and even colourise many old games without changes in executable code.

Hieros gamos or Hierogamy (Greek , \\"holy marriage\\") is a sacred marriage that plays out between a god and a goddess, especially when enacted in a symbolic ritual where human participants represent the deities. The notion of hieros gamos does not always presuppose literal sexual intercourse in ritual, but is also used in purely symbolic or mythological context, notably in alchemy and hence in Jungian psychology. Hieros gamos is described as the prototype of fertility rituals. Ancient Near East Sacred sexual intercourse is thought to have been common in the Ancient Near EastJames Frazer (1922), The Golden Bough, 3e, Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus as a form of \\"Sacred Marriage\\" or hieros gamos between the kings of a Sumerian city-states and the High Priestesses of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of love, fertility and warfare. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there were many shrines and temples dedicated to Inanna. The temple of Eanna, meaning \\"house of heaven\\"√©-an-na = sanctuary ('house' + 'Heaven'[='An'] + genitive) [John Halloran's Sumerian Lexicon v. 3.0 -- see link below] in Urukmodern-day Warka, Biblical Erech was the greatest of these. The temple housed Nadƒ´tu, priestesses of the goddess. The high priestess would choose for her bed a young man who represented the shepherd Dumuzid, consort of Inanna, in a hieros gamos celebrated during the annual Duku ceremony, just before Invisible Moon, with the autumn Equinox (Autumnal Zag-mu Festival). Greek mythology In Greek mythology, the classic instance is the wedding of Zeus and Hera celebrated at the Heraion of Samos,Walter Burkert warns that \\"the Hera festival is much too complicated to be understood simply as Hera's wedding\\" (Burkert, Greek Religion, J. Raffan, tr. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985) ¬ßII.7.7 \\"Sacred Marriage\\" 108., along with its architectural and cultural predecessors. Some scholarsFor example 'H. Sauer, in Der Kleine Pauly, s.v. would restrict the term to reenactments, but most accept its extension to real or simulated union in the promotion of fertility: such an ancient union of Demeter with Iasion, enacted in a thrice-ploughed furrow, a primitive aspect of a sexually-active Demeter reported by Hesiod,Hesiod, Theogony 969f. occurred in Crete, origin of much early Greek myth. In actual cultus, Walter Burkert found the Greek evidence \\"scanty and unclear\\": \\"To what extent such a sacred marriage was not just a way of viewing nature, but an act expressed or hinted at in ritual is difficult to say\\"Burkert 1985:108.. The best-known ritual example surviving in classical Greece is the hieros gamos enacted at the Anthesteria by the wife of the Archon basileus, the \\"Archon King\\" in Athens, originally therefore the queen of Athens, with Dionysus, presumably represented by his priest or the basileus himself, in the Boukoleion in the Agora.S.M. Kramer, The Sacred Marriage Rite (Bloomington:Indiana University Press, 1969); Karl Kerenyi, Zeus und Hera. Urbild des Vaters des Gatten und der Frau (Leiden:Brill 1972) 83-90. The brief fertilizing mystical union engenders Dionysus, and doubled unions, of a god and of a mortal man on one night, result, through telegony, in the semi-divine nature of Greek heroes such as Theseus and Heracles. Tantric Buddhism In Tantric Buddhism of Nepal, Bhutan, India and Tibet, yab-yum is a ritual of the male deity in union with a female deity as his consort. The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (') and skillful means (upƒÅya-kau≈õalya), and the female partner to 'insight' (praj√±ƒÅ).Keown, Damien. (2003). A Dictionary of Buddhism, p. 338. Oxford University Press. .\\"Yab Yum Iconography and the Role of Women in Tibetan Tantric Buddhism.\\" The Tibet Journal. Vol. XXII, No. 1. Spring 1997, pp. 12-34. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.The Marriage of Wisdom and Method By Marco Pallis Maithuna at Khajuraho Maithuna is a Sanskrit term used in Tantra most often translated as sexual union in a ritual context. It is the most important of the five makara and constitutes the main part of the Grand Ritual of Tantra variously known as Panchamakara, Panchatattva, and Tattva Chakra. The symbolism of union and polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realized by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body.

The hieros gamos is one of the themes that Carl Jung dealt with in his book Symbols of Transformation. Wicca In Wicca, the Great Rite is a ritual based on the Hieros Gamos. It is generally enacted symbolically by a dagger (known as an athame) being placed point first into a chalice, the action symbolizing the union of the male and female divine. In British Traditional Wicca, the Great Rite is sometimes carried out in actuality by the High Priest and High Priestess.

Serving in Poland and in Belarus, his name is closely linked to some of the most notorious crimes of the war. He also fought in World War I, the post-World War I conflicts, and the Spanish Civil War. He reportedly died after World War II while in Allied custody. According to Timothy Snyder, \\"in all the theaters of the Second World War, few could compete in cruelty with Dirlewanger\\". World War I Dirlewanger was born in W√ºrzburg. He enlisted in the Prussian Army in 1913 and served as a machine gunner in the \\"K√∂nig Karl\\" Grenadier Regiment 123, a part of the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps, on the Western Front of World War I, where he took part in the German invasion of Belgium and later fought in France. He received the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class, having been wounded six times, and finished the war with the rank of Lieutenant in charge of a company on the Eastern Front in southern Russia and Romania. At the cessation of hostilities the German units in Dirlewanger's area were ordered to be interned in Romania, but Dirlewanger disobeyed orders and led 600 men from his and other units back to Germany.Ingrao, p. 54 According to German biographer Knut Stang, the war was a contributing factor that determined Dirlewanger's later life and his \\"terror warfare\\" methods, as \\"his amoral personality, with his alcoholism and his sadistic sexual orientation, was additionally shattered by the front experiences of the First World War and its frenzied violence and barbarism.\\" Interwar period After the end of World War I, Dirlewanger, described in a police report as \\"a mentally unstable, violent fanatic and alcoholic, who had the habit of erupting into violence under the influence of drugs,\\"Longerich joined various Freikorps right-wing paramilitary militias and fought against German communists in Ruhr and Saxony, and against Polish nationalists in Upper Silesia. He participated in the suppression of the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 with the Freikorps in multiple German cities in 1920 and 1921. Later, he commanded an armed formation of students which was set up by him under the W√ºrttemberg \\"Highway Watch\\". On Easter Sunday 1921, Dirlewanger commanded an armoured train that moved towards Sangerhausen, which had been occupied by the Communist Party of Germany militia group of Max Hoelz in one of their raids intended to inspire worker uprisings. An attack by Dirlewanger failed, and the enemy militiamen succeeded in cutting off his force. After the latter was reinforced by pro- government troops during the night, the Communists withdrew from the town. During this operation, Dirlewanger was grazed on the head by a gunshot. After the Nazi Party gained power, Dirlewanger was celebrated as the town's \\"liberator from the Red terrorists\\" and received its honorary citizenship in 1935. Between his militant forays, he studied at the Goethe University Frankfurt and in 1922 obtained a doctorate in political science.Wistrich, Robert S. (2001). Who's Who of Nazi Germany: Dirlewanger, Oskar. Routledge, p. 44. . The following year, he joined the Nazi Party and its SA militia, and later also the SS. From 1928‚Äì1931 he was an executive director of a textile factory owned by a Jewish family in Erfurt where he renounced active service in the SA but financially donated to the SA, possibly obtaining the money by embezzling from his company.Ingrao, p. 63 Dirlewanger held various jobs, which included working at a bank and a knit-wear factory. In 1933 after the Nazi seizure of power, Dirlewanger was rewarded the office of director of the Heilbronn employment agency, a strategic post for local-level Nazi leaders. Dirlewanger was repeatedly convicted for illegal arms possession and embezzlement. In 1934, he was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment for the rape of a 14-year-old girl from the League of German Girls (BDM), as well as the illegal use of a government vehicle and damaging said vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Dirlewanger also lost his job, his doctor title and all military honours, and was expelled from the party. Soon after his release from the prison in Ludwigsburg, Dirlewanger was arrested again on similar charges for criminal recidivism. He was sent to the Welzheim concentration camp, either as what Stein feels was standard practice for deviant sexual offenders in Germany at the timeGeorge H. Stein (1984). The Waffen SS. Cornell University Press, p. 266. . or for creating a disturbance demanding the reversal of his criminal charges appearing before the Reich Chancellery.Ingrao, p. 71 Dirlewanger was released and reinstated in the general reserve of the SS following personal intervention of his wartime companion and local NSDAP cadre comrade Gottlob Berger, who was also a long- time personal friend of the SS chief Heinrich Himmler and had become the head of the SS Head Office (SS-Hauptamt, SS-HA). Dirlewanger next went to Spain, where he enlisted the Spanish Foreign Legion during the Spanish Civil War. Through Berger he transferred to the German Condor Legion where he served from 1936 to 1939 and was wounded three times. Following further intervention on his behalf by his patron Berger, he successfully petitioned to have his case reconsidered in light of his service in Spain. Dirlewanger was reinstated into the NSDAP, albeit with a higher party number (#1,098,716). His doctorate was also restored by the University of Frankfurt. World War II At the beginning of World War II, Dirlewanger volunteered for the Waffen-SS and received the rank of Obersturmf√ºhrer. He eventually became the commander of the so-called Dirlewanger Brigade (at first designated as a battalion, later expanded to a regiment and a brigade, and eventually a division), composed originally of a small group of former poachers along with soldiers of a more conventional background. It was believed that the excellent tracking and shooting skills of the poachers could be put to constructive use in the fight against partisans. Later, Dirlewanger's soldiers were mostly recruited among the ever-increasing groups of German convicted criminals (civilian and military) and concentration camp inmates, eventually including mental asylum patients, homosexuals, interned Romani people, and (at the end of the war) even political prisoners sentenced for their anti-Nazi beliefs and activities. The unit was assigned to security duties first in General Government (occupied Poland), where Dirlewanger served as an SS-TV commandant of a labour camp at Stary Dzik√≥w. The camp was the subject of an abuse investigation by the SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, who accused Dirlewanger of wanton acts of murder, corruption and Rassenschande or race defilement (Morgen consequently himself was reduced in rank and sent to the Eastern Front).Philip W. Blood, Hitler's Bandit Hunters: The SS and the Nazi Occupation of Europe According to Morgen, \\"Dirlewanger was a nuisance and a terror to the entire population. He repeatedly pillaged the ghetto in Lublin, extorting ransoms.\\" Atrocities committed by Dirlewanger included injecting strychnine into young Jewish female prisoners, previously undressed and whipped, to watch them convulse to death in front of him and his friends for entertainment.Richard Grunberger (1971). The 12-Year Reich: A Social History of Nazi Germany, 1933‚Äì1945. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. p. 104. . According to Raul Hilberg, this camp was where \\"one of the first instances that reference was made to the 'soap-making rumor\\".David Crowe (2004) Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind the List. Basic Books. p. 346. . According to the rumor, Dirlewanger \\"cut up Jewish women and boiled them with horse meat to make soap.\\" According to Peter Longerich, Dirlewanger's leadership \\"was characterized by continued alcohol abuse, looting, sadistic atrocities, rape, and murder‚Äîand his mentor Berger tolerated this behaviour, as did Himmler, who so urgently needed men such as the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger in his fight against 'subhumanity'.\\"Longerich, pp. 345‚Äì346 In his letter to Himmler, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Odilo Globocnik recommended Dirlewanger, who \\"in charge of the Jewish camp of Dzikow ... was an excellent leader.\\"Longerich, p. 831 During the Nuremberg Trials after the war, Berger said: \\"Now Dr. Dirlewanger was hardly a good boy. You can't say that. But he was a good soldier, and he had one big mistake that he didn't know when to stop drinking.\\"French L. MacLean (2007) Thanks God That's Gone to the Butcher: 2000 Quotes from Hitler's 1000-year Reich. Schiffer Publishing. p. 23. . In February 1942, the unit was assigned to \\"anti-bandit\\" operations (Bandenbek√§mpfung) in Belarus. In Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, Timothy Snyder wrote that \\"Dirlewanger's preferred method was to herd the local population inside a barn, set the barn on fire, and then shoot with machine guns anyone who tried to escape.\\"Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, page 241-242, 304 Rounded-up civilians would be also routinely used as human shields and marched over minefields. In Masters of Death, Richard Rhodes wrote that Dirlewanger and his force \\"raped and tortured young women and slaughtered Jews Einsatzgruppen-style in Byelorussia beginning in 1942.\\"Richard Rhodes, Masters of Death: The SS-Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust Snyder cautiously estimated that the Sonderkommando, by then regiment-sized, killed at least 30,000 Belarusian civilians. Himmler was well aware of Dirlewanger's reputation and record, but nonetheless awarded him the German Cross in Gold on 5 December 1943, in recognition of his unit's actions such as during Operation Cottbus (May‚ÄîJune 1943), during which Dirlewanger reported exterminating more than 14,000 \\"bandits\\". central Warsaw in 1944 In mid-1944, during the Operation Bagration, Dirlewanger's unit suffered heavy losses during fighting against Red Army regulars. It was then hastily rebuilt and reformed into a \\"storm brigade\\" and used in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. Historian Martin Windrow wrote that in summer of 1944 Dirlewanger led his \\"butchers, rapists and looters into action against the Warsaw Uprising, and quickly committed ... unspeakable crimes.\\"Martin Windrow (1984) The Waffen-SS. Osprey Publishing. p. 26. . In Warsaw, Dirlewanger participated in the Wola massacre, together with police units rounding up and shooting some 40,000 civilians, most of them in just two days. In the same Wola district, Dirlewanger burned three hospitals with patients inside, while the nurses were \\"whipped, gang-raped and finally hanged naked, together with the doctors\\" to the accompaniment of the popular song \\"In M√ºnchen steht ein Hofbr√§uhaus\\". Later, \\"they drank, raped and murdered their way through the Old Town, slaughtering civilians and fighters alike without distinction of age or sex.\\" In the Old Town ‚Äì where about 30,000 civilians were killed ‚Äì several thousand wounded in field hospitals overrun by the Germans were shot and set on fire with flamethrowers. SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, overall commander of the forces pacifying Warsaw ‚Äì and Dirlewanger's former superior officer in Belarus ‚Äì described Dirlewanger as having \\"a typical mercenary nature\\".Andrew Borowiec (2001) Destroy Warsaw!: Hitler's Punishment, Stalin's Revenge. the University of Michigan. p. 101. . In recognition of his work to crush the uprising and intimidate the population of the city, Dirlewanger received his final promotion, to the rank of SS- Oberf√ºhrer, on 15 August 1944. In October, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, recommended for it by his superior officer in Warsaw, SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer Heinz Reinefarth (after the war, Reinefarth lied about his role in Warsaw, even denying Dirlewanger had been under his command). Dirlewanger then led his men in joining the efforts to put down the Slovak National Uprising in October 1944, eventually being posted on front lines of Hungary and eastern Germany to fight against the advancing Red Army. In February 1945, the unit was expanded again and re-designated as an SS Grenadier division. That same month, Dirlewanger was shot in the chest while fighting against the Soviet forces near Guben in Brandenburg and sent to the rear. It was his twelfth and final injury in the war. On 22 April, he went into hiding. Dirlewanger is invariably described as an extremely cruel person by historians and researchers, including as \\"a psychopathic killer and child molester\\" by Steven Zaloga,Steven J. Zaloga (1982) The Polish Army 1939‚Äì45. Osprey. p. 25. . \\"violently sadistic\\" by Richard Rhodes, and \\"an expert in extermination and a devotee of sadism and necrophilia\\" by J. Bowyer Bell. . =Death= Dirlewanger was arrested on 1 June 1945 near the town of Altshausen in Upper Swabia by the French occupation zone authorities while he was wearing civilian clothes, using a false name and hiding in a remote hunting lodge. He was recognised by a former Jewish concentration camp inmate, and brought to a detention centre. He reportedly died around 5‚Äì7 June 1945 in a prison camp at Altshausen, probably as a result of ill treatment.

Hetzel) and science fiction writer. Grousset published under the pseudonyms of Andr√© Laurie, Philippe Daryl, Tiburce Moray and L√©opold Virey. Grousset was born in Corte, Corsica, and studied medicine before commencing a journalistic career. In 1869 he began working for the weekly newspaper La Marseillaise, writing pro- revolutionary articles. As a result of an attempt by Grousset to challenge Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte to a duel during 1870, Grousset's second, Victor Noir, was shot and killed by Bonaparte during a quarrel. Later the same year Grousset was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He was elected a member of the Paris Commune, becoming a member of its Executive Committee and Delegate for External Affairs. After the fall of the Commune, he was arrested and, in 1872, he was deported to New Caledonia. He escaped, and lived in Sydney, San Francisco, New York City and London, making a living by teaching French. He returned to France after the 1880 amnesty, becoming involved in literature and physical culture, but eventually returning to politics and, in 1893, becoming a Socialist Deputy for the 12th arrondissement of Paris. Like Jules Verne, he was another discovery of publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel. He \\"collaborated\\" with Verne on Les Cinq Cent Millions de la Begum (1879), L'√âtoile du Sud (1884) and L'√âpave du Cynthia (1885). Some scholars believe that these works were based on manuscripts written by Grousset and rewritten by Verne at Hetzel's request. One of Grousset's most interesting science fiction novels was Les Exil√©s de la Terre ‚Äì Selene-Company Limited (1887), probably one of the most fanciful cosmic tales of all times. In it, a consortium which intends to exploit the Moon‚Äôs mineral resources decides that, since our satellite is too far to be reached, it must be brought closer to the Earth. A Sudanese mountain composed of pure iron ore becomes the headquarters of the newly established Selene Company. Solar reflectors are used to provide the energy required to convert the mountain into a huge electro-magnet, with miles of cables wrapped around it. A spaceship-observatory is then built on top of the mountain. When the experiment begins, the mountain is ripped away from the Earth and catapulted to the Moon. There, the protagonists have various adventures and eventually return to Earth by re-energizing the mountain. Other notable works by Grousset published under the Laurie pseudonym include De New York √† Brest en Sept Heures [New York to Brest in Seven Hours] (1888), which predicted a transatlantic tunnel; Le Secret du Mage [The Secret of the Magician] (1890), in which evidence of an advanced prehistoric is discovered; Le Rubis du Grand Lama [The Ruby of the Great Lama] (1894), which features a steam-powered flying island; Atlantis (1895), which describes how the mythical kingdom has survived under a glass dome at the bottom of the sea near the Azores; Le Ma√Ætre de l'Ab√Æme [The Master of the Abyss] (1905), which features a revolutionary submarine, and finally Spiridon le Muet [Spiridon The Mute] (1907), a remarkable novel about a human-sized, intelligent ant. The character of Spiridon, depicted as a non-human alien, gifted with great knowledge, an insatiable scientific curiosity but no human feelings or emotions, the victim of mankind's petty jealousies and racial fears, is a striking departure from the Vernian influence that permeated the rest of Laurie's works.

CAID programs tend to provide designers with improved freedom of creativity compared to typical CAD tools. However a typical workflow may follow a simple design methodology as follows: * Creating sketches, using a stylus * Generating curves directly from the sketch * Generating surfaces directly from the curves The end result is generally a 3D model that represents the main intent of the designer had in mind for the physical product. Such models can then be saved in formats for more convenient exchange with others (such as OBJ for virtual viewing in 3D graphics programs) or manufacturing (such a STL to create a real-life model via a rapid prototyping machine). CAID helps the designer focus on the technical aspect of the design methodology rather than the sketching and modelling aspects, contributing to the selection of a better product proposal in less time. When product pre-requisites and parameters have been more completely defined, output from the CAID software can be imported into a CAD program for pre-production testing, adjustment, and generation of technical drawings and manufacturing data such as CNC tool-paths. CAID is far more conceptual and less technically focused than CAD. CAID programs tend to offer more tools that allow a designer to freely express themselves with more organic shapes and complex curves, whilst CAD software tends to be more focused on tools for the simple curves and straight lines more suitable for easy manufacturing. CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since initial 3D offerings in the 1970s, which were typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted output. Advances in programming and computer hardware,[21][22] notably solid modelling in the 1980s, have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.

Under traditional color theory, this set of primary colors was advocated by Moses Harris, Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, Johannes Itten and Josef Albers, and applied by countless artists and designers. The RYB color model underpinned the color curriculum of the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design and numerous art and design schools that were influenced by the Bauhaus, including the IIT Institute of Design (founded as the New Bauhaus), Black Mountain College, Design Department Yale University, the Shillito Design School, Sydney, and Parsons School of Design, New York. In this context, the term Primary color refers to three exemplar colors (red, yellow and blue) as opposed to specific pigments. As illustrated, in the RYB color model, red, yellow and blue are intermixed to create Secondary color segments of orange, green and purple; which in turn overlap to reveal a Tertiary color created from orange, green and purple: brown (not black). This set of primary colors emerged at a time when access to a large range of pigments was limited by availability and cost, and it encouraged artists and designers to explore the many nuances of color through mixing and intermixing a limited range of pigment colors. In art and design education, red, yellow and blue pigments were usually augmented with white and black pigments, enabling the creation of a larger gamut of color nuances including tints and shades. The RYB color model relates specifically to color in the form of paint and pigment application in art and design. Other common color models include the light model (RGB) and the printing ink CMY color model, the latter emerging in conjunction with the CMYK color model in the printing industry. History The 1613 RYB color scheme of Franciscus Aguilonius (Francisci Agvilonii), with primaries yellow (flavus), red (rubeus), and blue (caeruleus) arranged between white (albus) and black (niger), with orange (aureus), green (viridis), and purple (purpureus) as combinations of two primaries. Le Blon's 1725 description of mixing red, yellow, and blue paints or printing inks The first known instance of the RYB triad can be found in the work of Franciscus Aguilonius (1567‚Äì1617), although he did not arrange the colors in a wheel. Jacob Christoph Le Blon was the first to apply the RYB color model to printing, specifically mezzotint printing, and he used separate plates for each color: yellow, red and blue plus black to add shades and contrast. In 'Coloritto', Le Blon asserted that ‚Äúthe art of mixing colours‚Ä¶(in) painting can represent all visible objects with three colours: yellow, red and blue; for all colours can be composed of these three, which I call Primitive‚Äù. Le Blon added that red and yellow make orange; red and blue, make purple/violet; and blue and yellow make green (Le Blon, 1725, p6). In the 18th century, Moses Harris advocated that a multitude of colors can be created from three 'primitive' colors - red, yellow and blue. M√©rim√©e referred to \\"three simple colours (yellow, red and blue)\\" that can produce a large gamut of color nuances. \\"United in pairs, these three primitive colours give birth to three other colours as distinct and brilliant as their originals; thus, yellow mixed with red, gives orange; red and blue, violet, and green is obtained by mixing blue and yellow\\" (M√©rim√©e, 1839, p245). M√©rim√©e illustrated these color relationships with a simple diagram located between pages 244 and 245: Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique).De la peinture √† l‚Äôhuile : ou, Des proc√©d√©s mat√©riels employ√©s dans ce genre de peinture, depuis Hubert et Jean Van-Eyck jusqu‚Äô√† nos jours was published in 1830 and an English translation by W. B. Sarsfield Taylor was published in London in 1839. Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique), J. F. L M√©rim√©e (1830, 1839) Similar ideas about the creation of color using red, yellow and blue were discussed in Theory of Colours (1810) by the German poet, color theorist and government minister Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.Goethe, Theory of Colours, trans. Charles Lock Eastlake, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982. In The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul discussed the creation of numerous color nuances and his color theories were underpinned by the RYB color model. ‚Äì English translation by John Spanton Separate to the RYB color model, cyan, magenta, and yellow primary colors are associated with CMYK commonly used in the printing industry.

The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the title role. Claude Rains, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, Patric Knowles, Bela Lugosi, Evelyn Ankers, and Maria Ouspenskaya star in supporting roles. The title character has had a great deal of influence on Hollywood's depictions of the legend of the werewolf. The film is the second Universal Pictures werewolf film, preceded six years earlier by the less commercially successful Werewolf of London (1935). Lon Chaney Jr. would reprise his classic role as \\"The Wolf Man\\" in four sequels, beginning with Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man in 1943. Plot At some time in the early twentieth century, after learning of the death of his brother, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.) returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly, Wales to reconcile with his estranged father, Sir John Talbot (Claude Rains). While there, Larry becomes romantically interested in a local girl named Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), who runs an antique shop. As a pretext to converse with her, he purchases a silver-headed walking stick decorated with a wolf. Gwen tells him that it represents a werewolf (which she defines as a man who changes into a wolf \\"at certain times of the year.\\") Throughout the film, various villagers recite a poem, whenever the subject of werewolves comes up: :Even a man who is pure in heart, and says his prayers by night; :May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright. That night, Larry attempts to rescue Gwen's friend Jenny from what he believes to be a sudden wolf attack. He kills the beast with his new walking stick, but is bitten on the chest in the process. A gypsy fortuneteller named Maleva (Maria Ouspenskaya) reveals to Larry that the animal which bit him was actually her son Bela (Bela Lugosi) in the form of a wolf. She also reveals that Larry will transform into a wolf as well since he who is bitten by a werewolf and lives will turn into one himself. Talbot transforms into a wolf- like creature and stalks the village, first killing the local gravedigger. Talbot retains vague memories of being a werewolf and wanting to kill, and continually struggles to overcome his condition. He is finally bludgeoned to death by his father with his own silver walking stick after attacking Gwen. Sir John Talbot watches in horror as the dead werewolf transforms into his son's human form. Gwen notices as well and cries for her friend's condition as the local police arrive on the scene. Cast Promotional image featuring Evelyn Ankers and Lon Chaney Jr. Production Publicity photo of Chaney in full make-up. The poem, contrary to popular belief, was not an ancient legend, but was in fact an invention of screenwriter Siodmak. The poem is repeated in every subsequent film in which Talbot/The Wolf Man appears, with the exception of House of Dracula and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, and is also quoted in the later film Van Helsing, although many later films change the last line of the poem to \\"And the moon is full and bright\\". In episode 944 of Dark Shadows, Christopher Pennock (as Jeb Hawkes) recites this version of the poem. The original Wolf Man film does not make use of the idea that a werewolf is transformed under a full moon. Gwen's description and the poem imply that it happens when the wolfbane blooms in autumn. The first sequel, though, made explicit use of the full moon both visually and in the dialog, and also changed the poem to specify when the moon is full and bright. Presumably this is what popularized the full-moon connection in the 20th century. The sequel visually implies that the transformation occurs as a result of direct exposure to light from the full moon. Other fiction has assumed the transformation is an inescapable monthly occurrence and does not examine whether it is caused by light, tidal effects, or some cycle that happens to coincide with the moon's phases. =Special effects= In the original film, Chaney did not undergo an on-screen facial transformation from man to wolf, as featured in all sequels. The lap-dissolve progressive make-ups were seen only in the final ten minutes, and then discreetly. In the first transformation, Talbot removes his shoes and socks and it is his feet which are seen to grow hairy and become huge paws (courtesy of uncomfortable \\"boots\\" made of hard rubber, covered in yak hair). In the final scene, the werewolf does gradually return to Larry Talbot's human form through the standard technique. Stories about the make-up and transformation scenes have become legendary, and are mostly apocryphal. The transformation of Chaney from man into monster was certainly laborious. The series of makeups took five to six hours to apply, and an hour to remove.Vieira, p. 97 Jack Pierce had originally designed it for Henry Hull in Werewolf of London (1935) but Hull argued that the disguise made no sense within the plot, since two characters had to recognize \\"Dr. Glendon\\" even in his werewolf form. Pierce was ordered to design a second version which left more of Hull's face recognizable. Pierce then recycled his original design for the 1941 film. Chaney claimed he was forced to sit motionless for hours as the scenes were shot frame by frame. At times he claimed he was left to remain sitting while the crew broke for lunch and was also equivocal about using the bathroom. Chaney even went as far as saying special effects men drove tiny finishing nails into the skin on the sides of his hands so they would remain motionless during close ups. However, there may be some exaggeration involved - studio logs indicate during the filming of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) the entire crew, including Chaney took a two-hour break during the filming of a transformation and filmed the rest of the scene later that day (though the makeup for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein had been greatly redesigned and streamlined by Bud Westmore over the original Jack Pierce makeup). What really happened was a plaster mold was made to hold his head absolutely still as his image was photographed and his outline drawn on panes of glass in front of the camera. Chaney then went to makeup man Jack Pierce's department, where Pierce, using grease paint, a rubber snout appliance and a series of wigs, glued layers of yak hair to Chaney's face. Then Chaney would return to the set, line himself up using the panes of glass as reference and several feet of film were shot. Then Chaney would return to the make-up department, a new layer was applied, showing the transformation further along, then returned to the sound stage. This was done about a half- dozen times. Talbot's lap dissolve transformation on screen only took seconds, while Chaney's took almost ten hours. Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.81/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"A handsomely told tale with an affecting performance from Lon Chaney, Jr., The Wolf Man remains one of the classics of the Universal horror stable.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"One of the finest horror films ever made\\". In his review, Maltin praised the film's make-up effects, atmospheric music, and Chaney's performance. Home media In the early 1990s, MCA/Universal Home Video released The Wolf Man on VHS as part of the \\"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\\". In 1999, Universal released The Wolf Man on VHS and DVD as part of the \\"Classic Monster Collection\\", a series of releases of Universal Classic Monsters films. On April 27, 2004, Universal released The Wolf Man: The Legacy Collection on DVD as part of the \\"Universal Legacy Collection\\". This two-disc release includes The Wolf Man, along with Werewolf of London, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, and She-Wolf of London. In 2009, Universal digitally remastered and re-released The Wolf Man on DVD as a two-disc \\"Special Edition\\", as part of the \\"Universal Legacy Series\\". In 2012, The Wolf Man was released on Blu-ray as part of the Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection box set, which includes a total of nine films from the Universal Classic Monsters series. In 2013, The Wolf Man received a standalone Blu-ray release. In 2014, Universal released The Wolf Man: Complete Legacy Collection on DVD. This set contains seven films: The Wolf Man, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, The House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, Werewolf of London, and She-Wolf of London. In 2016, the seven-film Complete Legacy Collection was released on Blu-ray. That same year, The Wolf Man received a Walmart-exclusive Blu-ray release featuring a glow-in- the-dark cover. In September 2017, the film received a Best Buy-exclusive steelbook Blu-ray release with cover artwork by Alex Ross. On August 28, 2018, The Wolf Man was included in the Universal Classic Monsters: Complete 30-Film Collection Blu-ray box set. This box set also received a DVD release. In October 2018, the film was included as part of a limited edition Best Buy- exclusive Blu-ray set titled Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection, which features artwork by Alex Ross. Legacy The Wolf Man is the only Universal monster to be played by the same actor in all his 1940s film appearances. Lon Chaney Jr. was very proud of this, frequently stating in interviews, \\"He was my baby.\\"http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/584/ It is listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which stated that the film 'still remains the most recognizable and most cherished version of the [werewolf] myth'. The Wolf Man was not Universal's first werewolf film. It was preceded by Werewolf of London from 1935, starring noted character actor Henry Hull in a quite different and more subtle werewolf makeup. As noted previously, Hull objected to having his face entirely covered in latex and hair, and a less-hirsute, more devilish version was used in the film. The film was not a huge box office success, probably because audiences of the day thought it too similar in many ways to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, for which Fredric March had won an Oscar three years before. Some latter-day critics prefer Henry Hull's earlier werewolf to Chaney's, which was described in Carlos Clarens's book An Illustrated History of the Horror FIlm as \\"... looking like a hirsute Cossack.\\" The Wolf Man is one of three top-tier Universal Studios monsters without a direct literary source. The others are The Mummy and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. In the 1970s, novelizations of the original films were issued as paperback originals as part of a series written by \\"Carl Dreadstone,\\" a pseudonym for British horror writer Ramsey Campbell. =Sequels= The Wolf Man proved popular, and so Chaney reprised his signature role in four more Universal films, though unlike his contemporary \\"monsters,\\" Larry Talbot never enjoyed the chance to have a sequel all to himself. Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943) had Talbot's grave opened on a full moon night, causing him to rise again (making him, in the subsequent films, technically one of the undead). The full moon, which had not been shown or mentioned in the first film, was used as a quasi-explanation for the monster's resurrection, and the poem known to the local villagers was retconned to mention the full moon, so that the last line became : and the moon is full and bright. The resurrected Talbot seeks out Dr. Frankenstein for a cure, but finds the monster (Bela Lugosi) instead. The two square off at the climax, but the fight ends in a draw when a dam is exploded and Frankenstein's castle is flooded. In 1944 universal wanted to pair Dracula and the wolf man in \\"the wolf man vs Dracula\\" but was canceled in favor of a remake of phantom of the opera. In House of Frankenstein (1944), Talbot is once again resurrected and is promised a cure via a brain transplant, but is shot dead with a silver bullet instead. He returns with no explanation in House of Dracula (1945), and is finally cured of his condition. But he was afflicted once again, in the comedy film Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). This time the Wolf Man is a hero of sorts, saving Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello) from having his brain transplanted by Dracula (Bela Lugosi) into the head of the Monster (Glenn Strange). Grabbing the vampire as he turns into a bat, the Wolf Man dives over a balcony into the sea, taking Dracula with him. =Remake= Universal Pictures produced a remake of The Wolf Man with Joe Johnston directing the film and Benicio del Toro starring as Lawrence Talbot (also producer of the film). The remake followed the same basic plot of the original but the story and characters were significantly altered, with Anthony Hopkins in a radically altered version of the Claude Rains role. The film was released on February 12, 2010 and opened at #2 at the box office that weekend. The film was met with mixed reviews and a low box office reception but won an Academy Award for Best Makeup in 2011. Due to the 2010 remake performing below expectations at the box office, Universal chose not to produce a sequel. Universal's 2012 film Werewolf: The Beast Among Us was originally planned as a spin-off from The Wolfman but was ultimately unrelated. =Reboot= Universal announced that it would reboot their Universal Monsters properties as part of their Dark Universe, with Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan attached to develop the structure of the shared universe. In November 2014, Universal hired Aaron Guzikowski to write the shared universe's reboot of The Wolf Man. In June 2016, Deadline reports that Dwayne Johnson may star as the character. In October 2016, it was reported that David Callaham was brought on board to re- write the script. However, on November 8, 2017, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the Dark Universe in doubt. In May 2020, it was announced that Ryan Gosling has been cast as Wolf Man for an upcoming reboot of the titular character. Lauren Shuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo co-wrote the script, from an original story pitched by Gosling. The actor has previously been in negotiations to also serve as director, though it was ultimately decided that he would instead focus entirely on acting. Universal is actively pursuing a director. By July 2020, Leigh Whannell entered early negotiations to direct the project, with Jason Blum announced as an additional producer.

He had captured the ongoing problems with contamination suffered by human beings and animals. His photos reportedly include those of the many animals born with deformities in the Chernobyl area, from his many incursions into the Zone of alienation to bring the problems to the attention of the world. Kostin died in Kyiv in 2015 at the age of 78 in a car accident.AP via The Guardian, Igor Kostin, photographer Chernobyl disaster dies 78 He was married to Alla Kostin. Early life and conscription Kostin was born in Bessarabia, in Greater Romania (present day in Moldova), on 27 December 1936, three years before his father, F√©odor Kostin, an economist working in a bank, was sent to fight the war for the newly created Moldavian SSR, after Greater Romania was forced to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union under the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Before the cession, the Kostin family relocated to Kishinev, Moldavian ASSR (present day the capital city of Moldova, Chi≈üinƒÉu). They subsequently resided in the suburb of Kishinev for the next thirty-two years, when his father was sent to the war. From June 1941 onward, under German and Romanian occupation, Kostin was forced to feed on leftovers disposed by the Germans and better off Moldavians with his mother, Nadejda Popovitch, since his father was the sole breadwinner in the family, and there was widespread famine during the occupation. He and his mother frequently transported food such as borscht illegally to the German concentration camps around Kishinev for the Soviet prisoners of war. It was later revealed by Kostin in his photographic book that his mother hoped to find his father in the camps, only to realise later that his father was killed during a bombing years later. In August 1944, the Soviet Union re-established control over Moldavia, and drove the German and Romanian forces out of Moldavian SSR. The entrance of Soviet forces was ushered by aerial bombardment, and almost killed the Kostins, when a bomb obliterated their residence, when they hid under a bed. They later hid near a German armored vehicle, until Soviet forces entered the city. The Soviet Union began purging native Moldavians, and sending richer farmers and the intelligentsia to concentration camps in Siberia. Private business operations became illegal, and Kostin's mother operated a small family business, at the risk of being exposed to the officials by neighbors. In the mornings the Kostins would wake up to the clamor of some of their neighbors packing up and being deported. It was at this point of time that Kostin turned into a gangster and lost interests in schooling. His early life turned into a game of survival of the fittest. Most people were preoccupied with obtaining the basic necessities of life. In 1954, he began military service as a degenerated athletic youth in the army, where he was reformed and became a sapper. He revealed that on at least one occasion he was instructed to dig trenches along the Soviet border in anticipation of an American invasion. By the end of his service he grew more insubordinate and went absent without official leave adding seven months of military jail term to his three-year military service. His deputy commander assigned him the task of redecorating the \\"Leninrooms\\"‚Äîpolitical meeting rooms of the barracks. His jail term was immediately commuted upon the completion of the job. Career as a sportsman and engineer In 1959, upon being discharged from the army, Kostin began playing volleyball for Kishinev's regional sporting team. He then moved up the ladder to play for the Moldavian SSR team, subsequently becoming part of the Soviet national team, representing the union in international volleyball competitions. In 1969, his sporting career ended with multiple spinal and knee injuries and complications from negligence of medical treatments. He began studying at the Agronomy Institute of Kishinev, and was employed as Senior Engineer for a construction firm in Kishinev. It was then he received a job offer at the Construction Bureau of Kyiv, in Ukraine. In Kyiv, they pioneered a construction framing method that expedited building construction, and Kostin invented a machine for the method, which he was awarded prizes for. He was then promoted to Chief of Construction, and managed a staff of around 50 people. His wife at that time, Galina, who was also an engineer, helped him to discover and pursue his natural talent in photography through many sleepless nights developing and printing the analog images in Kyiv, which eventually won him praise at the international photo exhibitions. Career as a photographer By the mid-1970s, Kostin had lost most interest in the construction industry, and was frustrated with the low fixed salary. He professed that he enjoyed photography, specifically portraitures, and won a gold medal for a portrait of his wife in Kyiv's annual photographic exhibition. He had subsequently entered into at least 80 such exhibitions and photographic road-shows throughout the world. Kostin's career as an amateur photographer earned him more than twice the amount of salary than his career as Chief of Construction in the Construction Bureau of Kyiv. He was then employed in one of Ukraine's TV station as a copywriter. He was subsequently made an anchor for a monthly photographic programme, where he interviews some of most accomplished photographers around the world. He was simultaneously employed as the Chief of Construction, effectively holding two formal careers. A year and half later, the show was canceled, and he attempted to apply for a placing at Novosti Press Agency (APN) in Moscow, Russian SFSR. He was however, rejected by Galina Pleskova, then Editor-in-Chief for the agency. Kostin effectively ended his engineering career when he returned to Kyiv where he was resorted to be sleeping in the streets to pursue his photographic career. The Kyiv branch of APN agreed to permit him the use of their photographic development labs. The labs became his temporary abode for around five years after which he was employed as war reporter for Novosti. Kostin covered some of the most severe third-world wars where the Soviet Union was involved, such as in Vietnam War and Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, where he fielded as a non-Communist Party affiliated reporter for Novosti. Due to the fact of non-alignment, he was restricted from entering the front-lines. At Chernobyl After returning from Afghanistan, he began to work periodically for Novosti from the Kyiv branch. He reported on local and trans- Soviet matters but rarely left the state. On the late evening of 26 April 1986 a helicopter pilot whom he worked closely with for his journalistic activities alerted him that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The fire had been extinguished by the time they arrived at Chernobyl via helicopter, and witnessed a war-like scramble of military vehicles and power plant personnel down at the scene of the nuclear power plant. He also experienced an odd feeling combined with high temperature and toxic smog, that was unusual for an accident scene. The motor of his cameras began to exhibit symptoms of radioactive-caused degradation after around 20 shots. The helicopter returned to Kyiv after the cameras' failure. Kostin managed to develop the films, only to realise that all but one was unsalvageable - most of the films were affected by the high level of radiation, that caused the photographs to appear entirely black, resembling a film that was exposed to light pre-maturely. Kostin's only photograph of the nuclear power plant was sent to Novosti in Moscow, but he did not receive a permit to publish it until 5 May 1986. His visit to Chernobyl was illegal and not sanctioned by the authorities. Pravda published limited information about the accident on 29 April 1986, but did not publish Kostin's photographs. The accident was interpreted as a major catastrophe by the global news media, even when the Ukrainian and Soviet authorities were trying to suppress any news regarding the accident. Kostin later received permits as one of the representative of the five accredited Soviet media to cover the accident site and the Zone of Alienation. On 5 May, 1986, he ventured into the rubbles of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site and Reactor 4 along with the liquidators. It was then that he covered the mass exodus of inhabitants of Pripyat and 30 km zone surrounding the nuclear power plant, before the 1 May Labour Day celebration. Dozens had died from the accident, mostly workers at the nuclear power plant.

It was one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic kingdoms and was one of the largest battles of the ancient world. The battle was waged to determine the sovereignty of Coele Syria. Prelude The two largest Hellenistic kingdoms in the 3rd century BC, Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire, repeatedly fought for control of Syria in a series of conflicts known as the Syrian Wars. The Fourth Syrian War began in 219 BC, during which time Ptolemaic Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy IV, and the Seleucid Empire was ruled by Antiochus III the Great. In 217 BC, both armies were on campaign through Syria. The Seleucid and Ptolemaic armies met near the small Syrian town of Rafah. Antiochus initially set up his camp at a distance of 10 (about 2 km) and then only 5 stades (about 1 km) from his adversary's. The battle began with a series of small skirmishes around the perimeter of each army. One night, Theodotus the Aetolian, formerly an officer of Ptolemy, sneaked inside the Ptolemaic camp and reached what he presumed to be the King's tent to assassinate him; but he was absent and the plot failed. Forces  = Seleucid Army = Antiochus' army was composed of 5,000 lightly armed Daae, Carmanians, and Cilicians under Byttacus the Macedonian, 10,000 Phalangites (the Argyraspides or Silver Shields) under Theodotus the Aetolian, the man who had betrayed Ptolemy and handed much of Coele Syria and Phoenicia over to Antiochus, 20,000 Macedonian Phalangites under Nicarchus and Theodotus Hemiolius, 2,000 Persian and Agrianian archers and slingers with 2,000 Thracians under Menedemus of Alabanda, 5,000 Medes, Cissians, Cadusii, and Carmanians under the Aspasianus the Mede, 10,000 Arabians under Zabdibelus, 5,000 Greek mercenaries under Hippolochus the Thessalian, 1,500 Cretans under Eurylochus, 1,000 Neocretans under Zelys the Gortynian, and 500 Lydian javelineers and 1,000 Cardaces (Kardakes) under Lysimachus the Gaul. Four thousand horse under Antipater, the nephew of the King and 2,000 under Themison formed the cavalry and 102 war elephants of Aryan Indian stock marched under Philip and Myischos. = Ptolemaic Army = Ptolemy had just ended a major recruitment and retraining plan with the help of many mercenary generals. His forces consisted of 3,000 Hypaspists under Eurylochus the Magnesian (the Agema), 2,000 peltasts under Socrates the Boeotian, 25,000 Macedonian Phalangites under Andromachus the Aspendian and Ptolemy, the son of Thraseas, and 8,000 Greek mercenaries under Phoxidas the Achaean, and 2,000 Cretan under Cnopias of Allaria and 1,000 Neocretan archers under Philon the Cnossian. He had another 3,000 Libyans under Ammonius the Barcian and 20,000 Egyptians under his chief minister Sosibius trained in the Macedonian way. These Egyptians were trained to fight alongside the Macedonians. Apart from these he also employed 4,000 Thracians and Gauls from Egypt and another 2,000 from Europe under Dionysius the Thracian. His Household Cavalry (tis aulis) numbered 700 men and the local (egchorioi) and Libyan horse, another 2,300 men, had as appointed general Polycrates of Argos. Those from Greece and the mercenaries were led by Echecrates the Thessalian. Ptolemy's force was accompanied by 73 elephants of the African stock. According to Polybius, Ptolemy had 70,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 73 war elephants and Antiochus 62,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 102 elephants.Polybius V.65 and V.79‚Äì87.  War elephants  This is the only known battle in which African and Asian elephants were used against each other.v Due to Polybius' descriptions of Antiochus' Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), brought from India, as being larger and stronger than Ptolemy's African elephants, it had once been theorized that Ptolemy's elephants were in fact the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), a close relative to the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) ‚Äì a typical African bush elephant would tower over an Asian one, meaning that the smaller forest elephant would be a better fit with Polybius' descriptions. However recent DNA research has revealed that most likely, Ptolemy's elephants were in fact Loxodonta africana, albeit culled from a population of more diminutive African bush elephants still found in Eritrea today. Another possibility is that Ptolemy utilized the now extinct North African elephants (Loxodonta africana pharaoensis). Much smaller than their Indian or Bush cousins, members of this subspecies were typically around 8-foot high at the shoulder. Regardless of origin, according to Polybius, Ptolemy's African elephants could not bear the smell, sound, and sight of their Indian counterparts. The Indian's greater size and strength easily routed the Africans.  Battle  After five days of skirmishing, the two kings decided to array their troops for battle. Both placed their Phalangites in the center. Next to them they fielded the lightly armed and the mercenaries in front of which they placed their elephants and even further in the wings their cavalry. They spoke to their soldiers, took their places in the lines ‚Äì Ptolemy in his left and Antiochus in his right wing ‚Äì and the battle commenced. In the beginning of the battle, the elephant contingents on the wings of both armies moved to charge. Ptolemy's diminutive African elephants retreated in panic before the impact with the larger Indians and ran through the lines of friendly infantry arrayed behind them, causing disorder in their ranks. At the same time, Antiochus had led his cavalry to the right, rode past the left wing of the Ptolemaic elephants charging the enemy horse. The Ptolemaic and Seleucid phalanxes then engaged. However, while Antiochus had the Argyraspides, Ptolemy's Macedonians were bolstered by the Egyptian phalanx. At the same time, the right wing of Ptolemy was retreating and wheeling to protect itself from the panicked elephants. Ptolemy rode to the center encouraging his phalanx to attack, Polybius tells us \\"with alacrity and spirit\\". The Ptolemaic and Seleucid phalanxes engaged in a stiff and chaotic fight. On the Ptolemaic far right, Ptolemy's cavalry was routing their opponents. Antiochus routed the Ptolemaic horse posed against him and pursued the fleeing enemy en masse, believing to have won the day, but the Ptolemaic phalanxes eventually drove the Seleucid phalanxes back and soon Antiochus realized that his judgment was wrong. Antiochus tried to ride back, but by the time he rode back, his troops were routed and could no longer be regrouped. The battle had ended. After the battle, Antiochus wanted to regroup and make camp outside the city of Raphia but most of his men had already found refuge inside and he was thus forced to enter it himself. Then he marched to Gaza and asked Ptolemy for the customary truce to bury the dead, which he was granted. According to Polybius, the Seleucids suffered a little under 10,000 infantry dead, about 300 horse, and 5 elephants, and 4,000 men were taken prisoner. The Ptolemaic losses were 1,500 infantry, 700 horse, and 16 elephants. Most of the Seleucids' elephants were taken by the Ptolemies.  Aftermath  Ptolemy's victory secured the province of Coele-Syria for Egypt, but it was only a respite; at the Battle of Panium in 200 BC Antiochus defeated the army of Ptolemy's young son, Ptolemy V Epiphanes and recaptured Coele Syria and Judea. Ptolemy owed his victory in part to having a properly equipped and trained native Egyptian phalanx, which for the first time formed a large proportion of his phalangites, thus ending his manpower problems. The self-confidence the Egyptians gained was credited by Polybius as one of the causes of the secession in 207‚Äì186 of Upper Egypt under pharaohs Hugronaphor and Ankhmakis, who created a separate kingdom that lasted nearly twenty years. The battle of Raphia marked a turning-point in Ptolemaic history. The native Egyptian element in 2nd-century Ptolemaic administration and culture grew in influence, driven in part by Egyptians having played a major role in the battle and in part by the financial pressures on the state aggravatedThe Ptolemaic currency had already been debased under Ptolemy V (F.

This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the t√™te-b√™che binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this \\"Ace Double\\" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound t√™te-b√™che, until 1973. Ace, along with Ballantine Books, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. The death of owner A. A.

Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr came back as editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming absorbed by Berkley Books. Ace later became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA). History =1952: Ace Doubles concept= Ace Double D-36, Robert E. Howard's Conan the Conqueror. The novel on the reverse side was Leigh Brackett's The Sword of Rhiannon. Cover by Norman Saunders.Bibliography: Conan the Conqueror (Ace dbl cover) from ISFDB Retrieved December 4, 2012. Editor Donald A. Wollheim was working at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor. The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound t√™te-b√™che: Keith Vining's Too Hot for Hell, backed with Samuel W. Taylor's The Grinning Gismo, priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A t√™te-b√™che book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the \\"Ace Double\\" format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag \\"Complete and Unabridged\\" on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged. Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features William S. Burroughs's first novel, Junkie (written under the pseudonym \\"William Lee\\"), and many novels by Philip K. Dick, Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Harry Whittington, and Louis L'Amour, including those written under his pseudonym \\"Jim Mayo\\".Canja, Jeff. (2002) Collectable Paperback Books, Second Edition, East Lansing, Michigan: Glenmoor Publishing. The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's Life with Lancelot, backed with William Barton's Hunting on Kunderer, issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the \\"Ace Double\\" name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than t√™te-b√™che. =1953‚Äì1963: Genre specialization= Ace's second title was a western (also t√™te-b√™che): William Colt MacDonald's Bad Man's Return, bound with J. Edward Leithead's Bloody Hoofs. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as P. G. Wodehouse's Quick Service, bound with his The Code of the Woosters. In 1953, A.E. van Vogt's The World of Null-A, bound with his The Universe Maker, appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released Theodore S. Drachman's Cry Plague!, with a plot that could be regarded as SF, but the book it was bound with‚ÄîLeslie Edgley's The Judas Goat‚Äîwas not SF.) Another SF double followed later in 1953, and SF rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more SF titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, SF titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid juvenile delinquent novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, The Young Wolves by Edward De Roo and D-378, Out for Kicks by Wilene Shaw. By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for SF, but none matched the influence of either company. Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books published‚ÄîAce published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as Philip K. Dick (Solar Lottery, 1955, D-103, bound with Leigh Brackett's The Big Jump); Gordon R. Dickson (Alien from Arcturus, 1956, D-139, bound with Nick Boddie Williams' The Atom Curtain), Samuel R. Delany (The Jewels of Aptor, 1962, F-173, bound with James White's Second Ending), Ursula K. Le Guin (Rocannon's World, 1966, G-574, bound with Avram Davidson's The Kar-Chee Reign), Roger Zelazny (This Immortal, 1966, F-393), and R. A. Lafferty's Past Master (1968, H-54). =1964‚Äì1970: Financial struggles= Joanna Russ's And Chaos Died (1970), from the first Ace SF Special series. Cover by Leo and Diane Dillon. In 1964, science fiction author Terry Carr joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as R. A. Lafferty, Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin. Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series; and Carr also edited Universe, a well-received original anthology series. Universe was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere. In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a copyright loophole in the American edition of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Houghton Mifflin edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the George Allen & Unwin edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by Jack Gaughan. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by Ballantine Books (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any \\"unauthorized\\" versions ‚Äì referring directly to the Ace editions), Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print. Wyn died in 1967, and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living. =1971‚Äì2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary= Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with New American Library, he proceeded to set up DAW Books. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series. By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, Charter Communications, which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City.Ace Star SF paperback edition, title page of \\"When the Sleeper Wakes\\", by H. G. Wells, book catalog #441-88091-075, ca. 1971 In 1972, Ace was acquired by Grosset & Dunlap, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was in turn acquired by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset & Dunlap empire by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company. Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson's Neuromancer, Kim Stanley Robinson's The Wild Shore, Lucius Shepard's Green Eyes, and Michael Swanwick's In the Drift. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the SF genre. Other prominent SF publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner. In 1996, Penguin Group (USA) acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its SF imprint. As of December 2012, recently published authors included Joe Haldeman, Charles Stross, Laurell K. Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, and Jack McDevitt. Penguin merged with Random House in 2013 to form Penguin Random House, which continues to own Berkley. Ace's editorial team is also responsible for the Roc Books imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.

The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices. * D-series: 35¬¢, 1952 to 1962. * S-series: 25¬¢, 1952 to 1956. * T-series: 40¬¢. This series is listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may, therefore, not exist. * F-series: 40¬¢, 1961 to 1967. * M-series: 45¬¢, 1964 to 1967. * G-series: 50¬¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series). * K-series: various prices, 1959 to 1966. * H-series: 60¬¢, 1966 to 1968. * A-series: 75¬¢, 1963 to 1968. * N-series: 95¬¢, 1968. The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in t√™te-b√™che format: Keith Vining's Too Hot for Hell backed with Samuel W. Taylor's The Grinning Gismo. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry, but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate \\"Double\\" (i.e., t√™te-b√™che) or \\"Single\\"; there are D-series titles that are not t√™te-b√™che, although none of the t√™te- b√™che titles have an S serial number. Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101. The t√™te-b√™che format proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.  See also   References Further reading * Corrick, James A.

For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties label themselves as a liberal party. Background When liberalism started in Bohemia and Moravia, the Czech lands were member states of Austria-Hungary. Liberals in the region started as part of the conservative nationalist National Party (N√°rodn√≠ strana) or Old Czechs, but from 1874 they formed their own party: the National Liberal Party (N√°rodn√≠ strana svobodomysln√°), also known as the Young Czechs. Czech liberals usually do not call themselves liberals, but prefer labels such as progressive or even national socialist (which has nothing to do with the German variant). History The liberal movement is currently unsuccessful in this country. Liberal parties are small or in decline and are unable to cooperate. They were unsuccessful at the 2004 European elections. At these elections the European Democrats (Evrop≈°t√≠ demokrat√©) proved to be a liberal alternative, but it joined the EPP. = National Liberal Party = *1874: Liberals in Bohemia seceded from the National Party and formed the National Liberal Party. *1889: A faction of the National Party joined the National Liberal Party. *1897: The ‚áí Radical Progressive Party seceded from the party. *1899: The ‚áí Czech State Rights Radical Party seceded from the party. *1900: A faction seceded as the ‚áí Czech People's Party. *1918: The party merged with the ‚áí Czech State Rights Radical Party, the National Party and others into the mainly conservative Czech State Rights Democrats (ƒåesk√° st√°topr√°vn√≠ demokracie), renamed in 1919 as the Czechoslovak National Democracy (ƒåeskoslovensk√° n√°rodn√≠ demokracie). *1924: Allies of president Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk left the party to form the ‚áí National Labour Party. *1934: After the party developed into a national-conservative party, it joined the National Unification (N√°rodn√≠ sjedonocen√≠). = Czech People's Party / Czech Progressive Party = *1887: A second faction of liberals seceded from the National Party and joined the ‚áí National Liberal Party in 1889. *1900: This faction formed the Czech People's Party (ƒåesk√° strana lidov√°). *1906: The party absorbed the ‚áí Radical Progressive Party and was renamed Czech Progressive Party (ƒåeska strana pokrokov√°). *1918: The party disappeared, members joined the ‚áí Czech State Rights Democrats and the ‚áí Czech Socialist Party = Radical Progressive Party= *1897: The Radical Progressive Party (Strana radik√°lnƒõ pokrokov√°) seceded from the ‚áí National Liberal Party *1906: The party merged into the ‚áí Czech Progressive Party =From National Social Party until Liberal National Social Party= *1898: National-minded social democrats and left-wing liberals formed the National Socialist Party (N√°rodn√≠ strana soci√°ln√≠). *1918: The party was reorganized into the Czech Socialist Party (ƒåesk√° socialistick√° strana), from 1919 the Czechoslovak Socialist Party (ƒåeskoslovensk√° socialistick√° strana). *1926: The party absorbed the liberal ‚áí National Labour Party and was renamed the Czechoslovak National Socialist Party (ƒåeskoslovensk√° n√°rodnƒõ socialistick√° strana). *1948: The party continued as a communist satellite party under the name Czechoslovak Socialist Party (ƒåeskoslovensk√° strana socialistick√°).

Being a relatively late arrival on campus, prime lots on Webster Avenue, where most of the other fraternities were located, were unavailable. With the help of the national organization, a house for the fraternity was purchased on what was then the northern edge of the college campus. By the late 1920s, however, the house had begun to show its age, and a building campaign resulted in the demolition of the old building and the construction of a new building during the 1927-1928 academic year. This new house was built with three stories above ground with a basement, and included living quarters for eighteen students (the maximum permitted by the College at the time.) Although the new residence included a kitchen, fraternities at Dartmouth were not allowed to serve meals on a regular basis, and the kitchen was used primarily by the residents and during social functions. Over the years, there were many changes to the building, including two different porches constructed on the south side of the building, the installation of sump pumps which allowed finishing of rooms in the basement, and the relocation of the boiler room, social areas, and even a staircase. The brotherhood of the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa underwent a great transition in the years of World War II and immediately afterward. Many members of the classes of 1942 through 1945 were rushed through their academic studies and went off to war without so much as a graduation ceremony. At the same time, the U.S. Navy organized a V-12 Navy College Training Program on the Dartmouth College campus.U.S. Navy Memorial. \\"The Navy V-12 Program\\". Retrieved Feb. 8, 2006. Many Phi Sigma Kappa men from Dartmouth went off to war, and at least one spent time as a prisoner of war. When these same brothers returned to finish their education after the war, attitudes in the house were less innocent, which changed how the brotherhood treated one another.

Colleges and universities were the next locus of change as returning GIs flocked to the educational opportunities granted under the G.I.

This was more strongly true in the older East Coast schools, but appeared soon at college locations in the West, Midwest and even the South. Like some of its other chapters, the Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa had a history of being progressive about its membership. Until 1952, the Phi Sigma Kappa national organization did not have a formal policy regarding membership of ethnic or religious minorities in its written charter or regulations, while it did host the occasional foreign student. However, the influx of new collegians of all races led some chapters to push for legislation to encourage all local chapters to avoid admitting minorities to membership.Scobie, Richard (1956). A Fraternal Revolution: The Birth of Phi Tau Fraternity, As Told by One of the Principles: Richard Scobie. Hanover, New Hampshire: 1956. In a contentious debate in 1952, the matter was brought to a head, with opposition to this restriction voiced by Tau chapter members, among others. A policy was adopted, narrowly, called The Bedford Resolution, which read: \\"That the fraternity's tradition be maintained in the sense that there be no pledging or initiating of Negro men until such time as they are acceptable to all chapters.\\" \\"Bedford\\" was not written into the national organization's bylaws, but its short-term effect was nevertheless destructive: Phi Sigma Kappa chapters at Boston University and Knox College were both expelled from the national organization in 1953 for pledging African-American students. The Tau Chapter had been quietly opposed to this agreement, and had already admitted several Jewish men into the house. A campus-wide referendum on the desegregation of fraternities in 1954 resulted in a slim majority of Dartmouth students favoring mandatory desegregation of fraternities by 1960. This became a binding policy of the college administration.Hill, Ralph Nading, ed. (1964). The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle. Hanover, New Hampshire: Dartmouth Publications, Library of Congress Card no. 64-16542, pp. 259-260. Greek letters Œ¶Œ£Œö appear in a wrought iron railing on the southwest corner of the 1928 residence, photographed in 1995. Many Dartmouth Phi Sigma Kappa brothers held out hope that the national organization might eventually reverse the Bedford Resolution, but while they awaited a legislative solution, Richard Scobie, class of 1956, reports that some were dismayed by examples of \\"racist attitudes of certain leaders.\\" Several national organization leaders and their wives visited Dartmouth for a party celebrating the Tau chapter's 50th anniversary in May, 1955. National President A.L. Atcheson, District Director Bob Abbe, and District Deputy Sam Sargent all attended. Scobie relays, \\"Abbe was reported to have commented to several brothers, including Dick Taft, class of 1956 and then vice-president of the chapter, Well, it's this way. We've got to watch out for all minority groups; not just the Negroes. In different areas you've got to watch out for different things, sometimes it's Italians, sometimes it's Jews, sometimes it's Negroes.\\" Unbeknownst to Abbe, Dick Taft was Jewish. However, this anecdotal report has no corroboration in other sources; Abbe himself was Jewish, and Phi Sigma Kappa had already had a number of Jewish members. However, Scobie made the claim that this was the cause for \\"many in the chapter [to be] outraged and [offer] proposals to \\"go local\\" or to affiliate with a different national fraternity at the house meeting immediately following the visit. [However] no consensus was reached at the time, with the end of the academic year rapidly approaching.\\" Nationally, \\"Bedford\\" had proven to be harmful, and had been repealed by the National fraternity at the 1954 convention only two years after it had passed. It was replaced by a much weaker, unwritten \\"Gentlemen's Agreement,\\" with similar provisions but no real legislative teeth, which more progressive leaders thought they could used to soothe the process of change for trailing chapters. For some chapters, this was enough, but for others, like Tau, the demand for change would allow no mitigating steps. Tau did not attend the 1954 convention in Roanoke, Virginia. The movement for Tau to secede from the Phi Sigma Kappa national was rejuvenated in the early winter of 1956. Scobie, then outgoing chapter president, personally resigned his affiliation with the national fraternity in a letter in which he accused Phi Sigma Kappa of \\"black reactionary ideals.\\" A week later debate continued, and the first vote to disaffiliate failed to gain the two-thirds majority called for in the motion with a result of 41 local, 20 national, and 3 abstaining. A week later on March 7, 1956, the Tau chapter voted again to permanently separate from the national organization, with the ballot this time passing 54 local to 7 national. After briefly considering the name Phi Sigma Tau, the house decided to name themselves Phi Tau Fraternity. The history of the separation was chronicled by Dick Scobie for his senior thesis. Phi Tau was thus formed in May 1956. Ironically, it still won the debate on the national level: Phi Sigma Kappa voted at its next convention, just two months later in July 1956, to rescind the \\"Gentleman's Agreement,\\" and with this action its chapters became free to admit members of all races. It had lost reactionary Tau, but, Phi Sig, to its credit, became one of the first national fraternities to put to rest strife over race. That same year, 1956, its Phi chapter at Swarthmore pledged a black man from the Gold Coast, with no reaction from national leadership. Many national fraternities struggled with this issue into the 1980s. Phi Sigma Kappa has remained male-only, having itself had little call to change that policy. However, should that call ever come, among fraternities, a workable co-ed solution may be observed, where several national fraternities have adopted co-ed \\"Society\\" versions of themselves, as parallel organizations, to accommodate those chapters that choose to become co-educational. An example is the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Alpha Delta Phi Society, the latter of which hosts its co-ed chapters and where both use the fraternity's symbols. Phi Sigma Kappa has never been petitioned for similar formation of a co-ed \\"branch,\\" thus how it would respond is unknown. However, it has expressed strong interest in reopening closed and 'legacy' chapters on its older campuses.PSK Expansion targets , accessed 25 April 2014 Today, Phi Sigma Kappa's stated anti-discrimination policy is progressive: \\"No chapter shall discriminate in recruitment or in membership based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, ethnic background, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, parental status, or political affiliation.\\" =Coeducation to the present= Dartmouth College began to admit women students with the freshman class of 1972, which resulted in women members being allowed under current Dartmouth College rules of being accepted to fraternities during the spring semester of 1973. During the winter of 1972/1973, Phi Tau initiated a vote to allow it to become the first coeducational fraternity at Dartmouth College, and to admit women beginning in the spring rush year of 1973. When the organization's constitution was rewritten to reflect the new local status of the brotherhood in 1956, gender references were deliberately excluded from the text, making the house officially coeducational before the college itself. The vote in 1973 formally confirmed the membership policy. Unlike other coeducational Greek houses, members of Phi Tau have continued to refer to one another as \\"brothers\\", regardless of their gender. Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek house at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them, and was the first fraternity at the College to add sexual preference to its non- discrimination clause. In the 1980s, the Phi Tau residence began to face serious structural problems after the removal of a porch on the south side of the building. The walls of the building were constructed out of brick. Presented with different loads and stresses, the north wall began to bulge outward by nearly half a meter, and was literally threatening to explode. Large steel plates were placed on the outside of the building and steel tie rods were threaded through the building between the ground and second floor to pull the plates together and force the exterior walls to straighten. A new tradition began of articles in alumni newsletters proclaiming, \\"The north wall is still standing!\\" The Œ¶Œ§ residence at Dartmouth College, constructed in 2002, photographed in the winter of 2005. The College introduced undergraduate societies to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations. Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, undergraduate societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies. Panarchy, a coeducational fraternity with a 97-year history at Dartmouth, voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called Amarna.Trustees of Dartmouth College (2006). \\"Office of Residential Life: Undergraduate Societies\\". Retrieved Feb. 23, 2006. Phi Tau chose to remain a Greek house. In 1999, the College administration announced a \\"Residential and Social Life Initiative\\" to improve campus life. Speculation that all Greek houses at Dartmouth College might be forced to open admissions to anyone who wanted to join drew attention to Phi Tau's status as an already coeducational institution, but one that still held to Greek traditions. Then house president Virginia DeJesus-Rueff, class of 2000, defended Phi Tau's policy of self-selection.Semon, Kascha (1999). \\"Coed Houses Upset by Initiative\\". The Dartmouth. Feb. 22, 1999. In 2000, Dartmouth College unveiled a new master plan for the north side of the campus. The development plan called for the creation of a green on the northern side of the libraries in the center of campus, and anticipated the use of a portion of the property owned by Phi Tau. The fraternity entered into negotiations to sell of property to the College in exchange for the funds and construction support to build a new house to replace the existing Phi Tau building. The new structure was built during the summer and fall academic terms of 2002, for a sum in excess of $1.8 million.Phillips, Judith (2002). \\"New Phi Tau Costs $1.8 Million\\" The Dartmouth. Oct. 23, 2002. The new structure was located between North Main Street and the 1928 house. Student members of Phi Tau continued to occupy the old house during construction of the new building. Phi Tau brothers began living in the new house in the winter term of 2003, and the house built in 1928 was demolished in January, 2003. Membership and activities Like other fraternities and sororities, membership in Phi Tau is self-selective. The process of joining Phi Tau, called \\"rush,\\" invites potential student members to apply for admission. Members of the house then deliberate on these applications at an official house meeting and decide whether or not to offer a bid to each prospective new member. Anyone offered a bid to join may \\"sink\\" the bid, and thereby join the house, whenever they wish to do so until they graduate. Phi Tau, like most other Greek organizations in the United States, has a pledge period. Like all Dartmouth College Greek organizations, Phi Tau holds a weekly house meeting at which only brothers and faculty advisors may be in attendance. Associations Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity is owned by the non-profit Tau Corporation of Hanover, New Hampshire. All past and present members of the fraternity are voting members of the not-for-profit corporation, which meets at least annually. Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity is a recognized fraternal student organization of Dartmouth College and is a member organization of the Co-Ed Council. Phi Tau has had a long-standing charitable relationship with the Karnak Shriners of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, supporting their Hospital for Burned Children. A major Phi Tau social event each summer is the Shriners Day Parade down North Main Street in front of the Phi Tau house.

Still in production, the Islander is one of the best- selling commercial aircraft types produced in Europe. Although designed in the 1960s, over 750 are still in service with commercial operators around the world. The aircraft is also used by the British Army and police forces in the United Kingdom and is a light transport with over 30 military aviation operators around the world. Initial aircraft were manufactured at Britten- Norman's factory in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, UK. After Fairey Aviation acquired the Britten-Norman company, its Islanders and Trislander aircraft were built in Romania, then shipped to Avions Fairey in Belgium for finishing before being flown to the UK for flight certification. The Islander has been in production for more than 50 years. Development =Origins= In 1953, Britten-Norman was formed for the purpose of converting and operating agricultural aircraft, amongst other vehicles such as the Cushioncraft hovercraft.Simpson 1991, p. 77.Fricker 1968, p. 75. In 1963, the firm initiated development work upon what would become the Islander, having sensed a demand for a simple and inexpensive twin-piston engine aircraft. The founders, John Britten and Desmond Norman, had observed the rapid growth of the commuter airline sector, and concluded that capacity was of a higher value to these operators than either range or cruising speed, thus the Islander emphasized payload over either of these attributes. Through the use of low wing- and span-loading to generate greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes.Fricker 1968, pp. 75-76. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external fishplate joints are used for the same purpose.Fricker 1968, p. 76. The type was originally intended to use a fabric- and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing. The prototype BN-2 Islander displayed at the 1965 Paris Air Show six days after its maiden flight On 13 June 1965, the first prototype BN-2 Islander conducted its maiden flight, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/Continental IO-360B piston engines; only four days later, the prototype appeared at the Paris Air Show.Green 1976, p. 52. The IO-360B engines were later replaced by more powerful Lycoming O-540-E engines, which were located further outboard on the wings, for superior single-engine climb performance. On 20 August 1966, a second BN-2 prototype performed its first flight. These prototype aircraft, while resembling subsequent production models for the most part, were outfitted with different, less powerful engines. On 24 April 1967, the first production Islander performed its first flight; UK type certification was received in August 1967, US authorities also certified the type in December 1967. Initial production of the Islander started at the Britten-Norman factory at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight; however, within a few years the company found that it could not produce the aircraft at a sufficient rate to keep up with the customer demand.Fricker, John. \\"Foreign Accent.\\" Flying, December 1968. Vol. 83, No. 6. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 26. To expand production, a contract was placed with Intreprinderea de Reparatii Material Aeronautic (IRMA) of Romania, initially to assemble kit- form aircraft, which were then sent to the UK for completion. In August 1969, the first Romanian-assembled Islander performed its first flight. IRMA proved successful at economically producing the aircraft, producing roughly 30-40 aircraft per year at times, and eventually became the primary manufacturing site for the Islander. In 1977, IRMA received a contract for the production of a further 100 Islanders; from that point on, the firm produced all subsequent Islander aircraft.Hamilton-Paterson 2010, p. 255. More than 500 of the type were manufactured in Romania. In 1970, a military version of the Islander, marketed as the Defender, conducted its first flight. Modifications included the addition of underwing hardpoints for armaments/equipment, and the main cabin area being fitted out for light troop transport and support aircraft duties. The Defender capitalised on the aircraft's rugged structure, making it suitable for long-term operations in developing countries. Purchases from police and military customers have typically been for use in surveillance and counter-terrorism operations. The Maritime Defender is another military version of the Islander, intended for search and rescue, coastal patrol and fishery protection. A Seychellois Stamp with an illustration of a Britten- Norman Islander, 1981 =Further development= Despite the relative success of the Islander, Britten-Norman experienced wider financial difficulties during the late 1960s, ultimately resulting in the company entering receivership in October 1971. In August 1972, Britten-Norman was purchased by the Fairey Aviation Group, forming the Fairey Britten-Norman company; shortly thereafter, the majority of manufacturing activity for both the Islander and Trislander was transferred to its Avions Fairey factory in Gosselies, Belgium. Completed aircraft were flown to Bembridge for final customer preparation prior to delivery.\\"Avions Fairey Gosselies & Sonaca: a Tips of genie.\\" Belgian Aircraft History Association, Retrieved: 25 March 2016.Fricker, John. \\"Past and Present.\\" Flying Magazine, September 1977. Vol. 101, No. 3. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 271. Inflight BN-2T Fairey Aviation set about the development of a more powerful model, the Turbo Islander, equipped with a pair of Lycoming LTP101 turboprop engines. However, testing revealed that the LTP101 engines were too powerful for the aircraft; thus, following a period of re-designing, the project evolved into the Turbine Islander (BN-2T), equipped with a pair of Allison 250 turboprop engines instead. However, Fairey itself encountered financial difficulty, resulting in the Fairey Britten-Norman company entering receivership and the firm's acquisition by Oerlikon Buerle of Switzerland, leading to the formation of Pilatus Britten-Norman, at which point some production activity was transferred back to Bembridge. Another development was a turbo-normalizing system with RaJay turbocharger for the -2, -3, -6, -8, and -9 models allowing full power up to with attendant increase in true airspeed and takeoff and climb performance. Presently Talco in Texas holds the STC. In 1969, an improved version, the BN-2A Islander, conducted its maiden flight. It incorporated aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, such as lower-drag engine cowlings and undercarriage, an improved interior, and an expanded rear baggage area with external access. In 1970, to improve hot-and-high performance, more powerful Lycoming O-540-K1-B5 engines were made available, alongside optional tiptanks and an elongated nose to house baggage. Islander equipped with ducted fans, 1978 In 1977, a single standard BN-2 was re-engined with Dowty Rotol ducted fans. The ducted fan produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion. Some structural strengthening of the main wing spar at the root was required due to the extra weight.Hirst, Mike. \\"Building the quiet Islander.\\" Flight International, 16 July 1977. p. 210. This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the ducted fan as a means of reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.\\"Reporting Points.\\" Flying Magazine, October 1977. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 25. In 1978, a further improved version, the BN-2B Islander II, was produced as a result of a product improvement program. The BN-2B model involved several changes, including a redesigned cockpit and a reduction in cabin noise levels. In 1980, it was decided to make available turboprop engines for the type, adopting twin Allison 250-B17C engines; when the latter are installed, the aircraft is designated the BN-2T Turbine Islander. The first such BN-2T entered service in 1981. In February 1999, the acquisition of Romaero, the Romanian manufacturer of the Islander, by Britten- Norman Group was announced.\\"Britten-Norman takes over Romania's Romaero.\\" Aviation Week, 8 February 1999.\\"Britten-Norman enjoys new Romanian rhapsody.\\" Flight International, 14 June 1999.

In early 2008, B-N was studying a version powered by aircraft diesel engines with SMA Engines, already offering the SMA SR305-230. In May 2010, Britten- Norman announced that manufacturing of the Islander would be relocated from Romania to a new site in the UK, due to the rising costs of production in Romania.Morrison, Murdo. \\"Britten-Norman brings production back to the UK.\\" Flight International, 28 May 2010. Electric Project Fresson Supported by Britten-Norman, Cranfield Aerospace wants to develop an electric propulsion system for the over 700 Islanders currently operated. =Trislander= In 1968, the original second Islander prototype was re-used for a further development programme, being modified into a stretched aircraft with greater capacity, referred to as the Super Islander. However, the Super Islander programme was aborted without proceeding to certification. The prototype later received further design changes to produce the three-engined version, the BN-2A Mk III Trislander. This aircraft has a stretched fuselage, modified landing gear and a third engine, which is mounted on the tail. On 11 September 1970, the Trislander prototype conducted its maiden flight, appearing at the 1970 Farnborough Air Show the same day. Design Cockpit of a BN-2 Islander The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a rectangular fuselage and two wing-mounted engines; early aircraft were equipped with a pair of piston engines while later production models may be alternatively fitted with turboprop engines in their place. The rectangular cross section fuselage, which is furnished with a conventional tail unit and fixed tricycle landing gear, typically accommodates a single pilot and up to nine passengers in a commuter configuration, each row being accessed by its own door; the cabin can be rapidly reconfigured, allowing for a single aircraft to undertake a diverse range of tasks within a minimal period of time.Orbis 1985, p. 992. Often referring to the type as \\"The world's most versatile aircraft\\",\\"Islands: The World's Most Versatile Aircraft.\\" Britten Norman, Retrieved: 25 March 2016. Britten-Norman promotes the Islander's low direct operating costs, minimal maintenance, and its stability in flight as major attributes of the aircraft.\\"Islander.\\" Britten Norman, Retrieved: 25 March 2016. The original Islander was designed with an emphasis upon providing ease of access within the short haul sector to remote locations as a safe, efficient, and profitable transport aircraft. It has been regularly used by such operators, including the frequent use of unprepared rough airstrips and from challenging terrain; the Islander being capable of short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. The low load height and wide side doors provide for easy access for passenger and cargo operations, while the aircraft's ability to maintain a high takeoff frequency has led to the type's use for parachuting. For operating within noise-sensitive environments, silencers can be equipped on both the aircraft's engine and propellers.\\"Pilatus Britten- Norman will adopt Islander silencer.\\" Flight International, 7 January 1998. Exit in a parachuting exercise Designed as a small and inexpensive commuter/utility aircraft, various cabin configurations and equipment loadouts are available to suit a wide variety of different purposes, including charter flights, scheduled flights, agricultural uses, aerial firefighting, air freight VIP/executive transport, aerial surveillance, air ambulance, paradropping, and law enforcement.Goold, Ian. \\"Britten-Norman Islander celebrates 40th anniversary.\\" AIN Online, 16 October 2006. The design programme can be entirely personalized, allowing each customer to be involved in every area of the aircraft's manufacture to mold it to their preferences. Later versions of the Islander offer various options, including enlarged bay doors, 3-bladed scimitar propellers, low drag fairings, modern interior, ergonomic leather seating, in-flight entertainment systems, and alternative seat arrangements; underwing hardpoints can also be installed for carrying pod, spray booms and other external stores. Operational history Immediately following commercial availability, US distributor Jonas Aircraft ordered 30 Islanders, and placed orders for another 112 aircraft within a year. When equipped with four 54-gallon fuel tanks, the Islander was able to ferry itself across the transatlantic route, via Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, for US deliveries. The Islander's long-range capabilities were highlighted when the type won the 1969 London-Sydney air race. In 1974, sales of the Islander surpassed the 548-order record for British multi-engine commercial aircraft. In 1982, another production milestone was reached with the delivery of the 1,000th Islander. From the 1980s onwards, sales noticeably declined; according to Britten-Norman Chief Executive William Hynett, this was due to the global market having become saturated by the type and there being only a low civil demand for additional aircraft, in part due to the longevity of in-service Islanders. As of 2016, Britten-Norman claim that the Islander is in daily service with roughly 500 operators in more than 120 countries. Between 1976 and 2006, Scottish airline Loganair operated a number of Islanders as air ambulances, covering areas such as the island communities in the Hebrides.Lowton, Edward. \\"‚ÄúAt what altitude did you have your baby?‚Äù National Museum of Flight seeks mothers who gave birth midflight.\\" Culture 24, 16 June 2015.

Several commuter airlines and general aviation charter operators in the U.S. also flew the Islander including Stol Air Commuter in scheduled passenger service in northern California from their San Francisco International Airport (SFO) hub and Channel Islands Aviation in southern California which used the aircraft for the flights to Channel Islands National Park. Another U.S. commuter airline operator was Wings Airways which operated high frequency shuttle service into the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). By October 2019, 800 Islanders were in service including around 600 used for short flights.

Its British division is Penguin Books Ltd. Other separate divisions can be found in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa. History Penguin Books Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought over by Pearson Longman in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm Viking Press. In 1986, Penguin acquired the New American Library, a mass-market paperback publisher. Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the Putnam Berkley Group after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from MCA. The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division. The different Penguin companies use many imprints, many of which used to be independent publishers. Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own speaker's bureau that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community Book Country was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA. In April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed United States v. Apple Inc., naming Apple, Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants. The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books and weaken Amazon.com's position in the market in violation of antitrust law. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing. In October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House. The houses were considered two of the 'Big Six' publishing companies prior to the merger, which became the 'Big Five' upon its completion.

It was designed by the LWD bureau and produced by the WSK Warszawa-Okƒôcie factory. Development The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement of 1946 for a trainer to replace the Soviet UT-2, which was obsolete. The new aircraft was designed in 1947 in the LWD (Lotnicze Warsztaty Do≈õwiadczalne - Aircraft Experimental Workshops) - the first Polish post-war construction bureau. The chief designer was Tadeusz So≈Çtyk. A prototype named the LWD Junak, later the Junak 1, was flown on February 22, 1948 (its name means \\"brave young man\\"). The entire design was Polish, except for the engine, which was a license-built Soviet radial, the Shvetsov M-11D (93 kW, 125 hp). After tests, an improved variant, the Junak 2 was flown on July 12, 1949. Notable changes from the Junak 1 included the cockpit being moved forward, the fin being increased in area, a more powerful M-11FR engine (118 kW, 160 hp) was fitted and the massive landing gear covers were deleted. The plane's handling improved. The LWD team disbanded in 1950 and Junak 2 development was continued by the CSS workshops in Warsaw. After further improvements the prototype was designated the Junak-2bis, but finally entered production in 1951 as the Junak-2. Tadeusz So≈Çtyk was given a State Award in 1952 for the design. From 1951 to 1954, 105 Junak 2s were produced in the WSK-Okƒôcie in Warsaw (the first 3 in the WSK-Mielec). Tadeusz So≈Çtyk, then working in the Aviation Institute (Instytut Lotnictwa - IL) in Warsaw, proposed a Junak development with a bubble canopy, retractable landing gear and other improvements, designated the TS-7 Chwat, but it was not ordered by the authorities and remained on the drawing board. Instead, when the Polish Air Force was equipped with its first jet fighters, (the Yak-23 and MiG-15), there appeared to be a need for a trainer with a tricycle landing gear. So≈Çtyk designed a modified Junak with a fixed tricycle landing gear and other minor improvements. This plane entered production as the TS-9 Junak 3 (\\"TS\\" standing for the designers initials), after having first flown on August 7, 1953. The new plane was heavier, its maximum speed dropped from 223 km/h (139 mph) to 205 km/h (128 mph). Between 1953 and 1956, 146 Junak 3s were produced in WSK Warszawa-Okƒôcie. Along with the Junak 1, the LWD developed a civilian trainer and aerobatics variant, the LWD Zuch. Only 5 Zuch 2s were built in 1950, powered by a 116 hp Bramo Sh 14 radial engine. The Junak was the first aircraft mass-produced in Poland after World War II, the Polish aviation industry having been annihilated. Despite not being particularly modern, it was a stable and easy-to-handle aircraft, with an uncomfortable cockpit being one of its few flaws. On the other hand, it was considered a difficult aircraft to learn to fly, because a student in a rear cockpit had worse view. All models of Junak are generally referred to as LWD Junak or WSK Junak, while the designation TS-9 is not commonly used. The designation IL Junak 3 sometimes appears in books. Design The aircraft was of mixed construction (steel and wood) and conventional in layout. The fuselage consisted of a steel frame, covered with canvas, in front with metal sheet. It had two-spar wings of wooden construction and a trapezoidal shape; they were covered with canvas and plywood and were fitted with split flaps. It had a two-seat cabin (front: instructor, rear: student) with a common closed canopy (front section opening to the right, rear section sliding). Landing gear was conventional (Junak 2) or tricycle (Junak 3) and fixed. A 5-cylinder M-11FR radial engine gave 119 kW (160 hp) of maximum power and 104 kW (140 hp) normal power. The cylinders have individual cowls, which were often removed. The aircraft was fitted with a two-blade fixed pitch wooden propeller. It carried 80 liters (Junak 2) or 100 liters (Junak 3) of fuel. The plane had no armament. The Junak 3 was fitted with a radio. Operational history A Junak-3 in the Polish Aviation Museum Junak 2s were used in the Polish Air Force as a basic trainer from 1952. When their replacement, with Junak 3s, started in 1954‚Äì55, the Junak 2s were withdrawn from the Air Force and handed over to civilian flying clubs. Junak 3s were used in Polish military aviation from 1954 until 1961, when they were finally replaced with the TS-8 Bies. Starting from 1956, they were handed over to flying clubs as well. In civilian aviation, 71 Junak 2s and 93 Junak 3s were distributed among aero clubs, who suffered a shortage of suitable aircraft after the war. They were used for pilot training and glider towing throughout the 1960s. The last Junak 2s and Junak 3s were retired in 1972. In 1963 a group of 12 African pilot trainees from Algeria, Togo and Angola were taught to fly at Krosno, Poland, and they flew Junak 3.Ireneusz Materniak.

One of his first artistic opportunities came when he painted a banner for the presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison in 1840. After that, he began to paint portraits and in 1842 went to Cincinnati to open a studio with John Dunn, a former treasurer of the State of Indiana. After five months, he returned to his business in Indianapolis and continued painting as a sideline, exhibiting annually at the shows of the Cincinnati Art Union. By 1860, he was devoted to art full-time and became well known in Indianapolis for his portraits and landscapes. Cox was also a teacher with numerous students including William Merritt Chase.

Convergence is not necessarily given in the general case, and certain criteria must be met for convergence to occur. Determination of convergence requires the comprehension of pointwise convergence, uniform convergence, absolute convergence, Lp spaces, summability methods and the Ces√†ro mean. Preliminaries Consider ∆í an integrable function on the interval [0,2]. For such an ∆í the Fourier coefficients \\\\widehat{f}(n) are defined by the formula :\\\\widehat{f}(n)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}f(t)e^{-int}\\\\,dt, \\\\quad n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}. It is common to describe the connection between ∆í and its Fourier series by :f\\\\sim \\\\sum_n \\\\widehat{f}(n)e^{int}. The notation ~ here means that the sum represents the function in some sense. To investigate this more carefully, the partial sums must be defined: :S_N(f;t)=\\\\sum_{n=-N}^N \\\\widehat{f}(n)e^{int}. The question here is: Do the functions S_N(f) (which are functions of the variable t we omitted in the notation) converge to ∆í and in which sense? Are there conditions on ∆í ensuring this or that type of convergence? This is the main problem discussed in this article. Before continuing, the Dirichlet kernel must be introduced. Taking the formula for \\\\widehat{f}(n), inserting it into the formula for S_N and doing some algebra gives that :S_N(f)=f * D_N\\\\, where ‚àó stands for the periodic convolution and D_N is the Dirichlet kernel, which has an explicit formula, :D_n(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin((n+\\\\frac{1}{2})t)}{\\\\sin(t/2)}. The Dirichlet kernel is not a positive kernel, and in fact, its norm diverges, namely :\\\\int D_n(t)\\\\,dt \\\\to \\\\infty a fact that plays a crucial role in the discussion. The norm of Dn in L1(T) coincides with the norm of the convolution operator with Dn, acting on the space C(T) of periodic continuous functions, or with the norm of the linear functional ∆í ‚Üí (Sn∆í)(0) on C(T). Hence, this family of linear functionals on C(T) is unbounded, when n ‚Üí ‚àû. Magnitude of Fourier coefficients In applications, it is often useful to know the size of the Fourier coefficient. If f is an absolutely continuous function, :\\\\left\\\\widehat f(n)\\\\right\\\\le {K \\\\over n} for K a constant that only depends on f. If f is a bounded variation function, :\\\\left\\\\widehat f(n)\\\\right\\\\le {{\\\\rm var}(f)\\\\over 2\\\\pin}. If f\\\\in C^p :\\\\left\\\\widehat{f}(n)\\\\right\\\\le {\\\\ f^{(p)}\\\\_{L_1}\\\\over n^p}. If f\\\\in C^p and f^{(p)} has modulus of continuity \\\\omega_p, :\\\\left\\\\widehat{f}(n)\\\\right\\\\le {\\\\omega(2\\\\pi/n)\\\\over n^p} and therefore, if f is in the Œ±-H√∂lder class :\\\\left\\\\widehat{f}(n)\\\\right\\\\le {K\\\\over n^\\\\alpha}. Pointwise convergence Superposition of sinusoidal wave basis functions (bottom) to form a sawtooth wave (top); the basis functions have wavelengths Œª/k (k=integer) shorter than the wavelength Œª of the sawtooth itself (except for k=1). All basis functions have nodes at the nodes of the sawtooth, but all but the fundamental have additional nodes. The oscillation about the sawtooth is called the Gibbs phenomenon There are many known sufficient conditions for the Fourier series of a function to converge at a given point x, for example if the function is differentiable at x. Even a jump discontinuity does not pose a problem: if the function has left and right derivatives at x, then the Fourier series converges to the average of the left and right limits (but see Gibbs phenomenon). The Dirichlet‚ÄìDini Criterion states that: if ∆í is 2‚Äìperiodic, locally integrable and satisfies :\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} \\\\Bigl \\\\frac{f(x_0 + t) + f(x_0 - t)}2 - \\\\ell \\\\Bigr \\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}t }{t} < \\\\infty, then (Sn∆í)(x0) converges to ‚Ñì. This implies that for any function ∆í of any H√∂lder class Œ± > 0, the Fourier series converges everywhere to ∆í(x). It is also known that for any periodic function of bounded variation, the Fourier series converges everywhere. See also Dini test. In general, the most common criteria for pointwise convergence of a periodic function f are as follows: * If f satisfies a Holder condition, then its Fourier series converges uniformly. * If f is of bounded variation, then its Fourier series converges everywhere. * If f is continuous and its Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges uniformly. There exist continuous functions whose Fourier series converges pointwise but not uniformly; see Antoni Zygmund, Trigonometric Series, vol. 1, Chapter 8, Theorem 1.13, p. 300\\\\. However, the Fourier series of a continuous function need not converge pointwise. Perhaps the easiest proof uses the non- boundedness of Dirichlet's kernel in L1(T) and the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus uniform boundedness principle. As typical for existence arguments invoking the Baire category theorem, this proof is nonconstructive. It shows that the family of continuous functions whose Fourier series converges at a given x is of first Baire category, in the Banach space of continuous functions on the circle. So in some sense pointwise convergence is atypical, and for most continuous functions the Fourier series does not converge at a given point. However Carleson's theorem shows that for a given continuous function the Fourier series converges almost everywhere. It is also possible to give explicit examples of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at 0: for instance, the even and 2œÄ-periodic function f defined for all x in [0,œÄ] by :f(x) = \\\\sum_{p=1}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{p^2} \\\\sin\\\\left[ \\\\left( 2^{p^3} +1 ) \\\\frac{x}{2} \\\\right)\\\\right]. Uniform convergence Suppose f\\\\in C^p, and f^{(p)} has modulus of continuity, then the partial sum of the Fourier series converges to the function with speedJackson (1930), p21ff. :f(x)-(S_Nf)(x)\\\\le K {\\\\ln N \\\\over N^p}\\\\omega(2\\\\pi/N) for a constant K that does not depend upon f , nor p, nor N. This theorem, first proved by D Jackson, tells, for example, that if f satisfies the \\\\alpha-H√∂lder condition, then :f(x)-(S_Nf)(x)\\\\le K {\\\\ln N\\\\over N^\\\\alpha}. If f is 2\\\\pi periodic and absolutely continuous on [0,2\\\\pi], then the Fourier series of f converges uniformly, but not necessarily absolutely, to f.Stromberg (1981), Exercise 6 (d) on p. 519 and Exercise 7 (c) on p. 520. Absolute convergence A function ∆í has an absolutely converging Fourier series if :\\\\f\\\\_A:=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\widehat{f}(n)<\\\\infty. Obviously, if this condition holds then (S_N f)(t) converges absolutely for every t and on the other hand, it is enough that (S_N f)(t) converges absolutely for even one t, then this condition holds. In other words, for absolute convergence there is no issue of where the sum converges absolutely ‚Äî if it converges absolutely at one point then it does so everywhere. The family of all functions with absolutely converging Fourier series is a Banach algebra (the operation of multiplication in the algebra is a simple multiplication of functions). It is called the Wiener algebra, after Norbert Wiener, who proved that if ∆í has absolutely converging Fourier series and is never zero, then 1/∆í has absolutely converging Fourier series. The original proof of Wiener's theorem was difficult; a simplification using the theory of Banach algebras was given by Israel Gelfand. Finally, a short elementary proof was given by Donald J. Newman in 1975. If f belongs to a Œ±-H√∂lder class for Œ± > 1/2 then :\\\\f\\\\_A\\\\le c_\\\\alpha \\\\f\\\\_{{\\\\rm Lip}_\\\\alpha},\\\\qquad \\\\f\\\\_K:=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} n \\\\widehat{f}(n)^2\\\\le c_\\\\alpha \\\\f\\\\^2_{{\\\\rm Lip}_\\\\alpha} for \\\\f\\\\_{{\\\\rm Lip}_\\\\alpha} the constant in the H√∂lder condition, c_\\\\alpha a constant only dependent on \\\\alpha; \\\\f\\\\_K is the norm of the Krein algebra. Notice that the 1/2 here is essential‚Äîthere are 1/2-H√∂lder functions, which do not belong to the Wiener algebra. Besides, this theorem cannot improve the best known bound on the size of the Fourier coefficient of a Œ±-H√∂lder function‚Äîthat is only O(1/n^\\\\alpha) and then not summable. If ∆í is of bounded variation and belongs to a Œ±-H√∂lder class for some Œ± > 0, it belongs to the Wiener algebra. Norm convergence The simplest case is that of L2, which is a direct transcription of general Hilbert space results. According to the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem, if ∆í is square-integrable then :\\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi}\\\\leftf(x)-S_N(f) (x) \\\\right^2\\\\,dx=0 i.e., S_N f converges to ∆í in the norm of L2. It is easy to see that the converse is also true: if the limit above is zero, ∆í must be in L2. So this is an if and only if condition. If 2 in the exponents above is replaced with some p, the question becomes much harder. It turns out that the convergence still holds if 1 < p < ‚àû. In other words, for ∆í in Lp, S_N(f) converges to ∆í in the Lp norm. The original proof uses properties of holomorphic functions and Hardy spaces, and another proof, due to Salomon Bochner relies upon the Riesz‚ÄìThorin interpolation theorem. For p = 1 and infinity, the result is not true. The construction of an example of divergence in L1 was first done by Andrey Kolmogorov (see below). For infinity, the result is a corollary of the uniform boundedness principle. If the partial summation operator SN is replaced by a suitable summability kernel (for example the Fej√©r sum obtained by convolution with the Fej√©r kernel), basic functional analytic techniques can be applied to show that norm convergence holds for 1 ‚â§ p < ‚àû. Convergence almost everywhere The problem whether the Fourier series of any continuous function converges almost everywhere was posed by Nikolai Lusin in the 1920s. It was resolved positively in 1966 by Lennart Carleson. His result, now known as Carleson's theorem, tells the Fourier expansion of any function in L2 converges almost everywhere. Later on, Richard Hunt generalized this to Lp for any p > 1. Contrariwise, Andrey Kolmogorov, as a student at the age of 19, in his very first scientific work, constructed an example of a function in L1 whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere (later improved to diverge everywhere). Jean-Pierre Kahane and Yitzhak Katznelson proved that for any given set E of measure zero, there exists a continuous function ∆í such that the Fourier series of ∆í fails to converge on any point of E. Summability Does the sequence 0,1,0,1,0,1,... (the partial sums of Grandi's series) converge to ¬Ω? This does not seem like a very unreasonable generalization of the notion of convergence. Hence we say that any sequence a_n is Ces√†ro summable to some a if :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k=a. It is not difficult to see that if a sequence converges to some a then it is also Ces√†ro summable to it. To discuss summability of Fourier series, we must replace S_N with an appropriate notion. Hence we define :K_N(f;t)=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} S_n(f;t), \\\\quad N \\\\ge 1, and ask: does K_N(f) converge to f? K_N is no longer associated with Dirichlet's kernel, but with Fej√©r's kernel, namely :K_N(f)=f*F_N\\\\, where F_N is Fej√©r's kernel, :F_N=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} D_n. The main difference is that Fej√©r's kernel is a positive kernel. Fej√©r's theorem states that the above sequence of partial sums converge uniformly to ∆í. This implies much better convergence properties * If ∆í is continuous at t then the Fourier series of ∆í is summable at t to ∆í(t). If ∆í is continuous, its Fourier series is uniformly summable (i.e. K_N f converges uniformly to ∆í). * For any integrable ∆í, K_N f converges to ∆í in the L^1 norm. * There is no Gibbs phenomenon. Results about summability can also imply results about regular convergence. For example, we learn that if ∆í is continuous at t, then the Fourier series of ∆í cannot converge to a value different from ∆í(t). It may either converge to ∆í(t) or diverge. This is because, if S_N(f;t) converges to some value x, it is also summable to it, so from the first summability property above, x = ∆í(t). Order of growth The order of growth of Dirichlet's kernel is logarithmic, i.e. :\\\\int D_N(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi^2}\\\\log N+O(1). See Big O notation for the notation O(1). The actual value 4/\\\\pi^2 is both difficult to calculate (see Zygmund 8.3) and of almost no use. The fact that for some constant c we have :\\\\int D_N(t)\\\\,dt > c\\\\log N+O(1) is quite clear when one examines the graph of Dirichlet's kernel. The integral over the n-th peak is bigger than c/n and therefore the estimate for the harmonic sum gives the logarithmic estimate. This estimate entails quantitative versions of some of the previous results. For any continuous function f and any t one has :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{S_N(f;t)}{\\\\log N}=0. However, for any order of growth œâ(n) smaller than log, this no longer holds and it is possible to find a continuous function f such that for some t, :\\\\varlimsup_{N\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{S_N(f;t)}{\\\\omega(N)}=\\\\infty. The equivalent problem for divergence everywhere is open. Sergei Konyagin managed to construct an integrable function such that for every t one has :\\\\varlimsup_{N\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{S_N(f;t)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log N}}=\\\\infty. It is not known whether this example is best possible. The only bound from the other direction known is log n. Multiple dimensions Upon examining the equivalent problem in more than one dimension, it is necessary to specify the precise order of summation one uses. For example, in two dimensions, one may define :S_N(f;t_1,t_2)=\\\\sum_{n_1\\\\leq N,n_2\\\\leq N}\\\\widehat{f}(n_1,n_2)e^{i(n_1 t_1+n_2 t_2)} which are known as \\"square partial sums\\". Replacing the sum above with :\\\\sum_{n_1^2+n_2^2\\\\leq N^2} lead to \\"circular partial sums\\". The difference between these two definitions is quite notable. For example, the norm of the corresponding Dirichlet kernel for square partial sums is of the order of \\\\log^2 N while for circular partial sums it is of the order of \\\\sqrt{N}. Many of the results true for one dimension are wrong or unknown in multiple dimensions. In particular, the equivalent of Carleson's theorem is still open for circular partial sums. Almost everywhere convergence of \\"square partial sums\\" (as well as more general polygonal partial sums) in multiple dimensions was established around 1970 by Charles Fefferman.

It is a mosquito-borne, single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Five serotypes of the virus have been found,Dwivedi, V. D., Tripathi, I. P., Tripathi, R. C., Bharadwaj, S., & Mishra, S. K. (2017). Genomics, proteomics and evolution of Dengue virus. Briefings in functional genomics.16(4): 217‚Äì227, https://doi.org/10.1093/bfgp/elw040 all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease. Nevertheless, scientists' understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic, as rather than distinct antigenic groups, a continuum appears to exist. This same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus. Additionally, coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in real-world infections. Dengue virus has increased dramatically within the last 20 years, becoming one of the worst mosquito-borne human pathogens with which tropical countries have to deal. Current estimates indicate that as many as 390 million infections occur each year, and many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical. Evolution Based on the analysis of the envelope protein, at least three genotypes (1 to 3) are known. In 2013, a fourth serotype was reported. The rate of nucleotide substitution for this virus has been estimated to be 6.5 per nucleotide per year, a rate similar to other RNA viruses. The American African genotype has been estimated to have evolved between 1907 and 1949. This period includes World War I and World War II, which were associated with considerable movement of populations and environmental disturbance, factors known to promote the evolution of new vector-borne viral species. A Bayesian analysis of all four serotypes estimated that their most recent common ancestor existed about 340 AD (95% confidence interval: 280 BC-850 AD).Costa RL, Voloch CM, Schrago CG (2012) Comparative evolutionary epidemiology of dengue virus serotypes. Infect Genet Evol 12(2):309-314 Lifecycle Until a few hundred years ago, dengue virus was transmitted in sylvatic cycles in Africa, Southeast Asia and South Asia between mosquitoes of the genus Aedes and nonhuman primates, with rare emergences into human populations. The global spread of dengue virus, however, has followed its emergence from sylvatic cycles and the primary lifecycle now exclusively involves transmission between humans and Aedes mosquitoes. Vertical transmission from mosquito to mosquito has also been observed in some vector species. Dogs have been found to be infected by the virus, but more research is needed to determine if dogs or other animals can serve as reservoirs or are just incidental hosts. Recent findings suggest that as the virus infects human cells, host homeostatic processes such as autophagy and ER stress response, not to mention apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. The activation of autophagy and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction. Attempts to provide detailed summaries of the life cycle of dengue at the cellular level are published in review articles from different research groups. Genome The DENV genome is about 11000 bases of positive-sense, single stranded RNA (ssRNA) that codes for three structural proteins (capsid protein C, membrane protein M, envelope protein E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5). It also includes short noncoding regions on both the 5' and 3' ends. Structural and enzymatic proteins Cross section of a dengue virus showing structural components =E protein= The DENV E (envelope) protein, found as a dimer on the surface of the mature viral particle, is important in the initial attachment of this particle to the host cell. Each E protein monomer comprises three ectodomains, ED1 to ED3, and a transmembrane segment. ED2 includes the dimerization interface, two glycosylation sites, and the peptide of fusion with the cellular membrane. ED3 is a continuous polypeptide segment; its fold is compact and immunoglobulin-like. Dengue virus is transmitted by species of the mosquito genus Aedes. Several molecules that interact with the viral E protein (ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin, CD209, Rab 5, GRP 78, and the mannose receptor) have been shown to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry. The membrane form of ribosomal protein SA may also be involved in the attachment. Recombinant domains of the E protein are used as well-defined antigens in the serological detection of antibodies directed against dengue virus and as immunogens in vaccine candidates. =prM/M protein= The DENV prM (membrane) protein, which is important in the formation and maturation of the viral particle, consists of seven antiparallel Œ≤-strands stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The glycoprotein shell of the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E and M proteins. The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the trans-Golgi network, it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein, which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers, which lie flat against the viral surface, giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. During this maturation, pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein shell of the mature virion. The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell. =NS3 protein= The DENV NS3 is a serine protease, as well as an RNA helicase and RTPase/NTPase. The protease domain consists of six Œ≤-strands arranged into two Œ≤-barrels formed by residues 1‚Äì180 of the protein. The catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75 and Ser-135) is found between these two Œ≤-barrels, and activity is dependent on the presence of the NS2B cofactor. This cofactor wraps around the NS3 protease domain and becomes part of the active site. The remaining NS3 residues (180‚Äì618) form the three subdomains of the DENV helicase. A six-stranded parallel Œ≤-sheet surrounded by four Œ±-helices makes up subdomains I and II, and subdomain III is composed of four Œ±-helices surrounded by three shorter Œ±-helices and two antiparallel Œ≤-strands. =NS4A protein= DENV NS4A is a nonstructural protein involved in altering cell membrane curvature and induction of autophagy. In addition to its membrane altering property, NS4A is a scaffold for the virus replication complex and undergoes oligomerization. Mutations of NS4A that affect interaction with NS4B abolished or severely reduced virus replication indicating the importance of NS4A and its interaction with NS4B in dengue reproduction. Also, NS4A from four of the five serotypes of dengue all induce autophagy and protect infected cells from toxins via the ATM pathway, suggesting a conserved function for the protein among dengue viruses. =NS5 protein= The DENV NS5 protein is a 900-residue peptide with a methyltransferase domain at its N-terminal end (residues 1‚Äì296) and a RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) at its C-terminal end (residues 320‚Äì900). The methyltransferase domain consists of an Œ±/Œ≤/Œ≤ sandwich flanked by N-and C-terminal subdomains. The DENV RdRp is similar to other RdRps containing palm, finger, and thumb subdomains and a GDD motif for incorporating nucleotides. =Complexes between the E protein and neutralizing antibodies= Crystal structures of complexes between antibodies and either the ectodomain (sE) of the viral E protein or its domain 3 (ED3) have helped understand the molecular bases of the virus recognition and neutralization. Some of the epitopes are partially or totally inaccessible in the known structure of the mature virion. The corresponding antibodies are, therefore, assumed to bind to alternate or transitional conformations of the virus at 37 ¬∞C. * The murine antibody E111 neutralizes DENV1. Its Fab and scFv fragments were crystallized in complex with the ED3 domain of DENV1. Its epitope is located around Œ≤-strands C and C' of ED3, and the intervening loop. * The murine antibody 1A1D-2 strongly neutralizes DENV1, DENV2, and DENV3. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domain of DENV2. Its epitope straddles Œ≤-strands A and G of ED3. * The murine antibody 2H12 cross-reacts with all four DENV serotypes. It neutralizes the corresponding viruses, except DENV2. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domains of DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4. Its epitope is located around the conserved AB loop of ED3. * The murine antibody 4E11 neutralizes all four DENV serotypes with varying efficacies. Its scFv fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domains of the four DENV serotypes. Its epitope straddles Œ≤-strands A and G of ED3 as does the epitope of 1A1D-2. The structures at 2.0 √Ö resolution have enabled one to analyze the roles of water molecules within the protein interfaces and the roles of somatic hypermutations outside of these interfaces in the interactions and cross-recognitions. * The chimpanzee antibody 5H2 potently neutralizes DENV4. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the sE protein of DENV4. Its epitope is included in domain 1 (ED1) of the E protein. * The human antibodies Ede1-C10, Ede2-A11, and Ede2-B7 potently neutralize all four DENV serotypes. Their Fab or scFv fragments were crystallized in complex with the sE protein of DENV2. The recognition determinants of these antibodies are at a serotype-invariant site in the E dimer interface and include the exposed side chains of the E fusion loop and the two conserved glycan side- chains.

Dengue. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/infectious-diseases- related-to-travel/dengue A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that allergic symptoms are one of the core symptoms that are highly associated with dengue severity.  Mechanism of infection  # Dengue virus‚Äô (DENV) E envelope protein binds to a cellular receptor. The exact nature of the cellular receptor has not been fully elucidated. # DENV undergoes endocytosis. Acidification of the endosome leads to a conformational change of E, exposing a fusion peptide sequence that facilitates fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane, releasing the virion capsid into the cytoplasm. # Uncoating occurs in the cytoplasm # Host translational machinery (ribosomes) translates the (+)ssRNA into a single polypeptide # Cellular and viral proteinases cleave the polypeptide into 10 proteins (E, M, C and 7 nonstructural/enzymatic proteins) while embedded on the ER membrane. # As soon as functional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is synthesized, RNA replication can commence. Synthesis is asymmetrical, making 10 times more of the positive- sense strand than the negative. # Assembly occurs on intracellular membranes, which bud into the ER (forming the envelope from the ER membrane). Subsequent budding from the ER through the Golgi and into vesicles allows maturation via posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylation and pH transformational rearrangements # Egress occurs via exocytosis =Severe disease= Some people suffer from more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. Among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody- dependent enhancement, which happens when a person who has been previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third, or fourth time. The previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake. Immune system interaction In recent years, many studies have shown that flaviviruses, especially dengue virus, has the ability to inhibit the innate immune response during the infection. Indeed, dengue virus has many nonstructural proteins that allow the inhibition of various mediators of the innate immune system response. These proteins act on two levels : =Inhibition of interferon signaling by blocking signal transducer= NS4B is a small, hydrophobic protein located in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. It may block the phosphorylation of STAT 1 after induction by interferons type I alpha & beta. In fact, as the activity of Tyk2 kinase decreases in association with dengue virus, so too does STAT 1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the innate immune system's response to the virus is further damped as expression of interferon-stimulating gene(s) (ISG) is restricted by the aforementioned 'NS4B' protein. NS2A and NS4A cofactor may also take part in the STAT 1 inhibition. NS5 - the presence of this 105-kDa protein results in inactivation of STAT2 (via the signal transduction of the response to interferon) when it is expressed alone. When NS5 is cleaved with NS4B by a protease (NS2B3), it can degrade STAT2. In fact, after the cleavage of NS5 by the protease, an E3 ligase association with STAT2 occurs, and the E3 ligase targets STAT2 for the degradation. =Inhibition of the type I interferon response= NS2B3-b protease complex is a proteolytic core consisting of the last 40 amino acids of NS2B and the first 180 amino acids of NS3. Cleavage of the NS2B3 precursor activates the protease complex. This protease complex allows the inhibition of the production of type I interferon by reducing the activity of IFN-beta promoter; NS2B3 protease complex is involved in inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3. The NS2B3 protease complex inhibits (by cleaving) protein MITA which allows the IRF3 activation. = Mosquito D7 saliva protein = Dengue virus is transmitted by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which produces saliva that contains over 100 unique proteins, including the protein family D7. Scientists used to believe that A. aegypti saliva, when being transmitted, actually enhanced dengue virus in the body. The mosquito's saliva was thought to make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host. However, a current study has found that the protein D7 hinders the virus transmission into the host cells. The immune responses of antibodies that are trying to fight off the foreign virus actually increase transmission and make the infection worse. Levels of protein D7 are more prevalent in salivary glands of dengue-infected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected ones. D7 is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding. Despite the prior assumptions, D7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent viral infection. Unfortunately, D7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-D7 antibody levels. These antibodies inhibit the function of D7 proteins, which enhance transmission of dengue virus. Although immune responses against D7 proteins might impair their antiviral activity, a study showed that non- DENV subjects have slightly higher anti-D7 IgG levels than infected ones, although it was not statistically significant. Thus, more studies over D7 protein family are needed do elucidate its role on DENV infection and its applicability in medicine. = Vaccine research = Only one vaccine for dengue is currently approved in 11 countries (Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Guatemala, Peru, Thailand, and Singapore). Several vaccines are under development by private and public researchers.Vaccine Development , Dengue Vaccine Initiative, November 2012, accessed November 5, 2013 Developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging. With four different serotypes of the virus that can cause the disease, the vaccine must immunize against all four types to be effective. Vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock when infected with another serotype due to antibody- dependent enhancement. When infected with dengue virus, the immune system produces cross-reactive antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype. However, these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication. When macrophages consume the ‚Äòneutralized‚Äô virus, the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage, causing disease. These cross-reactive, ineffective antibodies ease access of virus into macrophages, which induces more severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). A common problem faced in dengue-endemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue; after giving birth, offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected with any of the other three serotypes. One vaccine was in phase III trials in 2012 and planning for vaccine usage and effectiveness surveillance had started. In 2009, Sanofi- Pasteur started building a new facility in ' (fr), a suburb of Lyon (France). This unit produces four-serotype vaccine for phase III trials. In September 2014, the Sanofi-Pasteur CEO gave early results of the phase III trial efficacy study in Latin America. The efficacy per serotype (ST) varied widely, 42.3% for ST2, 50.3% for ST1, 74.0% for ST3, and 77.7% for ST4. The full analysis of data from the phase III Latin American-Caribbean study will be reviewed by external experts before being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Primary results has to be presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting, held November 2‚Äì6, 2014, in New Orleans. In September 2012, one of the vaccines was reported to not have done well in clinical trials. In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi-Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9‚Äì45 years of age living in endemic areas. On May 1, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of Dengvaxia, the first vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes in people ages 9 through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas. Dengue is endemic in the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.First FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease in endemic regions https://www.fda.gov/news- events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-dengue- disease-endemic-regions = Drug research = There are no approved direct antiviral treatments for Dengue fever. Most antiviral drug research for Dengue infections has focussed on inhibition of the NS2B/NS3 protease or NS5 proteins. One drug, Balapiravir, a repurposed hepatitis C NS5 polymerase inhibitor progressed to a Phase II clinical trial before being stopped due to lack of efficacy.

If it occurs to all wheels simultaneously, the vehicle becomes, in effect, an uncontrolled sled. Aquaplaning is a different phenomenon from when water on the surface of the roadway merely acts as a lubricant. Traction is diminished on wet pavement even when aquaplaning is not occurring. Causes Every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface. The grooves of a rubber tire are designed to disperse water from beneath the tire, providing high friction even in wet conditions. Aquaplaning occurs when a tire encounters more water than it can dissipate. Water pressure in front of the wheel forces a wedge of water under the leading edge of the tire, causing it to lift from the road. The tire then skates on a sheet of water with little, if any, direct road contact, and loss of control results. If multiple tires aquaplane, the vehicle may lose directional control and slide until it either collides with an obstacle, or slows enough that one or more tires contact the road again and friction is regained. The risk of aquaplaning increases with the depth of standing water and the sensitivity of a vehicle to that water depth. =Water depth factors= Ruts in a road. * Depth of compacted wheel tracks and longitudinal depressions: Heavy vehicles can cause ruts in the pavement over time that allow water to pool. * Pavement micro- and macrotexture: Concrete can be preferable to hotmix asphalt because it offers better resistance to rut formation, though this depends on the age of the surface and the construction techniques employed while paving. Concrete also requires special attention to ensure that it has sufficient texture. * Pavement cross slope and grade: Cross slope is the extent to which the cross- section of a road resembles an upturned U. Higher cross slopes allow water to drain more easily. Grade is the steepness of the road at a particular point, which affects both drainage and force exerted by the vehicle on the road. Vehicles are less likely to aquaplane while traveling uphill, and far more likely to do so at the trough of two connected hills where water tends to pool. The resultant of cross slope and grade is called drainage gradient or \\"resulting grade\\". Most road design manuals require that the drainage gradient in all road sections must exceed 0.5%, in order to avoid a thick water film during and after rainfall. Areas where the drainage gradient may fall below the minimum limit 0.5% are found at the entrance and exit of banked outer curves. These hot spots are typically less than 1% of the road length, but a large share of all skid crashes occur there. One method for the road designer to reduce the crash risk is to move the cross slope transition from the outer curve and to a straight road section, where lateral forces are lower. If possible, the cross slope transition should be placed in a slight up- or downgrade, thereby avoiding that the drainage gradient drops to zero. The UK road design manual actually calls for placement of a cross slope transition in an artificially created slope, if needed. In some cases, permeable asphalt or concrete can be used to improve drainage in the cross slope transitions. * Width of pavement: Wider roads require a higher cross slope to achieve the same degree of drainage. * Roadway curvature * Rainfall intensity and duration =Vehicle sensitivity factors= * The driver's speed, acceleration, braking, and steering * Tire tread wear: Worn tires will aquaplane more easily for lack of tread depth. Half-worn treads result in aquaplaning about 3‚Äì4 mph (5‚Äì7 km/h) lower than with full-tread tires. * Tire inflation pressure: Underinflation can cause a tire to deflect inward, raising the tire center and preventing the tread from clearing water. * Tire tread aspect ratio: The longer and thinner the contact patch, the less likely a tire will aquaplane. tires that present the greatest risk are small in diameter and wide. * Vehicle weight: More weight on a properly inflated tire lengthens the contact patch, improving its aspect ratio. Weight can have the opposite effect if the tire is underinflated. * Vehicle type: Combination vehicles like semi-trailers are more likely to experience uneven aquaplaning caused by uneven weight distribution. An unloaded trailer will aquaplane sooner than the cab pulling it. Pickup trucks or SUVs towing trailers also present similar problems. There is no precise equation to determine the speed at which a vehicle will aquaplane. Existing efforts have derived rules of thumb from empirical testing. In general, cars start to aquaplane at speeds above 45-58 mph (72-93 km/h). =Motorcycles= Motorcycles benefit from narrow tires with round, canoe-shaped contact patches. Narrow tires are less vulnerable to aquaplaning because vehicle weight is distributed over a smaller area, and rounded tires more easily push water aside. These advantages diminish on lighter motorcycles with naturally wide tires, like those in the supersport class. Further, wet conditions reduce the lateral force that any tire can accommodate before sliding. While a slide in a four-wheeled vehicle may be corrected, the same slide on a motorcycle will generally cause the rider to fall. Thus, despite the relative lack of aquaplaning danger in wet conditions, motorcycle riders must be even more cautious because overall traction is reduced by wet roadways. In motor vehicles = Speed = It's possible to approximate the speed at which total hydroplaning occurs, with the following equation. V_p=10.35\\\\sqrt{p} Where p is the tire pressure in psi and the result V_pis the speed in mph for when the vehicle will begin to totally hydroplane. Considering an example vehicle with a tire pressure of 35 psi, we can approximate that 61 mph is the speed when the tires would lose contact with the road's surface. However, the above equation only gives a very rough approximation. Resistance to aquaplaning is governed by several different factors, chiefly vehicle weight, tyre width and tread pattern, as all affect the surface pressure exerted on the road by the tyre over a given area of the contact patch - a narrow tyre with a lot of weight placed upon it and an aggressive tread pattern will resist aquaplaning at far higher speeds than a wide tyre on a light vehicle with minimal tread. Furthermore, the likelihood of aquaplaning drastically increases with water depth. =Response= What the driver experiences when a vehicle aquaplanes depends on which wheels have lost traction and the direction of travel. If the vehicle is traveling straight, it may begin to feel slightly loose. If there was a high level of road feel in normal conditions, it may suddenly diminish. Small correctional control inputs have no effect. If the drive wheels aquaplane, there may be a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and indicated speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the car will suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, the back of the car will slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels aquaplane at once, the car will slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn. When any or all of the wheels regain traction, there may be a sudden jerk in whatever direction that wheel is pointed. =Recovery= Control inputs tend to be counterproductive while aquaplaning. If the car is not in a turn, easing off the accelerator may slow it enough to regain traction. Steering inputs may put the car into a skid from which recovery would be difficult or impossible. If braking is unavoidable, the driver should do so smoothly and be prepared for instability. If the rear wheels aquaplane and cause oversteer, the driver should steer in the direction of the skid until the rear tires regain traction, and then rapidly steer in the other direction to straighten the car. =Prevention by the driver= The best strategy is to avoid contributors to aquaplaning. Proper tire pressure, narrow and unworn tires, and reduced speeds from those judged suitably moderate in the dry will mitigate the risk of aquaplaning, as will avoidance of standing water. Electronic stability control systems cannot replace defensive driving techniques and proper tire selection. These systems rely on selective wheel braking, which depends in turn on road contact. While stability control may help recovery from a skid when a vehicle slows enough to regain traction, it cannot prevent aquaplaning. Because pooled water and changes in road conditions can require a smooth and timely reduction in speed, cruise control should not be used on wet or icy roads. In aircraft Aquaplaning may reduce the effectiveness of wheel braking in aircraft on landing or aborting a takeoff, when it can cause the aircraft to run off the end of the runway. Aquaplaning was a factor in an accident to Qantas Flight 1 when it ran off the end of the runway in Bangkok in 1999 during heavy rain. Aircraft which can employ reverse thrust braking have the advantage over road vehicles in such situations, as this type of braking is not affected by aquaplaning, but it requires a considerable distance to operate as it is not as effective as wheel braking on a dry runway. Aquaplaning is a condition that can exist when an aircraft is landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush, and/or wet snow. Aquaplaning can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of aquaplaning are dynamic aquaplaning, reverted rubber aquaplaning, and viscous aquaplaning. Any one of the three can render an aircraft partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll. However this can be prevented by grooves on runways. In 1965, a US delegation visited the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to view their grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning and initiated a study by the FAA and NASA. Grooving has since been adopted by most major airports around the world. Thin grooves are cut in the concrete which allows for water to be dissipated and further reduces the potential to aquaplane. =Types= Viscous Viscous aquaplaning is due to the viscous properties of water. A thin film of fluid no more than 0.025 mm in depth is all that is needed. The tire cannot penetrate the fluid and the tire rolls on top of the film. This can occur at a much lower speed than dynamic aquaplane, but requires a smooth or smooth-acting surface such as asphalt or a touchdown area coated with the accumulated rubber of past landings. Such a surface can have the same friction coefficient as wet ice. Dynamic Dynamic aquaplaning is a relatively high-speed phenomenon that occurs when there is a film of water on the runway that is at least 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) deep. As the speed of the aircraft and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance to displacement, resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the aquaplaning speed (Vp), the upward force generated by water pressure equals the weight of the aircraft and the tire is lifted off the runway surface. In this condition, the tires no longer contribute to directional control, and braking action is nil. Dynamic aquaplaning is generally related to tire inflation pressure. Tests have shown that for tires with significant loads and enough water depth for the amount of tread so that the dynamic head pressure from the speed is applied to the whole contact patch, the minimum speed for dynamic aquaplaning (Vp) in knots is about 9 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an aircraft tire pressure of 64 PSI, the calculated aquaplaning speed would be approximately 72 knots. This speed is for a rolling, non-slipping wheel; a locked wheel reduces the Vp to 7.7 times the square root of the pressure. Therefore, once a locked tire starts aquaplaning it will continue until the speed reduces by other means (air drag or reverse thrust). Reverted rubber Reverted rubber (steam) aquaplaning occurs during heavy braking that results in a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film of water on the runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced reverted rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive 'steam-cleaned' marks on the runway surface and a patch of reverted rubber on the tire. Reverted rubber aquaplaning frequently follows an encounter with dynamic aquaplaning, during which time the pilot may have the brakes locked in an attempt to slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber aquaplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less). =Reducing risk= Any aquaplaning tire reduces both braking effectiveness and directional control. When confronted with the possibility of aquaplaning, pilots are advised to land on a grooved runway (if available). Touchdown speed should be as slow as possible consistent with safety. After the nosewheel is lowered to the runway, moderate braking should be applied. If deceleration is not detected and aquaplaning is suspected, the nose should be raised and aerodynamic drag utilized to decelerate to a point where the brakes do become effective. Proper braking technique is essential. The brakes should be applied firmly until reaching a point just short of a skid. At the first sign of a skid, the pilot should release brake pressure and allow the wheels to spin up. Directional control should be maintained as far as possible with the rudder. In a crosswind, if aquaplaning should occur, the crosswind will cause the aircraft to simultaneously weathervane into the wind (i.e. the nose will turn toward the wind) as well as slide downwind (the plane will tend to slide in the direction the air is moving). For small aircraft, holding the nose up as if performing a soft field landing and using the rudder to aerodynamically maintain directional control while holding the upwind aileron in the best position to prevent lifting the wing should help. However, avoid landing in heavy rain where the crosswind component of the wind is higher than the maximum demonstrated crosswind listed in the Pilot Operations Handbook.

A long, narrow boat with a sliding seat and rigged with two oars per rower may be referred to as a scull, its oars may be referred to as sculls, and a person rowing it referred to as sculler. Sculling is distinguished from sweep rowing, whereby each boat crew member employs a single oar, complemented by another crew member on the opposite side with an oar, usually with each pulling an oar with two hands; and from stern sculling, which uses a single oar to propel a vessel with side-to-side movements from the stern. Overview =Early developments= The principle employed in sculling is also used in a screw propelle. The skill of propelling a Venetian gondola was used in a less refined way in other parts of Europe and probably elsewhere. For example, propelling a canoe with a single paddle using a \\"pitch stroke\\" or side slipping a canoe with a \\"scull\\" involves a similar technique. In China, sculling, called \\"lu\\", was also used by the 3rd century AD. In sculling, a single blade is moved through an arc, from side to side taking care to keep presenting the blade to the water at the effective angle. The innovation introduced with the screw propeller was the extension of that arc through more than 360¬∞ by attaching the blade to a rotating shaft. Propellers can have a single blade, but in practice there are nearly always more than one so as to balance the forces involved. Sculling oars for competitive rowing Sculling is a form of rowing in which a boat is propelled by one or more rowers, each of whom operates two oars, one held in the fingers and upper palm of each hand. This contrasts with the other common method of rowing, sweep rowing, in which each rower may use both hands to operate a single oar on either the port or starboard side of the boat. Sculling is generally considered the more technically complex of the two disciplines. Sculling can either be competitive or recreational, but the watercraft used will vary between the two as the racing shells of competitive rowing are built for speed rather than stability. Racing shells are also far more expensive and fragile than what is suitable for the recreational rower; a typical racing shell sells for thousands of dollars while recreational sculling boats may cost significantly less. =In crew = Quad, Germany, 1982. Stroke Seat: Martin Winter. 3 Seat: Uwe Heppner. 2 Seat: Uwe Mund. Bow Seat: Karl-Heinz Bu√üert. Sculling, one of the two major divisions of crew (or competitive rowing), is composed of races between small, sculled boats manned by various numbers of rowers. Generally, one, two, or four athletes row these shells. These shells are classified according to the number of rowers that they can hold: singles have one seat, doubles have two, and quads have four. In keeping with this pattern, quads rowed by three people (due, for instance, to a temporary shortage of rowers) are often colloquially referred to as \\"triples\\". The boat manufacturer 'Stampfl√Ø' has created a triple with only three seats (rather than using a quad occupied by three people). A rare sculling shell is the octuple, rowed by an eight-man crew, which is sometimes used by large rowing programs to teach novice rowers how to scull in a balanced, coxed boat. The physical movement of sculling is split into two main parts: the drive and the recovery. These two parts are separated by what is called the \\"catch\\" and the \\"finish\\". The drive is the section of the rowing stroke where the face of the oars, also known as blades, are firmly placed in the water and the rower is propelling the boat forwards by pulling against the anchor the oars provide. The recovery is the section where the rower's blades are not in the water, but instead gliding above it as the rower prepares for the next stroke. The catch is the moment the blades are dropped into the water at the end of the recovery and the start of the drive, while the finish is when the blades are slipping out after the drive is done and the recovery is beginning. In order to improve balance on the recovery, the blades are feathered, or held parallel to the surface of the water, at the finish, and squared (perpendicular to the water surface) at the catch. Competitive crew requires an efficient stroke with all rowers matching the cadence and movements of the stroke seat, the rower closest to the shell's stern. The shell may have a coxswain, or \\"cox,\\" to steer the boat, encourage the crew, and monitor the rate, though coxswains are highly uncommon in competitive sculling shells and the rower in bow seat usually takes on these responsibilities instead. The bow-most rower may have equipment that attaches the skeg of the shell to one of the bow's shoes to aid with the steering; without such equipment, a sculling boat is directed by uneven pressure applied to the opposing blades. A key technical difference between sculling and sweeping in crew is that the sculling oar handles overlap twice during the stroke, while sweep oar handles never overlap during normal rowing (because each sweeper usually holds only one oar). The overlap occurs at the midpoint of the drive and again during the recovery; because of this, scullers must hold one hand (conventionally the left hand) higher than the other at the point of overlap. To prevent this from impacting the balance of the boat, one oarlock (conventionally the starboard one, to the rower's lefthand side) is rigged higher than the other prior to rowing. This prevents the oar handles from colliding with one another and causing a crab or other problems.

Life Mie was born in Rostock, Mecklenburg- Schwerin, Germany in 1868. From 1886 he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Rostock. In addition to his major subjects, he also attended lectures in chemistry, zoology, geology, mineralogy, astronomy as well as logic and metaphysics. In 1889 he continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and received a doctorate degree in mathematics at the age of 22. In 1897 he got his Habilitation at the University of G√∂ttingen in theoretical physics and in 1902 became extraordinary professor for theoretical physics at the University of Greifswald. In 1917 he became full professor for experimental physics at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. In 1924 he became Professor at the University of Freiburg, where he worked up to his retirement in 1935. In Freiburg, during the Nazi dictatorship, Mie was member of the university opposition of the so-called \\"Freiburger Kreis\\" (Freiburg Circles) and one of the participants of the original \\"Freiburger Konzil\\". He died at Freiburg im Breisgau in 1957. Work During his Greifswald years Mie worked on the computation of scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous dielectric sphere, which was published in 1908 under the title of ‚ÄúContributions to the optics of turbid media, particularly of colloidal metal solutions‚Äù in \\"Annalen der Physik\\". The term Mie scattering is still related to his name. Using Maxwell's electromagnetic theory applied to spherical gold particles Mie provided a theoretical treatment of plasmon resonance absorption of gold colloids. The sharp absorption bands depend on the particle size and explain the change in colour that occurs as the size of the colloid nanoparticles is increased from 20 to 1600 nm. He wrote further important contributions to electromagnetism and also to relativity theory. In addition he was employed on measurements units and finally developed his Mie system of units in 1910 with the basic units Volt, Ampere, Coulomb and Second (VACS- system). Honors A crater on Mars was named in his honor, and also a building of the University of Freiburg as well as the Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenberg, where he first became a full professor, carries his name.

LAWA formerly owned and operated Ontario International Airport (ONT) and Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD) as well. Its headquarters are on the grounds of LAX in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Westchester.  History  LAWA was established in 1928 as the Los Angeles Department of Airports for the purpose of operating Los Angeles Municipal Airport, originally known as Mines Field. The Department of Airports changed its name to Los Angeles World Airports in 1997. = Los Angeles International Airport = Los Angeles Municipal Airport eventually became Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). = Van Nuys Airport = In 1949, LAWA acquired the Van Nuys Army Airfield in the San Fernando Valley from the U.S. War Assets Administration for the token fee of one dollar. LAWA changed the airfield's name to San Fernando Valley Airport before renaming it Van Nuys Airport (VNY). = Ontario International Airport = In 1967, the city of Ontario in neighboring San Bernardino County asked LAWA to enter into a Joint Powers Agreement for the operation and management of Ontario International Airport (ONT). LAWA acquired ONT from the city of Ontario in 1985 and expanded the airport's 485 acres of land to more than 1,700 acres and invested more than US$500 million in improvements. In April 2013, the city of Ontario filed a legal complaint against LAWA alleging mismanagement of ONT, ultimately resulting in a 40% decline of traffic between 2007 and 2013. LAWA countered the complaint citing the Great Recession was responsible for the decline in activity. After years of negotiations, LAWA sold back its shares of ONT to the newly-formed Ontario International Airport Authority (OIAA) in December 2015 for a total of US$190 million. It transferred operational management of the airport to OIAA on November 1, 2016. = Palmdale Regional Airport = In 1969, LAWA began searching for the location of a secondary international airport to relieve congestion at LAX. The location that LAWA decided on was in the Antelope Valley near the city of Palmdale. From 1969 to 1983, LAWA acquired over 17,500 acres through voluntary acquisitions and eminent domain to develop an intercontinental airport. Development of \\"Palmdale Intercontinental Airport\\" never materialized due in part to lack of demand for commercial air services, environmental litigation, and opposition from the United States Air Force (USAF) whose United States Air Force Plant 42 is located adjacent to LAWA-acquired land. LAWA entered into a lease agreement with the USAF to use Air Force Plant 42 runways and to build and operate a small terminal. Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD) began commercial operations in June 1971, but was not able to maintain steady demand with passenger traffic peaking in 1978 with 36,000 passengers before airline services eventually ceased in 1983. Two airlines began operating commercial services at PMD in 1990, but were again unable to maintain demand and ended services in 1998. In June 2007, United Airlines began operating at PMD, but ceased operations in December 2008 citing lack of demand. At the end of 2013, LAWA transferred its lease with the USAF to the city of Palmdale.  Operations  = Airports = Los Angeles World Airports owns and operates two airports: *Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in the city of Los Angeles *Van Nuys Airport (VNY) in the Van Nuys neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley = Ground transportation = LAWA operates the FlyAway bus service, which runs four shuttle routes between LAX and the following: Van Nuys Airport, Los Angeles Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Long Beach. The agency is building and plans to operate the LAX Automated People Mover. = Landholdings = LAWA still owns over 17,500 acres of land in the Antelope Valley that was acquired for the yet-to-be-developed \\"Palmdale Intercontinental Airport\\" and leases portions of it. = Revenue and expenditures = LAWA raises revenue by collecting aircraft landing fees, in addition to property leases and concession fees from airport tenants. Expenditures include runway and building maintenance fees, capital improvements and administration.  Governance  LAWA is a branch of the city of Los Angeles and is governed by a seven-member Board of Airport Commissioners. The Los Angeles City Charter requires one member to reside within the area surrounding LAX and another member to reside within the area surrounding VNY. The board is appointed by the Mayor of Los Angeles and approved by Los Angeles City Council. The Mayor also appoints the Executive Director who oversees over 4,000 employees and the day-to-day operations of the two airports. The current Executive Director is Deborah A. Flint, who was appointed in June 2015. = Board of Airport Commissioners = As of May 2019, the Board of Airport Commissioners are as follows: * Sean O. Burton, President * Valeria C. Velasco, Vice President * Gabriel L. Eshaghian * Beatrice C. Hsu * Nicholas P. Roxborough * Thomas S. Sayles * Cynthia A. Telles = List of Executive Directors = Below is the list of LAWA Executive Directors from 1928 to the present: * Clifford W. Henderson (1928-1938) * Richard Barnitz (1938-1940) * Woodruff DeSilva (1940-1944) * Clarence Young (1944-1950) * John W. Reeves Jr. (1950-1954) * Robert A. McMillan (1954-1959) * Francis T.

Flint (2015‚Äìpresent)  Law enforcement  LAWA maintains its own police department, the Los Angeles Airport Police sometimes referred to as \\"LAWAPD\\" or \\"LAXPD\\". LAWAPD is the fourth largest law enforcement agency in Los Angeles County, with more than 1,100 law enforcement, security and staff personnel. LAWAPD has patrolled jointly with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) since the opening of the current terminal area in 1961. In 2002 then-mayor James Hahn assigned additional LAPD officers to LAX to provide armed law enforcement officer coverage at passenger screening stations. Those officers are trained by LAWAPD officers to perform this function. They are assigned on an overtime basis, with LAWA reimbursing LAPD and, in turn, receiving substantial reimbursement from the Transportation Security Administration.

As one of the most familiar of the \\"Arabian Nights\\" tales, it has been widely retold and performed in many media, especially for children, for whom the more violent aspects of the story are often suppressed. In the original version, Ali Baba ( ') is a poor woodcutter who discovers the secret of a thieves' den, and enters with the magic phrase \\"Open Sesame\\". The thieves try to kill Ali Baba, but Ali Baba's faithful slave-girl foils their plots. Ali Baba's son marries her and Ali Baba keeps the secret of the treasure. Textual history The tale was added to the story collection One Thousand and One Nights by one of its European translators, Antoine Galland, who called his volumes Les Mille et Une Nuits (1704‚Äì1717). Galland was an 18th-century French Orientalist who heard it in oral form from a Maronite story-teller, called Hanna Diyab, who came from Aleppo in modern-day Syria and told the story in Paris.Goodman, John (17 Dec 2017). Marvellous Thieves adds a new chapter to Arabian Nights - Paulo Lemos Horta gives 'secret authors' their due in his study of the World Literature classic. North Shore News. In any case, the earliest known text of the story is Galland's French version. Richard F. Burton included it in the supplemental volumes (rather than the main collection of stories) of his translation (published as The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night) and thought its origins were Greek Cypriot. (n.) The American Orientalist Duncan Black MacDonald discovered an Arabic-language manuscript of the story at the Bodleian Library; however, this was later found to be a counterfeit. Story of Afternoon Ali Baba and his older brother, Cassim, are the sons of a merchant. After their father's death, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, building on their father's business. Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter. One day, Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, when he happens to overhear a group of 40 thieves visiting their stored treasure. Their treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by a huge rock. It opens on the magic words \\"open sesame\\" and seals itself on the words \\"close sesame\\". When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself and takes a single bag of gold coins home. Ali Baba and his wife borrow his sister-in-law's scales to weigh their new wealth. Unbeknownst to them, Cassim's wife puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali Baba is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave, taking a donkey with him to take as much treasure as possible. He enters the cave with the magic words. However, in his greed and excitement over the treasure, he forgets the words to get out again and ends up trapped. The thieves find him there and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the cave's entrance, as a warning to anyone else who might try to enter. Ali Baba brings the body home where he entrusts Morgiana, a clever slave-girl from Cassim's household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim's house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassim's body back together. Ali Baba and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone suspecting anything. The thieves, finding the body gone, realize that another person must know their secret, and they set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn a dead man's body back together. Realizing the dead man must have been the thieves' victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. The thief marks the door with a symbol so the other thieves can come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana who, loyal to her master, foils the thief's plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood similarly. When the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house, and their leader kills the unsuccessful thief in a furious rage. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again. Only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba's front door. Again, Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps, and the second thief is killed for his failure as well. At last, the leader of the thieves goes and looks himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba's house. The leader of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba's hospitality, bringing with him mules loaded with 38 oil jars, one filled with oil, the other 37 hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan, killing the 37 thieves in their oil jars by pouring boiling oil on them. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers they are all dead and escapes. The next morning, Morgiana tells Ali Baba about the thieves in the jars. They bury them, and Ali Baba shows his gratitude by giving Morgiana her freedom. To exact revenge, the leader of the thieves establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba's son (who is now in charge of the late Cassim's business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba's house. However, the thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a sword dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the thief's heart, when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief wanted to kill him, he is extremely grateful and rewards Morgiana by marrying her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it.

Rik Mayall starred as the title character: a happy, anarchic, and mischievous imaginary friend of a young girl named Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates) and nemesis of her overbearing mother Polly (Marsha Mason). He causes chaos around her home and neighborhood, but nobody can see him except her. When she grows up and has an emotional crisis, he returns to \\"cheer her up\\" in his own unique way, causing more chaos than ever before. The supporting cast included Carrie Fisher, Ron Eldard, Tim Matheson, and Bridget Fonda. Plot Elizabeth Cronin is an unassertive and repressed woman, dominated by her controlling mother Polly, who blames her for her divorce. While taking her lunch break from work, she visits her husband Charles, from whom she is separated, hoping to sort out their problems. He reasserts his desire for a divorce and says that he is in love with another woman named Annabella. While she is at a public phone, a man walking down the street breaks into her car to steal her purse, and then her car. Forced to run back to work at the courthouse, she arrives late and loses her job. As she leaves the courthouse, she runs into an old friend, Mickey, who brings up childhood memories they shared, which includes memories of Elizabeth's childhood imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred. Mickey explains how only Elizabeth could see Drop Dead Fred, and everybody else thought she was crazy. A series of flashbacks reveals that while he caused havoc for her, he also gave her happiness and a release from her oppressive mother. After a pep talk from her friend Janie, Elizabeth moves back into her mother's home, having nowhere else to go. Elizabeth finds the taped-shut jack-in-the-box that Polly trapped Fred inside in her childhood bedroom. She removes the tape, releasing Fred. He agrees to help her feel better, which she believes will only happen when she wins back Charles. However, his childish antics do more harm than good. He sinks Janie's houseboat, causes havoc at a restaurant, and tricks Elizabeth into attacking a violinist in a shopping mall. Worried by Elizabeth's recent strange behavior, Polly takes her to a (children's) psychologist. In the waiting room, Fred is seen meeting up with the imaginary friends of other patients, who are all children. The doctor prescribes medication to rid her of Fred, whom he and Polly believe is a figment of her imagination. She also changes her appearance and wardrobe. Charles now wants her back and she is overjoyed, until Fred discovers he is still cheating on her with Annabella. Heartbroken, she tells Fred that she cannot leave Charles, because she is scared of being alone. They escape to a dream sequence in which she is finally able to reject him and stand up to Polly, declaring she is no longer afraid of her. She frees her imprisoned childhood self. Fred tells her that she no longer needs him, so they kiss and he disappears. Upon awakening from the dream, Elizabeth dumps Charles and asserts herself to Polly. Before leaving, she reconciles with Polly and encourages her to find a friend to escape her own loneliness. She visits Mickey and his daughter Natalie, who blames Drop Dead Fred on mischief that has just prompted her nanny to quit. Elizabeth realizes that he is now with Natalie, although she can no longer see him.

They turned the project down. Filming began in August 1990, and finished in September that year. Filmed in Minneapolis, a large part of Drop Dead Fred was filmed at Prince's Paisley Park Studios in the suburb of Chanhassen. It has been said that Prince used to visit the set, each evening once filming had stopped for the day, to mess around and admire the costumes and props. Reception =Box office= The film, produced on a budget of just under $6.8 million, was released theatrically in North America on May 24, 1991, grossing $3,625,648 on its opening weekend, and $13,878,334 over its entire theatrical run. =Critical response= Drop Dead Fred was critically panned upon release but has gone on to become a cult film. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 11% based on 36 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Tackling mature themes with an infantile sensibility, Drop Dead Fred is an ill-conceived family comedy that is more likely to stir up a headache than the imagination.\\" On Metacritic it has a score of 25% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars and said \\"This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Margaret Lyons asked, \\"Is it supposed to be hilarious, or a really, really depressing story about the long-term effects of emotional abuse?\\" Leonard Maltin stated that \\"Phoebe Cates' appealing performance can't salvage this putrid mess...recommended only for people who think nose-picking is funny.\\" Peter Freedman of the Radio Times called it a \\"largely uninteresting and unfunny comedy\\" and \\"It's a nice idea, but it falls between all available stools and ends up as a mess on the floor thanks to the poor execution. It's particularly irritating if you've seen the much better Harvey.\\" Angie Errigo of Empire magazine wrote: \\"There is scarcely a laugh to be had unless you are six years old or immoderately fond of such wheezes as depositing dog poop on a white carpet\\". Writing for Mystical Movie Guide, Carl J. Schroeder wrote, \\"The imaginary friend is cavortingly rude for a reason; he served to push the girlchild to do mischief for attention and as a cry for help. Now grown up, the woman has forgotten and is about to lose her soul, so events call for some kind of literal return of her demon to force the exposure of her pain. This psychic crisis is poignantly realistic... The creature who is visible only to the woman is like a poltergeist energy of her repressed self, a problematic ego container into which her powers of assertion and creativity were poured and stored. The movie's resolution is startlingly beautiful.\\" References External links * * Category:1991 films Category:1990s black comedy films Category:1990s fantasy-comedy films Category:1991 independent films Category:American black comedy films Category:American fantasy-comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:British black comedy films Category:British fantasy films Category:British films Category:British independent films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 1970 Category:Films set in 1991 Category:Films set in Minnesota Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:PolyGram Filmed Entertainment films Category:Working Title Films films Category:Films scored by Randy Edelman ","title":"Drop Dead Fred"},{"id":"927403","title":"Lloyd M.

Prior to the conflict, two white trappers were killed by the Kake in retribution for the death of two Kake departing Sitka village by canoe. Sitka was the site of a standoff between the Army and Tlingit due to the army demanding the surrender of chief Colchika who was involved in an altercation in Fort Sitka. The loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to several Kake deaths during the winter. The Kake did not rebuild the small villages destroyed. Some dispersed to other villages, while others remained in the vicinity of Kake, eventually rebuilding the present day Kake. Background Following the Alaska Purchase, the United States Army came to Alaska to serve as the civil administering entity of the Department of Alaska. The U.S. authorities used common law, while the Tlingit people used indigenous law. Americans generally characterized the Tlingit legal framework as based on \\"revenge\\"; in actuality, it was more complex and involved \\"peace ceremonies\\" which included compensation in either goods or human lives.Harring, Sidney L. \\"The Incorporation of Alaskan Natives Under American Law: United States and Tlingit Sovereignty, 1867-1900.\\" Ariz. L. Rev. 31 (1989): 279. Events leading to war Sitka, Group of Distinguished Chiefs (1868) Sitka, Indian Village (1868) On New Year's Day 1869, three Tlingit chiefs (Colchika a Chilkat leader from Haines, Alaska), Kalsteix \\"Sitka Jack\\", and an unidentified chief) were invited to visit Fort Sitka to meet with Jefferson C. Davis. A sentry at the entrance to the fort challenged them, and after they ignored the challenge, kicked Colchika in the buttocks. In the ensuing scuffle, Colchika disarmed the soldier and walked away from the fort with his rifle. Upon hearing of the incident, Davis sent a small detachment to the nearby Sitka village to \\"bring in the Chilkat chief dead or alive\\". A firefight in the village ensued in which a Tlingit slave was killed, and Colchika and four others were wounded. The detachment then retreated as the Tlingit outnumbered them, and Davis proceeded to place Sitka under siege by gunship and fort artillery, demanding the surrender of Colchika. Some Tlingit who attempted to leave Sitka by canoe were killed by gunship fire. After a few days Colchika surrendered to the Army, however, the next morning an army sentry killed two unarmed Tlingit from the Kake tribe who were departing Sitka in a canoe.‚ÄúSearch for and destroy‚Äù: US Army Relations with Alaska‚Äôs Tlingit Indians and the Kake War of 1869,‚Äù A report by secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners Vincent Colyer and Sitka Mayor William S. Dodge from 1870 attributes the initial altercation in part to serving alcohol to natives, saying Colchika was inebriated at the time with Whiskey.Annual Report of the Department of the Interior: Origin of the Kake War, 1870, page 1031, Vincent Colyer & William S. DodgeLost heritage of Alaska: the adventure and art of the Alaskan coastal Indians, Polly Miller, Leon Gordon Miller, World Pub. Co., 1967, pages 177-9 Chief Tom of the Kake tribe demanded compensation for the death, as is customary in Tlingit law, from General Davis who refused. Failing to receive material compensation, the Kake sought retribution in lives. The Kake captured a party of four trappers on Admiralty Island: two white trappers (Ludwig Madger and William Walker) were put to death at Murder Cove,The Tlingit Indians, George T. Emmons edited and added to by Frederica De Laguna, 1991, page 334 while two mixed race Tlingit-Russian guides were purposefully set free.Atlas of the North American Indian, Carl Waldman & Molly Braun, page 174 While the army failed to recognize Tlingit law, others recognized the local customs. According to the post trader at Sitka Frank K. Louthan, \\"The failure to promptly pay for a real or supposed injury is at once the signal for retaliation, \\"The Kakes very promptly sought the usual remedy, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth'\\". Destruction of villages and forts Upon hearing of the retribution killings, Davis instructed Lieutenant Commander Richard Worsam Meade of the to set sail to the Kake tribal lands, take a few chiefs as hostage until surrender of the accused responsible for the killing, and to burn the villages. The Saginaw departed on the 11th of February 1869. A Landing party from the Saginaw entered the small Fossil Bluffs Village, found it deserted, and the next day set it alight. The next day the Saginaw sailed for Hamilton Bay, the site of present-day Kake and at the time a large village named Town Where No One Sleeps. This site was bombarded prior to a landing party putting to shore and setting the village afire after finding it deserted. The next morning the Saginaw sailed for Security Bay to a village now known as Retaliation Point Village which was also deserted and put to the torch. Setting sail, the Saginaw found two deserted forts with stores and smokehouses which were also destroyed by fire. According to Kake oral history, recorded in a 1979 interview, one elderly woman stayed in Fossil Bluffs Village and was burned to death. Aftermath The loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to several Kake deaths during the winter. The Kake did not rebuild the small villages destroyed. Some dispersed to other villages, while others remained in the vicinity of Kake, eventually rebuilding the present day Kake. Trade with Fort Sitka was reduced substantially in the months following the conflict. The post trader at Sitka Frank K. Louthan, some five months after the conflict delivered thirteen blankets and one coat, amounting in value to fifty dollar coins, to the Sitka and Chilkat, after the army refused to pay compensation, in order to restore trading relations. In December 1869 a similar event at Fort Wrangell in which Tlingit were killed and a white man (Leon Smith) was killed in retribution led to a two-day bombardment of Old Wrangell. However the Stikine surrendered the killer to the army, who following a court-martialing was hung in front of the fort garrison and villagers.The 1869 Bombardment of ·∏¥aachxÃ±an.√°ak ºw from Fort Wrangell: U.S. Army Response to Tlingit Law, Wrangell, Alaska (Washington DC: American Battlefield Preservation Program; Juneau, AK: Sealaska Heritage Institute, 2015).

He was appointed director of the Egyptian Museum in Florence, where he professionally reorganized the collection in new quarters in 1880, then at the peak of his career was made director of the Museo Egizio di Torino, which became with him and his many seasons of excavating, the second biggest Egyptian museum in the world. He was the author of famous scholarly works and a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy. At the same time, he was deeply involved, from his first stay with Franciscan missionaries at Luxor in 1884, with relieving the poverty he saw among the missionaries of Upper Egypt, for whom he founded the Association to Succour Italian Missionaries (ANSMI), which expanded its work to care for Italian emigrants throughout the Near East. Schiaparelli was from a distinguished family of scholars. His father Luigi Schiaparelli taught history at the University of Turin. Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, the famous astronomer, Celestino, the Arabist, Cesare, the pioneer of photography, Carlo Felice, the agronomist, Giovanni Battista, a pioneer of industrial chemistry and Elsa Schiaparelli, one of the most prominent figures in fashion between the two World Wars were among his kin. Between 1903 and 1920 Schiaparelli undertook twelve archaeological campaigns, opening sites in Heliopolis, the cemeteries of Giza, Hermopolis, Assiut, Qaw el-Kebir, Gebelein and Aswan (the tomb of Harkhuf). In 1902 permission to excavate the Western cemetery in Giza was granted by Gaston Maspero, director of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The area was divided into three sections, and chosen by lot. The southern section was given to the Italians under Ernesto Schiaparelli, the northern strip to the Germans under Ludwig Borchardt, and the middle section to Andrew Reisner.Markowitz, Yvonne J., Joyce L.

It is often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers. A simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain. For clarity, a distinction should be made between Directory Server Authentication and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications. Conversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems. As different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms. Other shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect, offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled. An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect, do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense. Benefits Benefits of using single sign-on include: * Mitigate risk for access to 3rd-party sites (user passwords not stored or managed externally) * Reduce password fatigue from different username and password combinations * Reduce time spent re-entering passwords for the same identity * Reduce IT costs due to lower number of IT help desk calls about passwords SSO shares centralized authentication servers that all other applications and systems use for authentication purposes and combines this with techniques to ensure that users do not have to actively enter their credentials more than once. Criticism The term reduced sign-on (RSO) has been used by some to reflect the fact that single sign-on is impractical in addressing the need for different levels of secure access in the enterprise, and as such more than one authentication server may be necessary. As single sign-on provides access to many resources once the user is initially authenticated (\\"keys to the castle\\"), it increases the negative impact in case the credentials are available to other people and misused. Therefore, single sign-on requires an increased focus on the protection of the user credentials, and should ideally be combined with strong authentication methods like smart cards and one-time password tokens. Single sign-on also makes the authentication systems highly critical; a loss of their availability can result in denial of access to all systems unified under the SSO. SSO can be configured with session failover capabilities in order to maintain the system operation. Nonetheless, the risk of system failure may make single sign-on undesirable for systems to which access must be guaranteed at all times, such as security or plant-floor systems. Furthermore, the use of single-sign-on techniques utilizing social networking services such as Facebook may render third party websites unusable within libraries, schools, or workplaces that block social media sites for productivity reasons. It can also cause difficulties in countries with active censorship regimes, such as China and its \\"Golden Shield Project,\\" where the third party website may not be actively censored, but is effectively blocked if a user's social login is blocked. Security In March, 2012, a research paper reported an extensive study on the security of social login mechanisms. The authors found 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook, Janrain, Freelancer, FarmVille, and Sears.com. Because the researchers informed ID providers and relying party websites prior to public announcement of the discovery of the flaws, the vulnerabilities were corrected, and there have been no security breaches reported.\\"OpenID: Vulnerability report, Data confusion\\" - OpenID Foundation, March 14, 2012 In May 2014, a vulnerability named Covert Redirect was disclosed. It was first reported \\"Covert Redirect Vulnerability Related to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID\\" by its discoverer Wang Jing, a Mathematical PhD student from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. In fact, almost all Single sign-on protocols are affected. Covert Redirect takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to an XSS or Open Redirect. Privacy As originally implemented in Kerberos and SAML, single sign-on did not give users any choices about releasing their personal information to each new resource that the user visited. This worked well enough within a single enterprise, like MIT where Kerberos was invented, or major corporations where all of the resources were internal sites. However, as federated services like Active Directory Federation Services proliferated, the user's private information was sent out to affiliated sites not under control of the enterprise that collected the data from the user. Since privacy regulations are now tightening with legislation like the GDPR, the newer methods like OpenID Connect have started to become more attractive; for example MIT, the originator of Kerberos, now supports OpenID Connect. = Email address = Single sign-on in theory can work without revealing identifying information like email address to the relying party (credential consumer), but many credential providers do not allow users to configure what information is passed on to the credential consumer. As of 2019, Google and Facebook sign-in do not require users to share email address with the credential consumer. 'Sign in with Apple' introduced in iOS 13 allows user to request a unique relay email each time the user signs up for a new service, thus reducing the likelihood of account linking by the credential consumer. Common configurations =Kerberos- based= * Initial sign-on prompts the user for credentials, and gets a Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT). * Additional software applications requiring authentication, such as email clients, wikis, and revision-control systems, use the ticket-granting ticket to acquire service tickets, proving the user's identity to the mailserver / wiki server / etc. without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Windows environment - Windows login fetches TGT. Active Directory-aware applications fetch service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re-authenticate. Unix/Linux environment - Log in via Kerberos PAM modules fetches TGT. Kerberized client applications such as Evolution, Firefox, and SVN use service tickets, so the user is not prompted to re- authenticate. =Smart-card-based= Initial sign-on prompts the user for the smart card. Additional software applications also use the smart card, without prompting the user to re-enter credentials. Smart-card-based single sign-on can either use certificates or passwords stored on the smart card. =Integrated Windows Authentication= Integrated Windows Authentication is a term associated with Microsoft products and refers to the SPNEGO, Kerberos, and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality introduced with Microsoft Windows 2000 and included with later Windows NT- based operating systems. The term is most commonly used to refer to the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services and Internet Explorer. Cross-platform Active Directory integration vendors have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to Unix (including Mac) and GNU/Linux systems. =Security Assertion Markup Language= Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based method for exchanging user security information between an SAML identity provider and a SAML service provider. SAML 2.0 supports W3C XML encryption and service- provider‚Äìinitiated web browser single sign-on exchanges. A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) is called the subject in SAML-based single sign-on. The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know the identity of the user, issues an authentication request to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials. The service provider trusts the user information from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources. Emerging configurations =Mobile devices as access credentials= A newer variation of single-sign-on authentication has been developed using mobile devices as access credentials. Users' mobile devices can be used to automatically log them onto multiple systems, such as building-access-control systems and computer systems, through the use of authentication methods which include OpenID Connect and SAML, in conjunction with an X.509 ITU-T cryptography certificate used to identify the mobile device to an access server. A mobile device is \\"something you have\\", as opposed to a password which is \\"something you know\\", or biometrics (fingerprint, retinal scan, facial recognition, etc.) which is \\"something you are\\". Security experts recommend using at least two out of these three factors (multi-factor authentication) for best protection.

An Okarito kiwi (Apteryx rowi) also known as the rowi Ostriches are the largest extant flightless birds as well as the largest extant birds in general. An extinct Moa. Until the arrival of humans, New Zealand's only mammals were bats and seals, resulting in many bird species evolving to fill the open niches. While many of New Zealand's flightless birds are now extinct, some, such as the Kiwi, Kakapo, Weka and Takahe are still around today. Flightless birds are birds that through evolution lost the ability to fly. There are over 60 extant species, including the well known ratites (ostriches, emu, cassowaries, rheas and kiwi) and penguins. The smallest flightless bird is the Inaccessible Island rail (length 12.5 cm, weight 34.7 g). The largest (both heaviest and tallest) flightless bird, which is also the largest living bird, is the ostrich (2.7 m, 156 kg). Ostriches are farmed for their decorative feathers, meat and their skins, which are used to make leather. Many domesticated birds, such as the domestic chicken and domestic duck, have lost the ability to fly for extended periods, although their ancestral species, the red junglefowl and mallard, respectively, are capable of extended flight. A few particularly bred birds, such as the Broad Breasted White turkey, have become totally flightless as a result of selective breeding; the birds were bred to grow massive breast meat that weighs too much for the bird's wings to support in flight. Flightlessness has evolved in many different birds independently. There were families of flightless birds, such as the now extinct Phorusrhacidae, that evolved to be powerful terrestrial predators. Taking this to a greater extreme, the terror birds (and their relatives the bathornithids), eogruids, geranoidids, gastornithiforms, and dromornithids (all extinct) all evolved similar body shapes ‚Äì long legs, long necks and big heads ‚Äì but none of them were closely related. Furthermore, they also share traits of being giant, flightless birds with vestigial wings, long legs, and long necks with some of the ratites, although they are not related. Origins of flightlessness Divergences and losses of flight within ratite lineage occurred right after the K-Pg extinction event wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and large vertebrates 66 million years ago. The immediate evacuation of niches following the mass extinction provided opportunities for Palaeognathes to distribute and occupy novel environments. New ecological influences selectively pressured different taxon to converge on flightless modes of existence by altering them morphologically and behaviorally. The successful acquisition and protection of a claimed territory selected for large size and cursoriality in Tertiary ancestors of ratites. Temperate rainforests dried out throughout the Miocene and transformed into semiarid deserts, causing habitats to be widely spread across the growingly disparate landmasses. Cursoriality was an economic means of traveling long distances to acquire food that was usually low-lying vegetation, more easily accessed by walking. Traces of these events are reflected in ratite distribution throughout semiarid grasslands and deserts today. Gigantism and flightlessness are almost exclusively correlated. This is mostly observed in islands lacking predators and competition. However, ratites occupy environments that are mostly occupied by a diverse number of mammals. It is thought that they first originated through allopatric speciation caused by breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. However, later evidence suggests this hypothesis first proposed by Joel Cracraft in 1974 is incorrect. Rather ratites arrived in their respective locations via a flighted ancestor and lost the ability to fly multiple times within the lineage. Gigantism is not a requirement for flightlessness. The kiwi do not exhibit gigantism, along with tinamous, even though they coexisted with the moa and rheas that both exhibit gigantism. This could be the result of different ancestral flighted birds arrival or because of competitive exclusion. The first flightless bird to arrive in each environment utilized the large flightless herbivore or omnivore niche, forcing the later arrivals to remain smaller. In environments where flightless birds are not present, it is possible that after the K/T Boundary there were no niches for them to fill. They were pushed out by other herbivorous mammals. New Zealand had more species of flightless birds (including the kiwi, several species of penguins, the takahe, the weka, the moa, and several other extinct species) than any other such location. One reason is that until the arrival of humans roughly a thousand years ago, there were no large land predators in New Zealand; the main predators of flightless birds were larger birds. =Independent evolution of flightlessness in Palaeognathes= Ratites belong to the superorder Palaeognathae, which include the volant tinamou, and are believed to have evolved flightlessness independently multiple times within their own group. Some birds evolved flightlessness in response to the absence of predators, for example on oceanic islands. Incongruences between ratite phylogeny and Gondwana geological history indicate the presence of ratites in their current locations is the result of a secondary invasion by flying birds. It remains possible that the most recent common ancestor of ratites was flightless and the tinamou regained the ability to fly. However, it is believed that the loss of flight is an easier transition for birds than the loss and regain of flight, which has never been documented in avian history. Moreover, tinamou nesting within flightless ratites indicates ancestral ratites were volant and multiple losses of flight occurred independently throughout the lineage. This indicates that the distinctive flightless nature of ratites is the result of convergent evolution. Morphological changes and energy conservation Two key differences between flying and flightless birds are the smaller wing bones of flightless birds and the absent (or greatly reduced) keel on their breastbone. (The keel anchors muscles needed for wing movement.) Adapting to a cursorial lifestyle causes two inverse morphological changes to occur in the skeleto- muscular system: the pectoral apparatus used to power flight is paedorphically reduced while peramorphosis leads to enlargement of the pelvic girdle for running. Repeated selection for cursorial traits across ratites suggests these adaptions comprise a more efficient use of energy in adulthood. The name \\"ratite\\" refers to their flat sternum that is distinct from the typical sternum of flighted birds because it lacks the keel. This structure is the place where flight muscles attach and thus allow for powered flight. However, ratite anatomy presents other primitive characters meant for flight, such as the fusion of wing elements, a cerebellar structure, the presence of a pygostyle for tail feathers, and an alula on the wing. These morphological traits suggest some affinities to volant groups. Palaeognathes were one of the first colonizers of novel niches and were free to increase in abundance until the population was limited by food and territory. A study looking at energy conservation and the evolution of flightlessness hypothesized intraspecific competition selected for a reduced individual energy expenditure, which is achieved by the loss of flight. Some flightless varieties of island birds are closely related to flying varieties, implying flight is a significant biological cost. Flight is the most costly type of locomotion exemplified in the natural world. The energy expenditure required for flight increases proportionally with body size, which is often why flightlessness coincides with body mass. By reducing large pectoral muscles that require a significant amount of overall metabolic energy, ratites decrease their basal metabolic rate and conserve energy. A study looking at the basal rates of birds found a significant correlation between low basal rate and pectoral muscle mass in kiwis. On the contrary, flightless penguins exude an intermediate basal rate. This is likely because penguins have well-developed pectoral muscles for hunting and diving in the water. For ground feeding birds, a cursorial lifestyle is more economical and allows for easier access to dietary requirements. Flying birds have different wing and feather structures that make flying easier, while flightless birds' wing structures are well adapted to their environment and activities, such as diving in the ocean. A number of bird species appear to be in the process of losing their powers of flight to various extents. These include the Zapata rail of Cuba, the Okinawa rail of Japan, and the Laysan duck of Hawaii. All of these birds show adaptations common to flightlessness, and evolved recently from fully flighted ancestors, but have not yet completely given up the ability to fly. They are, however, weak fliers and are incapable of traveling long distances by air. =Continued presence of wings in flightless birds= Although selection pressure for flight was largely absent, the wing structure has not been lost except in the New Zealand moas. Ostriches are the fastest running birds in the world and emus have been documented running 50 km/hr. At these high speeds, wings are necessary for balance and serving as a parachute apparatus to help the bird slow down. Wings are hypothesized to have played a role in sexual selection in early ancestral ratites and were thus maintained. This can be seen today in both the rheas and ostriches. These ratites utilize their wings extensively for courtship and displays to other males. Sexual selection also influences the maintenance of large body size, which discourages flight. The large size of ratites leads to greater access to mates and higher reproductive success. Ratites and tinamous are monogamous and mate only a limited number of times per year. High parental involvement denotes the necessity for choosing a reliable mate. In a climatically stable habitat providing year round food supply, a male's claimed territory signals to females the abundance of resources readily available to her and her offspring. Male size also indicates his protective abilities. Similar to the emperor penguin, male ratites incubate and protect their offspring anywhere between 85‚Äì92 days while females feed. They can go up to a week without eating and survive only off fat stores. The emu has been documented fasting as long as 56 days. If no continued pressures warrant the energy expenditure to maintain the structures of flight, selection will tend towards these other traits. The only known species of flightless bird in which wings completely disappeared was the gigantic, herbivorous moa of New Zealand, hunted to extinction by humans by the 15th century. In moa, the entire pectoral girdle is reduced to a paired scapulocoracoid, which is the size of a finger. List of flightless birds Many flightless birds are extinct; this list shows species that are either still extant, or became extinct in the Holocene (no more than 11,000 years ago). Extinct species are indicated with a dagger (‚Ä†). A number of species suspected, but not confirmed to be flightless, are also included here.

The area of a regular triacontagon is (with ) :A = \\\\frac{15}{2} t^2 \\\\cot \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{30} = \\\\frac{15}{2} t^2 \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{23 + 10 \\\\sqrt{5} + 2 \\\\sqrt{3(85 + 38 \\\\sqrt{5})}}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{15}{4} t^2 \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{15} + 3\\\\sqrt{3} + \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sqrt{25+11\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\right) The inradius of a regular triacontagon is :r = \\\\frac{1}{2} t \\\\cot \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{30} = \\\\frac{1}{4} t \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{15} + 3\\\\sqrt{3} + \\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sqrt{25+11\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\right) The circumradius of a regular triacontagon is :R = \\\\frac{1}{2} t \\\\csc \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{30} = \\\\frac{1}{2} t \\\\left(2 + \\\\sqrt{5} + \\\\sqrt{15+6\\\\sqrt{5}}\\\\right) =Construction= Regular triacontagon with given circumcircle As 30 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 5, a regular triacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.Constructible Polygon  Symmetry The symmetries of a regular triacontagon as shown with colors on edges and vertices. Lines of reflections are blue through vertices, and purple through edges. Gyrations are given as numbers in the center. Vertices are colored by their symmetry positions. Subgroup symmetries are connected by colored lines, index 2, 3, and 5. The regular triacontagon has Dih30 dihedral symmetry, order 60, represented by 30 lines of reflection. Dih30 has 7 dihedral subgroups: Dih15, (Dih10, Dih5), (Dih6, Dih3), and (Dih2, Dih1). It also has eight more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z30, Z15), (Z10, Z5), (Z6, Z3), and (Z2, Z1), with Zn representing œÄ/n radian rotational symmetry. John Conway labels these lower symmetries with a letter and order of the symmetry follows the letter.The Symmetries of Things, Chapter 20 He gives d (diagonal) with mirror lines through vertices, p with mirror lines through edges (perpendicular), i with mirror lines through both vertices and edges, and g for rotational symmetry. a1 labels no symmetry. These lower symmetries allows degrees of freedoms in defining irregular triacontagons. Only the g30 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.  Dissection 30-gon with 420 rhombs Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2m-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into m(m-1)/2 parallelograms.Coxeter, Mathematical recreations and Essays, Thirteenth edition, p.141 In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the regular triacontagon, m=15, it can be divided into 105: 7 sets of 15 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 15-cube. { class=wikitable + Examples - valign=top align=center 160px 160px 160px 160px 160px }  Triacontagram  A triacontagram is a 30-sided star polygon.

Johann Karl Rodbertus (August 12, 1805, Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania ‚Äì December 6, 1875, Jagetzow), also known as Karl Rodbertus- Jagetzow, was a German economist and socialist and a leading member of the Linkes Zentrum (centre-left) in the Prussian national assembly. He defended the labor theory of valueG.D.H. Cole points out that Rodbertus defended this theory \\"not in its Marxian form, but in the form in which it had been advanced by earlier writers such as William Thompson and John Francis Bray, and echoed by Proudhon.\\" See G.D.H. Cole's History of Socialist Thought: Volume II Part II. London: Macmillan, 1960. p. 21. as well as the view, as an inference from that, that interest or profit is theft. He believed that capitalist economies tend toward overproduction. Biography Rodbertus was also known as \\"Rodbertus-Jagetzow\\" from the name of the estate of Jagetzow, in Pomerania, which he bought in 1835. Rodbertus was the son of a professor of law, and himself studied law at G√∂ttingen and Berlin. From these studies he went on to Heidelberg, where he took up philosophy. He travelled extensively in the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland before returning to settle down on his newly purchased estate (Jagetzow).G.D.H. Cole (1960), p.20 He served from 1827 to 1832 in the Prussian justiciary. By 1837, he had formulated his social platform, and in that year published Die Forderungen der arbeitenden Klassen. Elected to the National Assembly in 1848, he was Minister of Education in the Auerswald-Hansemann ministry for a fortnight, and in 1849 was a leader of the centre-left. The last twenty years of his life were spent in retirement. Theories Socialism, as defined by Rodbertus, was to be a gradual evolution, hence his acquiescence in a monarchy, and his break with the Democrats as a political party. He regarded the social question as a purely economic one. His principal doctrines are these: The workman's share of the nation's industrial income tends constantly to decline; land rent and interest are the result of the exploitation of the working classes; the present shares in the distribution of wealth (rent, profits, interest, and wages) are not entirely the result of permanent, universal economic forces, but the result of historical evolution and the prevailing legal system; financial and commercial crises are due to a non-adjustment of production and consumption; the laborer's purchasing power is small and the capitalist and landlord classes, instead of increasing their consumption of luxuries, invest their savings in new factories, and in otherwise increasing the means of production, with the inevitable result that commodities of common consumption are produced in excess. Rodbertus stated the Labor Theory of Value as three connected propositions. First, only those goods that result from labor may be thought to be economic goods; other goods, like sunlight, which do not result from labor are natural goods and consequently have nothing to do with economics. Second, an economic good is solely the product of the labor; any other view of it is to be left to physicists. No part of the value of grain, for example, is to be attributed to sunshine or soil. Third, economic goods are products of the labor that went into their composition and the labor that created the instruments that enabled that production. The value of grain, for example, is not to be found merely in the ploughman but also in the work of those who manufactured the plough. Eugen von B√∂hm-Bawerk thought that Rodbertus' exposition of the exploitation theory was superior to that of Karl Marx in profundity and coherence. However, B√∂hm-Bawerk published his Capital and Interest, where he made his poignant criticism of the theory of exploitation and the labor theory of value on which it is founded, in 1890, several years before the publication of Volume III of Capital (most of which was written in the 1860s). There, Marx eliminates his simplifying assumption of Volume I that in capitalism commodities tend to exchange according to their 'values' (i.e., labor-values). Without Volume III it is not possible to have the complete picture of Marx's theory of capitalism and, in particular, his theory that commodities exchanged according to their 'production prices', which deviated systematically from their 'values', or according to 'modified prices of production' if capitalists had to pay rent to landowners. For Marx, commodities tended to exchange according to their 'values' only in non- capitalist (or 'simple') commodity production in which there is no wage labor (only independent producers) and land is freely available. Nevertheless, he used his sophisticated labor theory of 'value' for the construction of his theory of surplus-value (which was his theory of exploitation). This was the 'esoteric' part of his theory, which underlaid the 'exoteric' part that explained equilibrium prices, wages, and rents. The global surplus-value produced was for him the foundation for profits on capital and rents on land. B√∂hm-Bawerk considered the labor theory of value fallacious, since it could only be valid in special cases. For example, he argued against Rodbertus that a nugget of gold that falls to earth embedded in a meteorite, and thus not having been produced by labor, would still fall within the purview of economic science.

She was India's national champion for a record equaling nine times when she won all the senior national championships between 1997 and 2006.  Early life  Aparna Popat was born on 18 January 1978 in Mumbai, Maharashtra into a Gujarati family of Lalji Popat and Heena Popat. She studied at the J. B. Petil High School in Mumbai and her Pre-university course from Mount Carmel College, in Bangalore. Aparna also holds a bachelor's degree in Commerce from the Mumbai University.  Training background  Aparna started playing badminton in 1986 in Mumbai. As an 8-year old when she approached Anil Pradhan for coaching, he saw a spark in the girl and told her parents \\"Give me this girl and I will put her on the map of Indian Badminton\\". Being a National champion himself, he helped her develop skills required to face the many challenges of the game. In 1994, she shifted to the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy in Bangalore to further expand her capabilities. Training under the legendary Prakash Padukone, former All-England champion, she built up her fitness and learned techniques to be more competitive at the international level. Yearning to expand her learning, in 2002 she shifted to the Sports Authority of India training centre at Kengeri, Bangalore where she learnt the nuances of the game under coach Gangula Prasad.  Career highlights  Aparna captured her first Senior National title at Hyderabad in 1997. She went on to win the Senior National title till 2006, thereby equaling the Prakash Padukone's record of winning nine consecutive national singles titles. She won her last of the nine Senior Nationals titles at the age of 27 after defeating the 15-year-old Saina Nehwal at Bangalore in January 2006. The highlights of her achievements at the international level are participation in 2 Olympic Games, 1 Asian Games, a silver medal at the World Junior Championships in 1996 and 4 medals in 3 Commonwealth Games appearances. She reached career-high world ranking of 16.  Retirement  After 17 years of professional badminton, she retired from the game in 2006 after suffering a wrist injury that remained un-diagnosed. She remained undefeated at the National championships. Post retirement she was employed with Indian Oil Corporation in Mumbai till 2015. Coaching Aparna Popat took up the coaching role for the Mumbai Masters in the first edition of the Indian Badminton League.  Awards and achievements  She was conferred the Arjuna Award in 2005, one of the highest sporting honors in India awarded by the Government of India. She was one of the 17 participants to be selected from around the world and the lone Indian to be selected for the Global Sports Mentoring Programme, an initiative by the promoted by Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State and ESPN.

IdM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas of IT security and data management. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate, and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access. Identity and access management solutions have become more prevalent and critical in recent years as regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex. It addresses the need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous technology environments and to meet increasingly rigorous compliance requirements.Compare: The terms \\"identity management\\" (IdM) and \\"identity and access management\\" are used interchangeably in the area of identity access management. Identity-management systems, products, applications and platforms manage identifying and ancillary data about entities that include individuals, computer-related hardware, and software applications. IdM covers issues such as how users gain an identity, the roles and, sometimes, the permissions that identity grants, the protection of that identity and the technologies supporting that protection (e.g., network protocols, digital certificates, passwords, etc.).  Definitions  Identity management (ID management) is the organizational process for identifying, authenticating and authorizing individuals or groups of people to have access to applications, systems or networks by associating user rights and restrictions with established identities. Identity management (IdM) is the task of controlling information about users on computers. Such information includes information that authenticates the identity of a user, and information that describes data and actions they are authorized to access and/or perform. It also includes the management of descriptive information about the user and how and by whom that information can be accessed and modified. In addition to users, managed entities typically include hardware and network resources and even applications. Digital identity is an entity's online presence, encompassing personal identifying information (PII) and ancillary information. See OECD Functional requirements for privacy enhancing systems Fred Carter, OECD Workshop on Digital Identity Management, Trondheim, Norway, 9 May 2007 (PPT presentation) and NISTGuide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) , Recommendations of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, January 2009 guidelines on protecting PII.PII (Personally Identifiable Information) , The Center For Democracy & Technology, 14 September 2007 It can be interpreted as the codification of identity names and attributes of a physical instance in a way that facilitates processing.  Function  In the real-world context of engineering online systems, identity management can involve four basic functions: # The pure identity function: Creation, management and deletion of identities without regard to access or entitlements; # The user access (log- on) function: For example: a smart card and its associated data used by a customer to log on to a service or services (a traditional view); # The service function: A system that delivers personalized, role-based, online, on- demand, multimedia (content), presence-based services to users and their devices. # Identity Federation: A system that relies on federated identity to authenticate a user without knowing their password. = Pure identity = A general model of identity can be constructed from a small set of axioms, for example that all identities in a given namespace are unique, or that such identities bear a specific relationship to corresponding entities in the real world. Such an axiomatic model expresses \\"pure identity\\" in the sense that the model is not constrained by a specific application context. In general, an entity (real or virtual) can have multiple identities and each identity can encompass multiple attributes, some of which are unique within a given name space. The diagram below illustrates the conceptual relationship between identities and entities, as well as between identities and their attributes. Identity conceptual view In most theoretical and all practical models of digital identity, a given identity object consists of a finite set of properties (attribute values). These properties record information about the object, either for purposes external to the model or to operate the model, for example in classification and retrieval. A \\"pure identity\\" model is strictly not concerned with the external semantics of these properties. The most common departure from \\"pure identity\\" in practice occurs with properties intended to assure some aspect of identity, for example a digital signature or software token which the model may use internally to verify some aspect of the identity in satisfaction of an external purpose. To the extent that the model expresses such semantics internally, it is not a pure model. Contrast this situation with properties that might be externally used for purposes of information security such as managing access or entitlement, but which are simply stored, maintained and retrieved, without special treatment by the model. The absence of external semantics within the model qualifies it as a \\"pure identity\\" model. Identity management, then, can be defined as a set of operations on a given identity model, or more generally as a set of capabilities with reference to it. In practice, identity management often expands to express how model contents is to be provisioned and reconciled among multiple identity models. = User access = User access enables users to assume a specific digital identity across applications, which enables access controls to be assigned and evaluated against this identity. The use of a single identity for a given user across multiple systems eases tasks for administrators and users. It simplifies access monitoring and verification and allows the organizations to minimize excessive privileges granted to one user. User access can be tracked from initiation to termination of user access. When organizations deploy an identity management process or system, their motivation is normally not primarily to manage a set of identities, but rather to grant appropriate access rights to those entities via their identities. In other words, access management is normally the motivation for identity management and the two sets of processes are consequently closely related. = Services = Organizations continue to add services for both internal users and by customers. Many such services require identity management to properly provide these services. Increasingly, identity management has been partitioned from application functions so that a single identity can serve many or even all of an organization's activities. For internal use identity management is evolving to control access to all digital assets, including devices, network equipment, servers, portals, content, applications and/or products. Services often require access to extensive information about a user, including address books, preferences, entitlements and contact information. Since much of this information is subject to privacy and/or confidentiality requirements, controlling access to it is vital. = Identity federation = Identity federation comprises one or more systems that share user access and allow users to log in based on authenticating against one of the systems participating in the federation. This trust between several systems is often known as \\"Circle of Trust\\". In this setup, one system acts as the Identity Provider (IdP) and other system(s) acts as Service Provider (SP). When a user needs to access some service controlled by SP, they first authenticate against the IdP. Upon successful authentication, the IdP sends a secure \\"assertion\\" to the Service Provider. \\"SAML assertions, specified using a markup language intended for describing security assertions, can be used by a verifier to make a statement to a relying party about the identity of a claimant. SAML assertions may optionally be digitally signed.\\"  System capabilities  In addition to creation, deletion, modification of user identity data either assisted or self-service, Identity Management controls ancillary entity data for use by applications, such as contact information or location. * Authentication : Verification that an entity is who/what it claims to be using a password, biometrics such as a fingerprint, or distinctive behavior such as a gesture pattern on a touchscreen. * Authorization : Managing authorization information that defines what operations an entity can perform in the context of a specific application. For example, one user might be authorized to enter a sales order, while a different user is authorized to approve the credit request for that order. * Roles : Roles are groups of operations and/or other roles. Users are granted roles often related to a particular job or job function. Roles are granted authorizations, effectively authorizing all users which have been granted the role. For example, a user administrator role might be authorized to reset a user's password, while a system administrator role might have the ability to assign a user to a specific server. * Delegation : Delegation allows local administrators or supervisors to perform system modifications without a global administrator or for one user to allow another to perform actions on their behalf. For example, a user could delegate the right to manage office-related information. * Interchange : The SAML protocol is a prominent means used to exchange identity information between two identity domains. OpenID Connect is another such protocol.  Privacy  Putting personal information onto computer networks necessarily raises privacy concerns. Absent proper protections, the data may be used to implement a surveillance society. Social web and online social networking services make heavy use of identity management. Helping users decide how to manage access to their personal information has become an issue of broad concern.  Identity theft  Identity theft happens when thieves gain access to identity information - such as the personal details needed to get access to a bank account.  Research  Research related to the management of identity covers disciplines such as technology, social sciences, humanities and the law. Decentralized identity management is identity management based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs). = European research = Within the Seventh Research Framework Programme of the European Union from 2007 to 2013, several new projects related to Identity Management started. The PICOS Project investigates and develops a state-of-the-art platform for providing trust, privacy and identity management in mobile communities.PICOS PrimeLife develops concepts and technologies to help individuals to protect autonomy and retain control over personal information, irrespective of activities.

Replacing the Wildcat as the sporty iteration of Buick's three full- size car lines, it slotted between the LeSabre and Electra in the lineup. The Centurion name was inspired by a Buick concept car, the name coming from that of an officer in the Roman Army. The car's emblem was not the traditional Buick tri-shield, but a side profile of a centurion.  1956 GM Motorama showcar  1956 concept car The Centurion name was first used on a Buick concept car in the 1956 Motorama. It featured a red and white fiberglass body, airplane-like interior design, a fully clear \\"bubble top\\" roof and the first backup camera in place of a rear-view mirror, although it was never shown to be functional. This car currently resides in the Sloan Museum at the Flint Cultural Center in Flint, Michigan.  1971‚Äì1973  First seen on a concept car, the Centurion was nearly identical to the contemporaneous Buick LeSabre, differing in badging and grillework, minimal chrome trim, and an absence of the VentiPorts found on other full-size Buicks. Body styles included two-door and four-door hardtops and a convertible. There were no pillared sedans. The two-door hardtop shared the handsome semi-fastback roofline with the LeSabre and other GM B-body cars (such as the Chevrolet Impala Sport Coupe and the Olds Delta 88) along with a standard vinyl roof. =1971= 1971 convertible, rear view Replacing the Wildcat as the mid-line full-sized Buick positioned between the lower-priced LeSabre and the larger and more luxurious C-body Electra 225, the Centurion was promoted more as a mid-level luxury car than the Wildcat, which was marketed as a sporty/luxury performance car. The Centurion was offered initially with only the big-block V8 in two power output ranges determined by the presence of either a single or dual exhaust. The 1971 Centurion produced at 4400 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm with the base 455. The Centurion was also offered in the 455 Stage 1 and manual transmission configuration as well during the early portion of the 1971 model year. This was known as the A9 and B6 Option when ordering the car. What also separated the car from the LeSabre was that when the car would be ordered or recognized as a Centurion it would be branded as a 4P as the first two letters of the Vehicle Identification Number. Interior trim was upgraded from LeSabres with a notchback bench seat including center armrest standard equipment along with more luxurious cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery. In March 1971, the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic transmission became standard on all Centurions as well as the lower-priced LeSabres. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were standard equipment during the entire model year. Total sales were 29,398,Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960-1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.796. exceeding the Wildcat by nearly 25%.Flory, pp. 793, 796. =1972= 1972 convertible The 1972 Centurion featured minor appearance changes including a revised vertical bar grille and taillight lenses. Under the hood, the standard and only available 455 cubic-inch V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower, which represented an \\"on-paper\\" decrease from the 315 gross horsepower rating in 1971. This was due to an industry-wide change in horsepower measurements from the gross method by a dynamometer outside a vehicle with no accessories installed to a SAE net method in which horsepower was measured as installed in a vehicle with accessories and emission controls hooked up. Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, variable ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were again standard equipment. Sales climbed over 20%, to 36,165 for the model year.Flory, p.874. =1973= 1973 convertible owned by the Royal house of Denmark, used by Henrik, Prince Consort The 1973 Centurion featured a larger front bumper and new vertical grille shared with LeSabre models along with revised taillights. The two-door hardtop coupe no longer included a standard vinyl roof and the distinctive formal rear window was replaced by a backlight shared with LeSabre coupes. Under the hood, the standard engine was downgraded to a four-barrel 350 V8 rated at 175 net horsepower. The 250-horsepower 455 four-barrel was now optional. With the LeSabre convertible temporarily dropped after 1972 and the intermediate-sized Buick lineup (renamed from Skylark to Century for 1973) losing its droptop permanently after the 1972 model year, the Centurion was Buick's only convertible offering in 1973. This would also be the final year for the Centurion series, which was replaced for 1974 by the new LeSabre Luxus, which included the convertible reinstated to that line for another two model years. GM would not see another Buick convertible until the Buick Riviera in 1982. Total Centurion production was 110,539 units, including 10,296 convertibles. With only three years of production, the Centurion had one of the shortest model runs in modern Buick history.

It is part of the Asheville Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was incorporated into a town in June 2003. Sierra Nevada opened a brewery in Mills River in 2014. History Mills River is among the oldest communities in Henderson County, with its first landholder receiving a deed from the state of North Carolina in 1787. It was once a thriving agricultural community, often called the \\"fertile crescent\\". The Mills River Chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Geography Mills River lies in the northwestern part of Henderson County, extending northeast to the Buncombe County border and southwest to the Transylvania County border. It is bordered to the northeast by the city of Asheville and the town of Fletcher, and to the south by the unincorporated communities of Horse Shoe and Etowah. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.74%, are water. The French Broad River, one of the primary tributaries of the Tennessee River, flows through the northeastern part of the town. The Mills River, a tributary of the French Broad, flows from west to east through the center of the town, and the southern part of the town is in the valley of Boylston Creek, a small tributary of the French Broad. The town lies within minutes of Pisgah National Forest, Interstate 26, and Asheville Regional Airport. Highways 280 and 191 serve as the major arteries and provide access to the nearby cities of Asheville, to the north; Hendersonville, to the southeast; and Brevard, to the southwest. Demographics Government The current mayor is Chae Davis, who took office in December 2017, elected by her fellow town council members. The current town council members are Randy Austin, Brian Caskey, Brian Kimball, and Roger Snyder. Mills River is home to four schools: Mills River Elementary, Glenn C. Marlow Elementary, Rugby Middle School, and West Henderson High School. The Town Hall and Library are located at 124 Town Center Drive. Surrounding the Town Hall is Mills River Park, whose master plan includes ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, playgrounds, multi-use trails, a dog park, shelters and support facilities. The Mills River runs along the northern boundary of the property.

The station has a power of 28,000 watts in the daytime, and 1,000 watts at night. WQXI's signal is non- directional during the daytime, and directional at night. As of 2009, the station broadcast in the IBiquity HD Radio AM hybrid digital mode during daytime hours. History former logo WQXI first went on the air in 1948 as an all music station, playing pop standards. Their independent status was unique programming as the established stations, WAGA (590 AM, now WDWD), WSB (750 AM), WGST (920 AM, now WGKA), and WATL (1380 AM, now WAOK) were all network affiliates. By the 1960s, WQXI was Top 40 with the moniker \\"Quixie in Dixie\\". Among the stations personalities was Dr. Don Rose in the late 1960s, who went on to near legendary status at KFRC in San Francisco. For a time, it was owned by Esquire Inc.. In the 1970s, WQXI became an oldies station. By the 1980s, WQXI was simulcasting with its FM sister station. By the early 1990s, WQXI was airing an adult standards format. When Atlanta hosted the 1996 Olympic Games, the station simulcast the French radio news channel France Info for several hours a day. During the mid-1990s, WQXI also aired Spanish- language music for several hours a day as \\"La Pantera\\" (The Panther). The former WQXI-FM \\"94Q\\" (originally WDJK) became WSTR-FM (94.1 FM) \\"Star 94,\\" and WQXI-TV became WXIA-TV (Channel 11). Beginning in April 1997, the station aired a sports radio talk format owned by Lincoln Financial Media. WQXI was the AM radio flagship of the Atlanta Falcons,http://www.atlantafalcons.com/radio-and-television/radio-affiliates/ and until 2013, WQXI was the flagship station of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets radio network.http://www.ispsports.com/radio-network- affiliates.cfm?pid=33&type;=1&affiliates; The station formerly broadcast the syndicated Yahoo! Sports Radio during the overnight hours. For many years, WQXI was hobbled by signal issues. Even with its 28,000-watt daytime signal, it only provides grade B coverage to several of Atlanta's outer suburbs. At night, it is almost unlistenable outside of Atlanta itself. To solve this problem, it was simulcast in HD Radio on WSTR's HD2 subchannel. WQXI's audio was also broadcast on Channel 18 of the Georgia Tech Cable Network. On May 20, 2014, Lincoln Financial Media dropped WQXI's local programming and became a full-time affiliate of ESPN Radio. The station's Atlanta Falcons broadcasts were not affected by the change. On December 8, 2014, Entercom announces that it was purchasing Lincoln Financial Group's entire 15-station lineup (including WQXI) in a $106.5 million deal, and will operate the outlets under a LMA deal until the sale is approved by the FCC.\\"Entercom Acquires Lincoln Financial Media\\" from Radio Insight (December 8, 2014) The sale was approved on July 14, 2015. On July 1, 2015, ESPN Radio announced it would end its programming on WQXI and move it to Dickey Broadcasting-owned rivals WFOM and WCNN on August 17.\\"ESPN Radio On The Move In Atlanta\\" from Radio Insight (July 1, 2015) After that date, WQXI began simulcasting sister WSTR, effectively taking it back to its roots as an all-music station. On September 30, 2016, Entercom announced that it had sold WQXI to Kyung Sook Park's Atlanta Radio Korea, Inc. for $850,000 plus a time brokerage agreement prior to closing.\\"Entercom Sells WQXI-A/Atlanta To Atlanta Radio Korea\\" from All Access (September 30, 2016) The sale was approved by the FCC on November 29, and consummated on December 14th.https://licensing.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/Auth_Files/1745582.pdf On December 15, WQXI flipped to the Radio Korea format. WKRP connection In 1978, WQXI provided inspiration for WKRP in Cincinnati, a television sitcom about a radio station. Series creator Hugh Wilson dealt with WQXI when he worked in advertising. WKRP's early episodes about dropping turkeys from a helicopter and the \\"dancing ducks promotion,\\" in which ducks danced on hot plates, were stunts actually done by Jerry Blum at WQXI in the early 1970s. Blum had leased an 18-wheeler from which he tossed hundreds of live turkeys at a suburban Atlanta shopping center. 2013 controversy On June 17, 2013, during WQXI's morning program Mayhem in the AM hosts Steak Shapiro, Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini mocked New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason and his battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The trio used a robotic-sounding voice to imitate Gleason, who speaks with a voice synthesizer, and told several knock-knock jokes about him. Station management suspended the three hosts as soon as the program went off the air, and fired them later that afternoon. Station vice-president and General Manager Rick Mack apologized for the incident. Shapiro and Dimino subsequently moved to rival WCNN, which overtook WQXI as Atlanta's leading sports talk station. WQXI never recovered from the loss of Shapiro and Dimino, a factor behind its decision to become a full-time satellite of ESPN Radio. It soon later became the factor behind WQXI to drop its sports radio format in favor of simulcasting WSTR due to declining ratings because of this controversy.

Its main features are a castle, which has now been converted to a hotel, and the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, which runs through the outskirts of the village. It is primarily a residential community for workers in Cheltenham, and has a growing retired and working population, attracted by the scenic countryside. Though small in size, Southam has a thriving community. The village hall is used for coffee mornings, yoga sessions and the regularly occurring kids club among other things. The parish of Southam had a population of 1,175 according to the 2011 census. History By c.991 the name Southam was already in use, possibly derived from its position south of the larger parish of Bishop's Cleeve. In the Domesday Book it is written as Surham and was held by Durand, the Sheriff of Gloucester. From 1865 the village was also known as Southam-de-la-bere, this was to distinguish it from Southam in Warwickshire. Before Southam was in the hands of the de la Bere family in the 17th century, the land was owned by Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford. His youngest daughter, Mary de Bohun, was given the Manor as a dowry when she married Henry Bolingbroke in 1381, who later became Henry IV. Henry IV annexed it to the Duchy of Lancaster and later on James I granted the Manor to Robert Cecil, the Earl of Salisbury, who then sold it to Richard de la Bere. Richard de la Bere was the Lord of the Manor of Southam from 1609, and his Manor house was near the present Pigeon House in Southam Lane. Richard de la Bere was a Barrister of Law at Lincoln's Inn, and he died in 1636. His wife Margaret had the magnificent de la Bere tomb built in the south aisle of St. Michael's Church in Bishop's Cleeve in 1639, at a cost of ¬£400. They had no children, so his cousin, Kinnard de la Bere, inherited the title, and Southam House became the Manor House from 1636. Also leaving no direct male heir, Kinnard left the manor to William Baghott of Prestbury, the second son of William Baghott and Anne de la Bere (m.1684), who took on the name and crest of de la Bere. His eldest son, Thomas Baghott de la Bere, then inherited the estate. Southam House, now Ellenborough Park Hotel Thomas Goodman is thought to have begun building Southam House c.1500 and was completed by Sir John Huddleston, who was steward of Sudeley Castle. Southam House was later used by The Oriel School for Girls and now it is the Ellenborough Park Hotel. The Grade II* listed Tithe Barn and 12th-century Church of the Ascension are also points of interest. The church was abandoned to storing crops and making cider at some stage after 1646. In 1862 The Earl of Ellenborough restored the church in memory of his first wife, Lady Octavia Stewart, who had died of tuberculosis after five years of marriage. Ownership of the church transferred to the Diocese of Gloucester in 1957.

It is fawn or red and white in colour, and is hardy and docile. Its milk is rich in flavour, high in fat and protein, and has a golden-yellow tinge due to its high Œ≤-carotene content. The Guernsey is one of three Channel Island cattle breeds, the others being the Alderney ‚Äì now extinct ‚Äì and the Jersey.  History  A Guernsey cow in the U.S. The Guernsey was bred on the British Channel Island of Guernsey; it is first documented in the nineteenth century, and its origins are unknown. Cattle were brought to the island in the Middle Ages for draught work. It has been suggested that the Guernsey derives from cattle imported from the French mainland ‚Äì brindled cattle from Normandy, and wheaten stock similar to the Froment du L√©on of Brittany. There may also have been some influence from Dutch cattle in the eighteenth century. During that century large numbers of cattle were exported from the Channel Islands to England; some of them had previously been brought from France. Imports of French cattle to Guernsey were forbidden by law in 1819, but some importation of British cattle continued until 1877. Some cattle evacuated from Alderney during the Second World War were merged into the breed. Exports of cattle and semen were for a while an important economic resource for the island, and in the early 20th century, a large number of Guernsey cattle were exported to the United States. The Guernsey breed is on the watch list maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, with fewer than 2,500 annual registrations in the U.S. and an estimated global population less than 10,000 animals.\\"American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, Conservation Priority List, 2012\\"  Characteristics  The Guernsey is of medium size: cows weigh , and bulls . The coat is red or fawn (wheat-coloured), and may or may not be pied red-and- white or fawn-and-white. The Guernsey produces rich and flavoursome milk. It traditionally had several other good qualities: it was long-lived, calved without difficulty, grazed well and ‚Äì being relatively small-sized ‚Äì was an efficient milk producer. These advantages have been compromised by recent selective breeding strategies, which have led to larger animals, with longer legs. These no longer display the traditional qualities of the breed; this is particularly marked where there has been cross-breeding with Holstein-Friesian stock.  Use  The Guernsey is a dairy breed, and generally is reared for that purpose only. However, the cow is usually removed from the dairy herd around age's six to eight, and marketed for beef, and other processed meats. The milk has a golden-yellow tinge due to a high content of Œ≤-carotene, a provitamin for vitamin A. The milk also has a high butterfat content of 5% and a high protein content of 3.7%.

A former member of Radish, Kweller has released five solo albums and appeared on several collaborations. Early life Ben Kweller was born in San Francisco in 1981. In 1982, his family relocated to Emory, Texas, where his father, Howard Kweller, became the town's first doctor. In 1986, the Kwellers moved to the larger Texas town of Greenville. Kweller was exposed to music at a very early age. Howard taught Ben how to play the drums when he was seven years old. For the next year, they would play together almost every night after Howard got home from work. Howard sang and played guitar while Ben played the drums. The duo played songs by The Beatles, The Hollies, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists of the 1960s. Howard is also a longtime friend of Nils Lofgren, a neighbor of his.This was mentioned during an interview with Marc Riley on BBC 6music on December 4, 2008. Kweller has mentioned in interviews that meeting Lofgren greatly helped his exposure to music. When Kweller turned eight, someone showed him how to play \\"Heart and Soul\\" on the piano and the youngster immediately began to create his own songs using the same chords. By the time he was nine, he had a dozen original compositions under his belt and entered a songwriting contest sponsored by Billboard magazine, where he won an honorable mention. Adult years Kweller married his girlfriend, Liz Smith (the subject of the song \\"Lizzy\\") and they have two sons, named Dorian Zev Kweller, born in May 2006, and Judah Evan Kweller, born April 3, 2010. At the time of Dorian's birth they lived in New York City, but they later moved back to Kweller's home state of Texas and currently reside in Austin. Ben's middle name, Lev, means \\"Heart\\" in Hebrew and his son's middle name, Zev, means \\"Wolf\\". Ben has said in interviews, \\"Together we're Heart of the Wolf...\\" Radish (1993‚Äì1999) In 1993, Kweller became friends with a local musician, drummer John Kent, and formed the band Radish with bassist Ryan Green. The trio played locally in and around Greenville and recorded two independent releases, Hello (1994) and Dizzy (1995), with Martin Baird at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, Texas. Around the time of the release of Dizzy, Green left Radish to focus his attention on school. Lorin Hamilton stood in for Green for a few months until Bryan Bradford, also known as Bryan Blur, joined on for most of the band's career. Kweller sent a copy of Dizzy to guitarist Nils Lofgren who grew up with Kweller's father in Maryland. Lofgren was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt who was producing Lofgren's album Damaged Goods at the time. Greenawalt took Radish to a studio to record a demo tape which was subsequently sent to record labels nationwide. After an unexpected bidding war for Dizzy, Radish signed to Mercury Records to release the full- length Restraining Bolt. Radish made appearances on The Weird Al Show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Late Show with David Letterman, but despite a much-hyped signing, the band failed to strike success. Radish earned a cult following in the United Kingdom with its top-40 hit \\"Little Pink Stars\\". The band went on multiple European tours, including opening slots for Faith No More and Main Stage at Reading Festival in 1997. Radish released two singles. In 1998, Radish became a quartet; it featured Joe Butcher of the Polyphonic Spree and UFOFU on lead guitar and Debbie Williams on bass. Radish went to Muscle Shoals Studio in Alabama to record the follow-up to Restraining Bolt, provisionally titled Discount Fireworks. The band recorded with producer Bryce Goggin (Pavement, The Lemonheads). While mastering Discount Fireworks in New York City, Kweller and Kent met bassist Josh Lattanzi, who would become Radish's fifth and final bass player. As a result of Polygram's merger with Universal Music Group, the 18-song album was never released and Radish secured a release from their contract with Mercury Records. Solo career At age 19, Kweller moved with his girlfriend, Liz Smith, to New York, where he began his solo career. He played acoustic shows and self-released four EPs, comprising some of the unreleased Radish Discount Fireworks recordings and other songs recorded in his apartment on a laptop computer. It was one of these EPs, Freak Out, It's Ben Kweller, that caught the attention of Evan Dando of The Lemonheads. Dando invited Kweller on tour with him. Jeff Tweedy, Juliana Hatfield and Guster also noticed Kweller and took him on tour with them. =EP Phone Home and Sha Sha (2002)= In 2001, Ben Kweller became ATO Records' first worldwide signing and released a 5-track EP entitled EP Phone Home. In March 2002, Sha Sha, Kweller's first solo studio LP, was released. Sha Sha included the radio-friendly and popular single \\"Wasted & Ready\\", which reached #29 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album featured John Kent on drums and Josh Lattanzi on bass, and showcased a wide variety of sound from quirky pop, to folk, to punk. The album grew in popularity with a grassroots effort based on his website and a promotion group called teamBK, which promoted via word- of-mouth advertising. To support the release of the album and EP, he put together a live band, initially composed of Lattanzi on bass, Fred Eltringham on drums, and Mike Stroud on guitar and keyboards. Towards the end of the Sha Sha album cycle, the four-piece performed on PBS's Austin City Limits. Kweller performing at Ohio State University =The Bens (2003)= In 2003, Kweller toured Australia with Ben Folds and Ben Lee as The Bens. The trio produced an eponymous four-song EP, with each member taking lead vocals on one song, and a final song in which they all contributed vocals. In an interview on October 14, 2006, Ben hinted that The Bens may do another album. =Guster collaboration (2003)= Late in 2003, Kweller provided lead vocals on the song \\"I Hope Tomorrow is Like Today\\" from Guster's album Keep It Together. Kweller and Guster co-wrote the song after a late night jam at Guster's Brooklyn studio. The song is prominently featured in the movie Wedding Crashers. =On My Way (2004)= On My Way, Kweller's second LP, took a new direction. The album, produced by Ethan Johns, was recorded 'live' ‚Äì there were limited overdubs and no use of headphones. After the release of On My Way, Kweller embarked on more touring. On these tours, Kweller played for his largest audiences ever, including a US tour co-headlining with Death Cab for Cutie. By this point, the lineup of his live band had changed to include John Kent on drums and Jason Roberts on guitar and keyboards, after Mike Stroud left to concentrate on his own band Ratatat and Fred Eltringham left to play drums in The Wallflowers. =Ben Kweller (2006)= In 2006, he recorded his third LP, Ben Kweller with producer Gil Norton. Unlike the previous studio albums, Kweller played all the instruments on this record himself. Kweller continued to tour to support his self-titled album, and expanded his band into a five piece, which grew to include Dan Horne on bass, Mark Stepro on drums, Jay Barclay on guitar and organ, and Jason Roberts on lead guitar. Kweller continued to play guitar and piano on this tour, but it also gave him the opportunity to just sing on certain songs. The Montreal group Sam Roberts Band, and New York based Hymns, opened for Kweller. His tie-in 'Trio on the Train Track Tour' included a new live band comprising Chris Morrissey on bass, vocals & keyboard and Mark Stepro on drums, vocals, glockenspiel, percussion & \\"whatever else he feels like\\" during appearances in the United States. During the Australian leg of the tour, the band was composed of Jay Barclay on guitar, keyboard & vocals, Dan Horne on bass & vocals, and Mark Stepro continuing his previous roles. =Changing Horses (2009)= Changing Horses is Ben Kweller's fourth studio album, which was expected for release in September 2008 but was pushed to February 2, 2009, in Europe and February 3, 2009, in the United States through ATO Records. Kweller has described the new album as being more country in style than his previous releases. The album features his rhythm section Chris Morrissey (bass) and Mark Stepro (drums). It also debuts the talents of Ben Kitterman, who played pedal steel guitar and Dobro. On November 23, 2008, the full album was leaked to the Internet. In a statement, ATO Records said the leak was not the final version of the album. The song \\"Hurtin' You\\" debuted on Stereogum, and the whole album was made available to stream exclusively on Last.fm. In April 2009, Ben Kweller appeared at Australian festivals such as Chill City, East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival and West Coast Blues & Roots Festival. =Go Fly a Kite (2012)= Kweller's fifth studio album, entitled Go Fly a Kite, was his first release produced solely by his own record label, The Noise Company. In earlier interviews, Kweller had stated that it would be released as early as March or April 2011. However, a conversation with the manager of The Noise Company revealed that it was now set to come out either late January or early February 2012. The delay in release is a result of Kweller's parting ways with his former record label, ATO Records. This was confirmed by Kweller himself while onstage at Stubbs in Austin, Texas, on April 16, 2011. More recently, Kweller posted on his Twitter account that \\"Kite's\\" released date will be February 12, 2012. This was followed by a tweet saying that it will be available for pre- order in October. Kweller's album was released a few days earlier than expected on iTunes on February 7, 2012. =Circuit Boredom (2019)= On June 23, 2018, Kweller announced via his Instagram page that he would be releasing a new album in 2019. On January 22, 2019, Kweller announced his return to music after his (and his family's) near-death experience after Carbon monoxide poisoning during a vacation in New Mexico. The new album, Circuit Boredom, co- produced by Dwight A Baker, was released in 2019. Its first single, \\"Heart Attack Kid\\", was released on February 8, 2019. Kweller's music video for Heart Attack Kid, was made in collaboration with Robert Strange of Superorganism and released on 2/19/19. Austin City Limits performances Kweller played the 2003 Austin City Limits Music Festival at the conclusion of his tour, where he played Sha Sha in its entirety. He returned to the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2004 when he performed on the Bank of America stage. As part of his 2006 tour, Kweller played the Austin City Limits Music Festival, where he was plagued by a severe nosebleed for the entirety of his set. After covering his guitar in blood, he attempted to stop the flow by inserting a travel-size tampon thrown onto the stage by a fan, which expanded painfully during a performance of \\"This Is War\\". After attempting to play \\"Falling\\" at a piano which he also covered in blood, Kweller was forced to end the set early.Rolling Stone review ACL performance In spring of 2007, Kweller co- headlined with his label-mates Gomez. He continued through the summer with his own string of headlining dates which eventually ended at ACL fest. This time, he did not get a bloody nose; however, commemorative T-shirts were sold at the merchandise booth with fake blood stains that said \\"ACL 2007: The return of Ben Kweller\\". Immediately following his performance at ACL, Kweller began recording his fourth full-length LP, Changing Horses in Austin, Texas on September 21, 2007. Film debut Kweller made his acting debut in William H. Macy's Rudderless; filming began in April 2013. Discography =Albums= *Sha Sha, ver.1, 2000 (Homemade. Feat.

As scientific computing using vector processors became more popular, the need for lower-cost systems that might be used at the departmental level instead of the corporate level created an opportunity for new computer vendors to enter the market. As a generalization, the price targets for these smaller computers were one-tenth of the larger supercomputers. Several notable technical, economic, and political attributes characterize minisupercomputers. First, they were architecturally more diverse than prior mainframes and minicomputers in hardware and less diverse in software. Second, advances in VLSI made them less expensive (mini-price). These machines were market targeted to be cost-effective and quickly manufactured. Third, it is notable who did not manufacture minisupercomputers: within the USA, IBM and the traditional mainframe makers, outside the USA: the Japanese supercomputer vendors and Russia (despite attempts to manufacture minicomputers). The appearance of even lower-priced scientific workstations (e.g., Dana Computer/Ardent Computer/Stellar Computer (the merger of these companies)) based on microprocessors with high performance floating point units (FPUs) during the 1990s (such as the MIPS R8000, IBM POWER2), and Weitek eroded the demand for this class of computer.

It involves one company trying to figure out how to take away market share from another company.  Firm competition  Empirical observation confirms that resources (capital, labor, technology) and talent tend to concentrate geographically (Easterly and Levine 2002). This result reflects the fact that firms are embedded in inter-firm relationships with networks of suppliers, buyers and even competitors that help them to gain competitive advantages in the sale of its products and services. While arms-length market relationships do provide these benefits, at times there are externalities that arise from linkages among firms in a geographic area or in a specific industry (textiles, leather goods, silicon chips) that cannot be captured or fostered by markets alone. The process of \\"clusterization\\", the creation of \\"value chains\\", or \\"industrial districts\\" are models that highlight the advantages of networks. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness, this practically pertains to business sectors.  National competition  Global Competitiveness Index (2008‚Äì2009): competition is an important determinant for the well-being of states in an international trade environment. Economic competition is a political-economic concept that emerged in trade and policy discussions in the last decades of the 20th century. Competition theory posits that while protectionist measures may provide short-term remedies to economic problems caused by imports, firms and nations must adapt their production processes in the long term to produce the best products at the lowest price. In this way, even without protectionism, their manufactured goods are able to compete successfully against foreign products both in domestic markets and in foreign markets. Competition emphasizes the use of comparative advantage to decrease trade deficits by exporting larger quantities of goods that a particular nation excels at producing, while simultaneously importing minimal amounts of goods that are relatively difficult or expensive to manufacture. Trade Policy can be used to establish unilaterally and multilaterally negotiated rule of law agreements protecting fair and open global markets. While trade policy is important to the economic success of nations, competitiveness embodies the need to address all aspects affecting the production of goods that will be successful in the global market, including but not limited to managerial decision making, labor, capital, and transportation costs, reinvestment decisions, the acquisition and availability of human capital, export promotion and financing, and increasing labor productivity. Competition results from a comprehensive policy that both maintains a favorable global trading environment for producers and domestically encourages firms to work for lower production costs while increasing the quality of output so that they are able to capitalize on favorable trading environments.Trade Policy Subcouncil, \\"A Trade Policy for a More Competitive America: Report of the Trade Policy Subcouncil to the Competitiveness Policy Council.\\" (1993), 171 These incentives include export promotion efforts and export financing‚Äîincluding financing programs that allow small and medium-sized companies to finance the capital costs of exporting goods.Trade Policy Subcouncil, \\"A Trade Policy for a More Competitive America: Report of the Trade Policy Subcouncil to the Competitiveness Policy Council.\\" (1993), 180-183 In addition, trading on the global scale increases the robustness of American industry by preparing firms to deal with unexpected changes in the domestic and global economic environments, as well as changes within the industry caused by accelerated technological advancements According to economist Michael Porter, \\"A nation's competitiveness depends on the capacity of its industry to innovate and upgrade.\\"Porter, Michael E. \\"The Competitive Advantage of Nations.\\" Harvard Business Review. (1990) = History of competition = Advocates for policies that focus on increasing competition argue that enacting only protectionist measures can cause atrophy of domestic industry by insulating them from global forces. They further argue that protectionism is often a temporary fix to larger, underlying problems: the declining efficiency and quality of domestic manufacturing. American competition advocacy began to gain significant traction in Washington policy debates in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of increasing pressure on the United States Congress to introduce and pass legislation increasing tariffs and quotas in several large import- sensitive industries. High level trade officials, including commissioners at the U.S. International Trade Commission, pointed out the gaps in legislative and legal mechanisms in place to resolve issues of import competition and relief. They advocated policies for the adjustment of American industries and workers impacted by globalization and not simple reliance on protection.Stern, Paula. \\"The Long and the Short of US International Trade: The Crisis Deepens Despite Recovery.\\" 12 Oct 1984, The Business Council, Homestead, VA.  1980s  As global trade expanded after the 1979-1982 recession, some American industries, such as the steel and automobile sectors, which had long thrived in a large domestic market, were increasingly exposed to foreign competition. Specialization, lower wages, and lower energy costs allowed developing nations entering the global market to export high quantities of low cost goods to the United States. Simultaneously, domestic anti-inflationary measures (e.g. higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve) led to a 65% increase in the exchange value of the US dollar in the early 1980s. The stronger dollar acted in effect as an equal percent tax on American exports and equal percent subsidy on foreign imports.Paula Stern, \\"A Realistic Approach of American International Trade Opportunities,\\" The International Trade Seminar, 14 September 1984, Memphis, TN; Paula Stern, \\"The Long and the Short of US International Trade: The Crisis Deepens Despite Recovery,\\" October 12, 1984, The Business Council, Homestead, VA. American producers, particularly manufacturers, struggled to compete both overseas and in the US marketplace, prompting calls for new legislation to protect domestic industries.Paula Stern, \\"Macro Policy, Economic Health, and the International Order: The Crisis Deepens Despite Recovery,\\" December 17, 1984, Group of Thirty, New York, New York. In addition, the recession of 1979-82 did not exhibit the traits of a typical recessionary cycle of imports, where imports temporarily decline during a downturn and return to normal during recovery. Due to the high dollar exchange rate, importers still found a favorable market in the United States despite the recession. As a result, imports continued to increase in the recessionary period and further increased in the recovery period, leading to an all-time high trade deficit and import penetration rate. The high dollar exchange rate in combination with high interest rates also created an influx of foreign capital flows to the United States and decreased investment opportunities for American businesses and individuals. The manufacturing sector was most heavily impacted by the high dollar value. In 1984, the manufacturing sector faced import penetration rates of 25%.Stern, Paula. \\"Macro Policy, Economic Health, and the International Order: The Crisis Deepens Despite Recovery.\\"17 Dec 1984, Group of Thirty, New York, New York. The \\"super dollar\\" resulted in unusually high imports of manufactured goods at suppressed prices. The U.S. steel industry faced a combination of challenges from increasing technology, a sudden collapse of markets due to high interest rates, the displacement of large integrated producers, increasingly uncompetitive cost structure due to increasing wages and reliance on expensive raw materials, and increasing government regulations around environmental costs and taxes. Added to these pressures was the import injury inflicted by low cost, sometimes more efficient foreign producers, whose prices were further suppressed in the American market by the high dollar. The 1984 Trade Act developed new provisions for adjustment assistance, or assistance for industries that are damaged by a combination of imports and a changing industry environment. It maintained that as a requirement for receiving relief, the steel industry would be required to implement measures to overcome other factors and adjust to a changing market.Stern, Paula. \\"Additional Views of Chairwoman Paula Stern on Steel.\\" Jul 1984 The act built on the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 and worked to expand, rather than limit, world trade as a means to improve the American economy. Not only did this act give the President greater authority in giving protections to the steel industry, it also granted the President the authority to liberalize trade with developing economies through Free Trade Agreements (FTA's) while extending the Generalized System of Preferences. The Act also made significant updates to the remedies and processes for settling domestic trade disputes.Washington Trade Report, \\"Dictionary of Trade Policy.\\" The injury caused by imports strengthened by the high dollar value resulted in job loss in the manufacturing sector, lower living standards, which put pressure on Congress and the Reagan Administration to implement protectionist measures. At the same time, these conditions catalyzed a broader debate around the measures necessary to develop domestic resources and to advance US competition. These measures include increasing investment in innovative technology, development of human capital through worker education and training, and reducing costs of energy and other production inputs. Competitiveness is an effort to examine all the forces needed to build up the strength of a nation's industries to compete with imports.Paula Stern, \\"Economic Policy and the US Trade Crisis: Towards a National Trade Policy,\\" April 19, 1985, Washington, DC. In 1988, the Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act was passed. The Act's underlying goal was to bolster America's ability to compete in the world marketplace. It incorporated language on the need to address sources of American competition and to add new provisions for imposing import protection. The Act took into account U.S. import and export policy and proposed to provide industries more effective import relief and new tools to pry open foreign markets for American business.Paula Stern, \\"Level Playing Field or Mine Field,\\" Across the Board, Oct. 1988. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 had provided for investigations into industries that had been substantially damaged by imports. These investigations, conducted by the USITC, resulted in a series of recommendations to the President to implement protection for each industry. Protection was only offered to industries where it was found that imports were the most important cause of injury over other sources of injury.Stern, Paula. \\"A Realistic Approach of American International Trade Opportunities.\\" The International Trade Seminar, 14 Sept 1984, Memphis, TN. Section 301 of the 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act contained provisions for the United States to ensure fair trade by responding to violations of trade agreements and unreasonable or unjustifiable trade-hindering activities by foreign governments. A sub-provision of Section 301 focused on ensuring intellectual property rights by identifying countries that deny protection and enforcement of these rights, and subjecting them to investigations under the broader Section 301 provisions.Fennel, Bill and Alan Dunn, \\"Memorandum on Brief Comparison of Section 301 and Special Section 301 Trade Laws\\"Stewart and Stewart, 23 April 2004 Expanding U.S. access to foreign markets and shielding domestic markets reflected an increased interest in the broader concept of competition for American producers.Paula Stern, \\"Stop the Trade Bill Hysteria,\\" The New York Times, 15 Dec. 1987. The Omnibus amendment, originally introduced by Rep. Dick Gephardt, was signed into effect by President Reagan in 1988 and renewed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and 1999.Appleyard, op. cit; Cass, op. cit.  1990s  While competition policy began to gain traction in the 1980s, in the 1990s it became a concrete consideration in policy making, culminating in President Clinton's economic and trade agendas. The Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Policy expired in 1991; Clinton renewed it in 1994, representing a renewal of focus on a competitiveness-based trade policy. According to the Competitiveness Policy Council Sub-council on Trade Policy, published in 1993, the main recommendation for the incoming Clinton Administration was to make all aspects of competition a national priority. This recommendation involved many objectives, including using trade policy to create open and fair global markets for US exporters through free trade agreements and macroeconomic policy coordination, creating and executing a comprehensive domestic growth strategy between government agencies, promoting an \\"export mentality\\", removing export disincentives, and undertaking export financing and promotion efforts. The Trade Sub-council also made recommendations to incorporate competition policy into trade policy for maximum effectiveness, stating \\"trade policy alone cannot ensure US competitiveness\\". Rather, the Subcouncil asserted trade policy must be part of an overall strategy demonstrating a commitment at all policy levels to guarantee our future economic prosperity. The Sub-council argued that even if there were open markets and domestic incentives to export, US producers would still not succeed if their goods could not compete against foreign products both globally and domestically. In 1994, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) became the World Trade Organization (WTO), formally creating a platform to settle unfair trade practice disputes and a global judiciary system to address violations and enforce trade agreements. Creation of the WTO strengthened the international dispute settlement system that had operated in the preceding multilateral GATT mechanism. That year, 1994, also saw the installment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which opened markets across the United States, Canada, and Mexico.Brainard, Lael. \\"Trade Policy in the 1990s.\\" Brookings Institution. 29 Jun. 2001. In recent years, the concept of competition has emerged as a new paradigm in economic development. Competition captures the awareness of both the limitations and challenges posed by global competition, at a time when effective government action is constrained by budgetary constraints and the private sector faces significant barriers to competing in domestic and international markets. The Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum defines competitiveness as \\"the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country\\".World Economic Forum, The Global Competitiveness Report 2009‚Äì2010, p. 3 The term is also used to refer in a broader sense to the economic competition of countries, regions or cities. Recently, countries are increasingly looking at their competition on global markets. Ireland (1997), Saudi Arabia (2000), Greece (2003), Croatia (2004), Bahrain (2005), the Philippines (2006), Guyana, the Dominican Republic and Spain (2011) are just some examples of countries that have advisory bodies or special government agencies that tackle competition issues. Even regions or cities, such as Dubai or the Basque Country(Spain), are considering the establishment of such a body. The institutional model applied in the case of National Competitiveness Programs (NCP) varies from country to country, however, there are some common features. The leadership structure of NCPs relies on strong support from the highest level of political authority. High- level support provides credibility with the appropriate actors in the private sector. Usually, the council or governing body will have a designated public sector leader (president, vice-president or minister) and a co-president drawn from the private sector. Notwithstanding the public sector's role in strategy formulation, oversight, and implementation, national competition programs should have strong, dynamic leadership from the private sector at all levels ‚Äì national, local and firm. From the outset, the program must provide a clear diagnostic of the problems facing the economy and a compelling vision that appeals to a broad set of actors who are willing to seek change and implement an outward-oriented growth strategy. Finally, most programs share a common view on the importance of networks of firms or \\"clusters\\" as an organizing principal for collective action. Based on a bottom-up approach, programs that support the association among private business leadership, civil society organizations, public institutions and political leadership can better identify barriers to competition develop joint-decisions on strategic policies and investments; and yield better results in implementation. National competition is said to be particularly important for small open economies, which rely on trade, and typically foreign direct investment, to provide the scale necessary for productivity increases to drive increases in living standards. The Irish National Competitiveness Council uses a Competitiveness Pyramid structure to simplify the factors that affect national competition. It distinguishes in particular between policy inputs in relation to the business environment, the physical infrastructure and the knowledge infrastructure and the essential conditions of competitiveness that good policy inputs create, including business performance metrics, productivity, labour supply and prices/costs for business. Competition is important for any economy that must rely on international trade to balance import of energy and raw materials. The European Union (EU) has enshrined industrial research and technological development (R&D;) in her Treaty in order to become more competitive. In 2009, ‚Ç¨12 billion of the EU budget EU Budget 2009: gearing up for economic recovery (totalling ‚Ç¨133.8 billion) will go on projects to boost Europe's competition. The way for the EU to face competition is to invest in education, research, innovation and technological infrastructures. Muldur, U., et al., \\"A New Deal for an Effective European Research Policy,\\" Springer 2006 Stajano, A. \\"Research, Quality, Competitiveness. EU Technology Policy for the Knowledge- based Society,\\" Springer 2009 The International Economic Development Council (IEDC) in Washington, D.C. published the \\"Innovation Agenda: A Policy Statement on American Competitiveness\\". This paper summarizes the ideas expressed at the 2007 IEDC Federal Forum and provides policy recommendations for both economic developers and federal policy makers that aim to ensure America remains globally competitive in light of current domestic and international challenges. International comparisons of national competition are conducted by the World Economic Forum, in its Global Competitiveness Report, and the Institute for Management Development, in its World Competitiveness Yearbook. Scholarly analyses of national competition have largely been qualitatively descriptive.Porter M E, 1990, The Competitive Advantage of Nations London: Macmillan Systematic efforts by academics to define meaningfully and to quantitatively analyze national competitiveness have been made,Thompson, E R, 2003. A grounded approach to identifying national competitive advantage, Environment and Planning A, 35, 631‚Äì657. with the determinants of national competitiveness econometrically modeled.Thompson, E. R. 2004. National competitiveness: A question of cost conditions or institutional circumstances? British Journal of Management, 15(3): 197‚Äì218. A US government sponsored program under the Reagan administration called Project Socrates, was initiated to, 1) determine why US competition was declining, 2) create a solution to restore US competition. The Socrates Team headed by Michael Sekora, a physicist, built an all-source intelligence system to research all competition of mankind from the beginning of time. The research resulted in ten findings which served as the framework for the \\"Socrates Competitive Strategy System\\". Among the ten finding on competition was that 'the source of all competitive advantage is the ability to access and utilize technology to satisfy one or more customer needs better than competitors, where technology is defined as any use of science to achieve a function\\". = Role of infrastructure investments = Some development economists believe that a sizeable part of Western Europe has now fallen behind the most dynamic amongst Asia's emerging nations, notably because the latter adopted policies more propitious to long-term investments: \\"Successful countries such as Singapore, Indonesia and South Korea still remember the harsh adjustment mechanisms imposed abruptly upon them by the IMF and World Bank during the 1997‚Äì1998 'Asian Crisis' [‚Ä¶] What they have achieved in the past 10 years is all the more remarkable: they have quietly abandoned the \\"Washington consensus\\" [the dominant Neoclassical perspective] by investing massively in infrastructure projects [‚Ä¶] this pragmatic approach proved to be very successful.\\" The relative advancement of a nation's transportation infrastructure can be measured using indices such as the (Modified) Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index (M-RTI or simply 'RTI') combining cost- efficiency and average speed metrics M. Nicolas J. Firzli : '2014 LTI Rome Conference: Infrastructure-Driven Development to Conjure Away the EU Malaise?', Revue Analyse Financi√®re, Q1 2015 ‚Äì Issue N¬∞54  Trade competition  While competition is understood at a macro-scale, as a measure of a country's advantage or disadvantage in selling its products in international markets. Trade competition can be defined as the ability of a firm, industry, city, state or country, to export more in value added terms than it imports. Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competition can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI). = Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) = TCI can be formulated as ratio of forex (FX) balance to total forex as given in equation below. It can be used as a proxy to determine health of foreign trade, .The ratio from -1 to 1; higher ratio being indicative of higher international trade competitiveness. :TCI = \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{FX Earnings} - \\\\textrm{FX Expenses}}{\\\\textrm{FX Earnings} + \\\\textrm{FX Expenses}} In order to identify exceptional firms, trends in TCI can be assessed longitudinally for each company and country. The simple concept of trade competitiveness index (TCI) can be a powerful tool for setting targets, detecting patterns and can also help with diagnosing causes across levels. Used judiciously in conjunction with the volume of exports, TCI can give quick views of trends, benchmarks and potential. Though there is found to be a positive correlation between the profits and forex earnings, we cannot blindly conclude the increase in the profits is due to the increase in the forex earnings. The TCI is an effective criteria, but need to be complemented with other criteria to have better inferences.  Criticism  Krugman (1994) points to the ways in which calls for greater national competition frequently mask intellectual confusion arguing that, in the context of countries, productivity is what matters and \\"the world's leading nations are not, to any important degree, in economic competition with each other.\\" Krugman warns that thinking in terms of competition could lead to wasteful spending, protectionism, trade wars, and bad policy. As Krugman puts it in his crisp, aggressive style \\"So if you hear someone say something along the lines of 'America needs higher productivity so that it can compete in today's global economy', never mind who he is, or how plausible he sounds. He might as well be wearing a flashing neon sign that reads: 'I don't know what I'm talking about'.\\" If the concept of national competition has any substantive meaning it must reside in the factors about a nation that facilitates productivity and alongside criticism of nebulous and erroneous conceptions of national competition systematic and rigorous attempts like Thompson's need to be elaborated.

An early companion of explorer Daniel Boone, Robertson helped establish the Watauga Association in the early 1770s, and to defend Fort Watauga from an attack by Cherokee in 1776. In 1779, he co-founded what is now Nashville, and was instrumental in the settlement of Middle Tennessee. He served as a brigadier general in the Southwest Territory militia in the early 1790s, and as an Indian Commissioner in later life. Early life and education Robertson was born in 1742 in Brunswick County, Virginia, of Scots-Irish and English descent. Around 1750, his father relocated the family to Wake County, North Carolina. Robertson worked with his siblings on their family farm and had limited formal education, but he learned to track and hunt animals and know his way in the woods and waterways. Marriage and career Robertson returned to North Carolina and married Charlotte Reeves in 1767. They started farming. In 1769, Robertson accompanied explorer Daniel Boone on his third expedition to lands beyond the Allegheny Mountains. The party discovered the \\"Old Fields\\" (lands previously cultivated by generations of Native Americans) along the Watauga River valley, where Elizabethton, Tennessee later developed. Robertson stopped here to plant corn while Boone continued on to Kentucky. After returning to North Carolina, Robertson became involved with the Regulator movement. They recruited a group of settlers to return to the Watauga River valley, which they believed to be in Virginia (at that time including present-day West Virginia). In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers who had settled in Northeast Tennessee (along the Watauga, Doe, Holston and Nolichucky rivers) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish an independent regional government known as the Watauga Association. However, in 1772, surveyors placed the land officially within the domain of the Cherokee tribe, who had long occupied this area. They required the settlers to negotiate a lease to cultivate and settle on their land. As the signed lease was being celebrated, a Cherokee warrior was murdered by a white man. Robertson's skillful diplomacy made peace with the irate Cherokee, who threatened to expel the settlers by force if necessary. In 1775, a treaty meeting was held between the Cherokee and a delegation of the Transylvania Company, headed by Richard Henderson. Under the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals (or the Treaty of Watauga), the Transylvania Company purchased a vast amount of land from the Cherokee, including most of present-day Kentucky and part of Tennessee. The treaty was technically illegal since only the government could have formal transactions and purchase land from Native American tribes. (The British, the colonial governments of Virginia and North Carolina and, later, the United States, all forbade private purchase of land from Indians). During the treaty process, Dragging Canoe, son of Cherokee chief Attacullaculla, made a speech condemning the sale of any Cherokee land, which the tribe held in common for the use of all. He broke from the general Cherokee tribal government to form a band that the pioneers called the Chickamauga Cherokee or Chickamauga, for their settlement, although the people never had a separate tribal identity. After Henderson's Transylvania Company had bought Kentucky (although other tribes such as the Shawnee also claimed it), Daniel Boone was hired to widen the Indian path over Cumberland Gap to facilitate migration by Anglo-American pioneers. This road became known as the Wilderness Road. Robertson's group lived at Watauga in peace until July 1776, when Chief Old Abraham of Chilhowee led a Cherokee contingent that attacked Fort Watauga (a defensive log fort built by the Watauga Association). A 40-man contingent commanded by John Carter, with Robertson and John Sevier as lieutenants, withstood a siege of about two weeks. After the Cherokee were subjugated later that year, the governor of North Carolina appointed Robertson as Indian agent to reside at the Cherokee capital. He was to prevent them from forming an alliance with the British to fight as their allies against the rebels during the American Revolution. Fort Nashborough In the spring of 1779, during the Revolutionary War, Robertson and John Donelson founded Fort Nashborough, later to become Nashville. It was then part of the Washington District, North Carolina. He represented Davidson County (home of Fort Nashborough in present- day Tennessee, not to be confused with the modern Davidson County, North Carolina), in the North Carolina legislature and had the settlement established as a town. He also established the first school there, the historic Davidson Academy for male students. The Spanish governor of former French territory west of the Mississippi River offered Robertson peace and the free navigation of the Mississippi in exchange for his leaving the United States and establishing ‚Äî along with the Watauga settlement and Kentucky ‚Äî an independent government. He refused to consider the matter. In 1790, Robertson was appointed brigadier-general of the territorial militia by U.S. President George Washington, serving until 1796. He shared with Sevier the honor and affection of Tennesseans. He was appointed as Indian commissioner, serving until his death in 1814. Robertson died near Memphis and was buried there. His family had his remains moved and re-interred in 1825 in the Nashville City Cemetery, to memorialize his contributions there. His son, Felix Robertson (1781-1865), served as Mayor of Nashville from 1818 to 1819. Robertson's great-granddaughter, Medora Cheatham, married Telfair Hodgson Jr., the treasurer of Sewanee: The University of the South and a developer of Belle Meade, Tennessee. She was the honorary president-general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).

Vertical motion of the PBL is represented by the gray \\"blanket\\". The height of the PBL is largely driven by convection associated with the changing surface temperature of the Earth (for example, rising during the day and sinking at night). The colored arrows represent the strength and direction of winds at different altitudes. Depiction of where the planetary boundary layer lies on a sunny day. In meteorology, the planetary boundary layer (PBL), also known as the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) or peplosphere, is the lowest part of the atmosphere and its behaviour is directly influenced by its contact with a planetary surface. https://www.britannica.com/science/planetary-boundary-layer Retrieved on 2020-06-28 On Earth it usually responds to changes in surface radiative forcing in an hour or less. In this layer physical quantities such as flow velocity, temperature, and moisture display rapid fluctuations (turbulence) and vertical mixing is strong. Above the PBL is the \\"free atmosphere\\", where the wind is approximately geostrophic (parallel to the isobars), http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Geostrophic_wind_level Retrieved on 2018-09-20. while within the PBL the wind is affected by surface drag and turns across the isobars. Cause of surface wind gradient The difference in the amount of aerosols below and above the boundary layer is easy to see in this aerial photograph. Light pollution from the city of Berlin is strongly scattered below the layer, but above the layer it mostly propagates out into space. Typically, due to aerodynamic drag, there is a wind gradient in the wind flow just a few hundred meters above the Earth's surface‚Äîthe surface layer of the planetary boundary layer. Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero due to the no-slip condition. Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow. This turbulence causes vertical mixing between the air moving horizontally at one level and the air at those levels immediately above and below it, which is important in dispersion of pollutants and in soil erosion. The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness, so wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types. Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground can reduce the geostrophic wind speed by 40% to 50%. Over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%. These effects are taken into account when siting wind turbines.Maeda, Takao, Shuichiro Homma, and Yoshiki Ito. Effect of Complex Terrain on Vertical Wind Profile Measured by SODAR Technique. Retrieved on 2008-07-04. For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the \\"gradient height\\" and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the \\"gradient wind speed\\". For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea. Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height. Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so (within the surface layer), with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m. The shearing of the wind is usually three-dimensional, that is, there is also a change in direction between the 'free' pressure-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the Ekman spiral effect. The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10¬∞ over open water, to 30¬∞ over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40¬∞-50¬∞ over land at night when the wind speed is very low. After sundown the wind gradient near the surface increases, with the increasing stability. Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically, increasing the wind gradient. The magnitude of the wind gradient is largely influenced by the weather, principally atmospheric stability and the height of any convective boundary layer or Capping inversion. This effect is even larger over the sea, where there is no diurnal variation of the height of the boundary layer as there is over land. In the convective boundary layer, strong mixing diminishes vertical wind gradient. Constituent layers A shelf cloud at the leading edge of a thunderstorm complex on the South Side of Chicago that extends from the Hyde Park community area to over the Regents Park twin towers and out over Lake Michigan As Navier‚ÄìStokes equations suggest, the planetary boundary layer turbulence is produced in the layer with the largest velocity gradients that is at the very surface proximity. This layer ‚Äì conventionally called a surface layer ‚Äì constitutes about 10% of the total PBL depth. Above the surface layer the PBL turbulence gradually dissipates, losing its kinetic energy to friction as well as converting the kinetic to potential energy in a density stratified flow. The balance between the rate of the turbulent kinetic energy production and its dissipation determines the planetary boundary layer depth. The PBL depth varies broadly. At a given wind speed, e.g. 8 m/s, and so at a given rate of the turbulence production, a PBL in wintertime Arctic could be as shallow as 50 m, a nocturnal PBL in mid-latitudes could be typically 300 m in thickness, and a tropical PBL in the trade-wind zone could grow to its full theoretical depth of 2000 m. In addition to the surface layer, the planetary boundary layer also comprises the PBL core (between 0.1 and 0.7 of the PBL depth) and the PBL top or entrainment layer or capping inversion layer (between 0.7 and 1 of the PBL depth). Four main external factors determine the PBL depth and its mean vertical structure: # the free atmosphere wind speed; # the surface heat (more exactly buoyancy) balance; # the free atmosphere density stratification; # the free atmosphere vertical wind shear or baroclinicity. Principal types thumbnail =Convective planetary boundary layer (CBL)= A convective planetary boundary layer is a type of planetary boundary layer where positive buoyancy flux at the surface creates a thermal instability and thus generates additional or even major turbulence. (This is also known as having CAPE or convective available potential energy); see atmospheric convection.) A convective boundary layer is typical in tropical and mid-latitudes during daytime. Solar heating assisted by the heat released from the water vapor condensation could create so strong convective turbulence that the Free convective layer comprises the entire troposphere up to the tropopause (the boundary in the Earth's atmosphere between the troposphere and the stratosphere), which is at 10 km to 18 km in the Intertropical convergence zone). =Stably stratified planetary boundary layer (SBL)= The SBL is a PBL when negative buoyancy flux at the surface damps the turbulence; see Convective inhibition. An SBL is solely driven by the wind shear turbulence and hence the SBL cannot exist without the free atmosphere wind. An SBL is typical in nighttime at all locations and even in daytime in places where the Earth's surface is colder than the air above. An SBL plays a particularly important role in high latitudes where it is often prolonged (days to months), resulting in very cold air temperatures. Physical laws and equations of motion, which govern the planetary boundary layer dynamics and microphysics, are strongly non-linear and considerably influenced by properties of the Earth's surface and evolution of processes in the free atmosphere. To deal with this complexity, the whole array of turbulence modelling has been proposed. However, they are often not accurate enough to meet practical requirements. Significant improvements are expected from application of a large eddy simulation technique to problems related to the PBL. Perhaps the most important processes, which are critically dependent on the correct representation of the PBL in the atmospheric models (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project), are turbulent transport of moisture (evapotranspiration) and pollutants (air pollutants). Clouds in the boundary layer influence trade winds, the hydrological cycle, and energy exchange.

An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issues of security in a public offering, and bank lending, among others. The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the Underwriter. The name derives from the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Financial backers, who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a premium, would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose.\\"Underwriting: The Poetics of Insurance in America, 1722-1872\\" , by Eric Wertheimer, Stanford University Press, 2006 Securities underwriting Securities underwriting is the process by which investment banks raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing securities (both equity and debt capital). The services of an underwriter are typically used as part of a public offering in a primary market. This is a way of distributing a newly issued security, such as stocks or bonds, to investors. A syndicate of banks (the lead managers) underwrites the transaction, which means they have taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find enough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters make their income from the price difference (the \\"underwriting spread\\") between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from investors or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering. =Risk, exclusivity, and reward= Once the underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities, and the cost of holding them on its books until such time in the future that they may be favorably sold. If the instrument is desirable, the underwriter and the securities issuer may choose to enter into an exclusivity agreement. In exchange for a higher price paid upfront to the issuer, or other favorable terms, the issuer may agree to make the underwriter the exclusive agent for the initial sale of the securities instrument. That is, even though third-party buyers might approach the issuer directly to buy, the issuer agrees to sell exclusively through the underwriter. In summary, the securities issuer gets cash up front, access to the contacts and sales channels of the underwriter, and is insulated from the market risk of being unable to sell the securities at a good price. The underwriter gets a profit from the markup, plus the possibility of an exclusive sales agreement. Also if the securities are priced significantly below market price (as is often the custom), the underwriter also curries favor with powerful end customers by granting them an immediate profit (see flipping), perhaps in a quid pro quo. This practice, which is typically justified as the reward for the underwriter for taking on the market risk, is occasionally criticized as unethical, such as the allegations that Frank Quattrone acted improperly in doling out hot IPO stock during the dot-com bubble. In an attempt to capture more of the value of their securities for themselves, issuing companies are increasingly turning to alternative vehicles for going public, such as direct listings and SPACs. Bank underwriting In banking, underwriting is the detailed credit analysis preceding the granting of a loan, based on credit information furnished by the borrower; such underwriting falls into several areas: *Consumer loan underwriting includes the verification of such items as employment history, salary and financial statements; publicly available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a credit report; and the lender's evaluation of the borrower's credit needs and ability to pay. Examples include mortgage underwriting. *Commercial (or business) underwriting consists of the evaluation of financial information provided by small businesses including analysis of the business balance sheet including tangible net worth, the ratio of debt to worth (leverage) and available liquidity (current ratio). Analysis of the income statement typically includes revenue trends, gross margin, profitability, and debt service coverage. Underwriting can also refer to the purchase of corporate bonds, commercial paper, government securities, municipal general-obligation bonds by a commercial bank or dealer bank for its own account or for resale to investors. Bank underwriting of corporate securities is carried out through separate holding-company affiliates, called securities affiliates or Section 20 affiliates. Of late, the discourse on underwriting has been dominated by the advent of machine learning in this space. These profound technological innovations are altering the way traditional underwriting scorecards have been built, and are displacing human underwriters with automation. Natural language understanding allows the consideration of more sources of information to assess risk than used previously. These algorithms typically use modern data sources such as SMS / Email for banking information, location data to verify addresses, and so on. Several firms are trying to build models that can gauge a customer's willingness to pay using social media data by applying natural language understanding algorithms which essentially try to analyse and quantify a person's popularity / likability and so on, with the premise being that people scoring high on these parameters are less likely to default on a loan. However, this area is still vastly subjective. Insurance underwriting Insurance underwriters evaluate the risk and exposures of potential clients. They decide how much coverage the client should receive, how much they should pay for it, or whether even to accept the risk and insure them. Underwriting involves measuring risk exposure and determining the premium that needs to be charged to insure that risk. The function of the underwriter is to protect the company's book of business from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue insurance policies at a premium that is commensurate with the exposure presented by a risk. Each insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual's driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for life or health insurance, medical underwriting may be used to examine the applicant's health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as age & occupation). The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.\\"Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas),\\" Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 12, Actuarial Standards Board, December 2005 The underwriters may decline the risk, or may provide a quotation in which the premiums have been loaded (including the amount needed to generate a profit, in addition to covering expenses) or in which various exclusions have been stipulated, which restrict the circumstances under which a claim would be paid. Depending on the type of insurance product (line of business), insurance companies use automated underwriting systems to encode these rules, and reduce the amount of manual work in processing quotations and policy issuance. This is especially the case for certain simpler life or personal lines (auto, homeowners) insurance. Some insurance companies, however, rely on agents to underwrite for them. This arrangement allows an insurer to operate in a market closer to its clients without having to establish a physical presence. Two major categories of exclusion in insurance underwriting are moral hazard and correlated losses. With a moral hazard, the consequences of the customer's actions are insured, making the customer more likely to take costly actions. For example, bedbugs are typically excluded from homeowners' insurance to avoid paying for the consequence of recklessly bringing in a used mattress. Insured events are generally those outside the control of the customer, for example in life insurance, death by automobile accident is typically covered, but death by suicide is typically not covered. Correlated losses are those that can affect a large number of customers at the same time, thus potentially bankrupting the insurance company. This is why typical homeowner's policies cover damage from fire or falling trees (usually affecting an individual house), but not floods or earthquakes (which affect many houses at the same time). Other forms =Continuous underwriting= Continuous Underwriting is the process in which the risks involved in insuring people or assets are being evaluated and analyzed on a continuous basis. It evolved from the traditional underwriting, in which the risks only get assessed before the policy is signed or renewed. Continuous underwriting was first used in Workers‚Äô Compensation, where the premium of the insurance was updated monthly, based on the insured‚Äôs submitted payroll. It is also used in Life Insurancehttps://www.sapiens.com/blog/insurers-making-interesting-use-of- continuous-underwriting/, as well as Cyber Insurancehttps://content.naic.org/cipr_topics/topic_ondemand_insurance.htmhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/time%20for%20insurance%20companies%20to%20face%20digital%20reality/digital- disruption-in-insurance.ashx. =Real estate underwriting= In evaluation of a real estate loan, in addition to assessing the borrower, the property itself is scrutinized. Underwriters use the debt service coverage ratio to figure out whether the property is capable of redeeming its own value. =Forensic underwriting= Forensic underwriting is the \\"after-the-fact\\" process used by lenders to determine what went wrong with a mortgage.\\"Lenders scrutinize borrowers,\\" Herald Tribune March 12, 2008 Forensic underwriting is a borrower's ability to work out a modification scenario with their current lien holder, not to qualify them for a new loan or a refinance. This is typically done by an underwriter staffed with a team of people who are experienced in every aspect of the real estate field. =Sponsorship underwriting= Underwriting may also refer to financial sponsorship of a venture, and is also used as a term within public broadcasting (both public television and radio) to describe funding given by a company or organization for the operations of the service, in exchange for a mention of their product or service within the station's programming. =Thomson Financial league tables= Underwriting activity in the mergers and acquisitions, equity issuance, debt issuance, syndicated loans and U.S. municipal bond markets is reported in the Thomson Financial league tables.

Air Zonk was an attempt to update the company's image via a modern, punkish character called Zonk, who bears a purposeful resemblance to the TurboGrafx-16's caveman mascot, Bonk. The game was developed by Red Company, the original creators of the Bonk series, also known for their Gate of Thunder series. Air Zonk features King Drool, antagonist of the Bonk series, along with many other enemies from the series. It was followed by a sequel in 1993 called Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise for the TurboDuo, and has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console. Gameplay Air Zonk is a re- imagination of the Bonk video game series as a side-scrolling shooter set in the future. Artistically the game is lighthearted, featuring humorous designs of the environment and the characters. During each of the five levels, the gameplay centers around the effective use of shooting and bombing to complete a stage. At the start, the player may pick a companion character to team up with, such as anthropomorphic gumball machine or mummy with a drill attached to its head, in order to boost the Bonk's powers. The players can choose to limit the use of the designated companion characters for each level, or opt out of using companion characters altogether. Each companion character, or friend, can only be used once. Air Zonk takes on the distinct visual style that is sometimes called a \\"cute 'em up\\". There are three difficulty settings: sweet, spicy, and bitter. Zonk can charge his shots, which allows him to fire a more powerful attack. Charging longer causes Zonk to drop a bomb, which damages all enemies on the screen. Zonk can also acquire seven types of power- ups, each of which can also be charged for a unique special attack. As usual for scrolling shooters, whenever Zonk acquires a new power-up, he loses the current one. If Zonk is hit while he has a power-up, he loses the power-up but does not die, except in the case of the Mini-Zonk power-up. The Mini-Zonk power-up also differs from the other power-ups in that it cannot be charged, and can be found in both florets and random enemy drops (other power-ups can only be found in florets). Zonk starts each stage alone and with no power-ups. He must collect eight smiley faces, the eighth of which will appear in giant form with sunglasses, in order to get his friend to join him. The friend initially acts as a Gradius-style support which follows Zonk around shooting projectiles. If the player collects another eight smiley faces, Zonk and the friend will merge into a hybrid form, granting a new attack and 20 seconds of invulnerability. This new attack cannot be charged, and Zonk cannot drop bombs while in hybrid form. Once invincibility expires, if Zonk is hit he will revert to normal form and his friend will leave, though he retains whatever power-up he had before changing to hybrid form. Reception Air Zonk was awarded Best TurboGrafx Game of 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. Release Air Zonk was released in 2007 on the Wii's Virtual Console in May in Japan, July in America, and on July 13 in Europe.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/03.htmlhttps://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/VVnTG0iv33BXEEmN8960dGOCVhTFxCa_https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/TurboGrafx/Air- Zonk-276148.html It has gained an E rating from the ESRB. It was also released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 19, 2014, in America on July 27, 2017 and in Europe on August 3, 2017.https://www.nintendo.co.jp/titles/20010000007708https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/air- zonk-wii-u Sequel Air Zonk received a sequel in 1993 named Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise (also known as CD Denjin Rockabilly), which was released in the SuperCD format and requires the Super System Card to play on first- generation TurboGrafx-CD consoles. As its name would imply, the game has a CD audio soundtrack consisting of rockabilly music. The game contains all-new levels, assistants, and enemies.
