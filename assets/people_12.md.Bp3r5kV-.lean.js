Formerly representing Plaid Cymru, he was temporarily expelled from the party in 2018 and sits as a Welsh National Party Member of the Senedd. He was elected to the Senedd, then known as the Welsh Assembly, on the Plaid Cymru regional list, under the Additional Member System. In February 2020 he announced his intention to form a new political party, the Welsh National Party. Early life and career Born in South Wales, McEvoy has both English and Irish heritage through his father, whilst his mother's father came to the Welsh capital Cardiff from Yemen. McEvoy previously trained and worked as a teacher of modern languages. Political career McEvoy was elected to Cardiff Council as Welsh Labour Councillor for Riverside in 1999http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/Cardiff-1995-2012.pdf and later became vice-chair of the Labour council group, he defected to Plaid Cymru in 2003. He lost his seat in Riverside in 2004, but was elected in 2008 in the Fairwater ward. He then became Deputy Leader of Cardiff Council between 2008-2012 under a Liberal Democrat-Plaid Cymru coalition government. In 2012 he was re-elected to represent Fairwater. In September 2012, despite Plaid's decision not to put forward any candidates for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) elections, McEvoy said that he wanted to stand for the PCC for South Wales Police. McEvoy did not stand, Plaid did not put forward a candidate, and subsequently former MP Alun Michael won the position for Welsh Labour. McEvoy stood as a constituency candidate for Cardiff West in the 2016 Assembly election, which saw Plaid Cymru's share of the vote increase by 11.9%. The incumbent AM, Labour's Mark Drakeford, saw his majority reduced to 1,176 votes, with the Conservatives in third place. In the run-up to the 2017 Cardiff Council election, Wales Online described McEvoy as \\"arguably the most divisive frontline elected politician in Wales right now\\" who, despite being \\"at the forefront of an unprecedented growth of Plaid support and membership in Cardiff\\" had a \\"sometimes difficult relationship\\" with his adopted party, Plaid Cymru. McEvoy has, contrary to the policy of Plaid Cymru, supported the continuation of the Right to Buy scheme in Wales.David Deans (13 September 2017) \\"Plaid Cymru AMs McEvoy and Jenkins in right-to-buy row\\", BBC News. He opposed the Welsh Government's Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Act 2020 which saw most forms of corporal punishment of children prohibited.https://twitter.com/neiljmcevoy/status/818534334290391042 In August 2019 McEvoy gave an Assembly speech informing First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford of costs of up to ¬£245 to change lightbulbs under the Welsh Government Warm Homes/Arbed Am Byth scheme. Drakeford responded to the claims with a letter stating that costs of ¬£245 represented work including lighting fitting in \\"not less than 80% of all fixed outlets\\" in homes, as opposed to ¬£245 for individual lightbulb fittings. McEvoy responded by accusing the First Minister of discussing the matter with Arbed Am Byth alone, and not investigating contractors directly. He states he is unable to disclose details of his \\"whistle-blowers\\" to the First Minister but would be contacting the Auditor General for Wales. McEvoy was included in a list of the AMs with the largest budgets for staff and constituency office costs in the Assembly. He was described as budgeting ¬£115,865 for his office, which McEvoy described as necessary to deal with \\"an enormous amount of casework\\" and stated his \\"office is far busier than the local Westminster MP\\". His budget was the largest of any AMs in the Assembly. = 2019 Plaid Cymru conference debates = McEvoy has contributed to the debate around the Plaid Cymru conference, which is scheduled for 4 and 5 October in Swansea. He has voiced opinions on matters including the election for a Chair. Incumbent Chair Alun Ffred Jones, who presided over the party during McEvoy's disciplinary issues, ran against Dr Dewi Evans, who is an ally of McEvoy, and who was nominated alongside seven other prospective party officials by McEvoy's home Plaid branch of West Cardiff. Evans has been arguing for reform of the party's extension system. Candidates nominated by the Cardiff West constituency party include a former barrister who has represented McEvoy, and other perceived allies. Jones, in response to Dr Evans' proposals, argued that the role of Chair did not extend to re-admitting expelled members, and that the Plaid National Conference would need to discuss issues such as McEvoy's membership of the party. Plaid leader Adam Price, in an op-ed for Nation.Cymru, criticised \\"reports of a concerted attempt by some non-members of Plaid Cymru to intervene in our democracy\\", a criticism which some commentators have said is a reference to McEvoy's efforts during the Plaid conference to replace incumbent Chair Jones. Plaid AM Rhun ap Iorwerth made a tweet regarding McEvoy which stated \\"Don‚Äôt misunderstand me. His personality is a problem, but it goes far beyond ‚Äònot liking [McEvoy]. If anyone ‚Äì for reasons of personality or otherwise ‚Äì bullies, undermines, threatens, challenges legally‚Ä¶ time after time‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a problem.\\" = Prospective contest of 2021 Cardiff West seat = The issues with McEvoy's 2019 membership dispute with the party are particularly acute given his stated intention to again contest Cardiff West Welsh Parliament Election against the now First Minister Mark Drakeford. Plaid view the seat as an important target given the close result in 2016, and McEvoy would likely split the vote should both he and a Plaid Cymru candidate stand. = Recording of the Standards Commissioner = Senedd Commissioner for Standards Sir Roderick Evans resigned on 11 November 2019 after audio transcripts were published containing what McEvoy described as \\"bias\\", \\"really sexist views\\" about \\"female lawyers\\" as well as comments that former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood should \\"wind her neck in\\". The transcripts were quoted in the chamber by Assembly Brexit Party leader Mark Reckless, who later withdrew the comments on the request of the speaker, Elin Jones. The speaker subsequently ordered a security sweep of the assembly estate. McEvoy always stated he was the source of the recordings, which he said were made on his mobile phone in meeting rooms in the Senedd. Sir Roderick said McEvoy's conduct was \\"wholly unacceptable\\", and Jones requested that South Wales Police investigate the recordings. = Foundation of the Welsh National Party = In 2019 McEvoy announced that he was not seeking to rejoin Plaid Cymru. In February 2020 he announced that he was forming a new political party, the Welsh National Party, and that he had registered the name with the Electoral Commission. The launch of the party was planned for April 2020. On 6 May, following the threat of legal action from Plaid Cymru over the new party's name, the Electoral Commission removed the name \\"Welsh National\\" Party from the register of political parties, and ruled that a second application to register a name would have to be made. In response, McEvoy described the decision as representing \\"a shameful day for democracy\\" and said that the party was seeking 'urgent legal advice' as well as a statement from the Speaker‚Äôs Committee, who oversee the Electoral Commission. Controversies In November 2011 in a Facebook post, McEvoy accused the charity Welsh Women's Aid of \\"publicly funded child abuse\\" and claimed they supported women in breaking court orders on fathers' access to children. He was subsequently suspended by Plaid Cymru, and after investigation was allowed to return. McEvoy apologised for the words he used, but did not withdraw the allegations. In Council elections in May 2011, Welsh Labour ward opponent Michael Michael distributed leaflets of Only Fools and Horses character Del Boy with McEvoy's face imposed on them. McEvoy subsequently sued Michael for libel, but withdrew the case in December 2015. In January 2016, McEvoy agreed to the courts wishes to pay Michael ¬£120,000 in legal costs. The sum represented a quarter of the cost of the preliminary issues, and all costs after April 2013. McEvoy paid an initial sum of ¬£50,000, and agreed a payment plan with Michael and his lawyers, which included Michael having a legal charge imposed on McEvoy's home. In 2012, while a councillor, he presented a petition in the Welsh language, resulting in an argument with representatives of other parties. Despite protests, Councillor McEvoy declined to speak in English at the council meeting. After being elected to the Senedd in May 2016, McEvoy kept his position as a councillor on Cardiff Council, receiving the councillor's basic allowance of ¬£13,300 in addition to the Senedd salary of ¬£64,000. His Labour Party opponents described this as hypocrisy, saying that he had previously said it was wrong for people in public office to be a councillor and to work in another job. In March 2017 a Cardiff Council tribunal found a comment that McEvoy made to a council officer after a tenant's eviction hearing in 2015 amounted to \\"bullying behaviour\\". The Adjudication Panel for Wales ruled he broke Cardiff council's code of conduct but did not bring the council into disrepute. After the hearing, Mr McEvoy described the panel proceedings as a \\"farce\\", but Plaid chairman Alun Ffred Jones said the matter was \\"serious because it involves bullying\\". McEvoy was subsequently suspended from the Plaid Cymru Senedd group on 7 March 2017 and reinstated two weeks later. A Plaid Cymru disciplinary panel was to consider the complaints later in the Autumn. In September 2017, McEvoy was suspended again, after a unanimous decision by Plaid's Assembly group, following accusations that he had undermined Plaid Cymru's policy on council housing. In December 2018 McEvoy was referred to the Assembly Standards Commissioner after he was accused by his former office manager, Michael Deem, of misusing Assembly funds for printing leaflets and recruiting staff for party political, rather than Assembly work. Deem refused to comment on media reports, and McEvoy responded by stating that he \\"will continue to ask the difficult questions that some people don't want asked\\". In January 2018 he was expelled from the Plaid Cymru group in the Welsh Assembly, with a spokesperson stating that \\"his ongoing behaviour has left Assembly Member colleagues feeling undermined and demoralised\\". He currently sits as an independent. McEvoy posted to Twitter in March 2018, and later deleted, a response to an earlier post about former Plaid leader and AM Leanne Wood with an image of himself and Dafydd Elis-Thomas wearing boxing gloves outside the Senedd. The tweet was captioned \\"we're ready for her\\", and was deleted after AMs including Plaid minister Bethan Sayed said the tweet was \\"absolutely not funny\\". Matthew Ford, a senior advisor to McEvoy, later came forward to state he had posted the image without McEvoy's prior knowledge, to promote a \\"cross-party boxing event with the minister for sport\\". In July 2019, McEvoy was again investigated, this time for accusations that he had bullied a care home worker. McEvoy had contended that the case involved a child who had suffered \\"the worst case I've come across in 30 years\\". The investigation by the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales came during McEvoy's request in June to be re- admitted to the party, following over a year out of the party. The Plaid Membership, Discipline and Standards Committee was described as \\"evenly split\\" during deliberations into the case. However shortly after, the committee's panel saw \\"two instances of unauthorised disclosure\\" of information which stated the panel had failed to reach a decision. The news leak led to the party deciding to disband the panel and form a new panel with new members. As a result, McEvoy withdrew his application to re-join Plaid Cymru, and in a letter accused two members of the Membership, Discipline and Standards Committee panel of holding \\"prejudiced views about\\" him, as well as complaining of \\"malicious\\" leaks intended to bring down \\"a non-compliant panel\\". Plaid AM Helen Mary Jones however stated that the process was fair, and that the issue had consumed too much of \\"our time and our resources\\". She has indicated the Party would likely contact McEvoy through its solicitors regarding his claims. McEvoy is believed to have withdrawn his application due to party rules which state that if his application had been rejected in 2019, he would have been unable to reapply for a further five years. Personal life McEvoy lives in Cardiff with his wife Ceri. He has a daughter. His sister Lisa Ford is a Cardiff councillor for the Welsh National Party, having resigned from Plaid Cymru at the same time as McEvoy.

Location of Kittanning Gap, along a tributary of the Kittanning Run. Location of Kittanning Gap. The Kittanning Run is one of the several streams draining the Allegheny Plateau, each one cutting an abrupt valley, one of the gaps of the Allegheny-- one of several climbing valleys used for centuries by the Amerindian native peoples to pass East-to-West through the Allegheny Front escarpment, a barrier ridge separating the flat highlands plateau, the Appalachian Plateau--from the many barrier ridges making up the local Ridge- and-Valley Appalachians in the Central Pennsylvania heartland. The stream was very likely followed by the Kittanning Path connecting the Indian communities west of the Alleghenies, especially Kittanning Village with the large Indian settlements in the Susquehanna Valley and points east though the naming of the divergent run up through the Kittanning Gap suggests settlers may have bent the trail up to the plateau along a wider shallower grade, perhaps more suitable to settlers carts and Conestoga wagons migrating west. Unlike the Pennsylvania Canal System which built the Allegheny Portage Railroad for the 1845 railroad line chartered (ordered, in effect) to cross the Allegheny Mountains. The challenge of constructing a railroad through the ridge led to the construction of the unique Horseshoe Curve in 1854, once trumpeted as the world's busiest railway, and now designated as a National Historic Landmark. History In the 18th century the Kittanning Path passed through the gap, providing a route between central and western Pennsylvania for Native Americans and early white settlers. Why the gap is left of the Kittanning Run can only be speculated upon, but a topographical examination suggests for 16th-19th century peoples on foot or pulling a cart or Conestoga wagon, turning right up the gap would lead them across gentler climbing terrains, so may have been the path of choice up onto the tableland above versus the climbs along either bigger stream.

The Navy purchased her in 1804 and she served for some months in 1805 as HMS Sandwich before she was sold in Jamaica. During this period she captured three small French privateers in two days. British service On 14 October 1798 Sandwich captured the Dutch hoy Hoop and her cargo. was in sight. Capture Sandwich was under the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and cruising off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away.Hepper (1994), p.91. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur,Winfield and Roberts (2015), p.246. to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as best she could. By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Cr√©ole.

On 6 May Sandwich was on the Bahama Banks, about eight leagues from West Caicos. She was in company with the schooner Nassau when together they encountered the French privateer schooner Renom√©e.Nassaus status is unclear. She is not listed on the rolls of the Royal Navy. She may have been a vessel briefly acquired locally, perhaps by capture, or a privateer. Renom√©e was armed with one long 9-pounder gun and two 4-pounders, and had a crew of 56 men. The next day Sandwich and Nassau captured the privateer Rencontre. Rencontre was armed with two 4-pounder guns and had a crew of 42 men. That same day the British vessels captured V√©nus, which was armed with one gun and had a crew of 35 men. Bernarding would have liked to continue to cruise but felt obliged to cut his cruise short because of the number of prisoners he had taken. Fate The Navy sold Sandwich in Jamaica in 1805.

The election, held on 20 December, was won by James Gapes, who beat fellow city councillor Charles Thomas Ick. Background Initially, councillors elected one of their own as mayor towards the end of the year, and the role was usually awarded to the most senior councillor. The system changed with the introduction of The Municipal Corporations Acts Amendment Act, 1875, as that legislation stipulated that mayors had to be elected at large (i.e. by eligible voters). In December 1875, when the new act first applied, the incumbent mayor, Fred Hobbs, was the only candidate nominated. The returning officer, Edward Bishop, thus declared Hobbs elected unopposed on 17 December 1875. After having served two terms, it became known at the beginning of November 1876 that Hobbs would not seek election for a third term. This was regretted by one of the local newspapers, The Star, as they regarded him as having \\"discharged his duties with a thoroughness and zeal which will not be readily equalled by his successor.\\" In the same editorial, the two eventual candidates were named. From December 1876 onwards, George Leslie Lee acted as returning officer for mayoral elections for many years. Candidates ;James Gapes James Gapes was from Essex in England. He came to Christchurch with his wife, children, and a relative in 1859. They travelled as assisted immigrants, i.e. they were part of a supported immigration scheme and thus of humble origin. He started a glass, paint and paperhanging business in Victoria Street and was a member of many organisations. He was also known as a flutist, giving concerts together with Sir John Cracroft Wilson. Gapes was first voted onto Christchurch City Council as a city councillor in a February 1873 by-election. ;Charles Thomas Ick Charles Thomas Ick was an auctioneer by trade. He came from Otago to Christchurch in 1870. He was first elected as a city councillor in October 1872. Election Eligible electors in Christchurch had their first opportunity to vote for a mayor on 20 December 1876. Gapes represented working class interests, whereas Ick represented the wealthier part of the population. Gapes won the election, and was sworn in as mayor at the next Christchurch City Council meeting on 2 January 1877. Gapes was defeated at the next mayoral election in December 1877 by Henry Thomson, but won another election as mayor in November 1880. Ick became mayor in November 1878 when he beat Thomson.

The building will replace a preexisting branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. It is being developed by Hudson Companies and designed by Marvel Architects. __FORCETOC__ History Revised renderings of the structure were released in June 2015. In addition, as part of the project, 114 units of affordable housing will be built on two privately-owned sites in Community Board 2. The affordable housing will not utilize any public subsidy.15 This project comes at a time when NYC‚Äôs three public library systems have seen tremendous increases in utilization rates while public funding has remained well below what‚Äôs needed to fund repair and capital costs. The partnership behind 280 Cadman Plaza West speaks to the general public‚Äôs recommendation to utilize creative partnerships and reduce libraries‚Äô dependence on public funding. The redevelopment of 280 Cadman Plaza West is a unique opportunity to raise much needed capital to pay for deferred maintenance for other branches and to build an efficient and inspiring state- of-the-art library. The new Brooklyn Heights Branch will be the largest branch in the BPL system. The Brooklyn Heights branch library has been relocated to 109 Remsen Street, five blocks from the current location, to a renovated space at Our Lady of Lebanon Church. The interim library opened to the public in July 2016. Architecture The Brooklyn Public Library at 280 Cadman Plaza was built in 1962. The library was originally designed to serve as a library, as well as a fallout shelter. The two-story building had been open for half a century, when it was decided that the land would be redeveloped. Over that time the building had accrued much overdue maintenance. The Department of Design and Construction and a third party consultant separately assessed the property and agreed that the building had roughly $9 million worth of overdue capital needs. The building needed $3.6 million for a new heating, ventilation, and air cooling system. $4.2 million were needed for upgrades to the boiler, lighting, roof, and site drainage. $1 million would be required for new elevators. Lastly, $500,000 were needed for fire safety and security enhancements, which are held to a higher standard since the building was built. These large outstanding costs were big contributing factors in the decision to redevelop the location. Demolition plans for the site were filed and approved in March 2017, and demolition proceeded as planned. Hudson Companies, the developer of the project, is looking to turn the public library into a 36-story condominium building with a new high-tech public library at the base. The new building will be 409 feet tall, with as much as 294,773 square feet total. The new designs have a total of 134 total units. 8 apartments will be placed on the second floor of the building, twelve units will be on the third floor, and eight on the fourth. All of the floors above that will have fewer, larger, units. The average size of the units will be 2,064 square feet, with a total of 276,662 square feet which will be allocated to residential space. The lower three floors which will replace the old Brooklyn Library, and should span 26,624 square feet. The main entrance to the library will be on Cadman Plaza West. The building will also include a 9,000 square foot STEM Lab which will be made available to students in school district 13. Finally, a 930 square foot retail space will take up the remainder of the first floor. The architects of record for the new library and condominium (Marvel Architects) have gone with a contemporary design that should be practical while incorporating minimalism which will reduce how dated the building looks as it ages. As Marvel Architects states, ‚Äúa minimalist, highly repetitive, gridded facade clad in limestone gives the building an elegant presence within the varied urban context. The building‚Äôs distinct shape comes from its triangular footprint, creating three fa√ßades that address different parts of the city: the harbor to the southwest, Manhattan‚Äôs Midtown to the north, and the carpet of brownstone Brooklyn to the east.‚Äù There is some controversy regarding the two bas-reliefs which were made by Clemente Spampinato, which had to be removed before demolition could commence. Deputy Director of the PDC Keri Butler said of the bas-reliefs, ‚ÄúThe Public Design Commission has reviewed the methods and materials for removing the artworks from the facade of the library and temporarily storing them, and has found these methods to be appropriate with the understanding that a proposal for relocating the artworks within the new development at 280 Cadman Plaza West will be submitted by September 2017.‚Äù Controversy The sale of the building caused controversy. The site previously held a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, and initial proposals involving the sale of the site were opposed by two organizations: Citizens Defending Libraries and Love Brooklyn Libraries. Concerns included increased traffic, overpopulation of the local schools, the decrease of the library's space, and worries over the developer's pledge to provide affordable housing. The Brooklyn Public Library provided a defense of the sale, stating in front of city council that it receives insufficient funds from the city. However, a complaint sent to the city and state attorney general alleges that the Public Library has over $100 million in unspent funds. Usage The building will be residential, with the exception of a small retail space and first floor library branch. As part of the deal through which Hudson was given development rights,http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/2016/10/31/developer-to-demolish- brooklyn-heights-library 114 units of affordable housing will be built in Clinton Hill.

Personal life Elizabeth Compton was born in 1897 in Indian Hill, Ohio, to William Clay Compton and Minnie Gove. She was educated at a college preparatory school in Cincinnati. Hegemann married three times, changing her last name each time. In 1925 she married Michael Harrison, who worked for the National Park Service; they separated three years later. In 1929, she married Harry Rorick; this marriage lasted around a decade. Her third husband was Anton Hegemann (b. ca. 1890). Career Hegemann's interest in Southwest Native Americans developed during her first marriage, when she frequently visited Navajo and Hopi reservations within driving distance of the Grand Canyon, where her husband was stationed. She also apprenticed for a time at a local Indian arts and crafts shop. After her marriage broke up in the late 1920s, Hegemann moved to Tuba City on a Navajo Reservation in Coconino County, Arizona. With her second husband, she purchased the Shonto Trading Post, and beginning in the winter of 1929-30, they ran this business for a decade. During this period, she took many photographs of Native Americans, initially with a Kodak camera and later with a Graflex. At some point before World War II, she sold the trading post to Harry and remarried; the 1940 census lists her as living in San Diego with her third husband, Anton Hegemann. She spent the remainder of her life in southern California and New Mexico as well as Arizona. In 1963, Hegemann published Navaho Trading Days, a vivid account of her experiences at the Grand Canyon during the early days of its development as a tourist site, and on the reservation during her trading post days. Her text is accompanied by over 300 of her own documentary photographs of Native Americans (Navajo, Hopi, and Havasupai) and their villages, crafts, and ceremonies taken during the interwar years, along with photographs from the Grand Canyon. The book is recognized as an important source of information about life on the reservation during a transitional period. Hegemann also published one article on Navajo silver, in 1962. She died that same year. Legacy Hegemann's photographs and negatives are held by the following institutions: * A collection of her negatives and prints is held by the Museum of Northern Arizona. * A collection of 800 prints is held by the Huntington Library in California. * A collection of 35-mm copy negatives of prints used in Hegemann's book is held in the Smithsonian Institution's National Anthropological Archives. *A few of Hegemann's photographs and a manuscript of her book are included in a collection of documents related to her first husband, the Michael and Margaret B.

Abraham Lincoln Bush was born on December 14, 1860, in Palos Township, Illinois, the son of Lewis Bush and Mary Ritchey Bush. He was named for the newly elected president, although later dropped the name 'Abraham'. He was educated as a teacher at the Cook County Normal School, and taught for several years in public schools. Subsequently, he chose to become an engineer, and attended the University of Illinois. There he was a member and President of the Engineers' Club, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering in 1888. He then worked in a series of positions, as an assistant engineer at the Union Pacific Railroad and Pacific Shortline from 1888 to 1890, as assistant to Civil Engineer Elmer Lawrence Cathell from 1890 to 1892, as a Chief Draftsman in the West Office of the Pittsburg Bridge Company from 1892 to 1896, and Assistant Bridge Engineer and Acting Division Engineer for the Chicago and North Western Railroad from 1900 to 1903. Bush began work for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1900, and in 1903 became that railroad's Chief Engineer. a position he served in for six years, during which he directed many improvements to the line and facilities, sometimes working with the company architect, Frank J. Nies. Bush designed the tracks and sheds for the Lackawanna's Hoboken Terminal, the head house of which was designed by architect Kenneth Murchison. In place of the wide-span balloon roofs used at major terminals up to that time, Bush developed and patented a modular style of train shed known as Bush-style sheds, constructed of cast iron, steel and concrete, incorporating a vent over the tracks to allow steam and smoke to escape and skylights over the passenger platforms for illumination. Bush sheds were cheaper and easier to construct than balloon roofs, and were adopted for use at several major terminals in the years immediately following. Bush led planning of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, a huge project to eliminate curves, hills, and grade crossings, although construction was completed after he left the railroad. In 1909, Bush resigned from the DL&W; to become a partner in the civil engineering consulting firm Flickwir and Bush. During his time as president, chief engineer and treasurer of the firm he oversaw construction of the massive Tunkhannock Viaduct, the largest concrete structure in the world at the time, for the Lackawanna. During World War I he served in the construction division of the Army Quartermaster Corps as a Colonel, and designed ports, warehouses, arsenals, and other structures. Following the war, he and the officers of the Roberts & Schaefer Company organized the new engineering firm of Bush, Roberts & Schaefer Company to specialize in concrete bridges and viaducts, elevated tracks, piers, and general engineering. Bush served as President of the University of Illinois Alumni Association of New York, as Director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and was a member of the Western Society of Engineers, the American Railway Engineering Association, and the American Institute of Consulting Engineers. Lincoln Bush married Alma Rosetta Green of Colfax, Illinois, in 1890. They had two sons, Cedric Lincoln Bush, born in 1892, and Denzil Sidney Bush, born in 1901. They made their home in East Orange, New Jersey, where Bush was a member of the Arlington Avenue Presbyterian Church. He died at home on December 10, 1940.

Unlike bribery at lower ranks in the Wehrmacht, which was also widespread, these payments were regularized, technically legal and made with the full knowledge and consent of the leading Nazi figures. Background Historically, German and other European rulers commonly awarded titles, estates, and monetary rewards to diplomats and high-ranking officers. This was generally done to form a bond between the ruler and important subjects. The historical practice, however, differed from the one applied by Hitler. While in the Kingdom of Prussia, awards had usually been given publicly after successful campaigns or wars, Hitler dispensed the rewards to his elites in secret during the war. Diego Gambetta argues that Hitler's practice can be considered selective incentives rather than bribery, since bribery must involve three agents (the truster, the fiduciary and the corrupter) rather than two. In this case, Hitler's generals (the fiduciary) were paid to do what they were supposed to do for him (the truster, and not the corrupter) in any case. However, by accepting the gifts, the generals sacrificed the independence and the political clout they had already been losing as the result of the systematic consolidation of Hitler's role as the sole \\"genius strategist\\", and would remain chained to Hitler's decisions even when their soldiers and the common people suffered during the last phase of the war. Thus, historians consider the practice, although \\"not technically illegal\\" (since the gifts were granted by Hitler himself - who kept the monopoly on gift giving in Nazi Germany), \\"smacking of corruption\\" and \\"having an aura of deliberate corruption from above.\\" Some historians compare the practice with that used by Napoleon, his military class and his officials. Mechanism To ensure the absolute loyalty of the Wehrmacht officers and to console them over the loss of their \\"state within the state\\", Hitler had created what the American historian Gerhard Weinberg called a \\"a vast secret program of bribery involving practically all at the highest levels of command\\". Hitler routinely presented his leading commanders with \\"gifts\\" of free estates, cars, checks made out for large sums of cash, and lifetime exemptions from paying taxes. A typical example was a check made out for a half million Reichsmarks, presented to Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge in October 1942, together with the promise that he could bill the German treasury for any and all \\"improvements\\" that he might wish to make to his estate. Such was the success of Hitler's bribery system that by 1942, many officers had come to expect the bestowing of \\"gifts\\" from Hitler and were unwilling to bite the hand that fed them so generously. When Field Marshal Fedor von Bock was sacked by Hitler in December 1941, his first reaction was to contact Hitler's aide Rudolf Schmundt to ask if his sacking meant that he was no longer to receive bribes from the Konto 5 (\\"bank account 5\\") slush fund. =Konto 5 special fund= The Konto 5 slush fund, run by the chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers and distributed by Hitler as personal presents, started with a budget of about 150,000 Reichsmarks in 1933 and had grown to about 40 million Reichsmarks by 1945. Initially the funds came through his office as Reichskanzler and, after 1934, as Reichspr√§sident. The mandatory pre-1933 checks through parliament and the countersigning of the payments by the German finance minister were abolished by the Nazis. The money spent was at Hitler's discretion and required no other approval. . Payments from Konto 5, known officially as Aufwandsentsch√§digungen (\\"compensation for expenses\\"), had been made to Cabinet ministers and senior civil servants since April 1936. As part of the reorganization of the military command structure following the Blomberg‚ÄìFritsch Affair in early 1938, it was declared that the service chiefs, namely Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) Chief Wilhelm Keitel, Army commander Walter von Brauchitsch, Luftwaffe commander Hermann G√∂ring and Kriegsmarine commander Erich Raeder were to have the same status as Cabinet ministers and so all started to receive publicly the same pay as a Cabinet member and privately payments from Konto 5. The basis of the corruption system was monthly, tax-free payments of 4,000 Reichsmarks deposited in the bank accounts of field marshals and grand admirals and 2000 Reichsmarks for all other senior officers. On top of the money from Konto 5, officers received cheques, usually made out for the sum of 250,000 Reichsmarks, as birthday presents; they were exempt from income tax but not on interest earned from the money. That money came in addition to the official salary of 26,000 Reichsmarks a year for field marshals and grand admirals and 24,000 Reichsmarks a year for colonel generals and general admirals, as well as tax- exempt payments of 400 and 300 Reichsmarks a month, respectively, to help deal with the rising wartime living costs. In addition, senior officers were given a lifetime exemption from paying income tax, which was, in effect, a huge pay raise because of Germany's high income tax rates (by 1939, there was a 65% tax rate for income over 2,400 Reichsmark), and they were also provided with spending allowances for food, medical care, clothing and housing. In contrast, infantrymen who had the dangerous task of clearing landmines were given a 1 Reichsmark a day as a danger pay supplement. (1 Reichsmark was worth around $0.40 in 1940, or about $13 in 2015 (based on gold prices).Historical currency converter) =Nature of payments= Before any officer began to receive money, they met with Lammers, who informed them that future payments would depend on how much loyalty they were willing to show Hitler. They were advised that what he gave with one hand could just as easily be taken away with the other. The illicit nature of the payments was emphasised by Lammers's warning to them not to speak about the payments to anyone and to keep as few written records as possible. The money from Konto 5 was deposited for the officer's lifetime and did not stop when he retired. In the last months of the war, Erich von Manstein, Wilhelm List, Georg von K√ºchler and Maximilian von Weichs kept on changing the bank accounts into which Lammers had to deposit the money from Konto 5 to avoid the Allied advance. Much correspondence went back and forth between the officers and Lammers, as they kept writing anxiously to make certain that he was depositing their monthly bribes into the right accounts. Notable recipients =August von Mackensen= The first officer to be bribed for loyalty was the old World War I hero Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who welcomed the Nazi regime but criticized the murder of General Kurt von Schleicher in a speech before the General Staff Association in February 1935. To silence him, Hitler gave Mackensen a free estate of 1,250 hectares later that same year. This endowment was public and not secret. After this, according to Goda, von Mackensen remained loyal to the regime, although not enough from Hitler's point-of-view. In February 1940, Mackensen mentioned to Walther von Brauchitsch his view that the army had disgraced itself by committing massacres during the recent campaign in Poland. In 1942, Hitler was angered when reported that Mackensen helped to spread a defeatist letter among the generals (Goda consider this to be a falsified rumour; according to Goebbels' report, while the letter itself was a forgery, von Mackensen did play a major part in disseminating it). Hitler and Goebbels considered this disloyalty, although Mackensen was not punished by losing his estate. =Walther von Brauchitsch= In 1938, Brauchitsch decided to divorce his wife to marry a much younger woman who happened to be a \\"two hundred per cent rabid Nazi\\". The divorce court had a less kind view of Brauchitsch's decision to end his marriage than did his political master, and awarded the first Frau von Brauchitsch a substantial settlement. Hitler earned Brauchitsch's eternal gratitude by agreeing to use German tax-payers' money to pay his entire divorce settlement, said to have been between 80,000 and 250,000 Reichsmark. Brauchitsch had been promoted to army commander to replace Fritsch, who had resigned following false allegations of homosexuality, and was a compromise candidate as the army had refused to accept Hitler's first choice of Walther von Reichenau as Fritsch's successor. =Heinz Guderian= As well as money, in early 1943, General Heinz Guderian was informed that if he wanted an estate in Poland, to tell Hitler whose land he wanted, and he would get it. This resulted in him making several visits to Poland to find the right estate to steal. This caused some problems with the SS, which had designs on some of the estates that Guderian desired before a deal was worked out about which estate he could take. His bribe of a 937 hectares estate, confiscated from its Polish owner, was tax-free for his entire life-time. Historian Norman Goda wrote that after Guderian received his Polish estate, the doubts he had been expressing since late 1941 about Hitler's military leadership suddenly ceased, and he became one of Hitler's most ardent military supporters, or, as Joseph Goebbels described him in his diary, \\"a glowing and unqualified follower of the F√ºhrer\\". Before receiving his \\"gift\\" of a Polish estate, Guderian, as Inspector General for the Panzers, had been opposed to the plans for Unternehmen Zitadelle, which was to lead to the Battle of Kursk, one of Germany's worst defeats of the war; after receiving the estate, Guderian did a 180¬∞ turn about as to the wisdom of the operation. Instead of criticizing Zitadelle openly, Guderian approached Goebbels to ask him if he could talk Hitler out of it, behavior that Goda described as very atypical. Guderian was well known for his brash, blunt, outspoken style, for his rudeness to those he disliked, (in a notorious incident later in 1943, Guderian refused to shake the hand of Field Marshal Kluge because as he told him to his face he was not worthy of shaking hands), and for using vulgar, profanity-ridden language to describe a plan if he believed it to be a bad one. Guderian had foreknowledge of the 20 July plot of 1944 and did not report it to Hitler, but he did not commit himself to it either. On 20 July, Guderian withdrew to his Deipenhof estate and could not be contacted by the resistance. According to Goda, when it became clear that Hitler was still alive, Guderian ordered the Panzer units in Berlin to be loyal to the regime, and then sat on the Court of Honor that had the responsibility of expelling officers involved in it so that they could be tried before the Volksgerichtshof, a duty that he performed with zeal. It was only after January 1945, when Guderian's estate fell behind Soviet lines, that he began to disagree openly once more with Hitler. These disagreements were so intense that Hitler fired Guderian as Chief of the General Staff in March 1945. Goda comments that much of the fury that Guderian expressed in his 1950 memoir Erinnerungen eines Soldaten about what he regarded as unjust border changes after the war in Poland's favor, seemed to be related to his intensely held private view that the Poles had no right to take away the Polish estate that Hitler had given to him. =Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb= In 1943, retired Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb managed to have the German state buy him an entire district of prime forest land in Bavaria, valued at 638,000 Reichsmark, on which to build his estate. In late June-early July 1941 Leeb, as the commander of Army Group North, had witnessed first-hand the massacres committed by the Einsatzgruppen, Lithuanian auxiliaries, and the men of the 16th Army, outside Kaunas. As a Roman Catholic, Leeb was described as being \\"moderately disturbed\\" after seeing the killing fields, and sent in mildly critical reports about the massacres. Leeb approved of the killing of Lithuanian Jewish men, claiming that this was justified by the crimes that they were supposed to have committed during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania; but the killing of women and children might have been taking things too far.Krausnick, Helmut & Wilhelm, Hans-Heinrich Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges: Die Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD 1938‚Äì1942, Stuttgart: 1981 pp. 207‚Äì209. In response, Hitler's aide General Rudolf Schmundt told Leeb that he was completely out of line for criticizing the massacres at Kaunas, and should co-operate fully with the SS in \\"special tasks\\" in future. Schmundt asked if Leeb really appreciated his monthly payments from Konto 5, and reminded him that his birthday was coming up in September; the F√ºhrer was planning to give him a 250,000 Reichsmark cheque as a present to reward his loyalty. Leeb never said a word in protest of the \\"Final Solution\\" again, and duly received a 250,000 Reichsmark cheque in September 1941. In September 1941, Franz Walter Stahlecker, the commander of Einsatzgruppe A, in a report to Berlin, had nothing but praise for Leeb's Army Group North, which he reported had been exemplary in co-operating with his men in murdering Jews in the Baltic states.Hilberg, Raul The Destruction of the European Jews, New York: Holmes & Meier, 1985, p. 301 The historian Norman Goda used Leeb as an all-too typical example of a Wehrmacht officer whose greed overwhelmed any sort of moral revulsion that they might have felt about the Holocaust. =Other officers= In general, officers who were in some way critical of Hitler's military, if not necessarily political leadership, such as Leeb, Raeder, and Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt received (and accepted) larger bribes than officers who were well known to be convinced National Socialists such as General Walter Model, Admiral Karl D√∂nitz and Field Marshal Ferdinand Sch√∂rner. The success of Hitler's bribery system backfired in that some officers, such as Raeder, who had proven himself especially greedy, came to be regarded by Hitler as a serious annoyance because of his endless demands for more money, and more free land for his estates. Raeder's demand in 1942 that, on top of his life-time exemption from paying income taxes, Hitler also cancel taxes on the interest he earned from his 4,000 Reichsmarks a month payment from Konto 5, was viewed as outrageous. In 1944, Wolfram von Richthofen wrote to the OKW to argue that since he was stationed in Italy, at least 1,000 Reichsmarks of the 4,000 Reichsmarks deposited in his bank account every month should be in lire to compensate for the effects of rampant inflation in Italy. This demand was regarded as unreasonable even by Wilhelm Keitel who normally did not reject providing financial rewards for service to the F√ºhrer. According to Goda, payments from Konto 5 to the bank account of General Friedrich Paulus stopped in August 1943, not because he had lost the Battle of Stalingrad but because he had gone on Soviet radio to blame Hitler for the defeat. Goda notes that the 1944 list of recipients (of the Generaloberst ranks and above) of the monthly allowance includes Erwin von Witzleben and others who were associated with the July 1944 Plot, but these names are crossed off. According to Goda, after the failure of 20 July plot in 1944, the families of Erwin Rommel, Franz Halder, Friedrich Fromm and G√ºnther von Kluge were punished by being cut off from the monthly payments from Konto 5. In the case of Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, his family was ordered to repay some of the bribe money that he had received from Konto 5, since the money was given as a reward for loyalty to the F√ºhrer. Witzleben was evidently not loyal. Also based on statistics collected from Bundesarchiv Berlin, R 43 II, the account of Uebersch√§r and Vogel includes Halder among the 1944 recipients, but not Rommel, Kluge, Fromm and Witzleben (Uebersch√§r and Vogel do not provide statistics regarding the recipients of previous years). Although they note that Rommel was among the officers invited by Lammers to join the system in 1942, the two historians opine that whether he did successfully object to the donations cannot be known using current archival sources. According to Peter Lieb, the current state of research does not indicate Rommel as a recipient of Hitler's donations. According to Uebersch√§r and Vogel, Kurt Zeitzler is also said in the literature to have refused a donation, but this, too, cannot be found in archival sources. Zeitzler was among the 1944 recipients of the monthly allowance. Post-war The subject of the payments proved to be an embarrassing one for its recipients. Under oath at the Nuremberg trials, Walther von Brauchitsch committed perjury when he denied taking any bribes. Brauchitsch's bank records showed that he had been receiving 4,000 Reichsmark per month payments from Konto 5 from 1938 until the end of the war. At his trial in 1948, General Franz Halder perjured himself when he denied that he had taken bribes, and then had to maintain a stern silence when the American prosecutor James M. McHaney produced bank records showing otherwise. Erhard Milch admitted accepting money when under oath in 1947, but claimed that this was only compensation for the salary that he had been making as an executive at Lufthansa, a claim that Goda called \\"ridiculous\\". Weinberg commented that \\"the bribery system understandably does not figure prominently in the endless memoir literature of the recipients and has attracted little scholarly attention\\".

Origin and characteristics The Magna glossatura is a set of glosses written beside passages from the Latin Vulgate Bible. These glosses were written by Peter the Lombard during his teaching career and before he became the bishop of Paris (1159‚Äì1160). His gloss of Psalms and his gloss of the Pauline Epistles (referred to as the Collectanea) were compiled and became a part of the official gloss on the Bible. This collection of glosses would take on the name of Magna glossatura and would, during the 12th century, replace the Glossa ordinaria as the most frequently studied and copied exegetical gloss of the Bible. His other works included the Libri Quatuor Sententiarum (or the Four Books of Sentences) and his commentaries in the glossa Ordinaria. The Magna glossatura, along with other systematic glosses, would have been developed at theological schools such as Laon and Saint-Victor of Paris, and would have been used for the research conducted by theologians as well as the teaching of students in biblical exegesis. The layout of text in the Magna glossatura, is written in the intercisum (or intercut) format, which was developed by Peter Lombard. It was developed as a way of distinguishing scripture from the commentaries by writing the biblical verses in a larger script and on alternate lines next to the commentary, which would be ordered into columns. Blocks of scripture were then placed on the left edge of the columns to balance the biblical verses with the commentary. The intercisum method, from ca.1160, began to be applied to glosses on all the books of the Bible. This layout also gave glosses and their commentators greater influence in their relationship with the Word of God, as these glosses played a larger role in theological books by forming an essential reading in connection with the biblical text. Peter Lombard's gloss of the Pauline Epistles features not only commentaries concerning the traditional mode of reflection on the Christian faith, which regards the biblical text as sacra pagina, but also commentaries of systematic theology. As a result, Lombard writes on specific theological themes which deal with issues such as the nature of the Trinity. Lombard's glosses also include references to the works of other ecclesiastical figures and theologians, Ambrose and Augustine to name a few. The biblical commentaries and ideas present in the Magna glossatura are also present in the various sermons given by Peter Lombard to his peers and to his cathedral's congregation.

The GEA is responsible for the nation‚Äôs expanding entertainment sector.  History  On May 7, 2016, King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia announced a royal decree which included 67 announcements. Among the restructured and renamed councils, the General Authority for Entertainment was created. The General Authority for Culture was the only other entity to be created as a result of the announcements in the royal decree.  Mission  The Saudi population spends $22 billion dollars in tourism and entertainment outside the country every year. The government aims to transform 25% of that spending into local travel and entertainment to create a solid Saudi tourism economy. The Saudi Vision 2030 plan aims to raise capital by harnessing the previously unaddressed entertainment sector, helping to \\"nurture entertainment in all its forms, while also seeking to safeguard our precious cultural heritage\\". The General Authority for Entertainment defines the vision and evolution of the Saudi Arabia‚Äôs entertainment industry. It partners with both public and private actors, to reduce government spending on entertainment. In December 2016, the General Authority for Entertainment‚Äôs Chairman, Ahmed Al Khateeb, stated that the organization was created to boost citizen participation and opportunities for the youth.  Events and entertainment facilities  In early 2017, Jeddah held the first-ever Saudi Comic Con. The event dedicated to films, comics and anime featured celebrity appearances and was backed by the General Authority for Entertainment. In November 2016, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced planned expansions into Saudi Arabia, and the board of the GEA was appointed to manage the development of the theme parks in the country. Three parks are planned for construction, with the first one set to open by 2021. The General Authority for entertainment launched an online entertainment calendar, Roznamah (calendar in Arabic), in order to communicate about, and compile over 300 upcoming and past events, nationwide. It features upcoming film screenings and performances by Cirque du Soleil, Universe Science, the Light Festival and the Lion King musical. In March 2019, the GEA in collaboration with the General Sports Authority, General Culture Authority and the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage organized Sharqiah Season in the Eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Sharqiah Season is a 17-day festival that is launched in the shores of Alkhobar Corniche where many activities take place. Among such activities, the King Abdul Aziz Center for World Culture (Ithra) features the lives of many prominent artists and intellectuals from all over the world, such as Leonardo da Vinci.Moreover, 80 events were allocated this season to feature a number of Saudi cities including, Dammam, Dhahran, Alkhobar, Al-Ahsa and Jubail. As part of the Season, thousands of youngsters attended the first Saudi Colour Run in Khobar. This festival comes in the framework of the Saudi Vision 2030 that aims at boosting local tourism and entertainment. GEA has organized the largest Quran competition and the first Adhan competition in 2019. The competition has been participated by 13,000 from 162 countries. The main aim of the contest is to highlight the cultural diversity in the Islamic World that is shown in the different Quran recitation and adhan styles.  New Entertainment Academy  GEA has supported the establishment of an entertainment academy. The academy is planned to open in September 2019 and provide a number of courses and diploma programs. The academy will be located in Riyadh. The main goal of the project is to provide Saudi youth with the tools necessary to enable them to work in the flourishing entertainment sector in Saudi Arabia.  International Scholarship Program  The GEA launched an international scholarship program that aims at training and educating young Saudis in the entertainment field in a number of prestigious universities worldwide. This program is undertaken in partnership with the Qiddiya Investment Co. (QIC). The program will enable its students to have a future job in Qiddiya mega project as well as the many other entertainment projects taking place in Saudi Arabia.  Board  The board‚Äôs members meet every three months, and include male, female, foreign and local actors, with His Excellency Turki Al-Sheikh as Chairman of the GEA.

Like the closely related and also extinct phorusrhacids, it was a flightless predator, occupying predatory niches in environments classically considered to be dominated by mammals. It was a highly diverse and successful genus, spanning a large number of species that occurred from the Priabonian Eocene to the Burdigalian Miocene epochs. Description Though most material is highly incomplete, Bathornis is nonetheless known from a variety of skeletal elements: hindlimbs (most commonly tarso-metatarsals), forelimb elements (especially humeri), pelvises and skulls.Federico L.

Annals of the Carnegie Museum 30: 57‚Äì69.Gerald Mayr (2009). Paleogene Fossil Birds The bathornithid second toe is currently unknown, but the first toe is highly reduced, as with most Cariamiformes, and like phorusrhacids it possesses a robust jugal and reduced processus acrocoracoideus of coracoid, two features possibly having evolved in convergence due to their similar lifestyle.\\"Sistem√°tica y Filogenia de las Aves Fororracoideas (Gruiformes, Cariamae)\\" (PDF). Fundaci√≥n de Historia Natural Felix de Azara: 1‚Äì79.Gerald Mayr (2016). \\"Osteology and phylogenetic affinities of the middle Eocene North American Bathornis grallator‚Äîone of the best represented, albeit least known Paleogene cariamiform birds (seriemas and allies)\\". Journal of Paleontology 90 (2): 357‚Äì374. doi:10.1017/jpa.2016.45. Overall, Bathornis is a long legged, short-winged, large skulled bird, similar in shape to phorusrhacids. Its numerous species span a large diversity of body sizes, ranging from forms about as large as modern seriemas to 2 meter tall animals. Classification Bathornis is the type genus of Bathornithidae, a family of Cariamiformes, related to the modern seriemas (this relationship has been recognised ever since its first description) and also a variety of extinct forms like phorusrhacids, Strigogyps and idiornithids, in turn part of the Australaves assemblage that also includes falcons, passerines and parrots. Interspecific relations within the Cariamiformes are highly volatile and unresolved, bathornithids at times having been listed as sister taxa to seriemas, phorusrhacids and idiornithids, sometimes even as a polyphyletic group. It is usually considered the sister clade to Paracrax, and several authorities consider Neocathartes and several other taxa to be nested with it (see below). However, at least one phylogenetic study recovers Bathornis (and its synonyms) as more closely related to phorusrhacids than to Paracrax, though this is considered premature and based on far too few synapomorphies. The most recent phylogenetic studies find Bathornis to be the sole representative of Bathornithidae, within Cariamiformes but outside of the clade composing seriemas and phorusrhacids. Paracrax is found to be outside of Bathornithidae, with its status as a Cariamiformes uncertain. Discovery and naming The type species is B. veredus, its type specimen being Denver Mus. Nat. Hist. No. 805, a limb element (distal portion of a metatarsus), recovered by Philip Reinheinter from Oligocene deposits of Weld County, Colorado, which also heralded the cathartid Phasmagyps. First described by Alexander Wetmore, the bird was referred as a \\"cedicnemidid\\" (a wastebasket taxon for \\"thick-knee\\" birds) related to modern seriemas, erecting the subfamily Bathornithinae. Two birds described alongside it, the putative rallid Palaeocrex and the putative cathartid Palaeogyps, would later turn out to be bathornithid material, the latter in particular synonymous with B. veredus. The bird was noted as being massive in comparison to its modern seriema relatives, presumably the reason as to receive its genus name, \\"tall bird\\". The species name, \\"veredus\\", is not given an explanation, though it is a Latin word relating to speed.wikt:veredus Species Bathornis is noted for its high number of species, and is the most speciose of all Cariamiformes, extinct or extant. A minimum of five species are consistently recognised, with several otherwise monotypic taxa often either aligned with this genus or rendered outright synonyms of established species. Some caution has been suggested, given the possibility that some sympatric species might actually represent different sexes or morphs, though the vast temporal spanning of the genus still offers a large diversity. =Bathornis veredus= The type species, whose discovery and etymology is mentioned above. It is known from Eocene and Oligocene deposits of the Chadron Formation in Colorado and Nebraska. It is known from multiple tibiotarsal material, depicting an animal roughly the size of a modern emu, something that earned it the description of \\"one of the most remarkable of recent additions to our fossil avifauna.\\" Skull material from this species is also known. =Bathornis cursor= A species first described by Alexander Wetmore in 1933. Though occurring in the same deposits as B. veredus and similar to it in size, B. cursor is nonetheless considered distinct due to several features of the trochea. Wetmore referred to the bird as \\"a large edition of Bathornis celeripes from the same deposits\\", but posterior analysis showcases strong distinction from that taxon as well, and it occurs in considerably earlier deposits. =Bathornis geographicus= A species first described by Alexander Wetmore in 1942. An upper Oligocene species from deposits in South Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming, quite possibly a direct descendant of B. veredus itself. It is a larger bird than B. veredus and B. cursor, quite possibly the largest described member of the genus, and it co-existed with the similar sized Paracrax gigantea in the Brule Formation, where it shared a macropredatory role with it and mammals like Hyaenodon. =Bathornis fax= Originally referred to the rallid genus Palaeocrex (in the same paper originally describing B. veredus, no less), further examination has shown it to belong to Bathornis. There is some doubt about whereas it represents a different species or a younger morph of B. veredus.; if it is its own independent species, it is among the smallest forms at about the size of a modern seriema. =Bathornis celeripes= A species described by Wetmore in 1958, dating to the upper Oligocene deposits of South Dakota. It is relatively well studied at about 16 specimens, mostly of hindlimbs but also forelimb and shoulder girdle material. Though it was described as a smaller variant of B. cursor by Wetmore, it was actually similar to it in size, though it was still dwarfed by the larger B. geographicus and the larger Paracrax species, which would have co-existed with it. =Bathornis fricki= One of the youngest of all bathornithid species, recovered form Early Miocene Arikareean deposits in Willow Creek. There is a strong similarity to B. celeripes, and some researchers consider it to be the direct ancestor of B. fricki. =Bathornis minor= A species conspecific with B. fricki, known from a similar tibiotrasus that differs in several respects from its contemporary. =Bathornis grallator= B. grallator is known from the late Eocene Washakie Formation of Wyoming; similar fossils have been described from the Willwood Formation, but their status as Cariamiformes, let alone bathornithids, are unclear. Originally interpreted as a terrestrial cathartid, Storrs Olson reassigned it to Bathornis in 1985: > The reconstruction published with the original description of Neocathartes > has often been reprinted and has now made the \\"terrestrial vulture\\" an > integral part of the lore of avian paleontology. Well, forget it. > Neocathartes is just our old friend Bathornis in another guise. Since then, posterior researchers have flip-flopped in their evaluation of Neocathartes as a junior synonym of Bathornis, but most recent studies consistently refer to it within this genus. =Other forms= Several undescribed remains from the late Eocene and Oligocene have been putatively assigned to Bathornis. Palaeobiology Bathornis as a whole were large, terrestrial birds with long and powerful legs. Most if not all species are thought to having been flightless (B. grallator is traditionally considered as having been volant, but has since been found to be flightless), perhaps more specialised to this regard than even Paracrax, having proportionally short wings and keel, as well as a reduced processus acrocoracoideus in the coracoid. Bathornis was a carnivorous bird. Bathornis grallator and Bathornis veredus showcase that it had a strong beak akin to that of phorusrhacids, even sharing an identical reinforcement of the jugal, implicating a similar biting stresses. As Bathornis species reached large sizes, it is likely that they were apex predators within their environment, much as their South American phorusrhacid cousins; alongside the closely related Paracrax, they are examples of large predatory birds managing to compete successfully with mammals, having co-existed with large carnivorous mammals for over 17 million years. Palaeoecology Due to its longevity and high number of species, Bathornis spanned across several different types of environment. As a rule of thumb, however, its known range occurred around what is now the Great Plains; this prompted Wetmore to imagine it as a strider in open plains environments: > Geologists, from available evidence, inform its that North America during > the Oligocene was comparatively level with low relief, so that we may > imagine the species here under discussion as coursing over extensive plains. However, more recent analyses conclude that it probably favoured wetland biomes. In either case, Bathornis is found among rich mammalian faunas. B. cursor is found in close association with Megacerops, and B. geographicus with Merycoidodon, which might imply predation on these mammals. It shared its environment with several carnivorous mammals like hyaenodontids, entelodonts and nimravids, as well as the fellow cariamiform Paracrax, with which it would have competed. In particular, there may be evidence of niche partitioning with the latter, as it occurs in drier environments.

It is located in Bronx, New York which contains some of the poorest urban districts in the United States. It is managed by the Montefiore Department of Family and Social Medicine and offers training in 3 primary care specialities: internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics. It has trained over 700 physicians in primary care with a focus on medically underserved populations.  History  The program was founded in 1970 by Drs. Harold Wise and David Kindig. In 1973 family practice was added as a third track. Residents worked in partnerships and maintained their continuity practices at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Health Center, which Dr. Wise had begun in 1968. The RSPM was their response to the difficulty of recruiting physicians to MLK who could work effectively with the community and other members of the health care team. At the time MLK was the flagship of the neighborhood health center movement of the Office of Economic Opportunity, the main federal agency coordinating Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. In 1973 Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, one of the residency program‚Äôs first pediatric graduates, became its director and began developing the social medicine curriculum in which all three disciplines shared. This included health systems skills, such as medical care organization and economics; community and organizational skills, such as medical anthropology, Spanish and community-based projects; research and evaluation skills, such as epidemiology, biostatistics, and health services research; and educational and teaching skills, including patient education and curriculum development. In 1977 the family practice track moved its continuity practice from the Martin Luther King Health Center to North Central Bronx Hospital and in 1980 the Montefiore Family Health Center was opened and became the primary site for residency training and faculty practice in family medicine. Because of MLK‚Äôs fiscal problems, the pediatrics and internal medicine tracks moved to St. Barnabas Hospital in 1986. In 1990 several independent community health centers affiliated with MMC were organized into the Montefiore Ambulatory Care Network under Dr. Robert Massad. In 1991 pediatrics and internal medicine moved to the Ambulatory Care Network, now divided between the Comprehensive Health Care Center in the South Bronx and the Comprehensive Family Care Center in the East Bronx. In 1997, when the Comprehensive Health Care Center moved into a new facility, the social internal medicine and pediatrics tracks were again consolidated there. The Comprehensive Health Care Center, Comprehensive Family Care Center, and Family Health Center are all federally qualified health centers. In 1992 the Department of Family Medicine at Montefiore, which administers the Residency Program in Social Medicine, became an academic department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with a Division of Research, a required third year clerkship for medical students, and its own inpatient ward at Montefiore. Dr. Massad became the first Chairman of Family Medicine at Einstein with affiliated residencies at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center. In 1993 Dr. Massad received national recognition awards from both the National Association of Community Health Centers and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine. In 1995 the Residency Program in Social Medicine became the first organization to receive the National Primary Care Achievement Award in Education from the Pew Charitable Trust. In 1996 the Ambulatory Care Network merged with the Montefiore Medical Group and another graduate of the Social Medicine residency program, Dr. Kathryn Anastos, was recruited as its first medical director. Family practice residents began work at the Castle Hill and Valentine Lane family practices, where medical students had been rotating since 1993. In 1998 Dr. Massad was succeeded by another Social Medicine residency graduate, Dr. Peter Selwyn, as Chair of the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. Dr. Selwyn enlarged the Research Division and initiated a Palliative Care Service, including inpatient hospice beds. In 2000 the Valentine Lane Family Practice was transferred to the St. John‚Äôs Riverside Hospital System in Yonkers, and half of the family practice residency moved to the Williamsbridge Family Practice. In 2001 members of the department established the first Hispanic Center of Excellence in New York State at the medical school. In 2003 the department established the Bronx Center to Reduce and Eliminate Ethnic and Racial Health Disparities, the first National Institutes of Health Center of Excellence in a department of family medicine. After the Einstein Department of Epidemiology and Social Medicine was renamed the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health in 2004, the residency program was housed under the Department of Family and Social Medicine in 2005.

In the current business model, the pharmaceutical industry relies on the pricing and sales of its products to generate profits and to finance research and development of new drugs. This ability is dependent on the monopoly granted through patents. In the de-linkage model, other means (such as lump sums) would be used to reward companies for research and development in exchange for restricting the price charged for the product. This would allow the product to be sold at prices closer to production costs which would ensure better access, particularly for poor people and those who pay for their own treatment.  History  De-linkage was first promoted by civil society organizations as a better way of financing research and development than the patent-based system, alongside possible ways to implement financing flexibilities internationally. This was opposed by the industry as it was seen as an attack on the patent system on which the current business model depended. It was also questioned because it involved governments deciding how R&D; should be rewarded instead of the free market.. An early effort to implement delinkage of R&D; incentives from drug prices was the Medical Innovation Prize Fund legislation first introduced in the House of Representatives by Bernie Sanders in 2005, and subsequently revised and reintroduced several times. Several national governments support measures to move toward delinkage.  De-linkage and development of new antibiotics  Antibiotic resistance tests Until resistance has emerged against a previous generation of antibiotic, commercial return for any given new drug is uncertain. Therefore, the de-linkage model may be preferable in the context of developing new antibiotics and the fight against resistance where new antibiotics initially are unlikely to sell in large quantities because they should be reserved for use only when all other options have been exhausted. De-linkage also removes the incentive for the industry to boost sales that may encourage overuse that accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance.

(2016). The World Factbook: Zambia. Retrieved from https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world- factbook/geos/za.html on April 9, 2016. The mean age of mothers at birth is 19.3 years old, and the fertility rate is 5.72 children born per woman, which is the 7th highest in the world. The contraceptive rate is only 40.8%, and the birth rate is the 4th highest in the world at 42.13 births/1,000 population. Infectious disease is a key contributor to the poor health of the nation, and the risk is very high for diseases such as protozoal and bacterial diarrhea, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, malaria, dengue fever, schistosomiasis, and rabies. The adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS is 12.37%, which is the 7th highest in the world. Due to the poor health outcomes for mothers, and the challenges to access of care there is a significant impact on the culture of birth. Diversity in language and ethnicity plays a role in the diversity of care throughout Zambia. Establishing safety for the mother and baby through national health improvement, particularly concerning infectious disease and access to clean water, is a priority for Zambia.  Pregnancy behaviors and beliefs  Cultural beliefs during pregnancy, values and traditions can significantly affect individuals‚Äô attitudes towards modes of delivery, their definitions of different modes, and the decisions they make in this regard. In order to develop a positive cultural and religious attitude towards vaginal delivery, women‚Äôs awareness has to be raised through various ways and the existing misconceptions need to be corrected. While the woman is pregnant, extra precaution were taken as it is believed the women and her baby are in a physically and spiritually weaker state; this means they are more susceptible to sickness and evil forces. Preventative measures include changes in the women's nutrition. Certain foods are considered harmful to the fetus and should be avoided by the mother. For example, eating eggs while pregnant will cause the child to be born without hair. Eating fish could cause an infant abnormality. Postpartum care isn't widely accessible or accessed, but research has shown that access to antenatal care in preparation for the birth is associated with better postpartum care and contraceptive use. Use of postpartum birth control and family planning leads to better maternal health outcomes, including a reduction in the number of pregnancies, reduced transmission of STIs, and overall decreased risk for maternal mortality. Access to clean drinking water is a major concern in Zambia. 85.6% of the population in urban areas and 51.3% of the population in rural areas as access to improved water sources, and 14.4% of the urban population and 48.7% of the rural population has access to unimproved water sources. Access to sanitation facility access is unimproved in 44.4% of the urban population and 64.3% in the rural population. Women are not allowed to have sexual intercourse after the eighth month of pregnancy, this is believed to prevent the baby to have ‚Äúwhite stuff‚Äù (vernix) on their skin when they are born. Furthermore, extramarital relations are believed to bring harm to the baby. There are certain food women are allowed to and are not allowed to eat during pregnancy and labor, as they could have a lasting effect of the child's health. For example, women are not allowed to eat eggs. Labor Labor usually takes place in the home of the laboring women, should complications arise they are transferred to a maternity birthing center. However, due to geographic constraints sometime transportation is not an option, these geographic barriers contribute to the poor maternal health outcomes.Schmidt, C. (2013). Cultural Factors Exacerbating the Tragedy of Maternal Health in Zambia. 2013 NCUR. Labor is meant to be a private matter between the women and a few support people, the woman will often isolate herself from those not acting as support people during her laboring. Males are also not allowed to be a part of the laboring process. Laboring mothers often behave in ways that conform to societal expectations in terms how a laboring mother should act. For example, it is the belief that mothers should not should not be vocal during the delivery process as it could lead to complications for the baby. Women are encouraged by their mbusa to push whenever they experience pain. Mbusas will also utilize, pieces of clothing called a chitenge to assist women into different positions, in an attempt to alleviate some of their pain. Three to four women are allowed to be present during the labor and delivery process. These women are usually relatives or close friends such as: daughters, sisters, nieces, neighbors, and co-wives. Should a women tell more than a few close relatives and friends she is in labor it is believed that she will become bewitched and complications will occur during the labor process. Laboring and mothers giving birth preferred to have someone close by acting as a support person for them, however when naming the person they want to be there, a husband or male support person is usually not named. Mbusas operate under the assumption that less interference during the laboring process is better. However, at times they will employ a variety of strategies to accelerate the labor process. These include: providing fundal pressure, using a cooking stick to provide pressure in their mouth, and physically moving the mother. The gag reflex is used to help speed up either the labor process or the delivery of the placenta. Birth Only 5.4% of birth in Zambia are attended by a trained traditional birth attendant. Most laboring women will have a social support person present during the antepartum period, however if a women gives birth in a hospital, the support person will, most likely, not be present during the actual laboring process. These women are called ‚Äúmbusas‚Äù. Mbusas and those providing support during the laboring process have not received any formal education or training surround care of the laboring women. In most cases they do not have the skills needed to handle obstetrical emergencies. In those cases, they choose to accompany the laboring mothers to maternity units rather than delivering in the home. The major roles of mbusas during the laboring process is to provide emotional support to the mother. When mothers are brought into maternity centers, often do not have any direction making power. Many of the mbusas and those to bring the mothers to the maternity center are often only allowed in the room during visiting hours, however many women will choose to wait outside the unit. Should a mother be able to labor at home most of the power still belongs to them throughout the whole process. Furthermore, women who give birth in a medical center are subjected to more of the ‚Äúcoercive obstetric procedures‚Äù these include birthing positions that are convenient for the health care provider but not the laboring women. 53% of births occur in the home. The majority of the rest of the birth occur in maternity centers and hospitals. There seems to be a divide between those who gave birth in health care centers as opposed to those who gave at home. This is evidence by the fact that those who gave birth at home, do not receive as much postpartum as those who give birth in a healthcare setting. The women who choose to have a birth at home, states that they feel unwelcome at postpartum care clinics. Typically in labors occurring in the home mothers are free to choose a birthing position that is most comfortable to them: some of these positions include, sitting, kneeling, and squatting. Mbusa will help with positioning through the use of a chitenge, a fabric Zambian women use to tie around the waist. Those laboring in health care centers may not have as much freedom in positioning. Similar to the pain experienced during labor women giving birth are encouraged to push through the pain. Typically, no pharmacological pain relief is given to mothers birthing at home and mbusas will resort to using position changes as a way to relive some of the mother's pain. Once the placenta is delivered it is buried in a specific place near the house or village. It is done this way as to protect the mother and her baby from witchcraft. The placenta also plays a major role in the preservation of the women's fertility. One mbusa states: ‚ÄúThe placenta is buried, with the side where the baby lies facing the sky, and leaving the end of the cord showing, so that when the cord drops from the baby it should be connected with the cord buried with the placenta to protect the fertility.‚Äù. Some women cite the feelings of embarrassment dictating their personal behaviors. In a qualitative study one woman stated: ‚ÄúI would feel shy to have somebody next to me because we make a lot of noise and we are not covered.‚Äù. Furthermore, with the presence of a support person women feel that their behaviors must conform strictly with societal norms, as the support person could tell others if she did not. Should a complication arise women birthing at home do not have the resources of skills to be treated at home, women are transferred to the maternity center if they are able to get there logistically. Societal norms at times can view complications or an unhealthy mother and/or baby as the fault of the mother due to her behaviors during the pregnancy or labor. Obstetrical technology is not used in home births, this is one of the reason, home births with complications are transferred to a healthcare setting if possible. The use of technology within hospitals is also limited. For example, continuous fetal monitoring does not occur in most maternity centers. In hospitals the rate of episiotomies is not documented however it is estimated to be around 28%. Postpartum Once babies are born they are placed on a delivery mat until the mother delivers the placenta. The umbilical cord is then cut with a razor blade or sugar cane peel. Afterwards both the mother and the baby are bathed. Postpartum visits usually take place within the first 6 weeks after the birth of the child. Women who gave birth at home will then recover at home at well. There was no information about the average length of stay after a birth for women who birth in maternity centers.Samiya-Sumi, (2014). The Ultimate Guide to Postpartum Care: What to Do after Giving Birth  Postpartum Care on September 15, 2014. Pregnancy due dates and the start of labor are not announced as many are fearful this could evoke evil witchcraft. There are no significant differences noticed between women who have given birth before and those who have not, the labor process seems to be approached in the same way. One third of women who are married also use contraception. Furthermore, on average women begin to use contraception 8 month after their childbirth. After a child is born and while they are breastfeeding sexual activity is not allowed, as to protect the child. There is a large divide between those women who live in urban areas and those who live in rural areas in terms of postpartum care. Reports show that the rate of postpartum visits (up to 6 weeks after the birth of the baby) is 84% in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. As opposed to a rate of 42% of women from rural areas went to postpartum care. Newborn Care for the newborn is focused mainly on superstitious issues surrounding the umbilical cord. Women dress the umbilical cord with different mixtures such as ash, seashell with oil, or breastmilk and believe that the cord dropping on the male genitals will lead to infertility. It is also believed that a mother should not cook until the umbilical cord has fallen off, or the mother will get a mysterious disease. A baby born covered in vernix is considered to be dirty. Babies are traditionally left either unwrapped, or wrapped in piece of cloth immediately after birth. Skin-to-skin contact isn't always employed, unless the birth attendants have been trained to do so. These traditions may lead to hypothermia and delayed breast feeding. In hospitals and maternity centers specifically, the mothers were not encouraged to have skin to skin contact immediately following the birth of their child, nor were they encouraged to breastfeed. Due to the high maternal mortality rate of 224 deaths per 100,000 live births, many newborns are left without a mother and may therefore be orphaned and sent to an orphanage. Contributing to the high maternal mortality is access to care for mothers in need. Zambia has only 0.17 physicians and 2 hospital beds per 1,000. Poor maternal outcomes lead to poor newborn outcomes as well, particularly regarding the loss of a primary caregiver. The national rate of infant mortality is the 17th highest in the world at 64.72 per 1,000 live births. Access to clean water and sanitations is a considerable concern for the health and nutrition of the mother. If mom doesn't have proper nutrition and is breastfeeding, chances are the child will be malnourished as well. In Zambia, 14.9% of children under 5 are underweight. In Zambia, 8 out of 10 mothers breastfeeds exclusively for 6 months.Leach-Kemon, K. (2015). Visualizing Zambia‚Äôs success with breastfeeding. Humanosphere. Retrieved from http://www.humanosphere.org/science/2015/04/visualizing-zambias-success- breastfeeding/ on April 9, 2016. The exclusive rate for breastfeeding of children under 6 months is 61%, and early initiation (within the first hour) occurs in 57% of moms.Unicef. (2015). Unicef Zambia Fact Sheet: Nutrition. Unicef. Retrieved from http://www.unicef.org/zambia/5109_8461.html on 9 April 2016. The prevalence of adequate feeding practices in children aged 6‚Äì23 months is only 37%. Due to lack of access to clean water, breastfeeding is highly encouraged for Zambian mothers as formula requires a clean and safe water source that many don't have access to. Movement for baby friendly hospitals, ones that accommodate babies in the rooms with moms, promote breastfeeding, and provide lactation consultant services. Protection from HIV is another reason breastfeeding is encouraged, as exclusive breastfeeding builds the baby's immunity. Prior to the early 2000s, it was believed that HIV+ mothers should not breastfeed to avoid spreading HIV to their baby. When this was proven false and the National AIDS Council published a recommendation for HIV mothers to breastfeed their babies, breastfeeding rates began to rise again around 2007. An advocacy campaign was launched by the Zambian ministry of health in 2009 to promote improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rate. They have created a video is used to promote breastfeeding. However, as noted earlier, the access to media is limited in Zambia, so alternate methods of dissemination are required. The following graphic represents the increase in coverage of exclusive breastfeeding across Zambia over 5 year increments. Zambia is one of 22 African countries with the highest burden of undernutrition in children under five, and Micronutrient deficiencies are common in Zambian children, as vitamin A deficiencies are present in 54% of children under 5, and anemia in 53%. A child's nutritional status is influenced by access to food, care, and health, and poor feeding practices combined with illnesses such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS cause this high burden of undernutrition. Improving the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in mothers will help to improve the nutritional issues present in children and infants. Circumcision is generally perceived and suggested to be beneficial for reduction of STI and HIV transmission. Many religious and cultural groups have circumcision as a standard practice, but the medical circumcision movement has expanded as the understanding of the benefits has.

In September 2019 David was found to have breached Welsh Assembly standards of conduct after making remarks on Twitter. David re- tweeted a message by a constituent that the Welsh football team \\"has been hijacked\\" by the Welsh independence movement, and that \\"politics and sport should not be linked.\\" The constituent received an opposing reply from a Plaid Cymru member, to which David replied by calling the Plaid user an \\"utter knob\\" and a \\"coc oen\\". The Assembly‚Äôs standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans found the language was \\"abusive\\". David disagreed with the commissioner's categorisation, instead describing the remarks as \\"insulting\\". He further argued his response was affected by the \\"huge amount of abuse on Twitter\\" received by politicians. David chose to formally apologise for the incident, in the process avoiding a formal reprimand in the chamber. The issue came at the same time as similar disputes about the language used by fellow AM Leanne Wood which were aimed at a controversial Welsh blogger, words which Wood chose not to apologise for. The David and Wood incidents have raised wider questions about standards in the Assembly and how they manage social media communications by members.

Snyder is an American filmmaker and producer. Previously, she spent some time contributing to Variety. Snyder made her directorial debut with the 2000 documentary, I Remember Me, a biographical film chronicling her struggles with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). In 2016, Snyder won at the Crested Butte Film Festival ACTNow award for Newtown and was nominated at Sundance Film Festival in Grand Jury Prize-Documentary. She currently resides in New York City.  Background  Snyder received a bachelor's from George Washington University in 1983 and a master's in International Affairs from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in 1986. Upon completion of her masters, Snyder worked in international trade. She became involved in filmmaking as an international film consultant and U.S. Producer's Representative in Europe in the early 1990s. She is an advocate for the use of film as a medium to promote social change. As a co-founder of the BeCause Foundation, which aims to better the lives of children, Snyder produced three short films‚ÄîAlone No Love, One Bridge to the Next and Crossing Midnight‚Äîto raise awareness on issues of child sexual abuse, healthcare, homelessness and refugee integration. Previously, Snyder also served on the admissions committee for the Graduate Film Program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.  Early career  Snyder credits curiosity for her start in filmmaking. Following some time representing films in Eastern Europe, she broke the production side of the indie film industry. Snyder worked as an associate producer for the 1994 Oscar-winning short film Trevor, which tells the story of suicidal gay teenager. Trevor was later picked up by HBO, and Ellen DeGeneres hosted the airing. The directors of the film, Randy Stone and Peggy Rajski, realized the need for young people to have a safe way to discuss their feelings about sexuality, and thus in 1998 created the Trevor Lifeline (now the Trevor Project). The Trevor Lifeline became \\"the first national crisis intervention and suicide prevention lifeline for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth.\\" Trevor won the 1995 Academy Award for Best Action Live Short. In 2000, Snyder directed, produced, wrote and appeared in the film I Remember Me. The film became her biographical documentary debut, and explored the history of and controversy behind Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. = Shorts = In 2008, Snyder expanded on her philanthropic efforts by working with the non-profit BeCause Foundation to direct and produce the short films Alone No Love, One Bridge to the Next and Crossing Midnight. Alone No Love (2007) is a 27-minute film that addresses the issues Chicago doctors, state's attorneys, police officers and social workers face when working on cases involving sexually abuse children. With a portion of America's homeless out of sight and out of mind for some, Snyder took the initiative to create her short One Bridge to the Next (2008). Most of the film narrows in on Operation Safety Net, an organization that delivers healthcare to the homeless from bridge ways to alleyways. The last in the series of shorts Snyder directed and produced for the BeCause Foundation was Crossing Midnight (2009), which documents the struggles of Burmas refugees and those who come to their rescue. Snyder directed and produced the short film Duke Riley Goes to China, which premiered at the Palm Springs International ShortFest in 2015. The film chronicles the journey of Brooklyn artist Duke Riley, who embarks on recreating the race of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals.  Career  = Welcome to Shelbyville = Welcome to Shelbyville (2011), another project done in cooperation with the BeCause Foundation, was selected as Gucci-Tribeca Documentary Fund grant recipient. It aired on PBS' Independent Lens. Snyder's Welcome to Shelbyville documents the intersection of race and religion in America's Heartland. = Newtown = Showing the people and lives most affected by the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, Snyder's Newtown made its debut in the US Documentary Competition at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Filmed over three years, the film focuses on the devastated community of Newtown, Connecticut in the aftermath of tragedy. On the film, IndieWire blogger Katie Walsh wrote: \\"This film is an important historical record, and an important reminder of an event in American history that could have changed everything, that should have changed everything. There's no reason why it still can't. \\"Newtown\\" is a crucial reminder of that.\\" Jordan Raup of The Film Stage commented: \\"Each conversation, whether it be with families of those who lost children or the first responders at Sandy Hook Elementary School, is attuned to their internal grappling with the unfathomable loss.

Advocacy groups are generally classified according to two broad typologies: their core aims (group‚Äìcause typology), and their relationship to government (insider‚Äìoutsider typology). Classification by aims Early attempts to classify advocacy groups, first developed in the United Kingdom by J. D. Stewart in the 1950s, generally focused on who or what causes they represented. =Sectional groups= Sometimes referred to as \\"protectionist groups\\", \\"private interest groups\\" or simply \\"interest groups\\". Such groups are normally exclusive, as their membership is usually restricted to the section of society whose interests they represent: for example the British Medical Association (as those seeking to join the BMA must be medical practitioners or students training to enter the profession), or organisations such as the Law Society. However, the most common sectional groups worldwide are financial interest groups. This includes business groups (such as the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Nestl√© Corporation (Switzerland)), labour groups (such as NASUWT, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the Trades Union Congress (United Kingdom); IG Metall (Germany); and the AFL‚ÄìCIO (United States)), farm groups (such as the Irish Farmers' Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation), and professional groups (such as the American Bar Association). =Cause groups= Sometimes referred to as \\"promotional groups\\" or \\"public interest groups\\", these organisations campaign for a specific cause or objective, promoting approaches, issues or ideas that may not be of direct benefit to group members. They are invariably and explicitly non-partisan and represent a segment of society whose primary purpose is focused on promoting a particular cause or value. This therefore makes them more inclusive, as they generally try to establish wide popular support and do not implement as many restrictions on group membership. For example, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has become one of the largest and most visible UK cause groups, with over 1 million members (including 200,000 youth members), over 2,000 staff members and 13,000 volunteers nationwide. This category is wide-ranging, including civil liberties groups such as Liberty, Amnesty International, the League Against Cruel Sports, Countryside Alliance, the Institute for Public Policy Research and Policy Exchange. Charities such as Save the Children may fall under this category, as well as churches and religious organizations (e.g., Catholic Action in Italy), veterans' groups (e.g., the Union Fran√ßaise des Associations d'Anciens Combattants et Victimes de Guerre), and groups supporting the rights of people with disabilities (e.g., the Organizaci√≥n Nacional de Ciegos Espa√±oles (ONCE)), and some have even argued that organised religious groups such as the Roman Catholic Church would fall into this category. Cause groups are generally subdivided into three further categories: sectional cause groups, attitude cause groups and political cause groups: *Sectional cause groups ‚Äì aims to protect a specific section of society that is distinct from its own membership. For example, although the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) works on behalf of the rights of children, the majority of its members and supporters are adults; *Attitude cause groups ‚Äì aim to change people's attitude on a particular issue (often to the exclusion of others). Greenpeace, for example, seeks to change attitudes on the environment, although most cause groups have a broader remit; *Political cause groups ‚Äì aim to achieve certain political objectives, e.g. Charter 88, now Unlock Democracy, clearly has a political objective. The Chartists in the nineteenth century are also sometimes contemporarily classified as a political cause group. Many public interest groups operate in a single country (e.g., the Federal Association of Citizen-Action Groups for Environmental Protection in Germany). Others, such as the Sierra Club, may operate in only a few countries; however, many public interest groups have a much broader international presence, with activities in many countries (e.g., Amnesty International and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines). Classification by group status The issues surrounding the classification of advocacy groups according to their core aims has led writers such as Wyn Grant to divide groups according to the insider‚Äìoutsider typology, i.e. how close a particular advocacy group is to the government of the day, and to what extent it can develop secure and positive relationships with politicians and officials. =Insider groups= Insider groups are groups that enjoy close access to government agencies and officials. *Core insiders: Those with strong two-way relationships over a range of issues (e.g., CBI); *Specialist insiders: Those granted insider status but limited to a narrower area of expertise (e.g., the WWF); *Peripheral insiders: Those who are granted insider status but are barely ever consulted by the government due to the narrow nature of their cause (e.g. the Dogs Trust). =Outsider groups= Organisations outside the \\"political loop\\" are described as outsider groups. These fall under three subcategories: potential insiders, outsiders by necessity, and ideological outsiders. *Potential insiders ‚Äì groups that may achieve insider status in the future but are lacking in terms of support or experience. Charter 88 was considered a potential insider before 1997 (at which point the organisation became an insider group). *Outsiders by necessity ‚Äì groups forced to operate as outsiders and as a result are unlikely to have any realistic consultation with the government due to the nature of their cause or actions taken, e.g. Fathers4Justice. *Ideological outsiders ‚Äì groups that prefer to distance themselves from the government for ideological reasons. For example, Amnesty International avoids forging close relationships with governments in order to present itself as a neutral, objective organisation, and many alter-globalisation protests may not wish to become part of the government as they see it as part of the problem at hand. Issues with classifications There are issues with both types of classification. In attempting to distinguish between those who campaign for their own interests (sectional groups) and those who campaign for a political cause that is not directly in their own interests (cause groups), the group‚Äìcause typology ignores the scale or status of groups, and also ignores the fact that many advocacy groups do both; for example, teaching unions such as the NUT and NASUWT serve not only in their interests, but also campaign to raise awareness and promote reform and developments in governmental education policy. The insider‚Äìoutsider typology partially addresses the issues inherent in categorising advocacy groups by their aims, but ignores the fact that some groups may differ in being insiders or outsiders dependent on the government of the day, and does not mention the fact that many outsider groups can quickly become insider groups and vice versa (see: Overton window). For example, Charter 88 was clearly an outsider group prior to the 1997 general election, but assumed more influence following Labour's victory that year. Wyn Grant mentions that, in contrast, the National Farmers' Union insider status was threatened following control of Britain's agricultural policy by the European Union and a period of 13 years whereby the Labour Party was in opposition. Consequently, she says that it is more appropriate to divide insider groups into \\"high profile\\" insiders and \\"captive\\" or \\"prisoner\\" groups. \\"High profile\\" insider groups attract the attention of the media alongside working with government, \\"captive\\" or \\"insider\\" groups are reliant solely on the government for their survival because the government played a part in their creation ‚Äì e.g. the Equality and Human Rights Commission was established under the Equality Act 2006. Richard Heffernan argues that both organised and disorganised social movements, such as those campaigning for gender, racial and sexual equality or for the civil, political and social rights of those being discriminated against can be influential on sectional groups (such as trade unions, professional associations and trade organisations) as well as cause groups. Although social movements differ from pressure groups ‚Äì as they are generally not centrally organised and reflect broader societal shifts ‚Äì social movements can bring together elements of various pressure groups and political parties; for example, Green politics in the United Kingdom can bring together pressure groups such as Greenpeace and the Soil Association, alongside political parties such as the Green Party; the Green Party however denies that it is a single-issue political party, and has a manifesto including a wide range of non-ecologically related issues.

Early life  Alexander Black was born in New York City in 1859, the eldest child of Peter Black and Sarah MacCrae, both born in Scotland. After a grammar school education and teaching himself printmaking, became a reporter at the Brooklyn Eagle. In 1878 at the age 19 he toured Europe for three months keeping a detailed sketchbook.  Career  Black's career began as a newspaper man in Brooklyn and stenographer for Brooklyn courts, working at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle starting in 1870, editor of the Brooklyn Times (1885‚Äì1905), New York World (1905‚Äì1910), Frank Seaman, Inc. (1910‚Äì1913), Newspaper Feature Service (1913‚Äì1926), and as art editor for King Features Syndicate (1926‚Äì1935), alongside freelance writing and photography. During this time he also became the first president of the department of photography at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1886. His first book was published in 1886 titled Photography Indoors and Out, intended to be a manual for amateur photographers. On the lyceum circuit, Black presented a magic lantern show of candid photography called \\"Life through a Detective Camera\\" (alternately titled \\"Ourselves as Others See Us\\") in 1889. Inspired by audience responses to these lectures, as well as emerging work by Eadward Muybridge capturing the effect of motion in photography, Black began to develop a plan to bring fiction to life through dissolving slides. Over the summer of 1894, he wrote and photographed his first \\"Picture Play\\" titled Miss Jerry at Carbon Studio at 5 West 16th Street, New York. The finished work debuted before a live audience on October 9, 1894 at Carbon Studio, featuring a \\"slow movie\\" composed of over one hundred glass slide photographs of posed motion, accompanied by a feature-length script.  The Picture Play (See Miss Jerry)  > ‚ÄúPrimarily my purpose was to illustrate art with life‚Äù - Alexander Black Starring the actress Blanche Bayliss, the first Picture Play Miss Jerry told the story of a girl reporter in Brooklyn, with indoor scenes shot on a set created at Carbon Studios, and outdoor scenes on location in New York. > \\"While the motion picture was progressing with mincing steps in the peep > show Edison Kinetoscope the sheer force of the evolution of expression > presented the world with an interesting paradox ‚Äì the birth of the photoplay > upon the screen. . . Black arrived at a rate of four slides a minute for his > presentation...\\" - A Million and One Nights author Terry Ramsaye For the debut, Black read the scripted lines for all of the characters. Slides were dissolved using a double \\"magic\\" lantern, allowing the appearance of characters moving against a fixed background, at a rate of one approximately every 15 seconds. Miss Jerry was well received at the time, and Black went on to create and tour with two more Picture Plays, A Capital Courtship (1896) and The Girl and the Guardsman (1899). Partial collections of slides related to the original Picture Plays are stored at Princeton University and in private collections. No known intact set is known to have survived.  Later Career & Legacy  In the years following the Picture Play, Black went on to become a popular novelist, publishing several books into the 1930s, including adaptations of his three Picture Plays. He also continued to experiment with photography and film, creating several home made 16mm films featuring special effects and titles. Beginning in 1910, early film historians began to credit Black with his role in the development of motion picture. The significance of his work was not in the technical effect of motion, but in the presentation of a full length narrative on the screen, rather than a peep show, and in the development of what would later be known as a screenplay. In 2009, film historian Kaveh Askari and the Black family collaborated with the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California to preserve and archive several of Black‚Äôs original 16mm films, and screened them in November 2009. Existing collections of photographs, related papers, and films are now with Black Family in California, at the Pacific Film Archive, St Lawrence University, Princeton University, and the NY Public Archive.

She travels schools and colleges throughout the UK and the world, including Bangkok, The Hague, Shanghai, Kathmandu, Montreux and Taipei, delivering classes and conducting research with teenagers, teachers and parents on mental health, body image and social equality. Additionally, she is involved in campus wellbeing programmes in a number of British universities including Aberystwyth University and CU London, and is a trustee for student mental health charity Student Minds. Devon had a weekly column in the Times Educational Supplement for four years, between 2015 and 2019. She resigned suddenly in ‚Äòsolidarity with the trans community‚Äô in May 2019 after the magazine published a front page article recommending a resource to teachers Devon branded ‚Äòtransphobic‚Äô. Natasha currently has a monthly online column for the UK edition of Grazia Magazine. She has worked closely with a number of uk charities and organisations including Body Gossip and Mental Health First Aid England. She is a patron for No Panic, a charity which gives support to people living with anxiety. In August 2015, the Department for Education (DfE) appointed Devon as its first ever mental health champion for schools but axed the role in May 2016. Devon continues to give regular evidence to the Health and Education Select Committees and is involved in political campaigning. Campaigning Devon's personal experience of mental health issues began as a girl, when her panic attacks were misdiagnosed as asthma. Later, aged 17, she developed an eating disorder which she describes as 'a (very bad) coping strategy for anxiety'. She studied English at Aberystwyth University. She recovered from bulimia in 2006 and later co-founded the charity Body Gossip with former school friend Ruth Rogers. At the same time, she began visiting schools to deliver presentations and collect anecdotal evidence from pupils, teachers and parents. In 2010, she wrote an article about her experience of bulimia in the UK edition of Cosmopolitan magazine. After this, she was given a monthly column 'Natasha Devon Wants a Word', for the publication which ran until 2016. = Mental Health Media Charter = In 2017 Natasha launched the Mental Health Media Charter. This is a set of 7 simple guidelines for ensuring imagery and language used in mental health reporting is responsible, genuinely educational and stigma-reducing. The Charter was put together with the help of the Samaritans, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England and Beat. It has been endorsed by Girguiding, the Coalition for Men & Boys & the Labour Campaign for Mental Health. = Where's Your Head At = In May 2018 (for Mental Health Awareness Week) Devon launched Where‚Äôs Your Head At with Mental Health First Aid England and Bauer Media. The campaign calls for a change in the law so that provision for mental health first aid would be mandatory in all British workplaces. The change.org petition gained more than 200k signatures and was delivered by Natasha to Downing Street on 8 October 2018. It was debated in parliament in January 2019. Mental health champion for schools On 30 August 2015, the Department for Education (DfE) appointed Devon as its first ever mental health champion for schools,as part of a wider ¬£1.25bn drive to improve care. Announcing the decision, Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said: \\"Natasha is an inspiration to many young people and I'm delighted to have her on board as our first mental health champion. I know that together we can make a real difference in encouraging more young people to talk openly about mental health\\". Shortly afterwards, Devon wrote in The Daily Telegraph of her initial caution in accepting the role, adding: > \\"But then I thought ‚Äì Why have they picked me? Anyone who's ever watched me > on the news knows I'm notorious for being a left-leaning 'gob on a stick'. > Surely, if it was tokenism, they'd have selected someone less likely to > challenge them? When, during our first meeting the Minister told me that the > Government had realised the scale of the problem, they knew they had a > responsibility to do something about it and they wanted someone with real > experience within the field to advise them, I knew I'd made the right > decision\\". However, in May 2016 it was announced that Devon's role was to be axed.She was told that her position was discontinued for organisational purposes, to make way for a new interdepartmental role that would be salaried. The decision came days after she had criticised the government's testing regime in schools at the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference, where she had said: \\"Time and time again over recent years, young people ‚Äì and the people who teach them ‚Äì have spoken out about how a rigorous culture of testing and academic pressure is detrimental to their mental health. At one end of the scale we've got four- year-olds being tested, at the other end of the scale we've got teenagers leaving school and facing the prospect of leaving university with record amounts of debt. Anxiety is the fastest growing illness in under-21s. These things are not a coincidence.\\" The BBC reported that the DfE denied that Devon was being silenced because of her criticism, quoting the department as saying that an 'independent NHS task force report' published in February 2016 had 'recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created. For this reason we have had to reconsider the department's own role' and that Devon's position was being axed to avoid 'confusion'. Devon emphasised that while she had carried out her role unpaid to maintain her independence of the government, the new appointee would be salaried and could \\"be paid effectively to toe the party line\\". In September 2016, Devon obtained internal DfE emails using a Freedom of Information request. These indicated that despite the department's denials that she was sacked for making public criticisms of government policy, DfE officials were discussing her removal on these grounds months before her position was terminated. TV and radio In 2012, Devon was one of the mentors on the Channel 4 TV series Gok's Teens: The Naked Truth. She has also appeared on the BBC, Sky News and ITV as an expert on body image, and on the BBC's Newsnight programme.

An ESIC is able to attract early-stage investment capital from investors who are able to attract various taxation incentives, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of an ESIC to investors. Eligible investors include Australian tax residents and non-residents. A summary of the tax incentives states \\" The new tax incentives will provide eligible investors with: * a 20 per cent non refundable carry-forward tax offset on amounts invested in qualifying ESICs, with the offset capped at $200,000 per investor per year (on an affiliate-inclusive basis); and * a 10-year exemption on capital gains tax for investments held as shares in an ESIC for at least 12 months, provided that the shares held do not constitute more than a 30 per cent interest in the ESIC. The tax incentives are designed to promote this culture by connecting relevant early-stage companies with investors that have the requisite funds to assist entrepreneurs in developing successful innovative companies, particularly at the pre-commercialisation phase where a concept is in development, but the company requires additional investment to assist with commercialisation or further product development. To target the incentives to innovative activities, the early-stage company receiving the funding must satisfy two limbs: * The first limb determines that the company is early stage, against criteria related to expenditure, assessable income, stock exchange listing, date of incorporation or ABN (Australian Business Number) registration date. * The second limb determines that the company is involved in innovation, measured against criteria known as either a principles-based or objective test. Australia operates under a self-assessment tax system whereby the onus is placed on taxpayers not the Tax authorities (in Australia, known as The Tax Office). An appropriately skilled tax and investment expert in early-stage companies can assist in mitigating the risks of ensuring this targeted investment incentive ends up where the government intends it. As is the case with all aspects of Australia's tax laws, taxpayers can apply to the Australian Tax Office for a ruling/determination applicable to their specific circumstances. To pass the objective test a company must secure 100 points by meeting criteria, in whole or in part, including; the prior year research and development tax ratio, receipt of an 'Accelerating Commercialization Grant', completion or undertaking an eligible accelerator program, receipt of $50,000 or more in share investment by a 3rd party, registration of an innovation or standard patent or plant breeders right or license thereon, co-development and commercialization of an innovation with a listed higher education provider or registered research and development partner. For early-stage companies seeking to obtain an initial assessment of whether they qualify as an ESIC, a free predictor tools are available at ESIC Hub or ESIC Directory. The forms will take between 2‚Äì10 minutes to complete. As a new category of company and investment capital type a range of information and guidance for innovators and investors Tax incentives for early stage investors. The tests have been designed with stakeholder feedback in mind, to ensure they reflect industry concepts and remain flexible to new innovation.

Created in AD 106 by the Roman emperor Trajan after the final defeat of Decebalus' Dacian kingdom, it was originally a single province under the name Dacia, governed by a Legatus Augusti pro praetore. In 118, Hadrian reorganised the province, abandoning some territory in the east and relabelling the province Dacia Superior. At the same time he split Moesia Inferior, with the territory north of the Danube renamed as Dacia Inferior. In 123, Hadrian created a third Dacian province, Dacia Porolissensis, fashioning it out of territory from the northern portion of Dacia Superior. Antoninus Pius undertook the next reorganisation in 158. Dacia Superior was renamed Dacia Apulensis, Dacia Inferior was transformed into Dacia Malvensis, while Dacia Porolissensis remained as it was. During all these transformations, Dacia Superior/Dacia Apulensis was governed by a consular legate, while the other two provinces were under the command of praesidial procurators. Then in 166, the pressures building along the Danube frontier forced the new emperor Marcus Aurelius to reorganise the province once again. This time, he set up an overarching province which fused the three provinces into one, called Tres Daciae, commanded by a consular legate. However, the three provinces still remained as separate entities, each one governed by a praesidial procurator, who then reported to the proconsular governor. Apart from a brief period during the Marcomannic Wars when the province was temporarily split into three due to an emergency situation, Tres Daciae retained this structure until Aurelian abandoned the province in 271.

The flow sequence is from East Pond to North Pond to Great Pond to Long Pond to Messalonskee Lake and thence via Messalonskee Stream to the Kennebec River at Waterville. The lakes have long been an important resort area for fishing, boating, and swimming; and shoreline development includes residences for individuals employed in the cities of Waterville and Augusta. East Pond East Pond is the headwater pond of the Belgrade chain of lakes. The south end of the pond is in Oakland, and the north end of the pond in Smithfield overflows westward approximately through the village of Smithfield into the east side of North Pond. Algal blooms have been observed since the 1990s for about a week in June and again through the last month of summer. North Pond Weedy North Pond covers the boundary of Smithfield to the east, Mercer to the northwest, and Rome to the southwest. It is the shallowest lake of the chain. North Pond tributaries include Sucker Brook and Clark Brook joining the overflow from East Pond, and Leech Brook, Bog Brook and Pattee Brook flowing into the north end of the pond. There is a public boat launch area near the outlet of Bog Brook. The south end of North Pond overflows through Great Meadow Stream, which forms the eastern border of Rome and western border of Oakland and Belgrade for approximately before reaching the northwestern bay of Great Pond. Great Pond At , Great Pond is the largest of the Belgrade Lakes and forms the boundary between Rome to the north and Belgrade to the south. Tributaries Rome Trout Brook and Robbins Mill Stream enter the north end of Great Pond. Great Pond overflows westward approximately to the east side of Long Pond north of the narrows. Although Great Pond is more than twice as deep as the previous lakes in the chain, it similarly becomes uniformly warm through the summer and unsuitable for native trout or salmon. Long Pond The northern basin of Long Pond in Rome is of similar depth as Great Pond, but the basin forming the western boundary of Belgrade and eastern boundary of Mount Vernon south of the narrows is fifty percent deeper with cooler deep waters. There is a public boat launch area at the south end of the narrows. Tributaries Whittier Brook and Beaver Brook drain Whittier Pond, Beaver Pond, Watson Pond, Round Pond, Kidder Pond, and McIntire Pond into the northern basin of Long Pond. Stony Brook and Ingham Stream drain Moose Pond and Ingham Pond into the southern basin. The south end of Long Pond overflows through Belgrade Stream which reaches the south end of Messalonskee Lake after flowing eastward. Messalonskee Lake Messalonskee Lake is the deepest at , and second largest of the Belgrade Lakes with similar cold water habitat to the south basin of Long Pond. The north end of Messalonskee Lake overflows through Messalonskee Stream to the Kennebec River. Smaller ponds The McGrath Pond and Salmon Pond overflow into the east side of Great Pond. They have extensive shoreline development and are sometimes called the sixth and seventh Belgrade Lakes. Fishing The lakes provide suitable habitat for chain pickerel, white perch, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Early angling focused on brook trout from the tributary brooks and Atlantic salmon in the deeper lakes; but tributaries lack sufficient spawning and nursery habitat to replace angling success. Attempts to sustain the salmon population by stocking hatchery fish caused dramatic decline in the late 1970s of the population of rainbow smelt which had been the primary prey of native salmon. Stocking then introduced brown trout with greater tolerance for warm water lake conditions. Local interests seeking alternative angling opportunities illegally introduced northern pike and black crappie. Eutrofication from residential development of the shoreline has reduced Secchi disk depth to 4 meters, and dead algae has reduced oxygen levels in deep water.

History * Many newspapers have served the South Shore of Nova Scotia since Henry Fisher began The Nova Scotia Farmer in 1863. Only The Progress Enterprise in Lunenburg, founded by E.I. Nash in 1876, and The Bulletin in Bridgewater, founded by C.J. Cragg in 1888, survived. * Margaret and Ralph Hennigar purchased the newspapers and printing business in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lighthouse Publishing is one of the few remaining family-owned newspaper operations in Canada. Today, most newspapers are under group or chain ownership. * The Bulletin and the Progress Enterprise have a combined circulation of about 12,000. The Lighthouse Log is a 26,000 controlled- circulation advertising vehicle distributed free throughout Lunenburg and Queens Counties. * In 1995 the weekly papers were redesigned by editor Vernon Oickle and his staff, and changed format from broadsheet to 11 x 17-inch tabloid. Lighthouse Publishing gradually moved from the original hot lead makeup to cut-and-paste layout and design, and then to full pagination. Now it has gone digital and has moved from computer to plate, rather than from computer to negative to plate. * Lynn Hennigar became president and general manager of Lighthouse Publishing in 1995, replacing her father, Ralph Hennigar.

Motives for advocacy group action may be based on a shared political, religious, moral, health or commercial position. Groups use varied methods to try to achieve their aims including lobbying, media campaigns, publicity stunts, polls, research, and policy briefings. Some groups are supported or backed by powerful business or political interests and exert considerable influence on the political process, while others have few or no such resources. Letter-writing, petitions and marches Traditionally, the campaigns of pressure groups have included things such as letter-writing, petitions and marches. For example, in the mid-1980s, LIFE compiled a petition of more than 2,000,000 names opposed to abortion, organised a \\"Mail MPs a Mountain\\" campaign in 1987 and employed postcard campaigns in 1989 and 1990 against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Marches and demonstrations organised by the Anti-Poll Tax Federation in 1990 were said to have contributed to Margaret Thatcher's resignation as Prime Minister in November that year, and led to the subsequent replacement of the 1989 Community Charge (poll tax) with council tax in 1993. In February 2003, millions took to the streets as part of the Stop the War Coalition's efforts to persuade the government not to deploy US forces in Iraq. In countries such as the United States, petition-signing and letter-writing have been used to good effect at pride marches. These have been influential in the repeal of sodomy laws, support for civil unions and same-sex marriage, and on supporting anti-discrimination legislation. For example, in the 1998 Asbury Park pride march, the New Jersey Lesbian and Gay Coalition distributed postcards to Christine Todd Whitman and to two members of the state assembly asking them to oppose a state version of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force also distributed an \\"Update Call to Action\\", urging people to make telephone calls to state officials and write letters in support of education reform, revising state education policies and encouraging lawmakers to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected rights under the Pennsylvania Civil Rights Initiative. Following concerns over a proposed ban on hunting with dogs and lack of concern for rural issues, in 2002 the Countryside Alliance organised \\"the march for Liberty and Livelihood\\", which allegedly attracted over 400,000 people (including the Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith) and attracted supporters from New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and across Europe. Directly influencing the legislative process In most liberal democracies, advocacy groups tend to use the bureaucracy as the main channel of influence ‚Äì because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the legislature to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions ‚Äì groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; \\"the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests\\". This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to George Monbiot, the influence of big business has been strengthened by \\"the greater ease with which corporations can relocate production and investment in a global economy\\". This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government. Core insider groups have the ability to directly influence the formation of government policy at its primary sage through direct consultation with ministers, the civil service and government-appointed bodies working on these legislative proposals. Beyond these core insiders, specialist insider groups may also be called in to give specific information on a particular issue when it is necessary that their point of views or specialist interest is represented in discussions with ministers, the civil service or the government of the day. This consultation may involve informal discussions with relevant departments, or be more structured around a Green Paper Many larger groups employ lobbyists to pursue their legislative goals, and of those the richest groups maintain permanent Westminster offices. In the modern era, it has become more common for groups to employ lobbyists who will use their contacts on behalf of the pressure group in question in exchange for a fee; however, groups whose aims are local and limited in scale may be able to achieve their goals without needing to lobby, in contrast to broader-based groups. In the British cash-for-questions affair, which began when The Guardian newspaper alleged that London's most successful parliamentary lobbyist,Christian Wolmar, Greer's lobby empire crashes, The Independent, 20 December 1996 Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed. The controversy prompted John Major to instigate the Nolan Committee, to review the issue of standards in public life.First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1995). p. 14. Lobbying in the US and in the UK is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into corruption. In the United States the Internal Revenue Service makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy. Proposed solutions to the influence of lobbyists within the UK have been discussed by MPs and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Paul Flynn MP has suggested that a statuary register of lobbyists be available for viewing to the general public; Douglas Carswell MP says that transparence needs to be increased, with meetings of those with vested interests being made public, and Chandrashekhar Krishnan from Transparency International has said that lobbyists should have to wait longer before taking up jobs in the private sector, special cases such as defence being banned completely, in order to prevent the \\"revolving door\\" effect. Influencing political parties Advocacy groups can cultivate links with political parties in order to influence policy decisions. This is better done when the party is a party of opposition, as a party in government it will he hindered by time constraints, and policy formation is likely to be \\"top- down\\", not \\"bottom-up\\". However, when a party is in opposition, it will be more accepting towards a variety of ideas in order to broaden its support and formulate new policies. During Labour's time in opposition, groups such as Charter 88 and the Electoral Reform Society attempted to cultivate links with the party between 1979 and 1997. Another way groups can cultivate links with political parties is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, as the Conservative Party's campaigns are often funded by large corporations, it has been argued that many of its campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. In the United States, George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour ‚Äì when the British Labour Party was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers.GORDON MARSHALL. \\"pressure groups.\\" A Dictionary of Sociology. 1998. via Encyclopedia.com. (May 8, 2016). Embarking on legal action The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence, especially in states that have codified constitutions (such as the United States. For example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lobbied against the Topeka Board of Education in 1954 (Brown v. Board of Education), arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government. Although British courts do not have the same powers of judicial review as the US Supreme Court, litigation has been deemed a successful tactic for British pressure groups. Such action generally works on four levels: * Where a court finds that a government has acted ultra vires; * Where the rules in place violate EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights; * Where an Act of Parliament or action of a public official violates the Human Rights Act 1998; * Where litigation raises public awareness of an issue, irrespective of the outcome of the case. For example, the Pro-Life Alliance attempted to use the Human Rights Act to prevent the separation of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, where it became clear that Mary would die as a result of the procedure, in order to highlight loopholes in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Direct action campaigns Use of direct action is increasingly popular among pressure groups. The premise of direct group action stems from the concept that traditional methods of influencing government policy are flawed, and that more direct protests, acts of civil disobedience and (in more extreme cases) illegal acts and violence may offer the best opportunity of group success, as they captivate media attention. In the 1970s and 1980s, direct action was often used by gay liberation movements; for example, the Gay Activists Alliance in the United States often used \\"zaps\\" to gain their objectives.Faderman, Lillian and Stuart Timmons (2006).

Her leadership and generosity, directed toward promoting the education of women, led to Western Reserve University's College for Women being renamed in 1931 as the Flora Stone Mather College for Women. Early life Flora Amelia Stone was born on April 8, 1852, in Cleveland, Ohio. Her father was Amasa Stone and her mother was Julia Gleason Stone. Amasa Stone was a wealthy banker and builder of railroads and bridges. She had two siblings, a brother, Adelbert Barnes Stone (1844‚Äì1865), a geology student at Yale University, who died while swimming in the Connecticut River, and a sister, Clara Stone Hay (1849‚Äì1914). Flora Stone graduated from the Cleveland Academy in 1875. In spite of her family's privileged position and interest in assuring her brother's elite college education, she did not attend college. There was not a value placed on post-secondary education for the two Stone daughters. In 1881 Flora married Samuel Livingston Mather, a wealthy businessman with shipping and mining interests in the Great Lakes region. The couple had four children: Samuel Livingston (1882), Amasa Stone (1884), Constance (1889) and Philip Richard (1894). Philanthropy and social welfare advocacy Flora Stone Mather's philanthropy and devotion to civic causes were rooted in the experience of her family's strong Christian faith and their very active membership in the city's Old Stone Church. Notable Cleveland social welfare institutions that were beneficiaries of her financial gifts include two settlement houses, Goodrich House and Hiram House, the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, Consumers League of Ohio and the Cleveland Day Nursery and Kindergarten Association. Her engagement with these organizations often went well beyond financial support, involving her in direct service and advocacy for broader charitable investment in the work. Much of her philanthropy was directed to educational institutions like Adelbert College, Western Reserve University's College for Women, Hathaway Brown School and Lakeside Hospital School of Nursing, which was named in her honor. Her sister, Clara Stone Hay, was married to the wealthy statesman John Hay. Together, Flora and Clara continued their parents‚Äô tradition of civic generosity, earning their own recognition as prominent philanthropists. Legacy at Case Western Reserve University Flora Mather's most enduring philanthropic legacy is woven deeply into Case Western Reserve University's past and present. Her family was among the university's earliest benefactors. Amasa Stone, her father, was instrumental in moving Western Reserve College from Hudson, Ohio to Cleveland in 1882. In that year he made a substantial donation to the college and its undergraduate division was renamed 'Adelbert College' in honor of his son. Amasa Stone died the following year, but his support for the college was continued by his daughters and sons-in-law. =Flora Stone Mather College for Women= In 1892 Flora Mather donated generously to a fledgling effort to reestablish coeducation at Western Reserve College. The uproar over the college's controversial decision to end the admission of women led to the creation of a small separate women's division, initially known as the College for Women. Flora's sister and brother-in-law became the new college's first significant benefactors. Flora soon became a source of continuing support for the college. Her generosity and enthusiastic engagement in the life of the school was recognized as so crucial to reestablishing coeducation in the city's leading educational institution, that in 1931 the college was renamed in her honor as the Flora Stone Mather College for Women. Eventually, the women's college was fully integrated into the rapidly growing Western Reserve University. =Flora Stone Mather Quadrangle= The Flora Stone Mather Quadrangle, known to students as the Mather Quad, is the heart of Case Western Reserve University's campus. It is the location of the Kelvin Smith Library, Thwing Student Center, School of Law, Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, Weatherhead School of Management and many departments of the College of Arts and Sciences. Scattered around the campus are buildings funded by the Stone, Mather and Hay families, some still bearing the Mather name in dedication to Flora Stone Mather. The university's Amasa Stone Chapel was given in memory of their father by Flora Mather and Cora Hay. A portion of the campus has been designated as the Flora Stone Mather College Historic District. Flora Stone Mather died on January 19, 1909, at ‚ÄòShoreby‚Äô, the family's home on the Lake Erie shore in Bratenahl near downtown Cleveland. She is buried along with other family members in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

Born in Surabaya, as a teenager Herawaty toured Java with a number of stage troupes during the Japanese occupation and Indonesian National Revolution. In 1949, she made her feature film debut in Fred Young's Saputangan. After two years of collaborating with Young, appearing in a total of eight films for his Bintang Surabaja Film Corporation, Herawaty migrated to Djamaluddin Malik's Persari, where she soon became one of the company's most popular stars and appeared in such films as Rodrigo de Villa (1952) and Lewat Djam Malam (1955). When Persari was shut down, Herawaty returned to the theatre, spending most of the 1960s away from Indonesia's struggling film industry. She returned to screen in the 1970s, appearing in supporting roles in more than thirty films before her death. Early life Herawaty was born in Surabaya, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 4 April 1930. She graduated from the R.K. Zuster School before becoming active on stage at age thirteen, when she joined Irama Masa, a theatrical company established by the Japanese occupation government. Later in 1943, she married Darussalam, a fellow actor with the company who was ten years her senior. According to an interview with Kentjana, the couple fell in love while their troupe was on a boat returning from Makassar. By 1953 they had one child, a daughter named Rustiany. In 1945, following the surrender of Japan and the proclamation of Indonesian independence, Herawaty and her husband established the troupe Trimurti, based out of Gombong, Central Java. They toured Java and supported the Indonesians fighting against the returning Dutch colonial forces. This troupe had collapsed by 1947, and the two spent time with Djamaluddin Malik's troupe Bintang Timur and Fred Young's Bintang Surabaja. Bintang Surabaja and Persari Rd Mochtar and Herawaty in Rodrigo de Villa (1952) When Young established his own film company in 1949, also called Bintang Surabaja, Herawaty made the transition to film. Her first role was in Saputangan. This was followed by seven further films for the company, including Bintang Surabaja 1951 (1950), Djembatan Merah (1950), and Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! (1951). Herawaty's greatest success during the 1950s, however, was with Djamaluddin Malik's Persari. She joined the company shortly after it was established, appearing in early productions such as Sepandjang Malioboro (1951) and Surjani Mulia (1951), and was often cast along with Rd Mochtar. In 1952 Herawaty was part of a group of Persari actors and crew members who spent nearly two years in the Philippines to study filmmaking and produce two Ansco Colour films in collaboration with LVN Studio. In the first of these productions, the Indonesian-language edition of Rodrigo de Villa (1952), she was cast in the role of Jimena, the daughter of a treasonous courtier who falls in love with a loyal royalist. The second production, Leilani (also Tabu, 1953) saw Herawaty take the title role as a newlywed separated from her groom by a storm. Herawaty and her husband Darussalam, 1954 Upon returning to Indonesia in 1953, Herawaty continued acting for Persari, appearing in a further seven films for the company. This included the role of Norma, the fianc√©e of a returned guerrilla, in the Perfini‚ÄìPersari collaboration Lewat Djam Malam, which won a Citra Award for Best Film at the 1955 Indonesian Film Festival. By 1954 Herawaty was considered part of the Persari's \\"Big Four\\", together with Darussalam, fellow actress Titien Sumarni, and Mochtar. The following year she was named most popular Indonesian actress by the magazine Film Varia, though the film critic Salim Said suggests Malik influenced this decision; Sumarni, who had had a falling out with Persari, had won the popular vote. Later life and career In 1957, Malik was accused of corruption and placed under house arrest. The following year Persari was closed and much of its staff dispersed. Herawaty, rather than stay in the struggling film industry, returned to the theatre. With Darussalam, she established the Herawaty National Theatre in 1958, but over the next decade she acted with several troupes. Herawaty made only one film in the 1960s, Nenny (1968). In the 1970s Herawaty made another return to cinema, albeit mostly in supporting roles. She featured in more than thirty films between Djembatan Emas (1971) and Bintang Kejora (1986), including several films starring the dangdut singer Rhoma Irama. She and Darussalam were also active on television, with their show Senyum Jakarta (1972-1980); their fellow actors included Fifi Young and . In 1978 Herawaty received an award from the governor of Jakarta for her contributions to film, and in 1981 the (Persatuan Artis Film Indonesia, or PARFI) congress recognized her as their \\"Exemplary Actress\\". Herawaty died on 6 February 1989, aged 58. She was survived by Darussalam. Filmography In her thirty-seven-year acting career, Herawaty appeared in some fifty-five films. *Saputangan (1949) *Bintang Surabaja 1951 (1950) *Damarwulan (1950) *Djembatan Merah (1950) *Harumanis (1950) *Ratapan Ibu (1950) *Bakti Bahagia (1951) *Hidup Baru (1951) *Ditepi Bengawan Solo (1951) *Main-Main Djadi Sungguhan (1951) *Sepandjang Malioboro (1951) *Surjani Mulia (1951) *Pahlawan (1951) *Selamat Berdjuang, Masku!

The novel was shortlisted for the National Book Award for Fiction and later won the VCU First Novelist Award.  Background  Though Flournoy's father's family is originally from Detroit, she had not lived in the city, so did considerable research to be able to depict the different 20th century periods of life in Detroit depicted in the novel.  Plot  The novel tells the story of a Detroit family with 13 children as it responds to the economic woes of the city, in both the 1940s, and then in 2008. The house that sees the changes in the family, also becomes a character in the family's saga. Style Flournoy gives considerable tribute to Zora Neale Hurston as an inspiration for her work, and reviewers made comparison of the novel to works like Hurston's Mules and Men.  Reception  The novel received strong positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews wrote that \\"Flournoy‚Äôs writing is precise and sharp, and despite several loose ends [...] the novel draws readers to the Turner family almost magnetically.\\" The Nation reviewer Hannah K. Gold focused on how the novel successfully explores the dispossessed African American family, and praises the novel writing that it is \\"a story transformed by intragenerational retelling rather than passed down. It‚Äôs quick and dirty mythmaking.\\" Writing at The New York Times, Matthew Thomas called The Turner House a \\"assured and memorable novel.\\" Buzzfeed reported that The Turner House enjoyed strong sales in addition to positive critical reception: \\"According to Bookscan, which tracks around 70% of U.S. book sales, her book has sold over 15,000 copies in paperback and hardcover as of April [2016]; anything over 10,000 is generally considered high for literary fiction.\\" =Awards= * Finalist, 2015 National Book Award for Fiction * Winner, 2016 VCU Cabell First Novelist Award  References  External links * The Turner House at www.angelaflournoy.com Category:2015 American novels Category:Novels set in Detroit Category:2015 debut novels ","title":"The Turner House"},{"id":"50464412","text":"Stenoma eumenodora is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

He published in 1837 the first article referred to an ovariectomy performed in England and first described the picture of a kind of infantile spasm (present in his own son, James Edwin West) in an article published by The Lancet in 1841. this syndrome is typically characterized by three findings: epileptic spasms, psychomotor retardation and electroencephalogram with a characteristic layout of hypsarrhythmia, although one of the three may not appear.  Biography  There is little that is known about William James West, and the data about him, especially in the early years, are contradictory. Depending on the source his birth is dated in 1793 or 1794 in England, although it is unknown exactly the place. It is believed that he received medical training at Guy's Hospital in London, and it is known that he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons in February 1815. West married Mary Halsey Dashwood in June 1828 in the St Giles' Church, district of Camberwell, London. Although neither William nor Mary were originally from Kent, they lived in Tonbridge, a small town in that county. A year after his marriage his first daughter, Julia, was born. In 1834 or 1835 a son, William, was born. His third child, James Edwin, who was the object of the description of the syndrome that bears his name, was born on 13 February 1840. West was working quite successfully as a general practitioner and surgeon in Tonbridge. In 1837 West published in The Lancet a description of the first ovariectomy, describing how he removed an ovarian cyst with a size of about 20 pints (11.3 liters ). The patient recovered well, and the cyst was placed on display at the Museum of Guy's Hospital. His colleague and friend, John Gorham published later about several of the ovariotomies performed by West. In late January 1841 William wrote to The Lancet describing the case of his son James, who began to suffer a seizure disorder at four months of age. West's letter was published by The Lancet on 13 February 1841, James' first birthday. William James West died in 1848 at approximately 55 years of age, as recorded in the annals of Tonbridge, because of dropsy, an older term used to designate the ascites resulting from kidney or heart failure. His grave can still be visited in the cemetery of the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Tonbridge. Five years after the death of his father in 1853, James was transferred to the Earlwood Asylum for the Feeble-Minded in Redhill. James died on 27 September 1860, at the age of 20 and was buried in the same grave as his father.  Legacy  The name of William West is best known for the eponymous syndrome, even though the convention on the use of this name is relatively recent and dates back to 1960, when H. Gastaut organized the 9th Colloque de Marseille (Marseille Colloquium); which focused on infantile spasms. The methods of this meeting were published in the book L'enc√©phalopathie Myoclonique Infantile avec Hypsarythmie (infantile myoclonic encephalopathy with hypsarrhythmia) and was at that conference that H. Gastaut suggested the use of West syndrome as an eponym for infantile spasms; which is widely used for the syndrome to date. The truth is that most of the legacy of William and James West would have been lost forever if Mary West had not donated, some six months after the death of her husband, her private journal to William Newnham, a physician from Farnham. Newnham had found a similar case described by West two years before the publication of the case of James in The Lancet, so Mary's journal apparently aroused great interest in Newnham. A couple of years later Newnham wrote a monograph describing four cases, one of which was that of James West; Newnham's monograph quoted directly from Mary West's journal, and it is thanks to this work and the William West's letter to The Lancet; that is known a little about the private life and history of William and James West.

Biography  Born in Sarsfield, Ontario, Larose studied at the University of Ottawa, where he obtained his diplomas B.A. in 1910 and B.Ph. in 1912 and L.Ph. (Philosophy). He later studied at the Agricultural Institute of Oka (CAE), graduating in Agronomic Sciences in 1919. The same year he became employed in the service of the Ontario Department of Agriculture. Having established an office in Plantagenet, in the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, he started an inventory of agricultural lands. Discovering that the area around Bourget was a desert of abandoned sandy soil farmland and presented signs of erosion yielding to the advance of the \\"Bourget Desert\\", he suggested reforesting this \\"Bourget Desert\\" and launched a plan to sow a forest.prescott-russell.on.ca Ferdinand Larose had set up a small-scale reforestation experiment with seeds and planting trees in 1921-1923 (the Plantagent Demonstration Woodlot),.Ferdinand Larose, The South Nation and its environs, in: Conservation in Eastern Ontario, 1947, reprinted in: 12th South Nation Conservation Annual Bus Tour Package Thursday, June 25th, 2015 In 1926 he started a wasteland utilization campaign in Prescott and Russell counties.Ferdinand Larose, op.cit. In 1927 he became secretary of the newly founded Committee of Conservation and Reforestation of the united counties. In 1928 he obtained permission to work on a large-scale reforestation. For this, in 1928, the United Counties of Prescott and Russell acquired, on Larose's insistence, the territory of the future forest. This Prescot and Russel County forest, later called Larose Forest, became one of the largest man and hand planted forest in Canada. It covers an area of 110 square km in Clarence- Rockland, The Nation, Alfred and Plantagenet and Russell territories.Ggbooks, John Bacher, Two Billion Trees and Counting: The Legacy of Edmund Zavitz, publisher: Dundurn Natural heritage Ferdinand Larose was then nicknamed The Man Who Planted Trees, after the short novel by French nature writer Jean Giono. journalagricom.ca He continued stimulating the selling of abandoned farms by the united counties for further reforestation.J.

Since 1805, the Pirates of the South China Coast entered the most powerful period, many pirates were fully trained by the T√¢y S∆°n dynasty of Vietnam. They were called Ladrones by Richard Glasspoole. History Since the late 18th century, with the increase of the population, land annexation was becoming serious day by day. Many farmers lost their land, they became brigands or pirates. Giang B√¨nh was known as pirate hotbed at that time. In early times, most of Chinese pirates were fishmen. They came to Giang B√¨nh by boats to do business, though the private maritime trade was restricted by Chinese government. Giang B√¨nh located near China‚ÄìVietnam border; it belonged to Vietnam since L√Ω dynasty, later, it was ceded to China after the end of the Sino-French War, present-day it was known as Jiangping Town (Ê±üÂπ≥Èïá, in Dongxing, Fangchenggang, Guangxi, China). Giang B√¨nh was a melting pot of Vietnamese and Chinese, it was a strategically located; however, this area was neglected by Vietnamese government. T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion broke out in Southern Vietnam in 1771. The rebellion soon swept Nguy·ªÖn lords and Tr·ªãnh lords out of power. Many Chinese pirates were hired and joined the civil war. T·∫≠p ƒê√¨nh and L√Ω T√†i became generals of T√¢y S∆°n army. He Xiwen (H√† H·ªâ VƒÉn) became a general of Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, one of T√¢y S∆°n leaders, crowned the Quang Trung Emperor, and defeated the invading Chinese army in 1789. After the battle, Hu·ªá reconciled with China, however, he waited for an opportunity to take revenge on China. He provided money to Chinese pirates. Three prominent pirates, Chen Tianbao, Mo Guanfu and Zheng Qi, were ordered to hire more pirates. Since 1790, the number of Chinese pirates grew rapidly. Most of them pledged loyalty to T√¢y S∆°n dynasty, and were fully trained. Many pirates were granted official positions. They were able to block sea routes, and harassed the coastlines of South China (Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu) frequently. Later, they also took part in all important naval battle against Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh. In 1801, Nguy·ªÖn navy reached Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, a naval battle broke out in N·ªôn estuary (present-day Thu·∫≠n An estuary). Many Chinese pirates were hired by T√¢y S∆°n to fight against Nguy·ªÖn lord. Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau described that it was the fiercest battle in the history of Cochinchina. The battle ended with a near annihilation of both T√¢y S∆°n navy and Chinese pirates. Three important pirates, Mo Guanfu, Liang Wengeng and Fan Wencai, were captured by Nguy·ªÖn lord. Emperor C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh fled to ThƒÉng Long (present-day Hanoi), in there, he planned a counter-attack. Most of pirates did not supported T√¢y S∆°n dynasty, they fled back to China secretly. Chen Tianbao fled to Guangdong and surrendered to China. Zheng Qi still pledged loyalty to Emperor C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh. In 1802, he arrived at ThƒÉng Long. He was appointed as ƒê·∫°i T∆∞ M√£ (\\"Grand Marshal\\") by C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh. Zheng Qi get involved in the siege of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi, but his fleet was defeated in the mouth of Nh·∫≠t L·ªá River. T√¢y S∆°n dynasty was overthrown by Nguy·ªÖn dynasty. Unlike T√¢y S∆°n emperors, the new crowned Gia Long started to suppress the pirates. In September 1802, Nguy·ªÖn army destroyed the pirates' lair in Giang B√¨nh, captured Zheng Qi and had him executed. Lieutenant Turner and the crew of the ship Tay, made prisoners by the Ladrone Pirates After this incident, Chinese pirates had to flee to Guangdong. To compete for turf, they attacked each other. Finally, they found it would just destroy themselves. In 1805, seven pirate leaders made an agreement, a pirate alliance was founded. Seven leaders were: Zheng Yi (Red Flag Fleet), Guo Podai (Black Flag Fleet), Liang Bao (White Flag Fleet), Jin Guyang (Green Flag Fleet), Wu Shi'er (Blue Flag Fleet), Wu Zhiqing (Yellow Flag Fleet) and Zheng Laotong. Not long after, Zheng Laotong surrendered to Chinese government, actually there were six gangs joined the alliance. The Red Flag Fleet led by Zheng Yi was the strongest gang in the alliance, as a matter of course, he was selected the leader of the alliance. Ladrones Islands (present-day Wanshan Archipelago), Hong Kong and Leizhou Peninsula became pirate hotbeds. Zheng Yi died suddenly in Vietnam on 16 November 1807. His widow Ching Shih, became new leaders of Red Flag Fleet. Later, Ching Shih married with adoptive son Cheung Po Tsai, Cheung succeeded the leaders and leader of the alliance. It made Guo Podai resentful. Now Red Flag Fleet had 30,000 men and several hundred vessels, it became a big threat to Qing China and Portuguese Macau. In September 1809, Cheung was attacked by Portuguese Navy in the Tiger's Mouth. In November, Cheung was besieged by Chinese-Portuguese Navy in Chek Lap Kok. Cheung asked for Guo Podai's help, however, Guo refused. In a day of fog, Cheung fled from the battlefield. He was furious at Guo and vowed revenge on him. A navy battle between Red Flag Fleet and Chinese navy broke out in December, in the battle, Cheung was ambushed by Guo's Black Flag Fleet, and defeated. Several vessels of Cheung were captured by Guo. After the battle, Guo surrendered to Chinese government, Guo became an official of Chinese navy. Hearing the news, Cheung refused to surrender. However, more and more pirates surrendered. In January 1810, Cheung was persuaded to surrender. He delivered his fleet and weapons on 20 April. Cheung became a Chinese naval officer. On 24 May, Chinese-Vietnamese navy were dispatched to suppress the remnants of pirates. Cheung and Guo took part in the battle. The main part of pirate fleet was destroyed in the battle. It marked the end of Chinese pirates' era.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, she became the first woman to fly the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II aircraft in combat. The First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, recognized Dolan's transition from the military to civilian workforce as an example for others to follow. Dolan plans to join a small group of civilian pilots that fly the Harrier at air shows. Early life Dolan grew up near Saint Paul, Minnesota with three older siblings. Her father and oldest brother were both pilots in the U.S. Marine Corps which Dolan credits for sparking her interest in aviation. She was active in athletics including gymnastics, waterskiing, and snow skiing. Dolan attended the Convent of the Visitation School, an independent, all-girls, Roman Catholic, college-preparatory school in Mendota Heights, Minnesota. Military career Dolan attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland and graduated in 1996 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. As with her father and brother before her, Dolan chose the U.S. Marine Corps and was commissioned a second lieutenant. She attended The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia followed by flight training in the T-34C Turbo-Mentor at Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola in Florida. Dolan transitioned to jets, training in the T-2 Buckeye and the T-45 Goshawk at NAS Meridian near Meridian, Mississippi. She performed carrier qualification aboard the and earned her wings in September 1999. She transitioned to the AV-8B Harrier at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point near Havelock, North Carolina and was assigned to the \\"Tigers\\" of VMA-542. AV-8B Harrier of VMA-542 on the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD-5) in 2003 Dolan's first tour of duty took place from January to May during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She deployed with VMA-542 aboard the ‚Äîthe only woman in her squadron. Dolan became the first woman to fly the AV-8B Harrier in combat on the evening of March 19, 2003 in support of the shock and awe campaign that utilized overwhelming power and displays of force to quickly end the military effectiveness of Iraqi forces. She flew close air support missions destroying targets in designated kill boxes and protecting troops engaged with the enemy. Upon returning home, she was selected to attend the Weapons and Tactics Instructor (WTI) course at MCAS Yuma in Arizona. WTI is a prestigious seven-week course that trains marine aviators in advanced air-to- air and air-to-ground tactics in order to return them to their squadrons to train other pilots. Dolan's second tour occurred from May to November 2004 during the Iraq War. On this deployment, VMA-542 was stationed at Al Asad Airbase in the Al Anbar Governorate. She was assigned as the weapons and tactics instructor for the squadron and led combat missions in multiple battles including Operation Phantom Fury‚Äîthe Second Battle of Fallujah. Dolan returned home and served as the group's safety officer. She attended school with Training and Education Command in Quantico, Virginia but ultimately decided to leave active duty for the Marine Corps Reserve and a civilian position at General Electric. During her 12 years of active duty service, Dolan flew 121 combat missions in the AV-8B. Civilian career In 2009, Dolan joined General Electric where she participated in a leadership program that sent former junior military officers on rotation through GE businesses. She worked as a product development program manager at GE Aviation responsible for the production and sale of helicopter engines. In August 2012, Dolan was a host at a memorial dedication ceremony for Lieutenant Colonel Alfred A. Cunningham. Cunningham was the first Marine Corps aviator and the first Director of Marine Corps Aviation. The event was held at William L. Hammond Park in Marblehead, Massachusetts near the location where Cunningham learned to fly one hundred years prior at the Burgess Aviation Company. First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden created the Joining Forces initiative to support military families and demonstrate the unique capabilities veterans bring to the civilian workplace. In March 2013, Obama paid tribute to Dolan's successful transition from military to civilian life at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting. Dolan was interviewed for the 2015 book, Light It Up: The Marine Eye for Battle in the War for Iraq, where she described the attack and surveillance capabilities of the LITENING targeting pod that was used on the AV-8B Harrier. Dolan recounted her wartime experience using the pod to provide detailed imagery at high altitude, identify and designate targets using a built-in laser, and perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions using the pod to record video. An opportunity to fly the Harrier again came in 2014, when Dolan began training with Nalls Aviation, a company that operates a civilian-owned Sea Harrier in air shows in the eastern United States. According to owner, Art Nalls, she completed training in both the Czech Aero Vodochody L-39 Albatros jet trainer, the Sea Harrier, and plans to fly in the 2016 air show season. During the 2016 MCAS Cherry Point air show, Dolan took members of the media for rides in an L-39 Albatros. In 2017, Dolan was featured in AARP Studios \\"Badass Pilot\\" series. The nine-part series, hosted on YouTube, follows Art Nalls and his team as they perform at air shows. Episode 4 showed Dolan training with Nalls as she prepared for her first air show season flying the Sea Harrier. Dolan was promoted to colonel in the USMC Reserve in November 2018. Dolan expanded her management experience by working with control system projects for two years at GE Energy Connections before returning to military engine programs including the F414 turbofan that powers the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. , she remains active as a civilian pilot flying the L-39 Albatros and BD-5 microjet. Personal life Dolan is married to husband Matt with whom she has two children, Sean and Lara. , the family lives in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

He served as the Chief Minister (Menteri Besar) of Brunei from 1967 to 1972. Halim wrote the lyrics for Brunei's national anthem, \\"Allah Peliharakan Sultan,\\" in 1947. The song was adopted as the country's official national anthem in 1951, when it was still a British protectorate. Halim was longtime member of the Legislative Council of Brunei, serving on the council until his death in 2016. Early life Halim was born in Tutong, Brunei, on May 2, 1923. He began his education Bukit Bendera Malay School in Tutong, which he attend from age 10 until he reached fifth grade. In 1939, he became a trainee teacher, or student teacher, at Bukit Bendera Malay School, which is now known as Muda Hashim Secondary School, in Tutong. He then enrolled in courses to become a teacher at Sultan Idris Teachers College in Perak, British Malaya, beginning in 1939. Following the Japanese invasion of Malaya in 1941, Halim was transferred to Kita Bornei Kanri Yosei Jo in Kuching, Sarawak, to study the Japanese language. In 1944, Halim enrolled in advanced Japanese studies at the International School Kokusai Gakuyukai in Tokyo. Halim then studied at the Hiroshima University of Arts and Sciences, now known as present-day Hiroshima University, in April 1945, towards the end of World War II. On August 6, 1945, Halim, who was a student in at the university, survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Yura Halim was one of only three Southeast Asian students who survived the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The other two survivors were Abdul Razak, who later became a professor of Japanese in Malaysia, and Hasan Rahaya, an Indonesian politician. Career Yura Halim returned to Brunei following the end of World War II, where he worked as a teacher at Kuala Belait Malay School. He also studied public administration at South Devon Technical College in Devon, England, United Kingdom, in 1954. He was then appointed as an officer in the Information Office in 1957. In 1962, he was further appointed as the Deputy State Secretary and Director of Broadcasting and Information, a position he held from 1962 to 1964. Halim was elevated to the post of State Secretary of Brunei in 1964. He was appointed acting Chief Minister of Brunei in 1965 and was confirmed to the office as permanent Chief Minister in 1967. He held the office of Chief Minister, also known as Menteri Besar, from 1967 to 1972. He retired from the Bruneian civil service in 1973. In 1995, Yura Halim was appointed High Commissioner of Brunei to Malaysia by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. He was next appointed Ambassador to Japan in 2001. Halim, a resident of Sengkarai in Tutong District, died on April 11, 2016, at the age of 92. He was survived by eight children, 38 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren. Honours Yura Halim was awarded an honorary doctorate from Hiroshima University for promoting peace and bilateral relations between Brunei and Japan on April 22, 2013. He was the first Bruneian to receive such an honor. The only two other Southeast Asian survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hasan Rahaya of Indonesia and Abdul Razak of Malaysia, had previously been awarded honorary doctorates from Hiroshima University as well.

Benson was an Australian engineer and researcher who contributed to studies on piezoelectric crystals, television and sound systems, particularly loudspeakers. Achievements Benson was born in 1911 and educated at Sydney Technical High School and Sydney University, earning his Bachelors of Engineering in 1934. Shortly afterward he joined the Research Laboratories of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd. (AWA). He made contributions to many areas of electronics, starting with piezoelectric crystals. After earning a master's degree in 1945, he moved on to study color television and loudspeakers in the late 1940s and 1950s. On 3 November 1948, the first Australian-produced television set was unveiled at the IRE Radio Convention. The team who created the set were Benson, H.J. Oyston and B.R Johnson, who were present at the unveiling. He designed a novel electrically tapered column loudspeaker system for the Sydney Town Hall to successfully solve some acoustic problems with the space. This design lent credibility to the team at AWA and they won a contract to design the sound reinforcement system for the new Sydney Opera House in 1960. The design once again used column loudspeakers and it won a Duke of Edinburgh prize for industrial design for both Benson and AWA in 1972. Benson was editor of the AWA Technical Review journal from 1948 until 1975, when he retired. A series of papers published in Australian journals (including the AWA Technical Review) from 1968‚Äì1972 put a firm technical foundation on the electroacoustics of the era, clearly creating a single mathematical loudspeaker enclosure model that could be used to describe sealed, vented, and passive radiator enclosures, and similar types with various sorts of damping elements. Benson was the examiner for the 1972 PhD Thesis of Richard H. Small, of Thiele/Small parameters. AWA Technical Review was also the original publisher for A. Neville Thiele's 1961 papers on vented box loudspeakers. Thiele's papers were not well known until reprinted in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society (JAES) in 1971. Richard Small also published in the JAES in the early 1970s. Benson died in 1989 at age 78. An obituary tribute was written about him by fellow Australian loudspeaker researcher Neville Thiele in the JAES. In 1996, Prompt Publications published Benson's 1968‚Äì1972 three part paper series on loudspeaker cabinet design, with an introduction by Don and Carolyn Davis, as: \\"Theory and Design of Loudspeaker Enclosures\\" Don and Carolyn are founders of the well-known Synergistic Audio Concepts, or SynAudCon.

Background  The five protesters ‚Äì Ike Pinkston, 42, Sellassie Blackwell, 39, Edwin Lindo, 29, Maria Gutierrez, 66, and her son Ilyich \\"Equipto\\" Sato, 42 ‚Äì called for the resignation of SFPD chief Greg Suhr over a series of recent shootings of men of color. The protesters were a mix of musicians, educators, and a politician: Pinkston, Sellassie, and Equito are hip hop artists, Gutierrez is director of Los Compa√±eros del Barrio Preschool, and Lindo is a candidate for Supervisor in District 9. In February 2016, the San Francisco Police Department had voluntarily requested a United States Department of Justice begin a Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) review in an effort to reform the department, but it was not a civil rights review like that being undertaken in Ferguson, Missouri. Mayor Lee and the San Francisco Police Commission proposed changes in use of force policies on February 22, 2016. The San Francisco Police Officers Association, SFPD's union, refused to comply with the proposed policy and issued its own proposed use of force policy on April 6, 2016. The San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi sent California Attorney General Kamala Harris a request that supported the protestor's claims of racism by the San Francisco Police Department, and requested a civil rights investigation that would be enforceable. After Gongora's death, Adachi was joined by District Attorney George Gascon, Mission District Supervisor David Campos, and other stakeholders to protest the lack of transparency and need for police reform. In April 2016, the protest was further fueled by additional revelations of racist and homophobic text messages exchanged among SFPD officers, one year after the first discovery of racist texts resulted in the firing of eight officers as part of a federal corruption probe. Suhr said he would not resign over the racist text scandal and received support from Mayor Ed Lee. Mayor Lee spoke with the Frisco Five, telling them he respected their right to protest but that he would not agree to their demand that he fire Suhr. As the five protesters were hospitalized on the 16th day of the hunger strike, the Frisco Five supporters were joined by an additional group of supporters at San Francisco City Hall, resulting in clashes with the police and 33 people arrested. On May 7, 2016, the Frisco Five called off their hunger strike and called for a general strike in San Francisco on May 9, 2016.

The first compasses were made of lodestone, a naturally magnetized stone of iron, in Han dynasty China (20 BC ‚Äì 20 AD). The compass was later used for navigation during the Chinese Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD), as described by Shen Kuo. Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Magnetized needles and compasses were first described in medieval Europe by the English theologian Alexander Neckam (1157‚Äì1217 AD). Dry compasses begin appearing around 1300 in Medieval Europe and the Medieval Islamic world. This was replaced in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.  Navigation prior to the compass  Prior to the introduction of the compass, geographical position and direction at sea were primarily determined by the sighting of landmarks, supplemented with the observation of the position of celestial bodies. Other techniques included sampling mud from the seafloor (China), analyzing the flight path of birds, and observing wind, sea debris, and sea state (Polynesia and elsewhere). Objects that have been understood as having been used for navigation by measuring the angles between celestial objects, were discovered in the Indus Valley site of Lothal.http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/handle/2264/3082/J_Mar_Archaeol_3_61.pdf?sequence=2 The Norse are believed to have used a type of sun compass to locate true north. On cloudy days, the Vikings may have used cordierite or some other birefringent crystal to determine the sun's direction and elevation from the polarization of daylight; their astronomical knowledge was sufficient to let them use this information to determine their proper heading. The invention of the compass made it possible to determine a heading when the sky was overcast or foggy, and when landmarks were not in sight. This enabled mariners to navigate safely far from land, increasing sea trade, and contributing to the Age of Discovery.  Geomancy and Feng Shui  Chinese geomantic compass c. 1760 from the National Maritime Museum in London The compass was invented in China during the Han Dynasty between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD where it was called the \\"south-governor\\" (sƒ´n√°n ). The magnetic compass was not, at first, used for navigation, but for geomancy and fortune-telling by the Chinese. The earliest Chinese magnetic compasses were possibly used to order and harmonize buildings in accordance with the geomantic principles of feng shui. These early compasses were made with lodestone, a form of the mineral magnetite that is a naturally occurring magnet and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field. People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles. Early compasses were used to choose areas suitable for building houses, growing crops, and to search for rare gems. Compasses were later adapted for navigation during the Song Dynasty in the 11th century. Based on Krotser and Coe's discovery of an Olmec hematite artifact in Mesoamerica, radiocarbon dated to 1400‚Äì1000 BC, astronomer John Carlson has hypothesized that the Olmec might have used the geomagnetic lodestone earlier than 1000 BC for geomancy, a method of divination, which if proven true, predates the Chinese use of magnetism for feng shui by a millennium.John B. Carlson, \\"Lodestone Compass: Chinese or Olmec Primacy? Multidisciplinary Analysis of an Olmec Hematite Artifact from San Lorenzo, Veracruz, Mexico\\", Science, New Series, Vol. 189, No. 4205 (5 September 1975), pp. 753-760 (1975) Carlson speculates that the Olmecs used similar artifacts as a directional device for astronomical or geomantic purposes but does not suggest navigational usage. The artifact is part of a polished hematite bar with a groove at one end, possibly used for sighting. Carlson's claims have been disputed by other scientific researchers, who have suggested that the artifact is actually a constituent piece of a decorative ornament and not a purposely built compass. Several other hematite or magnetite artifacts have been found at pre-Columbian archaeological sites in Mexico and Guatemala.  Early navigational compass  A number of early cultures used lodestone so they could turn, as magnetic compasses for navigation. Early mechanical compasses are referenced in written records of the Chinese, who began using it for navigation sometime between the 9th and 11th century, \\"some time before 1050, possibly as early as 850.\\" At present, according to Kreutz, scholarly consensus is that the Chinese invention used in navigation pre-dates the first European mention of a compass by 150 years.Kreutz, p. 367 The first recorded appearance of the use of the compass in Europe (1190) is earlier than in the Muslim world (1232),Kreutz, p. 370Kreutz, p. 369 as a description of a magnetized needle and its use among sailors occurs in Alexander Neckam's De naturis rerum (On the Natures of Things), written in 1190.Kreutz, p. 368 However, there are questions over diffusion. Some historians suggest that the Arabs introduced the compass from China to Europe. Some suggested the compass was transmitted from China to Europe and the Islamic world via the Indian Ocean, or was brought by the crusaders to Europe from China.Derek J. de Solla Price, On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass However, some scholars proposed an independent European invention of the compass.Enclyopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, \\"Compass\\" entry, Helaine Selin, 1997, Springer- Science+Business Media. page 233 = China = Model of a Han Dynasty (206 BC‚Äì220 AD) south-indicating ladle or sinan. It is theorized that the south- pointing spoons of the Han dynasty were magnetized lodestones. There is disagreement as to exactly when the compass was invented. These are noteworthy Chinese literary references in evidence for its antiquity: * The magnetic compass was first invented as a device for divination as early as the Chinese Han Dynasty and Tang Dynasty (since about 206 BC).Li Shu-hua, p. 176 The compass was used in Song Dynasty China by the military for navigational orienteering by 1040‚Äì44,Needham, p. 252Li Shu-hua, p. 182f. and was used for maritime navigation by 1111 to 1117. * The earliest Chinese literature reference to magnetism lies in the 4th century BC writings of Wang Xu (È¨ºË∞∑Â≠ê): \\"The lodestone attracts iron.\\" The book also notes that the people of the state of Zheng always knew their position by means of a \\"south-pointer\\"; some authors suggest that this refers to early use of the compass.Needham p. 190 * The first mention of a spoon, speculated to be a lodestone, observed pointing in a cardinal direction is a Chinese work composed between 70 and 80 AD (Lunheng), which records that \\"But when the south pointing spoon is thrown upon the ground, it comes to rest pointing at the south.\\"Needham p. 18 Within the text, the author Wang Chong describes the spoon as a phenomenon that he has personally observed.Needham p. 18 \\"here the author is contrasting a fable which he did not believe with actual events he has seen with his own eyes\\" Although the passage does not explicitly mention magnetism,Li Shu-hua, p. 180 according to Chen-Cheng Yih, the \\"device described by Wang Chong has been widely considered to be the earliest form of the magnetic compass.\\" * The first clear account of magnetic declination occurs in the Kuan Shih Ti Li Chih Meng (\\"Mr. Kuan's Geomantic Instructor\\"), dating to 880. Another text, the Chiu Thien Hsuan Nu Chhing Nang Hai Chio Ching (\\"Blue Bag Sea Angle Manual\\") from around the same period, also has an implicit description of magnetic declination. It has been argued that this knowledge of declination requires the use of the compass. * A reference to a magnetized needle as a \\"mysterious needle\\" appears in 923‚Äì926 in the Chung Hua Ku Chin Chu text written by Ma Kao. The same passage is also attributed to the 4th-century AD writer Tshui Pao, although it is postulated that the former text is more authentic. The shape of the needle is compared to that of a tadpole, and may indicate the transition between \\"lodestone spoons\\" and \\"iron needles.\\"Needham p. 273-274 * The earliest reference to a specific magnetic direction finder device for land navigation is recorded in a Song Dynasty book dated to 1040‚Äì44. There is a description of an iron \\"south-pointing fish\\" floating in a bowl of water, aligning itself to the south. The device is recommended as a means of orientation \\"in the obscurity of the night.\\" The Wujing Zongyao (Ê≠¶Á∂ìÁ∏ΩË¶Å, \\"Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques\\") stated: \\"When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished...they made use of the [mechanical] south-pointing carriage, or the south-pointing fish.\\" This was achieved by heating of metal (especially if steel), known today as thermoremanence, and would have been capable of producing a weak state of magnetization. While the Chinese achieved magnetic remanence and induction by this time, in both Europe and Asia the phenomenon was attributed to the supernatural and occult, until about 1600 when William Gilbert published his De Magnete. * The first incontestable reference to a magnetized needle in Chinese literature appears in 1088. The Dream Pool Essays, written by the Song Dynasty polymath scientist Shen Kuo, contained a detailed description of how geomancers magnetized a needle by rubbing its tip with lodestone, and hung the magnetic needle with one single strain of silk with a bit of wax attached to the center of the needle. Shen Kuo pointed out that a needle prepared this way sometimes pointed south, sometimes north. * The earliest explicit recorded use of a magnetic compass for maritime navigation is found in Zhu Yu's book Pingchow Table Talks (ËêçÊ¥≤ÂèØË´á; Pingzhou Ketan) and dates from 1111 to 1117: The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars , and in the daytime by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south pointing needle. Diagram of a Ming Dynasty mariner's compass Thus, the use of a magnetic compass by the military for land navigation occurred sometime before 1044, but incontestable evidence for the use of the compass as a maritime navigational device did not appear until 1117. The typical Chinese navigational compass was in the form of a magnetic needle floating in a bowl of water.Kreutz, p. 373 According to Needham, the Chinese in the Song Dynasty and continuing Yuan Dynasty did make use of a dry compass, although this type never became as widely used in China as the wet compass.Needham p. 255 Evidence of this is found in the Shilin guangji (\\"Guide Through the Forest of Affairs\\"), published in 1325 by Chen Yuanjing, although its compilation had taken place between 1100 and 1250. The dry compass in China was a dry suspension compass, a wooden frame crafted in the shape of a turtle hung upside down by a board, with the lodestone sealed in by wax, and if rotated, the needle at the tail would always point in the northern cardinal direction. Although the European compass-card in box frame and dry pivot needle was adopted in China after its use was taken by Japanese pirates in the 16th century (who had in turn learned of it from Europeans),Needham, p. 289. the Chinese design of the suspended dry compass persisted in use well into the 18th century.Needham, p. 290 However, according to Kreutz there is only a single Chinese reference to a dry-mounted needle (built into a pivoted wooden tortoise) which is dated to between 1150 and 1250, and claims that there is no clear indication that Chinese mariners ever used anything but the floating needle in a bowl until the 16th century. The first recorded use of a 48 position mariner's compass on sea navigation was noted in The Customs of Cambodia by Yuan Dynasty diplomat Zhou Daguan, he described his 1296 voyage from Wenzhou to Angkor Thom in detail; when his ship set sail from Wenzhou, the mariner took a needle direction of ‚Äúding wei‚Äù position, which is equivalent to 22.5 degree SW. After they arrived at Baria, the mariner took \\"Kun Shen needle\\", or 52.5 degree SW.Zhou Zheng He's Navigation Map, also known as the \\"Mao Kun Map\\", contains a large amount of detail \\"needle records\\" of Zheng He's expeditions.Ma, Appendix 2 = Medieval Europe = A drawing of a compass in a mid 14th-century copy of Epistola de magnete of Peter Peregrinus.MS. Ashmole 1522, fol. 186r, Bodleian Library. Alexander Neckam reported the use of a magnetic compass for the region of the English Channel in the texts De utensilibus and De naturis rerum, http://www.uib.no/jais/v001ht/01-081-132schmidl1.htm#_ftn4 written between 1187 and 1202, after he returned to England from France and prior to entering the Augustinian abbey at Cirencester. In his 1863 edition of Neckam's De naturis rerum, Thomas Wright provides a translation of the passage in which Neckam mentions sailors being guided by a compass' needle: > The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy whether > they can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is > wrapped up in the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to > what point of the compass their ship's course is directed, they touch the > magnet with a needle, which (the needle) is whirled round in a circle until, > when its motion ceases, its point looks direct to the north.T. Wright, (ed.) > 'Preface', Alexandri Neckam De naturis rerum libri duo with the poem of the > same author, De laudibus divinae sapientiae, (London, 1863), xxxiv. > https://archive.org/details/alexandrineckam00neckgoog Neckam's clear understanding of the mariner's compass in the late twelfth- century, and his description of its use in marine navigation, has cast doubt on whether the compass was, as Professor Derk Bodde has argued, one of 'China's gifts to the West'.Professor Derk Bodde of Columbia University seems to maintain that whilst the mariner's compass was known to twelfth-century Europe, its application to navigation was not mentioned until the fifteenth century. This is easily dismissed by a wider reading of the period. http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_gifts.htm#compass From Neckam's description, some scholars have suggested it is not unlikely that the compass was also 'invented' in Europe, independently of Eastern technologies.T. Wright, (ed.) 'Preface', Alexandri Neckam De naturis rerum libri duo with the poem of the same author, De laudibus divinae sapientiae, (London, 1863),xxxv This is further supported by Jacques de Vitry's mention of the compass being used at sea in 1218, which indicates a broader knowledge of the compass and its uses in Medieval Northern Europe: > An iron needle, after having been in contact with the loadstone, turns > itself always toward the northern star, which, like the axis of the > firmament, remains immoveable, while the others follow their course, so that > it is very necessary to those who navigate the sea. Robert Southey suggested that the Siete Partidas contained a reference from the 1250s to the needle being used for navigation. In 1269 Petrus Peregrinus of Maricourt described a floating compass for astronomical purposes as well as a dry compass for seafaring, in his well-known Epistola de magnete. In the Mediterranean, the introduction of the compass, at first only known as a magnetized pointer floating in a bowl of water,Kreutz, p. 368‚Äì369 went hand in hand with improvements in dead reckoning methods, and the development of Portolan charts, leading to more navigation during winter months in the second half of the 13th century.Lane, p. 606f. While the practice from ancient times had been to curtail sea travel between October and April, due in part to the lack of dependable clear skies during the Mediterranean winter, the prolongation of the sailing season resulted in a gradual, but sustained increase in shipping movement; by around 1290 the sailing season could start in late January or February, and end in December.Lane, p. 608 The additional few months were of considerable economic importance. For instance, it enabled Venetian convoys to make two round trips a year to the Levant, instead of one.Lane, p. 608 & 610 At the same time, traffic between the Mediterranean and northern Europe also increased, with first evidence of direct commercial voyages from the Mediterranean into the English Channel coming in the closing decades of the 13th century, and one factor may be that the compass made traversal of the Bay of Biscay safer and easier.Lane, p. 608 & 613 However, critics like Kreutz have suggested that it was later in 1410 that anyone really started steering by compass.Kreutz, p. 372‚Äì373 = Muslim world = Al- Ashraf's diagram of the compass and Qibla. From MS Cairo TR 105, copied in Yemen, 1293. The earliest reference to a compass in the Muslim world occurs in a Persian talebook from 1232,JawƒÅme ø al-·∏•ekƒÅyƒÅt wa-lawƒÅme ø al-rewƒÅyƒÅt by Muhammad al- øAwfƒ´ where a compass is used for navigation during a trip in the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. The fish-shaped iron leaf described indicates that this early Chinese design has spread outside of China.Needham p. 12-13 \\"...that the floating fish-shaped iron leaf spread outside China as a technique, we know from the description of Muhammad al' Awfi just two hundred years later\\" The earliest Arabic reference to a compass, in the form of magnetic needle in a bowl of water, comes from a work by Baylak al-QibjƒÅqƒ´, written in 1282 while in Cairo.KitƒÅb Kanz al-tujjƒÅr fƒ´ ma ørifat al-a·∏•jƒÅr Al- QibjƒÅqƒ´ described a needle-and-bowl compass used for navigation on a voyage he took from Syria to Alexandria in 1242. Since the author describes having witnessed the use of a compass on a ship trip some forty years earlier, some scholars are inclined to antedate its first appearance in the Arab world accordingly. Al-QibjƒÅqƒ´ also reports that sailors in the Indian Ocean used iron fish instead of needles. Late in the 13th century, the Yemeni Sultan and astronomer al-Malik al-Ashraf described the use of the compass as a \\"Qibla indicator\\" to find the direction to Mecca. In a treatise about astrolabes and sundials, al-Ashraf includes several paragraphs on the construction of a compass bowl (·π≠ƒÅsa). He then uses the compass to determine the north point, the meridian (kha·π≠·π≠ ni·π£f al-nahƒÅr), and the Qibla. This is the first mention of a compass in a medieval Islamic scientific text and its earliest known use as a Qibla indicator, although al-Ashraf did not claim to be the first to use it for this purpose. (PDF version) In 1300, an Arabic treatise written by the Egyptian astronomer and muezzin Ibn Sim ø≈´n describes a dry compass used for determining qibla. Like Peregrinus' compass, however, Ibn Sim ø≈´n's compass did not feature a compass card. In the 14th century, the Syrian astronomer and timekeeper Ibn al-Shatir (1304‚Äì1375) invented a timekeeping device incorporating both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of prayers. Arab navigators also introduced the 32-point compass rose during this time. In 1399, an Egyptian reports two different kinds of magnetic compass. One instrument is a ‚Äúfish‚Äù made of willow wood or pumpkin, into which a magnetic needle is inserted and sealed with tar or wax to prevent the penetration of water. The other instrument is a dry compass. Navigational sailor's compass rose, 1607 In the 15th century, the description given by Ibn Majid while aligning the compass with the pole star indicates that he was aware of magnetic declination. An explicit value for the declination is given by  øIzz al-Dƒ´n al-WafƒÅ æƒ´ (fl. 1450s in Cairo). Pre modern Arabic sources refer to the compass using the term ·π≠ƒÅsa (lit. \\"bowl\\") for the floating compass, or ƒÅlat al-qiblah (\\"qibla instrument\\") for a device used for orienting towards Mecca. Friedrich Hirth suggested that Arab and Persian traders, who learned about the polarity of the magnetic needle from the Chinese, applied the compass for navigation before the Chinese did. However, Needham described this theory as \\"erroneous\\" and \\"it originates because of a mistraslation\\" of the term chia-ling found in Zhu Yu's book Pingchow Table Talks. = India = The development of the magnetic compass is highly uncertain. The compass is mentioned in fourth-century AD Tamil nautical books; moreover, its early name of macchayantra (fish machine) suggest a Chinese origin. In its Indian form, the wet compass often consisted of a fish-shaped magnet, float in a bowl filled with oil. This fish shape is due to its name, which is composed of the words maccha meaning fish and yantra meaning device. = Medieval Africa = There is evidence that the distribution of the compass from China likely also reached eastern Africa by way of trade through the end of the Silk Road that ended in East African centre of trade in Somalia and the Swahili city-state kingdoms. There is evidence that Swahili maritime merchants and sailors acquired the compass at some point and used it for navigation.  Dry compass  Early modern dry compass suspended by a gimbal (1570) The dry mariner's compass consists of three elements: A freely pivoting needle on a pin enclosed in a little box with a glass cover and a wind rose, whereby \\"the wind rose or compass card is attached to a magnetized needle in such a manner that when placed on a pivot in a box fastened in line with the keel of the ship the card would turn as the ship changed direction, indicating always what course the ship was on\\".Lane, p. 615 Later, compasses were often fitted into a gimbal mounting to reduce grounding of the needle or card when used on the pitching and rolling deck of a ship. While pivoting needles in glass boxes had already been described by the French scholar Peter Peregrinus in 1269,Taylor and by the Egyptian scholar Ibn Sim ø≈´n in 1300, traditionally Flavio Gioja (fl. 1302), an Italian pilot from Amalfi, has been credited with perfecting the sailor's compass by suspending its needle over a compass card, thus giving the compass its familiar appearance.Lane, p. 616 Such a compass with the needle attached to a rotating card is also described in a commentary on Dante's Divine Comedy from 1380, while an earlier source refers to a portable compass in a box (1318),Kreutz, p. 374 supporting the notion that the dry compass was known in Europe by then.  Bearing compass  Bearing compass (18th century) A bearing compass is a magnetic compass mounted in such a way that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the bearing compass. A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass.Frazer, Persifor, A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216 Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the B√©zard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it.Barnes, Scott, Churchill, James, and Jacobson, Cliff, The Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Navigation, Globe Pequot Press (2002), , , p. 27 This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.Barnes, p. 27 In 1928, Gunnar Tillander, a Swedish unemployed instrument maker and avid participant in the sport of orienteering, invented a new style of bearing compass. Dissatisfied with existing field compasses, which required a separate protractor in order to take bearings from a map, Tillander decided to incorporate both instruments into a single instrument. It combined a compass with a protractor built into the base. His design featured a metal compass capsule containing a magnetic needle with orienting marks mounted into a transparent protractor baseplate with a lubber line (later called a direction of travel indicator). By rotating the capsule to align the needle with the orienting marks, the course bearing could be read at the lubber line. Moreover, by aligning the baseplate with a course drawn on a map ‚Äì ignoring the needle ‚Äì the compass could also function as a protractor. Tillander took his design to fellow orienteers Bj√∂rn, Alvid, and Alvar Kjellstr√∂m, who were selling basic compasses, and the four men modified Tillander's design.Litsky, Frank, Bjorn Kjellstrom, 84, Orienteer and Inventor of Modern Compass, Obituaries, The New York Times, 1 September 1995 In December 1932, the Silva Company was formed with Tillander and the three Kjellstr√∂m brothers, and the company began manufacturing and selling its Silva orienteering compass to Swedish orienteers, outdoorsmen, and army officers.Seidman, p. 68Kjellstr√∂m, Bj√∂rn, 19th Hole: The Readers Take Over: Orienteering, Sports Illustrated, 3 March 1969Silva Sweden AB, Silva Sweden AB and Silva Production AB Become One Company: History, Press Release 28 April 2000  Liquid compass  A surface liquid-filled compass on a boat The liquid compass is a design in which the magnetized needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir Edmund Halley at a meeting of the Royal Society in 1690.Gubbins, David, Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism, Springer Press (2007), , , p. 67 However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship. Protected in a binnacle and normally gimbal-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813.Fanning, A.E., Steady As She Goes: A History of the Compass Department of the Admiralty, HMSO, Department of the Admiralty (1986), pp. 1-10Gubbins, p. 67 Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the Royal Navy from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a dry-mount type.Fanning, A.E., pp. 1-10 In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the United States Navy, and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.Warner, Deborah, Compasses and Coils: The Instrument Business of Edward S. Ritchie, Rittenhouse, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1994), pp. 1-24 Despite these advances, the liquid compass was not introduced generally into the Royal Navy until 1908. An early version developed by RN Captain Creak proved to be operational under heavy gunfire and seas, but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin.Gubbins, p. 67: The use of parallel or multiple needles was by no means a new development; their use in dry-mount marine compasses was pioneered by navigation officers of the Dutch East India Company as early as 1649. However, with ship and gun sizes continuously increasing, the advantages of the liquid compass over the Kelvin compass became unavoidably apparent to the Admiralty, and after widespread adoption by other navies, the liquid compass was generally adopted by the Royal Navy.W. H. Creak: \\"The History of the Liquid Compass\\", The Geographical Journal, Vol. 56, No. 3 (1920), pp. 238-239 Typical aircraft-mounted magnetic compass Liquid compasses were next adapted for aircraft. In 1909, Captain F.O. Creagh-Osborne, Superintendent of Compasses at the Admiralty, introduced his Creagh-Osborne aircraft compass, which used a mixture of alcohol and distilled water to damp the compass card.Davis, Sophia, Raising The Aerocompass In Early Twentieth-century Britain, British Journal for the History of Science, published online by Cambridge University Press, 15 Jul 2008, pp. 1-22Colvin, Fred H., Aircraft Mechanics Handbook: A Collection of Facts and Suggestions from Factory and Flying Field to Assist in Caring for Modern Aircraft, McGraw-Hill Book Co. Inc. (1918), pp. 347-348 After the success of this invention, Capt. Creagh- Osborne adapted his design to a much smaller pocket modelThe Compass Museum, Article: Though the Creagh-Osborne was offered in a wrist-mount model, it proved too bulky and heavy in this form. for individual useHughes, Henry A., Improvements in prismatic compasses with special reference to the Creagh- Osborne patent compass, Transactions of The Optical Society 16, London: The Optical Society (1915), pp. 17-43: The first liquid-damped compass compact enough for pocket or pouch was the Creagh-Osborne, patented in 1915 in Great Britain. by officers of artillery or infantry, receiving a patent in 1915.Hughes, Henry A., pp. 17-43 In December 1932, the newly founded Silva Company of Sweden introduced its first baseplate or bearing compass that used a liquid-filled capsule to damp the swing of the magnetized needle. The liquid-damped Silva took only four seconds for its needle to settle in comparison to thirty seconds for the original version. In 1933 Tuomas Vohlonen, a surveyor by profession, applied for a patent for a unique method of filling and sealing a lightweight celluloid compass housing or capsule with a petroleum distillate to dampen the needle and protect it from shock and wear caused by excessive motion. Introduced in a wrist-mount model in 1936 as the Suunto Oy Model M-311, the new capsule design led directly to the lightweight liquid-filled field compasses of today.  Gyrocompass  The first gyroscope for scientific use was made by the French physicist L√©on Foucault (1819‚Äì1868) in 1852, who also named the device, while researching in the same line that led him to use the eponymous pendulum, for which he was awarded a Copley Medal by the Royal Society. The gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos in The Netherlands after continuous spinning was made possible by small electric motors, which were in turn a technological outcome of the discovery of magnetic induction. Yet only in 1906 was the German inventor Hermann Ansch√ºtz-Kaempfe (1872‚Äì1931) able to build the first practical gyrocompass. It had two major advantages over magnetic compasses: it indicated true north and was unaffected by ferromagnetic materials, such as the steel hull of ships. Thus, it was widely used in the warships of World War I and modern aircraft.  Non-navigational uses  = Astronomy = Three compasses meant for establishing the meridian were described by Peter Peregrinus in 1269 (referring to experiments made before 1248)Taylor, p. 1f. Late in the 13th century, al-Malik al-Ashraf of Yemen wrote a treatise on astrolabes, which included instructions and diagrams on using the compass to determine the meridian (kha·π≠·π≠ ni·π£f al-nahƒÅr) and Qibla. In 1300, a treatise written by the Egyptian astronomer and muezzin Ibn Sim ø≈´n describes a dry compass for use as a \\"Qibla indicator\\" to find the direction to Mecca. Ibn Sim ø≈´n's compass, however, did not feature a compass card nor the familiar glass box. In the 14th century, the Syrian astronomer and timekeeper Ibn al-Shatir (1304‚Äì1375) invented a timekeeping device incorporating both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of salat prayers. = Building orientation = Evidence for the orientation of buildings by the means of a magnetic compass can be found in 12th-century Denmark: one fourth of its 570 Romanesque churches are rotated by 5‚Äì15 degrees clockwise from true east‚Äìwest, thus corresponding to the predominant magnetic declination of the time of their construction. Most of these churches were built in the 12th century, indicating a fairly common usage of magnetic compasses in Europe by then. = Mining = The use of a compass as a direction finder underground was pioneered in the Tuscan mining town Massa where floating magnetic needles were employed for tunnelling, and for defining the claims of the various mining companies, as early as the 13th century.Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 62‚Äì64 In the second half of the 15th century, the compass became standard equipment for Tyrolian miners. Shortly afterwards the first detailed treatise dealing with the underground use of compasses was published by a German miner R√ºlein von Calw (1463‚Äì1525).Ludwig and Schmidtchen, p. 64 = Sun compass = A sun compass uses the position of the Sun in the sky to determine the directions of the cardinal points, making allowance for the local latitude and longitude, time of day, equation of time, and so on. At fairly high latitudes, an analog-display watch can be used as a very approximate sun compass. A simple sundial can be used as a much better one. An automatic sun compass developed by Lt. Col. James Allason, a mechanised cavalry officer, was adopted by the British Army in India in 1938 for use in tanks and other armoured vehicles where the magnetic field was subject to distortion, affecting the standard issue prismatic compass. Cloudy skies prohibited its use in European theatres.

The government announced its plan to create Border Guard Forces in April 2009, in the hopes of ending hostilities between the government and insurgent groups leading up to the 2010 general election.  History  In 2008 the new constitution made it mandatory for insurgent groups to transition into a BGF before the government would agree to engage in peace talks. Following the government announcement on BGFs, the government set a deadline for all insurgent groups to transition into BGFs, and that all ceasefire agreements prior to the deadline would become \\"null and void\\". The deadline was originally set to be June 2009, but was delayed five times until September 2010. In April 2009, Lieutenant General Ye Myint led a government entourage to meet with Kokang, Shan and Wa insurgent groups, to discuss plans to create \\"collective security\\" formed by insurgent groups and under the command of the Tatmadaw, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Border Guard Forces. In 2009, four of the insurgent groups, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, the Kachin Defence Army (4th Brigade of the KIA), the New Democratic Army - Kachin (NDA-K) and the Pa-O National Organisation/Army (PNO/A), accepted the transition plan's terms and transformed into BGF groups. On 20 August 2009, Tatmadaw soldiers and recently transitioned BGF groups gathered outside the town of Laukkai, Kokang, in preparation for an attempt to recapture the town from the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), after they refused to transform into a BGF. The government changed its aggressive stance towards BGFs and ceasefires on 18 August 2011, when then President of Myanmar Thein Sein pledged to \\"make the ethnic issue a national priority\\" by offering open dialogue between the government and all insurgent groups, without the BGF requirement.  Structure  There are no official government guidelines regarding BGFs, but there are lines in the Burmese constitution that reference them. The following are de facto rules set by the Tatmadaw upon creation of the Border Guard Forces: * BGFs may only operate in the area they are assigned by the government * All members of a BGF are to be paid the same salary as a regular soldier in the Tatmadaw * Each BGF is to have exactly 326 personnel, 30 of whom are to be regular Tatmadaw soldiers * Important administrative positions are to be held only by Tatmadaw soldiers  References  Category:Military of Myanmar Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Myanmar Category:2009 establishments in Myanmar Category:Military units and formations established in 2009 ","title":"Border Guard Forces"},{"id":"50466706","text":"XHFH-FM is a radio station on 107.9 FM in Agua Prieta, Sonora.

He was known for publishing early works by Robert Lowell, Tennessee Williams, Wallace Stevens, Allen Tate, Marianne Moore, William Logan, Stephen Berg, and Dana Gioia. A 1982 Newsweek article about the rebirth of the hand press movement said that Duncan was \\"considered the father of the post-World War II private- press movement.\\"  Career  Harry Duncan was born in Keokuk, Iowa and earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1938 from Grinnell College intending to become a poet. He enrolled in the English graduate program at Duke University, but never completed his master's degree. During graduate school he spent summers at the independent Cummington School of the Arts. While in Massachusetts he began publishing books of contemporary poetry using a hand press. He eventually chose to focus on letterpress printing instead of a graduate degree. The first Cummington Press book was published in 1939. Duncan became director of the typographical laboratory at the University of Iowa's School of Journalism and moved the Cummington Press to Iowa City in 1956. In 1972, he moved to the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO) and began the university's fine arts press, Abattoir Editions, and taught. He retired from teaching in 1985 and returned to printing books full-time under the Cummington Press imprint. Duncan died on April 18, 1997, in Omaha, Nebraska. Marking the centenary of his birth, the Fall 2016 issue of Parenthesis included a portrait of Harry Duncan on its cover along with three articles by or about Duncan: the text of his talk \\"New England Novitiate,\\" \\"An Apprentice's Story\\" by Juan Nicanor Pascoe, and \\"A Checklist of Printed Work, 1939-1997\\" by Michael Peich and Denise Brady.

In addition to CWF Mid-Atlantic, Garcia also appeared for promotions including Fire Star Pro Wrestling and OMEGA Championship Wrestling. = WWE = NXT (2015‚Äì2018)  In April 2015, it was reported that Valenzuela signed a contract with WWE. On April 10, 2015, Valenzuela was announced as one of 11 new signings to begin training at the WWE Performance Center. Wrestling under his real name, Valenzuela made his first appearance on NXT as an enhancement talent, teaming with Elias Samson in a tag team match, losing to American Alpha. Valenzuela then began to make frequent appearances at NXT house shows for the rest of 2015 and the early part of 2016. In April 2016, vignettes began to air hyping the debut of Valenzuela, now repackaged as No Way Jose. He made his official debut on the April 20, 2016 episode of NXT, defeating Alexander Wolfe. On the June 22 episode of NXT, Jose interrupted Austin Aries during his interview backstage and told him to be positive following Aries' loss at NXT TakeOver: The End. Later that night, Jose defeated Josh Woods. Aries then came out and ended up dancing with Jose, but he then attacked Jose. After weeks of missing NXT, Jose attacked Aries after Aries' match on the July 20 episode of NXT. Jose rushed Aries outside into the locker room. Aries defeated Jose at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II. Then, Jose entered a feud with Eric Young and the SAnitY faction by calling them out after they interrupted a match between Rich Swann and Kona Reeves. This led to an assault on Jose. On the November 30 episode of NXT, Jose faced Eric Young in a losing effort. On the December 7 episode of NXT, Jose and Rich Swann faced the team of Eric Young and Alexander Wolfe again in a losing effort. Jose continued to feud with SAnitY, forming an alliance with Tye Dillinger and Roderick Strong to battle the faction in early 2017. He was scheduled to team with Dillinger, Strong and Ruby Riot against SAnitY at NXT TakeOver: Orlando but he was attacked by Sanity before the show. He was replaced by Kassius Ohno in the match, which was eventually won by SAnitY.  Raw (2018‚Äì2020)  On the April 9 episode of Raw, the first after WrestleMania 34, Jose made his main roster debut, defeating local talent John Skyler in a squash match. Jose picked up an upset victory against Baron Corbin on the April 30 episode of Raw, after interference from Titus O'Neil. This would lead to Jose teaming with O'Neil and Apollo Crews to face Corbin and The Revival on the May 7 episode of Raw in a losing effort. He failed to qualify for the Men's Money in the Bank ladder match in a triple threat match against Corbin and the eventual winner Bobby Roode on the May 14 episode of Raw. On the May 21 episode of Raw, Jose was defeated by Corbin to end their feud. Jose then started a feud with Mojo Rawley. After losing to Rawley on the June 18 episode of Raw, Jose would ask for a rematch, only to be constantly denied one by Rawley for the next three weeks. Jose finally got his rematch on the July 9 episode of Raw, however he would once again be defeated by Rawley. Afterwards, Jose did not compete on Raw for four months, instead regularly appearing on Main Event. Jose returned to Raw on November 26, where he was defeated by Jinder Mahal. Jose made his Royal Rumble debut at the namesake event on January 27, 2019, only to be eliminated in two seconds by Samoa Joe. On the April 13, 2020 episode of Raw, Jose was defeated by Bobby Lashley in a squash match. This would be his final WWE appearance. On April 15, 2020, Jose was released along with various other superstars and backstage talent as part of budget cuts stemming from COVID-19 pandemic.

She is best known for blending Native American and Mexican clothing traditions to create distinctive southwest resort wear dresses known as patio dresses, the fiesta dresses, (also known as the pejorative squaw dress). She founded the company Dolores Resort Wear that manufactured dresses for the American market, selling in upscale department stores across the country. The iconic design was appropriated and copied by other designers throughout the southwest becoming synonymous with mid-twentieth century regionalist fashion of the American Southwest. The dress design became the official dress of the American Square- dancing movement. Life Born Dolores Consuelo Barcelo in the northern Mexican state of Sonora on June 6, 1907 to Father Helberto Barcelo and Mother Beatrice Barcelo. She immigrated to Douglas, Arizona with her family in 1911 fleeing the civil unrest created by the Mexican Revolution. She moved to Los Angeles in 1920 and began working at Phiffer's, where she assisted the designers in selecting colors, trimmings and fabrics. She worked there for 17 years,. In 1929, she married Leo Gonzales. The Gonzales family moved to Tucson in 1938. Gonzales' sister, Maria, opened her own dress shop, called Irene Page. Although Irene Page made ladies' ready-to-wear at first, Maria Gonzales began to experiment with the style of broomstick skirts. Gonzales and her brother Richard Barcelo brought Irene Page after World War II when Maria married and moved out of state. In 1941, the store began to make their own dresses and it was also renamed the Dolores Shop. All of Gonzales's dresses were made in a converted house ‚Äì factory on West Council Street. In 1954, the Arizona Daily Star reported that Gonzales' factory created 60 dresses a day. In 1962, Barcelo convinced Gonzales to close her shop, seeing an end to the trend in fiesta dresses. According to Dolores's Son Lee Gondolas, the store, called the Dolores Shop received orders from all over the world. Dolores also had market outlets in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis and New York. In 1956, a Los Angeles Times Reporter dubbed her \\"The Dior of the Desert.\\" Major department stores sent buyers to the Dolores Shop to purchase dresses that sold for 100 to 300 (800‚Äì2400) in today's dollars. J.C. Penney wanted to sell her dressing in their stores, but Gonzales refused. Famous individuals, such as Mamie Eisenhower, Pat Nixon and Cyd Charisse were known to have bought Gonzales' dresses. Gonzales died in July 1994 in California.

The decree is difficult to date but it followed the revolt of the cities of Euboea in 446. The islanders were angered by the increasingly harsh imperialism of Athens and attempted to take advantage of the defeat of Athens in the Battle of Coronea in neighbouring Boeotia (c. 447 BC) which resulted in the loss of the Athenian ‚Äúland empire‚Äù. The revolt was crushed by the Athenians led by Pericles. Other cities on Euboea, such as Eretria, had decrees with exactly the same provisions passed. The decree is considered a point at which there was no longer any doubt of the imperial power held by Athens over its allies in the Delian League. I will not revolt from the people of Athens by any means or device whatsoever, neither in word or in deed, nor will I obey anyone who does revolt, and if anyone revolts I will denounce him to the Athenians. and I will be the best and fairest ally I am able to be and will help and defend the Athenian people, in the event of anyone wronging the Athenians people, and I will obey the Athenian people. Athens also expected to be involved in the judicial proceedings of the city of Chalcis resulting in the actions of local courts being severely restricted. The decree allowed the people of Chalcis to punish their own citizens, except in cases that involved death, exile, or the loss of rights as citizens. The right of appeal to the Heliaia in Athens was allowed. This was largely aimed at the oligarchic wealthy who hoped to gain the assistance of Sparta or Persia in their revolts.

The fabric was, in the past, presented as a gift of honour (Mana Phee) to the soldiers for their bravery in a successful war, and to the praise-worthy chiefs of the Nagas of Manipur by the king of Manipur. It is a product which is protected under the GI registration and is now made throughout the Indian state of Manipur. Geographical indication The fabric has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It was registered as \\"Shaphee Lanphee\\" under the Geographical Indications Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class ‚Äì 25 ‚Äì Clothing vide application number 371 dated 19 December 2011, and also for Wangkhei Phee (GI no.372) and Moirang Phee (GI no.373). The Government of Manipur was expected to register 1,000 weavers in respect of manufacturing Shaphee Lanphee within six months from the date of registration as per decision of the Consultative Committee meeting. History The literal meaning of the fabric 'Shaphee' is \\"the fabric of animal and war\\". It is exclusivity a product of Khoisnam lineage. It is said that the king saw a man of Khoisnam clan wearing this Shaphee Lanphee and riding a horse. The king then adopted it as a form of honouring brave Naga Chiefs of Manipur. According to manuscript titled Loiyumba Silyen, King Loiyumba (1074‚Äì1122 AD) authorised this product to be woven by the Khoisnam family. The product was revived in the 20th century with the efforts of Maisnam Nalini Devi, a weaver from Wangkhei Yonglan, her sister Maisnam Anita and their mother Keinahanbi who had both won the state award in 1992 for promoting this product. Nalini also won the Master Crafts Person award in 2009 for promoting this craft. Details of product Shaphee Lamphee embroidery is done over a black coloured cloth with red border. The motifs embroidered on the fabric consists of several designs, and some of the common designs adopted are: of animals such as \\"shamu\\" (elephant), \\"shagol\\" (horse), \\"iroichi\\" (buffalo horn), \\"wahong\\" (peacock), and \\"Nga\\" (fish); planets such as \\"numit\\" (sun), tha (moon); Thawanmichak (star) ; and also phantup (magical seat, ta (spear) - these designs are done in a set pattern and sequence of operation. The embroidery is done by hand using needle and yarns of cotton. It has a width of 110‚Äì132 cm and length of 225‚Äì230 cm and generally weighs 1854 grams. The yarn used are 2/20S cotton and 2/34S acrylic with wrap made with 2/20S cotton and weft woven from 2/20S cotton. The yarn used in embroidery is 2/20S cotton, mercerized and 2/40S. The fabric is revered for its religious significance in view of the motifs crafted on them. The core part of the fabric has red colour representing sun, the white strips at both borders denoting the cosmos of sky and the stars, and symbols of moon and sun assigned to mother and father. Some of these motifs are indicative of relationship between the celestial bodies and the Meitei King; particularly the magical seat and the elephant linked to the royalty and the spear heads and the fishes indicative of the mythology of king Naothingkhong (663‚Äì763 AD). The yarn used to make the fabric is a derivative of \\"Lashing\\" (Cotton ball) and \\"Kabrang\\" (Mulberry cocoon). These are also extracted from the bark of the tree species locally known as \\"Santhak\\" (Urtica sp.). The local fibre is then made into threads by spinning and then dyed using plants and bark. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing by applying starch made of rice, and then stretched across using a bamboo rod which is followed by winding into bobbin. Weaving of the fabric is done on a \\"Loin and Frame Loom\\" and motifs are made with needle work without frame using Manipuri cotton or occasionally silk threads. In order to exercise quality control of the product made by weavers, following the GI registration of the fabric, an inspection agency has been instituted with nine members drawn from the government departments, societies and master craftsmen.

It was a county in the land of Travunija. After the Ottoman conquest, it was replaced by the Zupci. Geography, economy and culture Vrsinje was located on the way from Trebinje (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina) to Herceg Novi (now in Montenegro), above Konavle (now in Croatia). It bordered the counties of Trebinje, Vrm, Konavle and Draƒçevica. It included the settlement of Mrcine (which Jireƒçek identified as Vrsinje itself, known as Mrcine since the 16th century), now known as Dubravka, in Konavle. Jireƒçek's identification of Mrcine as Vrsinje itself was proved false, as Mrcine was mentioned already in 1423 and 1427 in boundary settlements of Konavle lands. A larger size of Vrsinje is apparent from its often mention alongside Trebinje and Konavle. According to Jireƒçek, there were dense forests around Vrsinje (now without traces) from which planks were sold in Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Konavle and the Bay of Kotor. From Vrsinje and Konavle meat, especially salted pork (prosciutto), leather, horns, wool and cheese was exported to Ragusa. In 1310, two individuals from Vrsinje migrated to the Republic of Ragusa to work as servants. Vrsinje was inhabited by warlike shepherds. The Dobra≈°inoviƒá was a lesser noble family from Vrsinje, mentioned in the first half of the 15th century; Vukosav Dobra≈°inoviƒá was mentioned between 1426 and 1433 several times in Ragusan documents, while Toma≈° Dobra≈°inoviƒá was mentioned in 1439. Names of people from Vrsinje are recorded in documents; examples include 14th- century Rajko Milatkoviƒá or Milatoviƒá (1376), and 15th-century Radut Radosaliƒá (1416), Vukosav Dobra≈°inoviƒá (1426‚Äì33), Vukman Bogavƒçiƒá (1426), Pribio Bogavƒçiƒá (1429), Petko Radosaliƒá (1432), Radonja Paskaƒçeviƒá (1434), Radohna and Ostoja Radosaliƒá (1438), \\"Vatoyl\\" and \\"Butor Cranchouigh\\" (1438), Toma≈° Dobra≈°inoviƒá (1439), Dobrovoj Branojeviƒá, Branko Dobrovojeviƒá, Hranko Jirojeviƒá, Vukac Milatoviƒá, Rogu≈°in Milo≈°eviƒá, Vuk≈°a Pribiloviƒá, Boroje, Branko Dobrojeviƒá, and Dobroslav Stanojeviƒá. Bosnian linguist Asim Peco noted that almost all names of individuals from Vrsinje were Serb. History Vrsinje was an old county of the province of Travunija.) It was located in the eastern part of its territory. It was held by the medieval Serbian state until the late 14th century. It was held by magnates Nikola Altomanoviƒá until 1373, then ƒêuraƒë I Bal≈°iƒá until 1377, after which it was taken by Tvrtko I of Bosnia, during the Fall of the Serbian Empire. Bosnian magnate Sandalj Hraniƒá received southern Konavle and its city Sokol in 1392, and also held Vrsinje (as mentioned in 1424). In the 1440s, there were frequent flights from Trebinje, Vrsinje and Draƒçevica into Ragusan territory. After Bosnian king Stephen Thomas and the Serbian despot reconciled, the Republic of Ragusa proposed a league against the \\"Duke of St. Sava\\", Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça. In 1451, King Stephen Thomas ceded over the counties of Vrsinje and Draƒçevica to Ragusa. The Ragusans were allowed to raise castles in the ceded territory. Thomas' charter from 18 December 1451 also included the obligation that he would attack Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, but the ceding was only theoretical, as Duke Stjepan firmly held those territories. During the period of the Duchy of St. Sava, Vrsinje changed hands several times from the Duchy to the Ottomans, and from the Ottomans back to the Duchy. Vrsinje was held by the Ottomans already in September 1465. Ottoman suba≈üi are present in Vrsinje on 17 April and 20 August 1466, while Vlachs shepherd community of Zupci, as jurisdictio Turcorum, are present there on 7 October 1466. As seen from the Ottoman defter of 1475‚Äì77, the Zupci nahija replaced Vrsinje. The Zupci had earlier been mentioned as a family or people part of Vrsinje; in 1403 as \\"homo de Versigna Xube√ß\\", in 1421 as \\"de Versigne de genere Zuba√ß\\", in 1466 as \\"de Versigne Vlachos Xubci sic dictos\\". The tribe of Zupci replaced the name of Vrsinje. On 28 January 1501, a new vojvoda of Novi, Vrsinje and Trebinje is mentioned; this is the last time Vrsinje is mentioned as an administrative unit.

Early life  Loretta Ann Petit was born in New Orleans, Louisiana to Helen (n√©e Macklin) and Maurice Petit, Sr., the younger of two children. The family was very poor and moved often. In her book, \\"Making It Through\\", Petit recalled: > We must have moved about once every six (6) months. I remember the furnished > apartments we moved into. I remember the good and the bad ... It didn't take > the teachers long to find out I was a good student, and it certainly didn't > take the children long to see I was shy and poverty-stricken and ashamed of > my situation ... By the time I was in the sixth grade, I had gone to five > schools. At age 11, Petit moved in with her great-aunt, Rowena Leblanc, and subsequently had a stable residence for the remainder of her formative years.  Radio career  =Early career= Petit's start in broadcast radio came about while attending the University of New Orleans. There, she became a student broadcaster with Radio UNO, then hosted by station WTIX in Metairie. At the time, Petit was working full-time in an administrative position with the City of New Orleans, and radio was a side interest. In July 1989, Petit's mother, Helen Macklin Petit, died from cancer at age 52. Petit took an extended leave of absence from work and eventually resigned. When she finally returned to the work force some months later, Petit switched careers and accepted a part-time on air position working a small gospel radio station, K75. In 1990, Petit accepted a full-time overnight on air position at gospel radio station WYLD-AM. Within a year, she was promoted to full-time middays, where she developed a community following as the \\"Midday Messenger\\". She retained this time slot for many years. =United Broadcasters of New Orleans= Immediately after Hurricane Katrina struck the city of New Orleans in late August 2005, a number of area radio stations, led by WWL-AM, came together in Baton Rouge, LA to form United Broadcasters of New Orleans, a temporary consortium of broadcast personnel, equipment, and other shared resources. Petit was one of a number of broadcasters who helped to provide a continuous 24 hour cycle of news updates and post-Katrina coverage. Louisiana residents, including those still trapped in New Orleans with working radios, could hear the broadcasts via WWL 870-AM. The broadcasts were available outside of Louisiana via streaming services. Petit's show and several others also hosted call ins to help individuals share information about loved ones in hopes of reuniting families. =Present Day= Petit currently hosts the morning drive time show on WYLD-AM, where she also serves as the music and program director. During her 25 years in radio, she has received numerous community awards and was nominated twice for a Stellar Award for gospel music industry professionals. Petit has served as an emcee at countless New Orleans community events, including the annual New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.  Books and other media  Petit has authored two books: \\"Making It Through\\", published in 1996, and \\"Getting a Grip: Saved, Single, and Sensible, published in 2010. In 2007, Petit starred as paramedic Barbara Winters in Code 7, a dramatic short film. In addition, she is the founder of Petit-Kendeka Ministries and the C.O.F.F.E.E. Sisterhood Network.  Ministry  After pursuing theological studies for a number of years, Petit became an ordained minister in 1997. She is currently the 2nd Assistant Pastor at Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist Church, of which she has been a member since 1979. She speaks at various churches and events as part of her ministry.  Personal life  Petit is divorced and has three children: Kenya, Barry (Derren), and Kalilah. She is currently a doctorate student with ABD status at the University of Phoenix.

At their maximum extent, the domains of the Dukagjini extended from Upper Zadrima in the northwest to the Plain of Dukagjini in western Kosovo. The political center of the Dukagjini family was Lezh√´ until 1393 when it was surrendered to Venice in order to not fall under the Ottomans. The Ottoman sanjak of Dukagjin was named after the rule of the family in the areas that formed it. The Dukagjini family appears for the first time in historical record in 1281, when their progenitor Gjin Tanushi took the title of dux. They may have been descendants of the earlier Progoni family which roughly claimed the same territory as they. The Dukagjini formed their independent domains when they rebelled against the Balsha family. This event must have happened by 1387, because that year the brothers Pal and Lek√´ Dukagjini signed a trade agreement with the Republic of Ragusa and allowed free passage to the republic's merchants through their territories. It was later ruled by Pal's descendants, Tanush Dukagjini, and Pal Dukagjini II. In June 1393, the two Dukagjini brothers ceded it to Venice, which it kept until 1478 - despite later attempts by the family to retake the city. The difficult to access mountainous hinterland in the east remained under the control of the Dukagjini. In 1398, Tanush III (son of Pal I), surrendered to the Ottomans, but in 1402, after their defeat at Ankara and the capture of Sultan Bayezid I, he freed himself from them. The main representatives of the Dukagjini in the 15th century were Pal II with his sons Lek√´ III. and Nikoll√´ II. Dukagjini (‚Ä† 1454). Pal Dukagjini and his son Nikoll√´ participated in Skanderbeg's assembly of Lezha on March 2, 1444 as vassals of Lek√´ Zaharia, the lord of Sati and Danja. Lek√´ III. apologized for not being able to attend the meeting. After the death of Pal II (1446) Lek√´ took over the Dukagjini and Nikoll√´ took part in the Albanian-Venetian War (1447‚Äì1448).

A performance lasts about twenty-five minutes. History Villa-Lobos composed his First Symphony in 1916, to a philosophical argument written by himself under the pseudonym \\"Epaminondas Villalba Filho\\". It is the first in a cycle of five symphonies written in the style of Vincent d'Indy. It was given a partial performance (the second and third movements, according to and ; the first and fourth movements according to ) on 20 September 1919 in the Theatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro by the Grande Companhia Italiana, conducted by Gino Marinuzzi. The complete symphony was first performed on 30 August 1920, again in the Theatro Municipal, by the Orquestra da Sociedade de Concertos Sinf√¥nicos do Rio de Janeiro, conducted by the composer. At some later date, Villa-Lobos revised the score, adding tam-tam, glockenspiel, and side drum to the percussion section . Villa-Lobos had written the romantic-symbolic programme text for this symphony already in 1907. It concerns the mystic relationship of the artist's soul with fate and the universe, but these philosophically effusive ideas are both difficult to understand and virtually imperceptible in the music .

History Villa- Lobos composed (or began composing) his Second Symphony in Rio de Janeiro in 1917, but the score was not completed until late in 1943 or early in 1944 . It was first performed on 6 May 1944 in a radio broadcast by the Orquestra Sinf√¥nica da R√°dio Nacional, conducted by the composer. The first North American performance took place a little more than six months later, on 26 November 1944 in Philharmonic Auditorium, Los Angeles, by the Janssen Symphony of Los Angeles, conducted by Villa-Lobos. It is the second in a cycle of five symphonies written in the style of Vincent d'Indy . Instrumentation The symphony is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, t√≠mpani, tam-tam, bass drum, cymbals, side drum, tambour de basque, celesta, 2 harps, and strings. Analysis The symphony is in four movements: #Allegro non troppo #Allegretto scherzando #Andante Moderato #Allegro The principal, first theme of the opening movement returns in all of the subsequent movements as a cyclic theme. It appears twice in the development section of the second movement (b. 93 and 168, both times in the low strings), at the beginning of the development in the third movement (b. 32) in the low woodwinds, and in the fourth movement in the development or episodic section, first in the bass clarinet, then with the addition of the bassoons and contrabassoon . The third, slow movement is a monothematic sonata-allegro form, with a shift from B minor to D major marking both the exposition and the course of the work as a whole . The finale is cast in sonata-allegro form, though with unconventional tonal relationships. The two main themes have tonics separated by a tritone, E and B in the exposition, transposed upward by a minor third in the recapitulation to G and D. The tonal plan therefore projects a diminished seventh chord, with an upward progression of a semitone at the end to conclude the Allegro on D. Thematically, the movement contains not only its own themes and the main cyclic theme of the symphony, but also recalls motivic material from themes in all the preceding movements . The symphony takes approximately 50 minutes to perform. This makes it the second-longest of Villa-Lobos' symphonies, after No. 10.

A performance lasts about 35 minutes. History In 1919, Villa-Lobos was commissioned to write a symphony to celebrate the Treaty of Versailles. In response, he composed his Third Symphony in Rio de Janeiro, beginning work in early May and finishing the score less than six weeks later, on 12 June 1919 (; ). The work is subtitled A Guerra (War) and the manuscript also designates it the \\"1a Sinfonia Simb√≥lica\\" (First Symbolic Symphony). It is the first of a trilogy of programmatic symphonies based on arguments by , the others being subtitled A Vit√≥ria (Victory) and A Paz (Peace), as well as being the third in a cycle of five symphonies written in the style of Vincent d'Indy . The first two movements were presented on 31 July 1919 in the Theatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro, by the Orchestra do Theatro Municipal conducted by the composer, as part of a concert dedicated to the President of Brazil, Epit√°cio Pessoa. The complete symphony was first performed (together with the Fourth Symphony) in the same venue and by the same forces in September 1920, in a concert given in honour of Albert I and Elisabeth of Bavaria, the King and Queen of Belgium . However, it appears that at this time the symphony had only three movements. The slow movement, Lento e marcial, \\"certainly did not exist before 1946\\", and was probably added shortly before the work was publishedin 1955 . Instrumentation There are two manuscript scores of the symphony, one lacking the third movement and with a somewhat larger instrumentation than the later manuscript (and published) version. It is scored for (1) an orchestra consisting of: piccolo, 2 (or 4) flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 (or 4) clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 (or 8) horns, 4 trumpets (or cornets), 4 trombones, tuba, 4 timpani, tam-tam, cymbals, matracas, 2 (or 4) bass drums, 2 (or 4) side drums, (xylophone), celesta, 2 harps, piano, and strings, (2) a small brass band consisting of piccolo bugle in E, 2 bugles in B, 4 cornets, 4 trombones, 2 alto saxhorns, 2 bass saxhorns, 2 contrabass saxhorns in B, and 2 contrabass saxhorns in E, and (3), in the last movement, an optional mixed chorus. The earlier, three- movement version also specified the numbers of stringed instruments: 26 first violins, 24 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos, and twelve double basses, bringing the total number of orchestral players to 164, surpassing the gigantic orchestras called for by Richard Strauss in Elektra and Salome . Analysis The symphony in its final form has four movements: #Allegro quasi giusto: \\"A vida e o labor\\" (Life and Work) #Como um scherzo: \\"Intrigas e cochichos\\" (Intrigues and Whispers) #Lento e marcial: \\"Sofrimento\\" (Suffering) #Allegro impetuoso: \\"A batalha\\" (Battle) Unlike Villa-Lobos's two preceding symphonies and the following one, the Third Symphony does not use cyclic techniques internally, though there is a neighbour-note motive found in all four movements . More unusually, several themes from this symphony recur in the Fourth Symphony, creating cyclic relationships between these two independent works . Although Villa-Lobos took great care in the construction of the first movement , its form is by no means clear cut. If it is viewed as a traditional sonata-allegro, then there is very little development in the middle section. In the recapitulation, Villa-Lobos seeks to create contrasting colouration from the way the thematic material was originally presented in the exposition. For example, in the opening bars, the first theme is given to the woodwinds (later joined by horns and cornet), and the strings accompany with a semiquaver figure; in the recapitulation, the second violins and violas have the theme, accompanied by the semiquaver figure in clarinet and bassoon . The movement can also be seen as a sort of modified rondo form (ABCDA'B' plus coda), in which the D section is essentially episodic. However, the two occurrences of the refrain (A) are in the dominant and supertonic keys of G and D, and the overall tonic key, C, is reached only in the concluding coda . The main theme of the second movement was inspired by the scherzo of Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony .

History According to the official account, Villa-Lobos composed his Fifth Symphony in 1920. It is the third of a trilogy of programmatic symphonies written to commemorate World War I, based on arguments by . It is also the last of a cycle of five symphonies in the style of Vincent d'Indy. It was never performed, and the score has been lost. A programme documenting a performance on 5 March 1961 at Carnegie Hall in New York, by the New York Philharmonic conducted by Eleazar de Carvalho appears to have been a hoax. When asked by the Museu Villa-Lobos for confirmation, the conductor informed them that he had never had a copy of the score, and that concert never took place . Although a memorial concert in Carnegie Hall by members of the New York Philharmonic conducted by Carvalho was announced for that date, the all-Villa- Lobos programme was to include the Madonna Fantasia, the Cello Concerto in A Minor, Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5, and Uirapuri . No mention was made of any symphony . In any case, Lisa Peppercorn doubts that the work was actually completed in 1920, but only progressed beyond the conception of the idea in 1946. According to her, the Ricordi catalogue of Villa-Lobos's works published on 30 June 1965 lists the symphony under the title Odiss√©a da Paz, and states it was composed in 1921 . David Appleby, on the other hand, gives this as the subtitle of the Seventh Symphony . Analysis The symphony has four movements: # Allegro #Scherzo #Moderato #Allegro grandioso In 1928 or 1929, Villa-Lobos explained to music journalist Suzanne Demarquez that the as-yet unperformed Fifth Symphony, like its two predecessors, added a wind band to the orchestra, but also included a mixed chorus singing nonsense syllables borrowed from several languages: Russian, French, Chinese, African, etc. The object of such a text is to explore the influence of phonemes and rhythm on musical effect, as he did again later in the choir parts of the Nonet and Ch√¥ros No. 10 .

It lasts about twenty-five minutes in performance. History Villa-Lobos composed his Sixth Symphony in Rio de Janeiro in 1944. It was first performed in Rio de Janeiro on 29 April 1950 by the Orquestra do Theatro Municipal, conducted by the composer. The score is dedicated to Mindinha . An early report, based on conversations with Villa-Lobos in Paris in 1928‚Äì29, said that a Sixth Symphony (subtitled Symphonie indienne and based on Brazilian indigenous themes) had been written shortly after the Fifth Symphony, at about the same time as Villa-Lobos's opera Malazarte (1921), but had never been performed . No reference to such a work is found in the official catalogue of the composer's works, however. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for an orchestra consisting of 2 piccolos, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, tam-tam, bass drum, large side drum, Indian drum, side drum, cymbals, vibraphone, celesta, 2 harps, and strings. Analysis The symphony consists of four movements: #Allegro non troppo #Lento #Allegretto quasi animato #Allegro The main theme of the symphony was devised by projecting the outline of mountains at Belo Horizonte, Brazil, onto graph paper and transcribing the result as a melody. Villa-Lobos called this technique milimetraza√ß√£o (graphing), sometimes rendered in English as \\"millimetrization\\" or \\"milmeterization\\" . A harmonized version of this melody for piano, together with a similar treatment titled New York Skyline, was initially published in the October 1942 issue of New Music, devoted to works by Brazilian composers . The first movement is in a slightly unconventional sonata-allegro form which, according to the composer's usual methods, omits the second theme from the recapitulation. The overall tonal centre is on C, with secondary key areas on D and G . In the second movement, Villa-Lobos utilizes a technique of drawing attention to a pitch through its exclusion, in an arguably atonal passage in b. 33‚Äì47 where a clarinet solo weaves a long melody repeatedly using eleven chromatic notes, with the omission of the note G. This pitch is then introduced emphatically in the viola entrance at b. 47 .

History Villa-Lobos composed his Tenth Symphony for the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city of S√£o Paulo. He began work in Rio de Janeiro in 1952, completing the score on 15 February 1953 in New York. It was first performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris on 4 April 1957. The soloists were Jean Giraudeau (tenor), Camille Maurane (baritone), and Jacques Chalude (bass). The Orchestre National et Choeur de la Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise was conducted by the composer. The score is dedicated to Mindinha (Arminda Neves d'Almeida), the composer's companion for the last 23 years of his life . Instrumentation The symphony/oratorio is scored for tenor, baritone, and bass soloists, mixed choir, and an orchestra consisting of 2 piccolos, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, tam-tam, cymbals, chocalho, coconut hulls, lion's roar, bells, gong, sleigh bells, small frame drum, bass drum, xylophone, marimba, celesta, 2 harps, piano, organ, and strings. Analysis The symphony has five movements: #Allegro: \\"A terra e os seres\\" (The Earth and Its Creatures) #Lento: \\"Grito de guerra\\" (War Cry) #Scherzo (Allegretto scherzando): \\"Iurupichuna\\" #Lento: \\"A voz da terra e a apari√ß√£o de Anchieta\\" (The Voice of the Earth and the Appearance of Anchieta) #Poco allegro: Glory in Heaven, and Peace on Earth The first movement is for the orchestra alone, and serves as an overture to the four remaining movements, which feature the vocal soloists and choirs. The movement is in sectional form, dominated by a principal melodic motif consisting of an upper-neighbour note figure followed by an upward leap. This motif is found in all five of the main sections of the movement, which are differentiated by tempo, key area (C, B, E, C, and C), instrumentation, rhythms, harmonies, and specific transformations of the main motif. The second theme of the first of these sections is the only one not derived from the core motif. Quasi-tonal quartal harmonies are especially evident, but alternate with polychords in dense ostinato textures and more thinly orchestrated tonal passages. The fourth section, which is developmental, begins with an abrupt change of tempo and a short tonal fugato in the strings .

Biography  Trained for the bar, he first worked as an attorney but the success of his play Les Finac√©s, in 1808, caused him to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1814, he joined the guards of the king of Belgium, leaving military service after receiving the Legion of Honour in 1818. A very prolific author, he wrote under various collective pseudonyms such as Emmanuel, with Emmanuel Arago, M. Sapajou, with Francis baron d'Allarde and Gabriel de Lurieu. Managing director of the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s from 1830 to 1836, he also directed Le Nain couleur de rose, a political, literary and moral newspaper from 15 September 1815 to 5 May 1816 and collaborated with La Foudre by Alphonse de Beauchamp.

The plot follows a young vegetarian's first year at veterinary school when she tastes meat for the first time and develops a craving for flesh. The film premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2016 and was theatrically released in the United States on 10 March 2017 by Focus World, and in France on 15 March 2017 by Wild Bunch. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Ducournau's direction and screenplay, though was met with some controversy for its graphic content. Plot Lifelong vegetarian Justine begins her first semester at veterinary school, the same one her older sister Alexia is currently attending and where her parents met. Her first night, she meets her roommate Adrien, who says he is gay, and is forced to partake in a hazing ritual, welcoming the new students. They are brought to a party, where Justine feels uncomfortable until she runs into Alexia. Alexia shows Justine old class photos of students bathed in blood, including one with their parents. The next morning, the new class is splattered with blood and are forced to eat raw rabbit's kidneys. Justine refuses, saying she is a vegetarian. Alexia encourages Justine to eat it by telling her she will like it. Justine still refuses. Alexia then takes two and eats them both, still unable to convince Justine. Alexia then forces one into her mouth so she will eat it; she walks out with Adrien gagging. Later that night, she discovers a strong, itchy rash all over her body. She goes to the doctor, who diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her a cream for the rash. The next day, Justine begins having cravings for meat, which makes her ashamed of herself. She and Adrien take a late-night trip to a gas station so no one will see her eating meat. Unsatisfied, she eats raw chicken in the morning, and later throws up a long bundle of hair. That night, Justine finds the same cream that the doctor gave her in Alexia's cabinet. Alexia gives her a bikini wax; when she tries to cut the wax off with sharp scissors, Justine kicks her away and Alexia accidentally cuts off her own finger. Shocked in horror, Alexia faints. Justine picks up the finger and tastes it. Justine ends up liking the taste and starts eating the finger. Alexia wakes up and is shocked when catching Justine eating her severed finger. The next morning, Alexia takes Justine to a deserted road, where she jumps in front of a car, causing the car and the two people in it to crash into a tree. Alexia starts eating one of the passengers as Justine tries to stop her. Despite this, Justine's craving for human meat grows and she starts lusting after Adrien. That night, she arrives at a party, where blue paint is thrown at her as part of another hazing ritual and she is forced to make out with a boy painted yellow until they're painted completely green. As Justine and the boy do as dared, Justine mistakenly bites the middle of his bottom lip off, leaving the other party guests shocked in disgust as soon as he bursts out of the door in pain. After what happened in the paint party, Justine goes back to her dorm and takes a shower. During her shower, she picks a chunk of the boy's lip out of her teeth, which she then eats. Justine confides in Adrien and they end up having sex, during which Justine tries to bite Adrien. Justine then stops herself from her attempts and bites her own arm. Justine is relaxed as the blood runs from her arm. Disturbed, Adrien tries to ignore what she's just done and caresses Justine. Later on during a party, Justine gets extremely intoxicated and Alexia takes her to the morgue. The next morning, everyone in school stares at Justine, some avoiding her. As an explanation, Adrien shows her a video of a drunken Justine crawling like an animal, trying to take bites out of the arm of a corpse, which Alexia pulls out of reach with a crowd of angry party guests booing and watching. Furious by what was seen from Alexia, Justine pushes Alexia in attempt to attack her, and the two fight. Alexia bites part of Justine's cheek off and they bite each other's arms, finally taking comfort in eating one another only to be pulled apart by two other students. Justine hits one of them with a backpack and helps Alexia up as they walk each other back to their dorms. That night, Justine sleeps with Adrien in his bed. The next morning, when Justine touches Adrien who seems to be asleep, she notices blood on her hand and pulls off the blankets, only to find Adrien dead with most of his right leg eaten and a stab wound in his back. Justine then sees a bloody and mostly catatonic Alexia slumped in the kitchen floor, revealing that she was the one who murdered Adrien. Furious, Justine picks up a bloodied ski pole Alexia killed Adrien with, and walks up to her sister with an unpleasant stare, planning on killing Alexia with it. Justine puts the ski pole down and decides not to kill Alexia and simply cleans her up in the shower instead. Alexia is imprisoned for the murder of Adrien, and Justine is sent back home. Despite everything, the two sisters appear to be on good terms. At home Justine's father tells her that what happened is neither her fault nor Alexia's. He explains that when he first met Justine's mother, he couldn't understand why she didn't want to be with him. He says that he finally realized the first time they kissed, indicating a scar on his lip. He proceeds to open his shirt, revealing scars and missing chunks of his chest and tells Justine that she will find a solution. Cast * Garance Marillier as Justine * Ella Rumpf as Alexia * as Adrien * Laurent Lucas as Father * Joana Preiss as Mother * Bouli Lanners as The driver * Marion Vernoux as The nurse * Jean-Louis Sbille as The professor Release Raw was screened in the International Critics' Week section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Prize. During a screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, some viewers received emergency medical services after allegedly fainting from the film's graphic scenes. Ducournau said she was \\"shocked\\" to hear this during a Q&A; after the screening. The film won several awards in European film festivals, including the top prizes at the Sitges Film Festival, Festival international du film fantastique de G√©rardmer, and the Paris International Fantastic Film Festival.http://cine- marketing.net/2017/08/05/raw-good-film-and-bad-buzz/ The film had a limited theatrical release in the United States by Focus World starting on 10 March 2017. Reception Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 91% approval score based on 145 reviews and an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Raw lurid violence and sexuality live up to its title, but they're anchored with an immersive atmosphere and deep symbolism that linger long after the provocative visuals fade.\\" On Metacritic, it has an 81 out of 100 rating based on 33 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Catherine Bray of Variety wrote, \\"Suspiria meets Ginger Snaps in a muscular yet elegant campus cannibal horror from bright new talent Julia Ducournau.\\" Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film an A‚àí grade, stating, \\"The strongest of the female-led films I've screened so far at the festival is Raw, Julia Ducournau's beautifully realized, symbolically rich, and disturbingly erotic meditation on primal hungers of all kinds.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone praised the film highly, giving it a rare perfect score of 4 out of 4 stars; going so far as calling it \\"a contender for best horror movie of the decade\\".https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/raw-movie-review-its-a- modern-horror-masterpiece-w470613 For The Canadian Press, David Friend wrote from the Toronto International Film Festival that the film \\"had audiences squirming in their seats and a few queasy patrons rushing for the exits,\\" but he noted it was \\"far more than a gory horror film. Director Julia Ducournau brings a sense of humanity to the story.\\" Nick Pinkerton of Sight & Sound gave a rather lukewarm review of the movie, labeling it \\"another unwieldy metaphor bundled in showy cinematography\\", citing the movie's \\"curatorial preciousness\\" as well as an overall insistence on contrived set pieces. In December 2017, film critic Mark Kermode named Raw the best film of 2017. Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the fluidity and unpredictability of the human appetite is one of the movie‚Äôs most playful and persistent themes.\\" Awards * 2016: FIPRESCI prize in the \\"parallel sections\\" category, conferred by a jury of the International Federation of Film Critics for a film at either the Directors' Fortnight or International Critics' Week running parallel to the Cannes Film Festival. * 2016: Toronto International Film Festival, third place in the audience voting for the Grolsch People's Choice Midnight Madness Award. * 2016: Sutherland Award, for most original and imaginative first feature at the London Film Festival. * 2016: The film won two awards at the Strasbourg European Fantastic Film Festival : ** Golden Octopus of the best international fantastic movie ** Public Choice Award of the best international fantastic movie * 2016: Flanders International Film Festival Ghent : Explore Award * 2017: Prix Louis-Delluc for best first film * It received four nominations at the 8th Magritte Awards, winning Best Foreign Film in Coproduction and Best Production Design. *2018: Australian Film Critics Association nominated for Best International Film (Foreign Language).

His business is almost ruined by his ambitious general manager, George Lawrence, who in the president's absence has changed the formula of a popular patent medicine produced by the company. The president is faced with a lawsuit by a man who claims the new formula drug caused the death of his son. The president's daughter Margot becomes involved.

It was the first TV play for many of the cast. Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald thought that \\"neither the writing nor the acting... allowed deep or gripping investigation of the play ' s essential issue whether it is better to be callous and stay rich, or to be decent and plunge down to poverty....

It was broadcast live on the ABC from Sydney on the night of 24 February. In Melbourne the ABC were doing a live broadcast of the play Eye of the Night. These two were the first in a series of ten plays made by the ABC in 1960 using local writers, others including The Astronauts and The Slaughter of St Teresa's Day. (Other plays possibly included Close to the Roof, Dark Under the Sun, The Square Ring, Who Killed Kovali?, and Swamp Creatures.) Plot A murderer on the run, Chicka, stops in a remote South Australian town of Edenberrry. He kidnaps one of its women, Joan, when he thinks the town's policeman is going to arrest him. He runs off with her, punctures his petrol tank, but returns to kill her children after she runs away while he sleeps. The policeman arrives just in time to save the situation. Cast *Rod Milgate as Chicka *Benita Harvey as Joan *Deryck Barnes as policeman *Jane Coghlan *Tom Farley *Ben Gabriel *Reg Lye Production Early Australian TV drama production was dominated by using imported scripts but in 1960 the ABC was undertaking what has been described as \\"an Australiana drive\\" of producing local stories. It was the first of ten Australian television plays to be produced by the ABC in Sydney and Melbourne in 1960. The writer Denys Burrows was also an actor; it was his first TV play. He based the settings and the character on a trip he made through central Australia. \\"The township in the play and the dialogue is fictional, but the setting and characters are based on a town we passed through,\\" said Burrows. \\"I remember the place well - it was 114 degrees in the shade when we arrived there. The people were most kind and I thought at the time what a story there would be in the way they had to live the struggle. I filed the idea away in my mind and it gradually matured.\\" Burows described the town as \\"six shacks, a pub a lot of bare earth and a railway line.\\" Rod Milgate had only been acting professionally for 12 months. Benita Harvey said the role was a departure for her as \\"because of my dark features I'm usually chosen for cosmopolitan roles.\\" Outdoor scenes were to have been filmed on location south of Sydney. However on the day the crew went to film them, the sun stayed behind the clouds all day. These scenes were finally shot against a mock up background in the studio under large lamps. Reception The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"an unsuccessful attempt to graft an unconvincing crime melodrama on to a documentary treatment of outback life... The author's observation is better than his plot-planning and when the life of the remote, heat-hammered cluster of shacks was allowed to move along its normal lines and at its own pace, there were moments of genuine interest and accomplishment‚Äîexcept that the pace of Raymond Menmuir's production... tended to be a bit slow. A competent cast... worked very effectively when they were allowed by the script to be real characters.\\" References External links * *Turning Point at National Film and Sound Archive Category:1960s Australian television plays Category:1960 television plays Category:Australian films ","title":"Turning Point (1960 film)"}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function P(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),o(l,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const B=d(L,[["render",P]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/12.md","filePath":"people/12.md"}'),x={name:"people/12.md"},D=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{F as __pageData,D as default};
