Regulation of Financial Institutions eJournal: Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 5 December 2017. and a form of investor-directed venture capital fund. It launched in April 2016 after a crowdfunding campaign. By September 2016, it was delisted and had, in effect, become defunct. The DAO had an objective to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing both commercial and non-profit enterprises. It was instantiated on the Ethereum blockchain, and had no conventional management structure or board of directors. The code of the DAO is open-source. The DAO was stateless, and not tied to any particular nation state. As a result, many questions of how government regulators would deal with a stateless fund were yet to be dealt with. The DAO was crowdfunded via a token sale in May 2016, and it was one of the largest crowdfunding campaigns in history. In June 2016, users exploited a vulnerability in The DAO code to enable them to siphon off one-third of The DAO's funds to a subsidiary account. On 20 July 2016 01:20:40 PM +UTC at Block 1920000, the Ethereum community decided to hard-fork the Ethereum blockchain to restore virtually all funds to the original contract. This was controversial, and led to a fork in Ethereum, where the original unforked blockchain was maintained as Ethereum Classic, thus breaking Ethereum into two separate active blockchains, each with its own cryptocurrency. The DAO was delisted from trading on major exchanges such as Poloniex and Kraken in late 2016.  History  The computer code behind the organization was written by Christoph Jentzsch, and released publicly on GitHub. Simon Jentzsch, Christoph Jentzsch's brother, is also involved in the venture. The DAO was launched on 30 April 2016 at 01:42:58 AM +UTC on Ethereum Block 1428757,https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413#code with a website and a 28-day crowdsale to fund the organization. The token sale had raised more than by 10 May 2016, and more than -worth of Ether (ETH)‚Äîthe digital value token of the Ethereum network‚Äîby 12 May, and over by 15 May 2016. On 17 May 2016, the largest investor in the DAO held less than 4% of all DAO tokens and the top 100 holders held just over 46% of all DAO tokens. The fund's Ether value was more than , from more than 11,000 investors. As of May 2016, The DAO had attracted nearly 14% of all ether tokens issued to date.Staff, The Economist. May 21st, 2016 The DAO of accrue. A new, automated investment fund has attracted stacks of digital money Since 28 May 2016 the DAO tokens were tradable on various cryptocurrency exchanges. A paper published in May 2016 noted a number of security vulnerabilities associated with The DAO, and recommended that investors in The DAO hold off from directing The DAO to invest in projects until the problems had been resolved. An Ethereum developer on GitHub pointed out a flaw relating to \\"recursive calls\\" in early June that was picked up and blogged by Peter Vessenes, founder of the Blockchain Foundation on June 9, and by June 14, fixes had been proposed and were awaiting approval by members of The DAO. On June 16 further attention was called to recursive call vulnerabilities by bloggers affiliated with the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3). On June 17, 2016, the DAO was subjected to an attack exploiting a combination of vulnerabilities, including the one concerning recursive calls, that resulted in the transfer of 3.6 million Ether - around a third of the 11.5 million Ether that had been committed to The DAO - valued at the time at around $50M. The funds were put into an account subject to a 28-day holding period under the terms of the Ethereum contract so were not actually gone; members of The DAO and the Ethereum community debated what to do next, with some calling the attack a valid but unethical maneuver, others calling for the Ether to be re- appropriated, and some calling for The DAO to be shut down.Klint Finley for Wired. June 18, 2016 A $50 Million Hack Just Showed That The Dao Was All Too Human Eventually, the Ethereum network was hard forked to move the funds in The DAO to a recovery address where they could be exchanged back to Ethereum by their original owners. However, objectors to the hard fork continued to use the original Ethereum blockchain, now called Ethereum Classic. In September 2016 Poloniex de-listed DAO trading pairs, and in December 2016 Kraken also de-listed the token.  Operation  The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization that exists as a set of contracts among people that resides on the Ethereum blockchain; it did not have a physical address, nor people in formal management roles. The original theory underlying the DAO was that by removing delegated power from directors and placing it directly in the hands of owners the DAO removed the ability of directors and fund managers to misdirect and waste investor funds. As a blockchain-enabled organization, The DAO claimed to be completely transparent: everything was done by the code, which anyone could see and audit. However, the complexity of the code base and the rapid deployment of the DAO meant that the intended behavior of the organization and its actual behavior differed in serious ways that weren't apparent until after the attack occurred. The DAO was intended to operate as \\"a hub that disperses funds (currently in Ether, the Ethereum value token) to projects\\". Investors received voting rights by means of a digital share token; they vote on proposals that are submitted by \\"contractors\\" and a group of volunteers called \\"curators\\" check the identity of people submitting proposals and make sure the projects are legal before \\"whitelisting\\" them. The profits from the investments will then flow back to its stakeholders. The DAO did not hold the money of investors; instead, the investors owned DAO tokens that gave them rights to vote on potential projects. Anyone could pull out their funds until the time they first voted. The DAO's reliance on Ether allowed people to send their money to it from anywhere in the world without providing any identifying information. In order to provide an interface with real-world legal structures, the founders of The DAO established a Swiss-based company, DAO.Link, registered as a Soci√©t√© √† responsabilit√© limit√©e (SARL) in Switzerland, apparently co-founded by Slock.it and Neuchatel-based digital currency exchange Bity SA. According to Jentzsch, DAO. Link is in Switzerland because Swiss law allows it to \\"take money from an unknown source as long as you know where it's going.\\" Marketing In May 2016, TechCrunch described The DAO as \\"a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organization. ... It offers complete transparency, total shareholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and autonomous governance.\\" Risks In May 2016, the plan called for The DAO to invest Ether in ventures it would back (contractors) and to receive in return \\"clear payment terms\\" from contractors. The organizers of the DAO promoted the DAO as providing investors in the DAO a return on their investment via those \\"clear payment terms\\" and they warned investors there is \\"significant risk\\" that the ventures funded by the DAO may fail. Risks included unknown attack vectors and programming errors. Additional risks noted included the lack of precedence in regulatory and corporate law; how governments and their regulatory agencies would treat The DAO and contracts it made was unknown. There was also a risk that there would be no corporate veil protecting investors from individual legal and financial liability for actions taken by The DAO and by contractors in which The DAO invested. It was unclear if The DAO was selling securities, and if it was, what type of securities those might be. Additionally, to function in the real world, contractors would likely need to convert the invested Ether into real-world currencies. In May 2016, attorney Andrew Hinkes said that those sales of Ether would be likely to depress the value of Ether. The code behind The DAO had several safeguards that aimed to prevent its creators or anyone else from mechanically gaming the voting of shareholders to win investments. However, this would not prevent the making of fraudulent profitability projections, and in addition, a paper cited a \\"number of security vulnerabilities\\".Popper N. \\"Paper Points Up Flaws in Venture Fund Based on Virtual Money.\\" New York Times May 27, 2016 Proposals Slock.it (a German Blockchain venture), and Mobotiq (a French electric vehicle start-up) were listed as seeking potential funding on the daohub.org website during the May \\"creation period\\". Both Jentzsch brothers are involved in Slock.it as well. Regulation On 25 July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published a report on initial coin offerings (ICOs) and The DAO, examining \\"whether The DAO and associated entities and individuals violated federal securities laws with unregistered offers and sales of DAO Tokens in exchange for 'Ether,' a virtual currency.\\" The SEC concluded that DAO tokens sold on the Ethereum blockchain were securities and therefore possible violations of U.S. securities laws.

Rigi was extracted from a passenger jet on his way from Dubai, United Arab Emirates to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence had tracked Rigi's movements for five months before arresting him.  Abdolmalek Rigi  Abdolmalek Rigi () was the leader of Jundallah, a terrorist group based in the Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.  Arrest operation  There are two conflicting versions of Rigi's arrest. According to the Iranian government, after visiting United States military base in Afghanistan on 23 February 2010, Rigi with forged Afghan passport, was passenger of the flight which traveled from Dubai, United Arab Emirates to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. When the plane arrived to Persian Gulf, Iranian fighter jets interrupted its way that confirmed by Bishkek airport. The Iranian jets told to land in Iranian territory and added that \\"a number of foreign passengers were forcibly removed.\\" Therefore, the plane landed in the Bandar Abbas International Airport and all passengers took down. After that Iranian forces identified Rigi and arrested him. Other people got on the plane and Iran government gave a gift to the passengers for apologizing the delay.

According to a former U.S. intelligence officer, on the other hand, Rigi was captured by Pakistani officials and delivered to Iran with U.S. support: \\"It doesn't matter what they say. They know the truth.\\" The United States has denied the Iranian version and denounced all claims that western intelligence organizations have supported Jundullah.  In the popular media  Jazeera Satellite Channel announced Rigi was arrested in Pakistan while Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar, interior minister, said: \\"Abdolmalek Rigi was arrested outside Iran while he was traveling somewhere and was transferred to Iran.\\" He said to Press TV that Rigi was arrested Tuesday on a flight from Dubai to Kyrgyzstan.

We don't have a military plan against Iran. Attacking Iran is very difficult for us (the U.S.). They (Americans) promised to help us (Jundullah) and they said that they would co-operate with us, free our prisoners and would give us military equipment, bombs, machine guns, and they would give us a base.\\" He declared that he had had a meeting with a senior person at Manas United States military base in Kyrgyzstan when he was captured. Rigi's confession of American support was possibly coerced.

History  = Wigger counts = It probably began with Count Wigger I, whose name is recorded from 967 to 981 AD as having extensive comital rights and estates in the Germarmark march on the middle Werra (the area of Frieda and Eschwege), at Hainich (Bad Langensalza, Schlotheim, M√ºhlhausen and Oberdorla) and in the Obereichsfeld. (Abschnitt zur ¬´Erphol-Schenkung¬ª) The fragmented estates of Count Wigger extended via Dornburg an der Saale as far as the area of Zeitz, where he is mentioned from 965‚Äì981 as the Margrave of Zeitz. Along with the Ekkehardiners, the counts of Kevernburg, the counts of Schwarzburg and counts of Weimar the Wiggers were a powerful comital family in Thuringia in the 10th to 12th centuries. = Counts of Bilstein = From about 1130, their descendants called themselves after their family seat, Bilstein Castle, in the H√∂llental valley west of Albungen, today a village in the borough of Eschwege. This castle had probably been built by them around 1100. In this period they came into military conflict with the counts of Northeim, who around 1105/1110 had defeated Count Rugger (R√ºdiger) I of Bilstein and destroyed the first, still weakly fortified Bielstein Castle. His successor, Rugger II of Bilstein, asserted himself with the construction of the new Bilstein Castle and began to develop the land around the castle, the woods on the Hoher Mei√üner, as, as \\"clearing demesne. For this purpose he also founded Germerode Abbey, which became the family abbey of the dynasty. The descriptive family name, the Bilsteiners, was later appended even to the early members of the house. = Burgraves = In the 12th century, the Ludovingians needed to place all responsibility for the management of the castle of Wartburg, particularly its security and the improvement of the fortifications, into the hands of an authorised representative. This person held the office of Burgrave of the Wartburg. With the appointment of the counts of Wartburg, who appear at the same time in the 13th century as the burgraves of Brandenburg at the neighbouring Brandenburg Castle, a side line of the counts of Bilstein were elevated to high status, although they were not related by blood to the Ludowingian family. = Decline and end = In 1301, Count Otto II of Bilstein, with the consent of his wife, Catharina, sold the Bilstein fief and subsequently also his allodial estate to Landgrave Henry I of Hesse.Deed dated 14 May 1301 in the Marburg State Archives: Count Otto of Bilstein sold to Landgrave Henry his enfeoffed estates in (Lower) Hesse (Hassia) from the rivers Werra (Gewerra) to the Forest of Hecheno . With his death in 1306 the comital line came to an end. = Links to other aristocratic families = There is evidence that the counts of Bilstein were related to the lords of Bilstein in Westphalia. According to the Reinhardsbrunn Chronicle by monk, Johannes Caput, from Ilfeld Abbey an Elger of Bilstein on the Werra built the Ilburg and called himself the Count of Ilfeld. In 1162 a nobleman of Ilfeld married Lutrude of Hohnstein and called himself thereafter Ilfeld-Hohnstein and, from 1182, just von Hohnstein.Counts of Honstein-Ilfeld at Genealogie- Mittelalter.de  Bearers of the name  * Wigger I (962), Margrave of the Germarmark (around M√ºhlhausen) * Wigger II * Rugger I (1071), had comital rights in Martinfeld (near Heiligenstadt) * Rugger II, Count of Bilstein, founded Germerode Abbey * Otto II of Bilstein was the last male member of the family line.

In the approach to the tragic events (and during the trial) he was known by his military title of Major Alexander Gordon Kinloch (close acquaintances call him Major Gordon). Through the greatest of ironies, due to the murder, Kinloch was thereafter entitled \\"Sir\\". Although the term is not used during his trial, it is one of the first recorded instances of Diminished responsibility due to mental instability. The case also set parameters for the use and validity of notes taken by witnesses in use as testimony.Cobbett's State Trials, Thomas Bayly Howell He therefore became a baronet on 16 April 1795http://www.thepeerage.com/p49127.htm#i491265 the day of his victim's death. The entirety of his baronetcy was spent either in prison or under house arrest, neither being a barrier to his legal rights to the title of Baronet. His trial included many prominent legal and medical persons of late 18th century Edinburgh society. Life He was the son of Sir David Kinloch, 5th baronet of Gilmerton (1710‚Äì1795) (son of Sir Francis Kinloch, 3rd Baronet) and his wife Harriet Cockburn (d. 1757) daughter of Sir Archibald Cockburn, an advocate.http://www.thepeerage.com/p49127.htm#i491262 His year of birth is unclear, but as the younger brother of Sir Francis Kinloch (b. 1747) is presumed to be around 1749. He served as an Ensign in the 65th Regiment in Ireland in 1767 and there befriended the much older Major John MacKay who remained a lifelong friend. In 1773 he joined his regiment in Halifax, Nova Scotia.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 78 In 1778 he was a Captain in the 65th Regiment based in Coxheath, Nova Scotia. During this stay he befriended Lt (later Lt Col) Samuel Twentyman of the 18th Regiment. In the autumn of 1779 Archibald was promoted to Major, and Twentyman joined his regiment in sailing to the West Indies. In 1779/1780 Archibald spent much time in St. Lucia in the West Indies and together with several thousand others (many of whom died) caught a fever (generally called St.Lucia Fever), after which his disposition changed greatly, to the concern of all his family. He is recorded (at an unclear date) of having been once confined to the Edinburgh Bedlam for insanity. His mood was said to worsen with alcohol. In 1783 Twentyman remet him in Lincoln and considered him much changed. Major MacKay met him in London in the same year and was of the same opinion. In 1785 MacKay met him again, also meeting his father Sir David Kinloch and ill-fated brother, Francis, all on a visit to a Mr and Mrs Dalrymple of North Berwick for an evening of whist. In September 1789, back in Scotland, he is noted in having been in an odd incident where he severely cut his own hand with a pocket-knife whilst in a carriage in the Grassmarket in Edinburgh (blaming it on broken glass in the carriage though none existed). Dr William Farquharson attended him and visited him for two months as he recovered, describing him as \\"deranged\\", but seemingly gaining some degree of friendship or empathy.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 99 In the summer of 1790 Kinloch left Gilmerton House in the middle of the night and travelled to Greenock on the west coast of Scotland to track down his friend, Major MacKay, who was much surprised to see him.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 76 In October 1790 he is again in London but invites a friend (Cpt Miller) to join him in a hotel on the Oxford Road but is not there. He is tracked down at Old Slaughter's Coffee House on St Martins Lane. He returned to Scotland after a visit to Cpt Miller's recruiting office in Huntingdon in November 1790. He was dressed in black to mourn the recent death of his eldest brother, Cpt David Kinloch (mentioned in few genealogies but the original heir-apparent to the baronetcy).The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 80 On 1 April 1794 the same doctor saw him again (on North Bridge) and thought him likely to harm himself. He saw him later that year in irons in Haddington jail, and considered him further disturbed. He is recorded in having struck Francis in the face over an argument at his father's dining table, prior to his father's death, wounding Francis badly. Francis is said to have forgiven him. His father, Sir David died at Gilmerton House (in the presence of all his children) on 18 February 1795 precipitating a bizarre series of events. Firstly the baronetcy passed to Sir Francis Kinloch, his eldest son, then becoming 6th baronet. Archibald is stated as having been dissatisfied by his settlement within the will (receiving only ¬£1300 of ¬£1500 he thought due). On 1 April Kinloch was greeted at his Edinburgh lodgings in the Black Bull Tavern on Leith Street, by Dr James Home. They ate at Hunters on Writers Court (near St Giles Cathedral) together with his younger brother, Alexander Kinloch. Archibald is said to have \\"only\\" drunk one or two gills of brandy (around half a pint!)The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p.94 On 13 April Kinloch was seen by an acquaintance travelling in a chaise to Haddington, where his brother Sir Francis Kinloch lived. He was seen again in Mrs Fairbairn's restaurant in Haddington but appeared (and declared himself) very ill. Kinloch returned to Gilmerton with the two men (including Dr George Somner) he had met in the restaurant (each in their own chaise), but a mile from Gilmerton the carriages paused for the men to urinate and Kinloch began walking back to Haddington. His carriage driver went to find him and did not return, having been then ordered to take him to Haddington, however he was instead returned to Gilmerton House. Kinloch was seen holding a pistol in his room there and declared himself very ill..Cobbett's State Trials, Thomas Bayly Howell On the morning of 14 April (at 5 am) Kinloch was seen wandering in Beanston Wood near his home. He said he was planting. He later barricaded himself into his room and did not emerge until 5 pm, demanding laudanum because he wished to sleep and not wake. He was seen to be carrying two pistols.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 85 On the evening of 14 April 1795 Sir Francis Kinloch travelled from his home at Athelstaneford (near Haddington) to visit Archibald at Gilmerton House, recently inherited from their father. He dined with Archibald (as host) and a few other men, including a George Somner. The group as a whole sat until 3 am. Archibald appears to have arisen from in his bed-chamber, half-dressed, and confronted Sir Francis on the stair. He came down with two loaded pistols in his pockets. He fired one, hitting Francis in the chest as he stood on the staircase. He was taken to his room where the men tried to tend him, and had to escort his sister, Harriet Kinlkoch, back to her room. Francis was mortally wounded, but was fully conscious and it was he who summoned a doctor, through an \\"expressed\\" (couriered) letter. Dr James Home and Dr Francis Home were called from their home at Foulis Close in EdinburghEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1795 arriving at 9:30 am but could do little to assist. Archibald was placed in a strait jacket, already in the house, and put into the care of a nurse. Dr Benjamin Bell arrived from Edinburgh at some point during the day and extracted the bullet whilst Francis was still alive. The bullet had passed most of the way through the body and was extracted from the back, near the spine.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 35 Sir Francis had a slow and painful death, dying at 11 pm on the evening of 16 April some 44 hours after the shooting. However, he had expressed to those present a deep regret for his poor brother, and seemed to lay no blame on his shoulders. He had specifically requested that the authorities not be contacted. However, Archibald was placed in Haddington Jail on 16 April, escorted there by Hay Smith WS. He was visited in jail by Dr George Somner, Dr Home and Rev Goldie. He was moved to the Edinburgh Tolbooth on 24 April. On 18 April three doctors confirmed and certified the death: Benjamin Bell and James Home of Edinburgh and Dr George Somner of Haddington (presumably Sir Francis' personal physician). It is unclear why this postdated the death by 36 hours). Archibald was arrested on 30 May and placed in the Tolbooth Prison on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, adjacent to the Scottish High Courts. The two pistols, inscribed by the maker H. W. Mortimer of London, and the ball taken from Francis' body were held as evidence. The trial The trial took place on 30 June 1795 in the Edinburgh High Court. The jury comprised 15 men from the Edinburgh area, including several \\"gentlemen\\" to best equate to peers of the baronet.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother- German, 1795, p. 10 The trial was held under Lord Justice Clerk, Robert McQueen, Lord Braxfield, presiding over: David Rae, Lord Eskgrove; William Nairne, Lord Dunsinane; John Swinton, Lord Swinton; and William Craig, Lord Craig.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 1 The prosecution was led by Robert Dundas of Arniston. Robert Blair (later Lord Avontoun) was Solicitor General, John Burnet was Advocate and Hugh Warrender was Agent. For the defence David Hume led Kinloch's defence team, aided by three further advocates: Charles Hope (later Lord Granton); William Rae; and David Monypenny (later Solicitor General for Scotland.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 2 Kinloch pleaded not guilty after the reading of the charge of murder. His brother-in- lawhttps://www.geni.com/people/Harriet-Cunliffe/6000000007456715809 Sir Foster Cunliffe, and cousin, James Wilkie of Foulden, stood with him through the trial..Cobbett's State Trials, Thomas Bayly Howell Witnesses (family, friends and servants) attested to Archibald's insanity but, in general, the medical witnesses did not consider him insane. Much blame was placed on the servants for not being there to assist in the disarming of Archibald. Curiously, contrary to standard client-lawyer privileges, Charles Hay WS, Sir Francis Kinloch's lawyer, was asked to disclose private conversations both as a friend and in his professional capacity. He had last seen him on 12 or 13 March. He intimated that Sir Francis had gone through his father's papers (after he died) with lawyers, to separate the important from the unimportant, but on burning the latter, was accused by Archibald of prejudicing the younger members of the family (including himself). This had led to a growing resentment. Mr Hay had written a legal opinion to the effect that the settlement made to the younger siblings exceeded the legal requirements and did not require further legal investigation. This had not satisfied Archibald who felt cheated, and considered that he was still owed ¬£200. This appears to be the underlying cause of the attack. He further suspected Francis of trying to poison him with pills on the day before the attack.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother- German, 1795, p. 38 A large amount of the evidence circled around financial matters between Sir Gordon and other parties and of little if any relevance to the murder. Two of the main witnesses, his brother Alexander and sister Harriet, were excused the need to give evidence, it considered to be \\"too distressing\\"..The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 80 The Lord Justice in his summary asked the jury to consider whether the acts might be the result of madness as a malady or temporary madness caused by drunkenness. He clarified that the law saw drunken madness as a \\"voluntary contracted madness\\" requiring judgement as though the person be in their right senses.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother- German, 1795, p. 123 It was not disputed that a murder had occurred, the issue was to consider If Archibald was insane at the time.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 150 The jury, led by Andrew Wauchope, found Kinloch guilty, but was considered temporarily insane.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 152 The judgement was read by the Lord Justice Clerk on 15 July 1795. The accused (referred to in the trial as the 'pannel') was unanimously declared guilty. However, they declared him insane and 'not an object of punishment'. This saved him from the death penalty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Tolbooth. An odd rider on the sentence allowed any person to secure his release on payment of ¬£10,000 and on upon promise of holding him securely in another place (effectively allowing a house arrest).The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother-German, 1795, p. 155 Dr William Farquharson approached Lord Braxfield on 17 July and successfully secured Kinloch's release into his own care.The Trial of Sir Archibald Gordon Kinloch for the Murder of Sir Francis Kinloch his Brother- German, 1795, p. 158 It is not clear if the required bond was paid. If so it equates to around ¬£5million by current (2016) standards. Death Worlds End Close, Edinburgh Kinloch went to live with Farquharson at his house at Worlds End Close on the Royal Mile.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1795 Farquharson disappears from the Edinburgh Post Office Directory soon thereafter, presumably choosing a less urban environment for this onerous task of caring for Kinloch. Archibald died in 1800, presumably in Farquharson's house (given the requirements of the judgement). At this point, his younger brother, Sir Alexander Kinloch (Sandie) became the 8th baronet and the Kinloch baronetcy returned to normality.

It was set up by the family of Josh Carrick, who died of the disease in October 2011 at the age of 23. Josh Carrick Josh Carrick, from Luton, was the son of Steve and Arlene Carrick and the twin brother of Dominic. He was a computer science graduate from the University of Nottingham who was offered his dream job at IBM shortly before his diagnosis. He initially felt a backache in August 2010, attributing it to a long drive. When it did not ease, he had tests which suggested a kidney infection and was prescribed antibiotics, but in September an x-ray diagnosed testicular cancer. Twelve weeks later, after chemotherapy, he was free of symptoms, but by February 2011 they began again. Around Easter it was discovered that the cancer had metastasised to his spine and brain; stronger chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant ended the cancer for a second time. He then had monthly blood tests, and the September one showed that the disease was now incurable. He died in October. Foundation The charity was set up in October 2012, and had raised ¬£50,000 by October 2013. By March 2016 it had raised more than ¬£300,000. It works together with Cancer Research UK, IBM, and the University of Nottingham. IBM offers ¬£100 to the best first-year student in the University's Computer Science department, and offers visits to their laboratories for the top five. The money raised for Cancer Research UK has funded a study on the link between testicular cancer survivors and cardiovascular disease, and a laboratory for a metastasis specialist. A bicycle ride from London to Brighton raised ¬£22,000. British Prime Minister David Cameron awarded Steve and Arlene Carrick the 496th and 497th Points of Light, a daily award for charity fundraisers. The charity has been highlighted in national newspapers. It was the charity of choice at the 2015 RESI Awards.

The parish has collaborated in various grassroots initiatives to combat adverse social conditions in the area, including Homeboy Industries, Proyecto Pastoral at Dolores Mission, CHIRLA, and the East Los Angeles Housing Coalition. History The church began as a mission in St. Mary's parish in 1925 and in 1945 moved to its present site, renamed ‚ÄúThe Mission of Nuestra Senora de los Dolores\\". In 1946, the Canonnesses of St. Augustine (later named the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) came from Belgium to open the first Catholic school in the neighborhood in 1952. After 1980, the Belgians were no longer able to staff Dolores Mission and the Jesuits, at the invitation of Cardinal Manning, came to this parish. The Jesuits took as their goal to empower parishioners to exercise leadership and to build community. Since then various grassroots organizations have sprouted and grown in the parish. From 1986 to 1992, its pastor was Greg Boyle, who is also the fonder of Homeboy Industries. Projects The \\"Projects\\" were founded after 1986 when the California Province of Jesuits was entrusted with the parish. Under community leadership, five organizations were formed providing training, education, and social services in the Pico-Aliso/Boyle Heights district of East Los Angeles. * IMPACTO (Imaginando Ma√±ana Pico-Aliso Community Team Outreach) is a safe, after-school facility.

He rose from humble beginnings as a carpenter to have a major influence on ironworks at Cyfartha and Pontypool and is responsible for the design of early cast-iron bridges. Early life Little is known about George's early life except that he was born in Trevethin around 1759 and that his father, who was also called Watkin George, died in 1787. Career Again, little is known about George's early career but from about 1790 to 1794 he was possibly working on iron girder bridges over the Glamorganshire Canal. He was made a partner in Cyfartha ironworks in 1792 by the owner Richard Crawshay. The works expanded over the next few years, developing Henry Cort's puddling process, to become the largest ironworks in the world by 1806. During this period Watkin George also constructed or designed Pont-y-Cafnau (1792-93 - an iron tramway bridge and aqueduct), Gwynne water aqueduct (1793-96 - a timber trestle structure 185m long, part of which ran over Pont-y-Cafnau), Melingriffith water pump (1793-1795), Aeolus waterwheel (1793-97 - a 50 ft diameter cast iron waterwheel), the Merthyr Bridge (1799-1800 - a single shallow arch of cast iron), and Ynysfach Ironworks (1801 - the two blast furnaces bore his initials). Around 1805 Watkin George left Cyfartha to become a partner at Pontypool Ironworks where he undertook a number of changes including the demolition of a wire works at Pontymoile, a new tinplate works and waterwheel at Pontymoile and two tinplate works at Lower Mill, near Pontymoile. After George left Cyfartha he was described later (1807) as having ...\\"lately quitted the concern with from thirty to forty thousand pounds in his pocket. This is one among the most remarkable instances of wealth acquired by the untutored ingenuity of the natural faculties.\\" The partnership with Capel Hanbury Leigh at Pontypool proved successful and after the first two years George received ¬£8,300 in profits. In 1811 George submitted plans for a bridge at Chepstow. The bridge was eventually built to a design by John Rastrick in 1816. Family life On 20 September 1789 George married Anne Jenkins (1760-1845, also from Trevethin) at Llanhilleth. They had two or three children, Hannah (1793) Anne (1794) and Watkin (1795). Watkin George died on 10 August 1822 and is buried at St Cadoc's Church, Trevethin. Legacy Pont-y-Cafnau and Melingriffith Water Pump both survive and are scheduled monuments (Pont-y-Cafnau is also a Grade II* listed building). The Iron Bridge at Merthyr was dismantled in 1963. The remaining parts are stored at Cyfarthfa Castle.

Sankaran Nair (1919‚Äì2015), known as Colonel Menon among his colleagues, was an Indian civil servant, diplomat and the director of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the apex intelligence agency in India. He served as the Indian High Commissioner to Singapore from 1986 to 1988 and was the last member of the Indian Imperial Police. He was reported to have played a crucial role in the formation of Bangladesh, through RAW operations during the Bangladesh Liberation War. His memoirs, Inside IB and RAW: A Rolling Stone that Gathered Moss, published in 2008 made news for the insider details it contained about two of the highest intelligence agencies in India. The Government of India awarded him the third highest civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1983, for his contributions to society.  Biography  1971 Instrument of Surrender ‚Äì Bangladesh Liberation War. Sankaran Nair was born on 20 December 1919 at Ottapalam, in Palakkad district of the south Indian state of Kerala and did his graduate studies at Loyola College, Chennai. Subsequently, he pursued studies in Law but abandoned it midway when he was inducted into the Indian Imperial Police. After the Indian independence, he continued at the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and, in 1959, went to Ghana to successfully complete the IB assignment of establishing Ghana Intelligence Agency, returning to India after two years. In the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, he was involved in the investigations against Intelligence Bureau on allegations of ineptitude, and was reported to have submitted 65 reports to the investigation committee. When Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was formed in 1968 as a splinter agency of IB, Nair became the deputy of Rameshwar Nath Kao, the founder director of the agency. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, he was in-charge of the operations there and his contributions in training the Mukti Bahini guerrillas are reported to have played a vital role in the successful liberation of Bangladesh. After Kao's resignation from RAW service in 1977 (reports suggest that he was forced to demit office), Nair succeeded him as the director but his tenure lasted only three months as he resigned from the post, reportedly in protest, when Morarji Desai, the then Prime Minister of India, downgraded the position of the director of RAW from rank of a Cabinet Secretary. He was moved to Minority Commission as its secretary from where he superannuated in December 1978. However, he was involved with RAW operations again with the accession of Indira Gandhi to power again in 1980, and was known to have contributed to the restructuring of the agency. In 1981, he was given the responsibility of the Secretary General of the 1982 Asian Games and four years later, in 1986, he was appointed as the High Commissioner of India to Singapore, holding the post till his retirement from active service in 1988. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1983. In 2008, he published his memoirs, Inside IB and RAW: The Rolling Stone that Gathered Moss, which narrated his official life at Intelligence Bureau and Research and Analysis Wing and the book featured many notable personalities such as Sanjay Gandhi, Morarji Desai, V. C. Shukla, Indira Gandhi, R. N. Kao, Y. B. Chavan and Rajiv Gandhi. The book discussed about the lapses during the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Indo- Pakistan War of 1965 as well as several inside information in Indian politics and reportedly made news. He died on 17 November 2015 at his daughter's residence in Bengaluru where he spent his last years, at the age of 95, survived by the daughter; his wife had preceded him in death three years earlier.

Nomenclature  The District of Neales was named in honour of John Bentham Neales, a politician regarded as the \\"Father of Mining\\" in South Australia. History Neales Flat once had three Lutheran churches. They have combined and only one congregation continues, and combines services with the church at nearby Peep Hill. It is now part of the \\"Eudunda Robertstown Lutheran Parish\\", which includes Lutheran churches at Robertstown, Point Pass, Geranium Plains, Eudunda, Neales Flat and Peep Hill. The first Lutheran people in the district were from the Immannuel Synod and met in homes from 1871, building St Stephan's Lutheran Church in 1874. The congregation of St Paul built its own building a few kilometres further west, also in 1874, followed by a larger building next door (north side) in 1893 with the original building used as a school. The school became a government school in 1917 and closed in 1942. The school building was used by the St John's congregation from 1894 until that congregation built its own building in 1912 immediately south of the school. With union of the Synods in 1967, St John's and St Paul's combined in the St Paul's building as Trinity Lutheran Church. In 2009, St Stephan's merged with Trinity and formed Neales Flat Lutheran Church, meeting in the reconsecrated St John's building. A single cemetery lies behind these two church buildings.

DApps have been popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as the Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts. DApps can be found on centralized marketplaces such as State of the DApps, Dapp.com, Holdex, DAppRadar and CoinGecko. Characteristics DApps have their backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network, as opposed to typical applications where the backend code is running on centralized servers. A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm or IPFS. DApps are typically open source, decentralized, incentivized through providing tokens to those who validate the DApp, and in compliance with a specific protocol agreed upon within the community. Deployment DApps may run on top of distributed computing systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Decentralized applications are stored on and executed by a blockchain system. Steem created a well-established ecosystem that leads to the widespread adoption of DApp development. There are large number of DApps that are serving well in various industries. Examples are Steem Monsters, dMania, Steemblr, Musing and SteemHunt etc. Adoption There have been criticisms of DApps surrounding their inaccessibility to the average user. Many DApps struggle to attract users, particularly in their founding stages, and even those that attract widespread initial popularity struggle to retain it. A notable example was the DApp CryptoKitties, which crashed the Ethereum network at the height of its popularity https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual- cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/.

Opening The line was opened in stages, the first section Sulech√≥w - Wolsztyn was opened on 1 April 1905. Three months later, the line was extended to Grodzisk Wielkopolski. In July 1909 an extension was opened to Lubon. Closure The single-track line between Sulech√≥w and Wolsztyn operated by Lubuska Regional Railways was closed to passenger services in 1994. In 2001 freight traffic on the line was suspended and in 2005 the line was closed. Currently, this section is impassable in several places due to missing tracks, in Okuninie and on the section between Chwalim - Kargowa. In 2015, the track between Sulech√≥w - Powodowo was completely removed. Modernisation On 14 March 2011 the first stage of modernisation of the line between Wolsztyn and Poznan started. New tracks and sleepers were put in place, new platforms were built at Stƒôszew, Szreniawa and Wiry, railway crossings were modernised and a new signalling centre to control the trains on the line opened. This work was carried out within the framework of the Wielkopolska Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013, financed by European Regional Development Fund and national funds. Renovation of the 73 kilometers of tracks cost 84 million zloty, 70% of this amount accounted for financing from EU funds under the Wielkopolska Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2007-2013. After the modernization the trains can pass this route at a speed of 110 km per hour. The line from Wolsztyn to Poznan was modernised under the supervision of a conservator as the modernisation efforts were made to preserve the historical appearance of the line on which passenger connections were operated by steam engines. For the duration of the works related to the modernisation of the railway line was closed, and services were serviced by bus replacement. On 11 December 2011, with the change of timetable of trains on the route, a direct rail service was restored. Since 14 December 2014 trains stop at the new station of GrƒÖblewo.

Originally formed in March 1918 for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force, it was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. The battalion consisted of four machine gun companies, which had previously existed as independent companies assigned mainly at brigade level. The battalion took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. The battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF following the conclusion of hostilities. During World War II, the battalion was re-raised as part of the Militia in September 1942, and undertook garrison duties in the Torres Strait, until it was disbanded in May 1944. History Originally raised for service during World War I as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the 5th Machine Gun Battalion was one of five such units raised as part of the AIF during the war. The battalion was formed in March 1918 from Australian Machine Gun Corps personnel, and consisted of four machine gun companies ‚Äì the 8th, 14th, 15th, and 25th ‚Äì which had previously existed as independent companies assigned at brigade and divisional level. Major Alan Herbert Wright served as the battalion's first commanding officer, in an acting capacity until Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Roy Marsden arrived in April. The establishment of machine gun battalions within the AIF was the final step in the evolution of the organisation of direct fire support during the war. At the start of the war, Maxim machine guns had been assigned within line infantry battalions on a limited scale of two per battalion. As it was realised that there was a need for increased fire support, this was later increased to four guns per battalion, operated by a section of one officer and 32 other ranks. At the end of the Gallipoli Campaign, the AIF was reorganised and expanded in preparation for its transfer to the Western Front, and the machine gun sections within each infantry battalion had been consolidated into companies assigned at brigade level. The first three of the battalion's constituent companies had been formed in Egypt in March 1916 and at that time they had been assigned to the 8th, 14th and 15th Brigades respectively, arriving in Europe in mid-1916. These companies had fought through the early battles following the Australians' arrival in Europe, including Fromelles, Bullecourt, Polygon Wood and Ypres. The 25th Machine Gun Company, however, had been formed in England in February 1917 after the decision was made to assign an extra company at divisional level so that each division had four companies, and in September 1917, the company was assigned to the 5th Division, arriving in France at the end of the month. The battalion was equipped with a total of 64 Vickers medium machine guns ‚Äì assigned at a scale of 16 per company ‚Äì and took part in the final stages of the war, seeing action during the Allied defensive operations during the German Spring Offensive and then the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, which finally brought an end to the war. During these battles, the battalion was employed to provide enfilade fire in defence, and plunging fire in support of attacking infantry forces, engaging targets out to . Due to the exposed position from which the machine gunners fired, they suffered heavy casualties. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the battalion was disbanded in mid-1919 during the demobilisation of the AIF. Upon formation in 1918, the battalion had adopted a vertical black and gold rectangle unit colour patch (UCP), which was usually worn above the crossed guns badge of the Machine Gun Corps. While the battalion's constituent companies had previously been issued distinctive UCPs, upon the formation of the battalion these were replaced by the single battalion patch. The black and gold colours were chosen to signify that the unit as a machine gun unit, while the vertical rectangle showed that the 5th Machine Gun Battalion was part of the 5th Division, which used the same shape UCP for the majority of its units. Legacy In the inter-war years, the machine gun battalion concept was discontinued in the Australian Army, and in the 1920s medium machine gun platoons were added to the organisation of standard infantry battalions. According to Alexander Rodger, as a result of the decision not to re-raise machine gun battalions in the early interwar years, no battle honours were subsequently awarded to the 5th Machine Gun Battalion ‚Äì or any other World War I machine gun battalion ‚Äì as there was no equivalent unit to perpetuate the honours when they were promulgated by the Australian Army in 1927. Nevertheless, the machine gun battalion concept was revived again in 1937 as fears of war in Europe surfaced again, and four Australian Light Horse regiments ‚Äì the 1st, 16th, 17th and 18th ‚Äì were converted into machine gun regiments. Following the outbreak of World War II, four machine gun battalions were raised as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force, each assigned at divisional level. Several more units were raised within the Militia including the 6th and 7th Machine Gun Battalions, which served in New Guinea, and several more light horse regiments were also converted for garrison duties, including the 14th, 19th, 25th and 26th. For its part, the 5th Machine Gun Battalion was re-raised in August/September 1942 amidst the backdrop of the Japanese advance in the Pacific and fighting in New Guinea. Formed as a Militia unit at Landsborough, Queensland, it was equipped with 48 Vickers medium machine guns, and drew its personnel from the machine gun companies originally assigned to the 33rd, 45th, 46th, 52nd and 59th Infantry Battalions. When it was re-raised in 1942, the 5th Machine Gun Battalion adopted a new colour patch: a black, green and gold triangle. Defensive duties were undertaken in south-east Queensland throughout 1942, before the battalion was ordered to proceed to the Torres Strait in January 1943. There, they undertook garrison duties as part of Torres Strait Force, replacing the 62nd Infantry Battalion, which was redeployed to Merauke. The battalion remained there until July 1944, when it was relieved by the 26th Infantry Battalion and returned to mainland Australia. It was disbanded in September 1944 at Glenfield, New South Wales. At the end of that war, the decision was made to return medium machine guns to the establishment of individual infantry battalions. Consequently, since then no further machine gun battalions have been raised as part of the Australian Army.

Two theories are that: the temple was located outside Melite (a Roman city) as it was Greek not Roman; and that close by in Mtarfa there was the Temple of Zeus. Persephone was the daughter of Zeus. However the restoration marble refers to the temple as of Proserpina not Persephone. in Cult and continuity. () was a Roman temple in Mtarfa, Malta, an area which was originally a suburb outside the walls of Melite. It was dedicated to Proserpina, goddess of the underworld and renewal. The date of construction is unknown, but it was renovated in the 1st century BC or AD. The ruins of the temple were discovered in 1613, and most of its marble blocks were later used in the decoration of buildings, including Auberge d'Italie and the Castellania in Valletta. Only a few fragments still survive today. History and architecture The only epigraphic evidence of the temple is the Chrestion inscription, which was discovered among its ruins in 1613. It records that the temple was already old and was threatening to collapse during the reign of Augustus in the 1st century BC or AD, and it was restored by Chrestion, the procurator of the Maltese Islands. This inscription is the earliest known Latin text that was found in Malta. It read: The temple was built out of marble and its columns were in the Corinthian order. If still in use by the 4th century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Discovery of remains and destruction The Statue of Saint Nicholas of Bari now stands on the site of the temple. The statue is on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands (NICPMI). A chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas was eventually built near the site of the temple. In 1613, while digging the foundations for a statue of that saint near the chapel, many large blocks of marble from the temple were found, together with pillars, cornices, capitals and carved slabs including the Chrestion inscription. The chapel no longer exists, but the statue of St. Nicholas still stands on the site of the temple. The discovery of the temple was recorded by Giovanni Francesco Abela in his 1647 book Della Descrizione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichit√†, ed Altre Notizie. Over the following centuries, most of the remains of the temple were used in the construction of new buildings. In the 1680s, some marble blocks were used to carve the trophy of Gregorio Carafa above the main entrance of Auberge d'Italie in Valletta. The fa√ßade of the Castellania, which was built in the late 1750s, also contains marble cannibalized from the Temple of Proserpina. The temple was a very frequented site by almost all archeologist on the islands in the 19th century.The historical guide to the island of Malta and its dependencies. p. 68-69. In A hand book, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta, written by Thomas MacGill in 1839, it is mentioned that \\"not a vestige of [the temple] remains above ground\\", but some fragments were found at the Public Library in Valletta. The archaeologist Antonio Annetto Caruana examined the site of the temple in 1882, and found no remains except for some holes dug in the rock. He recorded that some capitals, pillars and cornices were piled up in the square in front of the Mdina cathedral, while other remains were found in the private collection of Mr. Sant Fournier.

Vicente Giner was already in Rome in May 1672, as at that time he is recorded granting his nephew Jos√© Giner a general power to sell on his behalf any of his assets. His nephew, the son of a brother of unknown name, appears on the document as absent. This is regarded as evidence that at the time he had already left Spain and was therefore granting his nephew full authority to manage his estate in Spain. Giner stated that at the time he was living at a house in the Roman administrative district of Campo Marzio. Giner was closely linked with and possibly studied with the prominent architectural painter Viviano Codazzi who had moved to Rome from Naples in 1648.Niccolo CODAZZI, Two architectural capricci at Galerie Heim He possibly painted figures in the architectural compositions of Codazzi. He also painted the figures for Codazzi's son Niccol√≤ while the latter worked in his father's studio. This collaboration is evidenced by the Saint Peter Baptizing the centurion and the Arch of Titus (At Jean-Fran√ßois Heim).Niccol√≤ Codazzi and Vicente Giner, Saint Peter Baptizing the centurion and the Arch of Titus at Jean-Fran√ßois Heim In 1680 the artist lived in the Via Gregoriana. In that year, he was one of the leading signatories, together with fellow artist Sebasti√°n Mu√±oz, of a petition from a group of Spanish painters directed to Gaspar M√©ndez de Haro, 7th Marquis of Carpio, the Spanish Ambassador to Rome. This petition requested that an Academy for Spanish artists, along the lines of the French academy, be created in Rome with the celebrated painter Francisco Herrera the Younger as its director. The Ambassador who was himself one of Europe‚Äôs most important art collectors at that time, received the request with great pleasure.

The signed Perspective with port is in the collection of the Bank of Spain's collection and another signed Interior of a basilica with musicians in concert around a table in the Museu de Belles Arts de Val√®ncia. Giner specialised in painting large and dramatic architectural compositions animated by numerous figures. His works depict monumental buildings, monuments and ruins from Antiquity. The artist did not strive to depict existing scenes realistically but combined existing and imaginary elements to arrive at a balanced composition.

He was evidently inspired by the work of his contemporary Viviano Codazzi. Giner may have worked in Codazzi's workshop and they collaborated on a number of occasions although there is no documentary evidence to support this. Some of his paintings were formerly attributed to Viviano Codazzi, including the Architectural Capriccio with Figures and an Obelisk and the Architectural Capriccio (both in the collections of the National Trust).. Works at the National Trust. The re-attribution of the latter was made by art historian David Marshall in 1987 who argued that the composition was clearly dependent upon Codazzi's paintings of the 1660s, but was executed in a flatter, dull and less precise manner. The figures were painted clearly by another hand from that of the painter of the architecture.Vicente Giner, An Architectural Capriccio at the National Trust Collections His compositions often include figures which represent a religious scene but without attempting to depict a particular biblical episode. As is the case with Viviano Codazzi, several of compositions also include daily scenes in which elegantly dressed personages appear together with simply dressed common people. This shows his debt to the genre works of the group of genre painters active in Rome and known as the Bamboccianti who depicted Roman scenes with ordinary people. The careful physiognomies and gestures of his figures also show his familiarity with the figures of Cornelis de Wael and Pandolfo Reschi. His compositions regularly used compositional and architectonical schemes borrowed from Viviano Codazzi.

It received its status as a Grade I-listed building on 22 February 1963. Early history The English historian, John Capgrave, wrote that St Cyngar established a monastery in Glamorganshire with 12 canons dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It is believed this was the beginning of Holy Trinity Church. In 1874, the remains of what appeared to be a monastery were still visible. The parish consisted of Marcross Manor, owned by Sir Philip de Marcross from 1189 to 1200. De Marcross' only heir was a daughter; when she married in about 1250, the manor passed to William le Butler. The church was described as a rectory worth five marks in 1254, and was still described as such in 1535. By 1563, it was noted as having a parson and curate; by 1835, while it remained classified as a rectory, the listing for patron was the Chapter of Llandaff. The church is in the village centre. The main structure dates from the 12th century; it is believed that the tower was added to the building in the 14th century. The tower, with its saddleback roof, may have been partially rebuilt in the 17th century, from evidence of a difference in masonry above its ridge. The rounded Norman arch at the church entrance dates from circa 1150 and the large font with rolled mouldings dates from the 12th century. There are no aisles in either the chancel or nave. One of the chancel walls has two trefoil light windows believed to be from the 13th century. One of these windows may have been used for the ringing of a Sanctus Bell. The building is constructed of stone with slate roofing, with the roof for the chancel being lower than the nave. Still in the chancel is the lepers' window, where those with contagious diseases could view church services without coming into contact with others. 19th century to present By the late 19th century, it became evident that the church was in need of restoration work. The rector of Holy Trinity began a fundraising campaign for the work; it took four years to raise the needed funds. By 1892, enough donations were received to allow Kempton and Fowler of Llandaff to begin the project. During the restoration, the architects discovered many items of note which had been hidden by previous renovations to the church. While removing old plaster from the walls, a doorway leading to the rood loft on the north side of the chancel arch was uncovered. The plaster removal also located a 13th-century tomb in a recess of the north nave wall. During the restoration, a tomb in the chancel floor from circa 1200 and the church's original pillar piscina were also located. When the restoration was completed, the church had been completely re-roofed, the church walls and tower were renovated, new floors were installed along with new pews, a new pulpit and reading desk, as well as a new altar and altar rail. Holy Trinity was reopened on 17 January 1897. The only changes made to the church since this restoration were to remove the pews in favour of chairs for seating. The church appears to now be in need of work, particularly after a series of spring storms in 2016. In May, 2016, a village fundraiser was held at the local pub to help with the necessary costs of repairing the church. There is also a circa 15th century cross which holds a circa 18th century bronze sundial on the church property; these became Grade II listed buildings on 9 October 1982.

She was one of the best British two-year-old fillies of 2015 when she ran second in the Lowther Stakes before winning the Cheveley Park Stakes. Her only win in the following year came in the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes but she was placed in both the Sceptre Stakes and the Challenge Stakes. Background Lumiere is a grey mare bred in England by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was from the seventh crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St James's Palace Stakes. His other offspring have included Able Friend, Mukhadram, Lope de Vega and Casamento. Lumiere's dam Screen Star won on her only racecourse appearance, a contest for two-year-old at Redcar Racecourse in 2007. She was a great-granddaughter of Outstandingly the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly of 1984. During her racing career, the filly was owned by Sheikh Mohammed's son Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum and trained by Mark Johnston at Middleham in North Yorkshire. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Lumiere was ridden in all of her 2015 races by William Buick. She made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 9 July and started the 6/5 favourite against seven opponents. She led from the start, accelerated away from the field approaching the final furlong and won impressively by six lengths from Sharja Queen. The filly was then moved up sharply in class for the Group 2 Lowther Stakes at York Racecourse on 20 August and started the 9/4 favourite ahead of the Princess Margaret Stakes winner Besharah. She took the lead soon after the start but was overtaken by Besharah inside the final furlong and was beaten two and a quarter lengths into second place. On her third and final appearance as a juvenile, Lumiere was one of eight fillies to contest the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket on 26 September and started the 100/30 third choice in the betting behind Besharah and the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes winner Illuminate. A two-horse Irish challenge comprised Alice Springs (third to Minding in the Moyglare Stud Stakes) and the Curragh Stakes winner Bear Cheek. Lumiere took the lead from the start and opened up a clear advantage at half way. She was strongly challenged in the closing stages but stayed on to win by half a length, a head and three quarters of a length from Illuminate, Besharah and Alice Springs. After the race Johnston said \\"We always thought there was no shortage of stamina but we also know she's very fast and has a tremendous cruising speed. I'm very, very hopeful she can stay a mile\\". =2016: three- year-old season= Lumiere began her second season in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket on 1 May and started the second favourite in a sixteen-runner field. After starting strongly and disputing the early lead she dropped away quickly in the last three furlongs and finished last behind Minding. After a two-month break the filly was dropped in class for her return in the Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at Newmarket on 7 July. Ridden as in the Guineas by Joe Fanning she started 3/1 favourite and posted a decisive win as she took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by six lengths from the colt Cymric. Later that month she was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse in which she briefly held the lead 500 metres out before fading to finish ninth behind Qemah. James Doyle partnered Lumiere in her last two races. She was dropped in distance for the Group 3 Sceptre Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 9 September and finished third to Spangled and Mise En Rose after leading inside the final furlong. I the Challenge Stakes on 7 October over the same distance at Newmarket she led for most of the way before being overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a length by the colt Aclaim.

He is the CEO of several companies including Coast and Hills Developments. He has investments in hotels and residential towers as well as marina developments. Ioannou has been appointed by the Cypriot president as honorary consul of Cyprus in the Sinai Peninsula. Career =Business= Boat-racing & Boat-building During the time Ioannou resided in Egypt, he was the national UIM president. As a speed boat manufacturer he organised the first red sea rib rally and brought to this event a long list of world class royalty, celebrities, business people and adventurers, and created thereafter a series of events which included the first ever Formula 2 race in the Egyptian Nile, \\"les 8 heurs du nil\\". Rudy, also personally participated in several boat racing events such as the one in Zeebrugge in which he came first place. However boat racing, boat races, and boat building reportedly remain to this day his hobby. In 2007, he moved to Monaco where he stayed in his apartment in Fontvieille to work more closely with the UIM. As for boat building, Ioannou formed his ship building company after having built his first 105-foot steel yacht by the age of 26. He later moved to speedboat and rigid inflatable boat manufacturing where he ended up receiving several awards for retail and military navy contracting. The Italian Navy also endowed him with a high honor award for marine contracting and contribution to their navy fleet of military vessels. Projects in progress Nicolas Ioannou is currently developing several projects around Europe. His company is working on the developments of projects to build a new commercial and residential compound and marina, as well as other several projects to pioneer high rise towers that consist of 5-star luxury apartments and hotels that are said to break the record for the tallest buildings in their countries. Ioannou is undertaking many of these projects reportedly along with his Egyptian and Saudi Arabian billionaire partners who are shareholders within the company. =Politics= Ioannou was in Egypt during the 2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks where he intervened to aid the Cypriot tourists in Egypt at the time. After providing refuge to the surviving victims he was esteemed as a man of resources to aid the Cypriot government in political missions during crisis. This led to his endowment as the Honorary Consul of Cyprus in Egypt where he was able to provide an exit from Egypt to Cypriots who desired to leave the country in a time where Egyptian airports were shut down by the government for security reasons during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. =Real estate= Ioannou owns a significant amount of land in Cyprus some of which he inherited. This land was owned by his grandfather before the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in the north. He also owns land in Greece, as well as an island in the Ionian sea.

It is run as a socio-cultural centre by a non-profit association on behalf of the city council, and is financed by revenues made from its in-house gastronomy along with public subsidies. Its management states that around 500 events take place in the rooms of the Lagerhalle each year. It also hosts Osnabr√ºck's Cabaret and Morgenland festivals.  History  In 1972, the ironware wholesalers Richter moved their warehouse from Osnabr√ºck's old town centre to a nearby industrial area. Towards the end of 1973 a citizens‚Äô initiative made up of artists, arts enthusiasts and craftspeople took form and developed a concept for the new usage of the Richter warehouse: as a communications centre and arthouse. The group presented its concept to the city administration in February 1974, initiating a dialogue with then-Lord Mayor Ernst Weber regarding a possible acquisition of the building by the city. The Richter family demanded 550,000 DM for the building, with an additional condition that its future usage should not be contrary to the character of the Heger Tor area. As the suggestion to use the Lagerhalle as a recreational centre had met with the approval of local government as well as councilors, a concept was developed for the building's further usage. After the citizens‚Äô initiative had put forward its proposals to the local management committee, the culture committee passed a positive verdict on the concept in November that year. On 23 December 1974, Osnabr√ºck city council managed to acquire the building at a price of 465,000 DM.History of the Lagerhalle (last accessed 3 February 2012) In the space of 18 months, the former warehouse was converted into a cultural centre. The city council made all space within the building freely available and assumed responsibility for all running costs.

Demographic surveys of faculty that began in the 1950s and continue to the present have found higher percentages of liberals than of conservatives, particularly among those who work in the humanities and social sciences. Researchers and pundits disagree about survey methodology and about the interpretations of the findings. History =Pre- and post- WWII= Max Yergan was one of the first professors fired for political views. Carol SmithSmith, Carol. (2011). \\"The dress rehearsal for McCarthyism.\\" Academe 94(4): 48-51. and Stephen LebersteinStephen Leberstein, \\"Purging the Profs: The Rapp Coudert Committee in New York, 1940‚Äì1942,\\" in Michael E. Brown et al. (eds.), New Studies in the Politics and Culture of US Communism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1993; p. 92. have documented investigations of professors' political views at the City College of New York (CCNY) during the 1930s and 1940s. Citing the tactics of private hearings, requiring respondents to name others, and denying rights of legal representation, Smith calls the investigations a \\"dress rehearsal for McCarthyism\\". Smith described the case of Max Yergan, who was the first African American professor hired at the CCNY. After complaints that he expressed liberal and progressive views in his classes on Negro History and Culture, Yergan was terminated in 1936. In 1938, the U.S. House of Representatives created the House Un-American Activities Committee; one of the committee's first actions was to attempt to investigate the political views of faculty in the New York public colleges. In 1940, Bertrand Russell was denied employment as a philosophy professor at CCNY because of his political beliefs. That same year, the New York State Legislature created the Rapp-Coutert Committee, which held hearings in 1940‚Äì41 during which faculty accused of holding communist political beliefs were interrogated. More than 50 faculty and staff at CCNY resigned or were terminated as a result of the hearings. One professor, Morris Schappes, served a year in prison on perjury charges for refusing to name colleagues who may have been affiliated with the Communist party. Smith believes that the investigations caused the largest political purge on one campus in the history of the US. In 1942, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), began investigating the political views of W.E.B. DuBois, an African American sociologist who taught at Atlanta University. The investigation centered on DuBois's 1940 autobiography, Dusk of Dawn. Although the investigation was dismissed, Atlanta University fired DuBois in 1943. Public outcry led the university to reinstate DuBois, but he retired in 1944. In 1949, the House Un- American Activities Committee summoned faculty members from the University of Washington, and three tenured faculty members were fired. Public concern about the political opinions of college teachers intensified after World War II ended in 1945. Sociologists who were investigated by the FBI for their political beliefs during this period include Ernest Burgess, William Fielding Ogburn, Robert Staughton Lynd, Helen Lynd, E. Franklin Frazier, Pitirim A. Sorokin, Talcott Parsons, Herbert Blumer, Samuel Stouffer, C. Wright Mills, and Edwin H. Sutherland. =McCarthyism and loyalty oaths= Joseph McCarthy's hearings led to faculty members being pressured to resign. Although government employees and entertainment figures were most often investigated for alleged communist sympathies during the \\"Second Red Scare\\" of the 1950s, many university faculty were accused as well. In their 1955 study of 2,451 social scientists who taught at American colleges and universities, Lazarsfeld and Thielens noted that the period of 1945‚Äì55 was especially marked by suspicion and attacks on colleges for the political views of their faculty. These authors label this period \\"the difficult years.\\" In 1950, the University of California Board of Regents and its administration began to require faculty to sign a two-part political loyalty oath: one part required faculty to declare they were not Communists, and did not believe in the tenets of Communism;Radin, Max. (1950). Bulletin of the American Association of University Professors (1915-1955), 36(2): 237-245. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40220718 the other part was an oath of loyalty to the state of California and the US Constitution in accordance with the Levering Act. In early March, 1950, the faculty, who numbered 900, unanimously refused to sign even though the Regents threatened non-signers with termination. Faculty who refused to sign the loyalty oath were terminated, although most of the terminations were later overturned by a California state court. In 1951, members of the American Legion began accusing various university faculty of being communists. University administrations responded by banning left-wing student groups and communist speakers. Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee investigated 18 faculty members at Sarah Lawrence College, some of whom were pressured to resign. According to historian Ellen Schrecker, \\"it is very clear that an academic blacklist was in operation during the McCarthy era.\\" An estimated 100 university faculty were terminated during the McCarthy era due to suspicions about their political beliefs.Aby, Stephen H. (2009). \\"Discretion over valor: The AAUP during the McCarthy Years.\\" American Educational History Journal 36(1): 121-132. In 1970, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover sent an open letter to US college students, advising them to reject leftist politics, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the FBI conducted a secret counterintelligence program in libraries. Surveys =Ford Foundation= In 1955, Robert Maynard Hutchins led an effort within the Ford Foundation to document and analyze the effects of McCarthyism on academic freedom. He commissioned sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld to conduct a study of university faculty in the United States, and the results were published by Lazarsfeld and Wagner Thielens in a book, The Academic Mind. As part of a survey of faculty views about academic freedom during the \\"Second Red Scare\\", they asked 2,451 professors of social science a large number of questions, and found that about two thirds of these faculty members had been visited by the FBI and had been asked questions about the political beliefs of their colleagues, students, and themselves. They also included a few questions about political party affiliations and recent voting patterns, and reported that there were more Democrats than Republicans, 47% to 16%. According to sociologist Neil Gross, the study was significant because it was the first effort to poll university faculty specifically about their political views. =Carnegie Commission on Higher Education= The Lazarsfeld and Thielens study had examined a sample of 2,451 social science faculty members. A second study, conducted in 1969 on behalf of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, was the first to be performed with a large survey sample, extensive questions about political views, and what Neil Gross characterized as highly rigorous analytic methods. The study was conducted in 1969 by political scientist Everett Carll Ladd and sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, who surveyed 60,000 academics in multiple fields of study at 303 institutions about their political views. Publishing their results in the 1975 book The Divided Academy, Ladd and Lipset found that about 46% of professors described themselves as liberal, 27% described themselves as moderates, and 28% described themselves as conservative. They also reported that faculty in the humanities and social sciences tended to be the most liberal, while those in \\"applied professional schools such as nursing and home economics\\" and in agriculture were the most conservative. Younger faculty tended to be more liberal than older faculty, and faculty across the political spectrum tended to disapprove of the student activism of the 1960s. Smaller follow-up surveys on behalf of the Carnegie Foundation held in 1975, 1984, 1989, and 1997 showed an increased trend among professors toward the left, apart from a small movement to the right in 1984. By the 1997 study, 57% of the professors surveyed identified as liberals, 20% as moderates, and 24% as conservatives. =Later surveys= As later surveys were published, some scholars pointed to the harmful effects of a political imbalance in the faculty, and one editorial described the effects as \\"ruining college\\". Other scholars said that there were serious methodological problems that led to overestimates of the disparity between liberals and conservatives, and that there were political motivations for such overestimates. Higher Education Research Institute Beginning in 1989, the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) at the University of California, Los Angeles has conducted a survey of full-time faculty at American four-year colleges and universities every three years. The HERI Faculty Survey gathers comprehensive information about the faculty experience, such as position, field, institutional details, and personal opinion and views, including a single question asking respondents to self-identify their political orientation as \\"far left\\", \\"liberal\\", \\"moderate/middle of the road\\", \\"conservative\\", or \\"far right\\". Between 1989 and 1998, the survey showed negligible change in the number of professors who described themselves as far left or liberal, approximately 45%. , surveying 16,112 professors, the percentage of liberal/far left had increased to 60%. When asked in 2012 about the significance of the findings on political views, the director of HERI, Sylvia Hurtado, said that the numbers on political views attract a lot of attention, but that this attention may be misplaced because there may be trivial reasons for the shifts. North American Academic Survey Study Ladd and Lipset, who had conducted the original Carnegie survey, designed a telephone survey in 1999 of approximately 4000 faculty, administrators, and students, called the North American Academic Survey Study (NASS). Stanley Rothman, the project lead after the passing of Ladd and Lipset, published a paper using NAASS data along with Neil Nevitte and S. Robert Lichter which concluded \\"complaints of ideologically-based discrimination in academic advancement deserve serious consideration and further study\\". Rothman along with co-authors Matthew Woessner and April Kelly-Woessner reported their extended findings in a book titled The Still Divided Academy.\\"Five myths about liberal academia\\", Matthew Woessner, April Kelly-Woessner and Stanley Rothman Friday, February 25, 2011 Washington Post Politics of the American Professoriate Neil Gross and Solon Simmons conducted a survey starting in 2006 called the Politics of the American Professoriate which led to several study papers and books. They designed their survey to improve on past studies which they felt had not included community college professors, addressed low response rates, or used standardized questions. The survey drew upon a sample size of 1417 full-time professors from 927 institutions. In 2007, Gross and Simmons concluded in The Social and Political Views of American Professors that the professors were 44% liberal, 46% moderates, and 9% conservative. Inside Higher Ed reported that economist Lawrence H. Summers made his own analysis of the data collected by Gross and Simmons and found a larger gap among faculty teaching \\"core disciplines for undergraduate education\\" at selective research universities, but the report also concluded that \\"there was widespread praise for the way the survey was conducted, with Summers and others predicting that their data may become the definitive source for understanding professors' political views.\\" Gross published a more extensive analysis in his 2013 book Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care? and, with Simmons, in their 2014 compilation Professors and Their Politics. They strongly criticized what they saw as conservative political influence on the interpretation of data about faculty political views, arising from activists and think tanks seeking political reform of American higher education. Sociologist Joseph Hermanowicz described Professors and Their Politics as \\"a welcome addition to sociological literature examining higher education, which, in the case of its intersection with politics, has not received serious attention since Paul Lazarsfeld and Wagner Theilen's classic study of 1958 and Seymour Martin Lipset and Everett Carll Ladd's 1976 work.\\" Regional and disciplinary variations Several studies have found that the political views of academics vary considerably between different regions of the United States, and between academic disciplines. In a 2016 opinion column in The New York Times, for example, political scientist Samuel J. Abrams used HERI data to argue that the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty varied greatly between regions. According to Abrams, the ratio of liberal to conservative professors was highest in New England, where this ratio was 28:1, compared to 6:1 nationally. Abrams also commented on these findings that \\"This previously unspecified ideological imbalance on campuses has led to cries of discrimination against right of center professors and scores of reports from both academic and popular press sources which have chronicled the concerns with this \\"beleaguered\\" and \\"oppressed\\" minority on campus... The data clearly reveal that conservative faculty are not only as satisfied with their career choice ‚Äì if not more so ‚Äì as their liberal counterparts, but that these faculty are also as progressive in their teaching methods and maintain almost identical outlooks toward their personal and professional lives.\\" Mitchell Langbert examined variations in political party registration in 2018, describing a higher concentration of Democrats in elite liberal arts institutions in the northeast, and found more Democrats among female faculty than male faculty. He also found the greatest ratio of Democrats to Republicans in interdisciplinary studies and the humanities, and the lowest ratio in professional studies and science and engineering. Focusing specifically on social psychology academics, a 2014 study found that \\"[b]y 2006, however, the ratio of Democrats to Republicans had climbed to more than 11:1.\\" The six authors, all from different universities and members of the Heterodox Academy, also said, by 2012, \\"that for every politically conservative social psychologist in academia there are about 14 liberal psychologists\\" according to Arthur C. Brooks. Academy member Steven Pinker described the study as \\"one of the most important papers in the recent history of the social sciences\\". Russell Jacoby questioned the focus of the study on the social sciences rather than STEM fields saying that the \\"reason is obvious: Liberals do not outnumber conservatives in many of those disciplines\\". Effects =On students= Since the modern conservative movement in the United States began in the mid-20th century, conservative authors have argued that college students are unduly influenced or indoctrinated as a result of the prevalence of liberal faculty at their schools. William F. Buckley's God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of \\"Academic Freedom\\", Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind, Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education, and Roger Kimball's Tenured Radicals have made such arguments. George Yancey argues that there is little evidence that the political orientation of faculty members affects the political attitudes of their students.Yancey, George. \\"Recalibrating Academic Bias.\\" Academic Questions 25, no. 2 (2012): 267‚Äì78. A study by Mack D. Mariani and Gordon J. Hewitt published in 2008 examined ideological changes in college students between their first and senior years and found that these changes correlated with that of most Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 during the same time period, and there was no evidence that faculty ideology was \\"associated with changes in students' ideological orientation\\" and concluded that students at more liberal schools \\"were not statistically more likely to move to the left\\" than students at other institutions. Similarly, Stanley Rothman, April Kelly- Woessner, and Mathew Wossner found in 2010 that students' \\"aggregate attitudes do not appear to vary much between their first and final years,\\" and wrote that this \\"raises some questions about charges that campuses politically indoctrinate students.\\" Analysis of a survey of students' political attitudes by M. Kent Jennings and Laura Stoker found that the tendency of college graduates to be more liberal is largely due to \\"the fact that more liberal students are more likely to go to college in the first place.\\" =On faculty= Lawrence Summers has said: \\"As someone who is a strong Democrat and is a liberal, and does not think that we have won the argument with the country over the last 40 years, rather to the contrary, it makes me wonder whether if you do not engage in intense dialogue with those whom you disagree with... whether your own arguments will be sharpened and honed to maximum effect.\\" Rothman, Kelly-Woessner, and Woessner also found in 2010 that 33% of conservative faculty say they are \\"very satisfied\\" with their careers, while 24% of liberal faculty say so. Over 90% of Republican-voting professors said that they would still become professors if they could do it all over again. The authors concluded that, although such numbers are not definitive as to how faculty members feel that they have been treated, they provide some evidence against the idea that conservative faculty members are systematically discriminated against. Woessner and Kelly-Woessner also examined what might have given rise to the differences in the numbers of liberals and conservatives. They looked at the choices made by undergraduate students when planning future careers. They found that there were no differences in intellectual ability between conservative and liberal students, but that liberal students were significantly more likely to choose to pursue PhD degrees and academic careers, whereas conservative students of identical academic accomplishments were more likely to pursue business careers. They concluded that the greater numbers of liberal than conservative professors could be accounted for by self-selection in career paths, rather than by bias in hiring or promotion. Lawrence Summers said at a symposium about The Social and Political Views of American Professors that he considers it a problem that some academics express an \\"extreme hostility\\" to conservative opinions. He observed that faculty who were invited to give Tanner Lectures on Human Values were almost always liberals, and expressed concern that an imbalance in political representation at universities could impede rigorous examination of issues. He also attributed the small numbers of conservative professors largely to the career choices made by people comparing academic careers with other options. One outcome of these controversies was the founding of the Heterodox Academy in 2015, a bipartisan organization of professors seeking to increase the acceptance of diverse political viewpoints in academic discourse. As of February 2018, over 1500 college professors had joined Heterodox Academy. The group publishes a ranking which rates the top 150 universities in the United States based on their commitment to diversity of viewpoint. Jon Shields and Joshua Dunn surveyed 153 conservative professors for their 2016 study Passing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University. The authors wrote that these professors sometimes have to use \\"coping strategies that gays and lesbians have used in the military and other inhospitable work environments\\" in order to preserve their political identity. One tactic used by about one-third of the professors was to \\"pass\\" (or pretend) to hold liberal views around their colleagues. Shields stated his view that the populist right may overstate the bias that does exist and that conservatives can succeed using mechanisms like academic tenure to protect their freedom.

Personal history Morgan was born in Alejandra, Argentina in 1892. He moved to Wales as a child and was educated at Carmarthen Grammar School and later at Llandovery College. He was a talented all-round sportsperson who played as a hooker for the college during the winter and was an important member of the cricket XI during the summer months. After leaving college he found employment as an engineer at the Thomas and Clement Foundry in Llanelli. In 1913 he returned to Argentina where he became a farmer in his birth town of Alejandra. In 192 he moved to Campo Largo where he worked as a police officer. He died in Argentina in 1947. Rugby career Morgan is initially recorded playing rugby when he was a student at Llandovery College. On moving to Llanelli he joined local side the Oriental Stars, where he was soon spotted by Llanelli RFC and given a place in their team. While at Llanelli Morgan faced his first international opponents, selected for his club against the second touring South Africans. It was a close match with the tourists winning 8-7. Morgan did enough to impress and was selected for his first international cap for Wales, facing the same South African team. In another tough match Morgan again found himself on the losing side this time the result was 3-0. Morgan played one last match for his adopted country when he faced England in the 1913 Five Nations Championship. =International matches played= Wales * 1912 * 1913 Bibliography  References Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Argentine rugby union players Category:Rugby union forwards Category:1892 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Llanelli RFC players Category:People educated at Llandovery College Category:Wales international rugby union players ","title":"Johnnie Morgan"},{"id":"50388199","text":"Gunstock Knob is a summit in West Virginia, in the United States.

Description  B. mariantensis is known from two specimens, including the holotype UFRGS-PV-0168-T, a complete skull, atlas, axis and third neck vertebra and the paratype UFRGS-PV-0315-T, right maxilla and jaw, both housed at the vertebrate paleontology collection of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre-Brazil. The specimens were collected at the same site, along road RS-240 near the town of Porto Mariante, 28 km east of Ven√¢ncio Aires, in the municipality of Bom Retiro do Sul. Since its first description by Langer & Schultz (2000) it became known in the scientific literature as the \\"Mariante Rhynchosaur\\" in reference to the town of Porto Mariante. It was finally named as a new genus and species by Cesar Leandro Schultz, Max Cardoso Langer and Felipe Chinaglia Montefeltro in 2016 as B. mariantensis. The generic name Brasinorhynchus comes from Portuguese brasino used for red horses in south Brazil in reference to the red color of the fossils and their resemblance to a horse skull, and from the Greek rhynchos meaning \\"beak\\", a common suffix for rhynchosaur genera. The specific name shares its origin with the specimens' old nickname, the \\"Mariante Rhynchosaur\\". B. mariantensis is unique among other known rhynchosaurs by possessing a contact between the prefrontal and postfrontal bones that excludes the frontals from the eye socket. A phylogenetic analysis recovered it in an advanced position with the Stenaulorhynchinae, as the sister taxon of Stenaulorhynchus stockleyi from the late Anisian of Manda beds, Tanzania. B. mariantensis occurs in the Mariante 1 locality that yielded isolated dicynodont remains, which is near Mariante 2 that yielded more complete material referable to Dinodontosaurus, both of which belong to the Alemoa Member beds of the formation. This puts B. mariantensis in the Dinodontosaurus Assemblage Zone which is of Ladinian age, thus making it the youngest known stenaulorhynchine.

The island is private property, owned since 1995 by John Malone, one of Maine's largest landowners. Description and history Mosquito Island is located about south of Martinsville and east of Marshall Point, the southernmost tip of the St. George peninsula. The island is about in size. The stone house is located in a clearing on the northwestern shore of the island, along with a small cluster of more modern buildings. It is a 1-1/2 story Cape style structure, built out of rough-cut granite and topped by a gabled roof. The front (north-facing) of the roof is pierced by two gabled dormers, which are 20th-century additions. The main facade has two sash windows flanking the main entrance, which is topped by a multilight transom window. The house's construction date is uncertain. The stone was quarried locally, using a method that went out of common use around 1750, and is distinctively different from more modern methods used in quarrying the stones for an 1830 foundation on the island. The earliest surviving real estate transactions involving the island date to 1785, and the early history of the island is not well documented. The island was purchased in 1995 by John Malone, a billionaire businessman and philanthropist with extensive landholdings in the state, and the house was restored.

Located on a rise overlooking the city's downtown, these houses were built by leading businessmen of the period, and are either Federal or Greek Revival in their style. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Crosby Street and Crosby Lane are located on a hill just north of Augusta's downtown business district. The two streets form a L, its ends at Bridge Street, a major east-west route, and State Street, a major north-south route. There are eight houses in the district, of which seven are historically significant. One faces State Street, one Crosby Lane, and the others face Crosby Street. The oldest house is that of George Crosby, a two-story wood frame building with Federal style. Two houses, built in the 1840s, exhibit Greek Revival style, while one is transitional between the Greek Revival and Federal periods. This enclave of homes is a surviving element of Augusta's early commercial development. In that period, businessmen built their houses near the commercial district. As later commercial and industrial development encroached, wealthier elements of the community built further away. This area survived conversion to commercial or industrial use because of its location on a hill. Many of these houses have been converted into multiple units.

The movement predominantly centered around Paris, France, and Italy, with some offshoots in England, Germany, and North America. Whistlejacket by George Stubbs Edouard Louis Dubufe, Portrait of Rosa Bonheur (1857). Symbolic of her work as an Animali√®re, the artist is depicted with a bull. Some examples of animalier artists and their subjects are George Stubbs and Jules Moigniez (paintings and sculpture of horses), Antoine-Louis Barye (sculpture of bulls and humans), and Rembrandt Bugatti (felines, human figures, and zoo animals).  History  Theseus Slaying Minotaur by Barye Animals as a visual motif were used in ancient art and in tribal art, in animal style art and objects but were not generally represented as figurative, anatomically correct, creatures. The Celtic-Germanic animal style with its \\"combination of abstract and organic shapes, of formal discipline and imaginative freedom, became an important element ... in the art of the Dark Ages.\\" During the Baroque period in France and England, a 1670 commissioned terracotta model for a sculpture of Louis XIV titled Equestrian Statue of Louis XIV by Gian Lorenzo Bernini was rejected on the grounds that it was not suitable to the dignity of the king. The term animalier was first used by the French press and salon jurors, often as a derogatory term. The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but with the opening of the new Paris Jardin des Plantes zoo and the M√©nagerie du Jardin des plantes, interest in animal art increased.http://www.iub.edu/~iuam/online_modules/metz/collection.html The Dukes of Orleans, Luynes, Montpensier, and Nemours were soon to become Barye's patrons. In 1882 Edouard Manet created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the Getty Museum since 2014.http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/265936/edouard- manet-portrait-of-julien-de-la-rochenoire-french-1882/George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector Paul Mellon, who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the Yale Center for British Art. It has been observed that \\"many animal sculptures were modeled in plaster for exhibition and cast later in bronze editions. The size and variety of an edition depended on the popularity of the piece at exhibition, and many Barye, M√™ne, and Fratin pieces were so popular that they were cast in very large editions.\\"  Animalier artists  Rembrandt Bugatti at the zoo in Antwerp, BelgiumArtists of the animalier movement were referred to as les animaliers. Important artists of the animalier movement included Antoine-Louis Barye (1796‚Äì1875), Rembrandt Bugatti (1884‚Äì1916), George Stubbs (1724‚Äì1806), Alfred Dedreux (1810‚Äì1860), Christopher Fratin (1801‚Äì1864),http://www.bronze- gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=21 http://www.worldcat.org/title/concise-history-of-bronzes/oclc/15625 Alexandre Guionnet, Pierre-Jules M√™ne (1810‚Äì1879).http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Mene%2C+Pierre- Jules Rosa Bonheur (1822‚Äì1899), Isidore Bonheur (1827‚Äì1901), Anna Hyatt Huntington (1876‚Äì1973), Paul-Edouard Delabrierre (1829‚Äì1912), Alfred Dubucand (1828‚Äì1894), Jules Moigniez (1835‚Äì1894) and √âmile-Coriolan Guillemin (1841‚Äì1907).  Animalier reproductions  Many beautiful replicas are made of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as cast iron, spelter, or cast bronze, as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional lost wax process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet was exceptional in that he worked in wood. Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use patinated verdigris cast bronze or iron, or bonded marble resin (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with resin glue), as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of Capiz placuna placenta oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the Philippines (where they are known as kapiz).

Separated by a deep dingle, which probably was formerly a moat, it is situated westward of the town upon an almost precipitous eminence, near to the River Wye. An earlier church, dedicated to St. John, called Eglwys Ifan, appears from the Notitia Cambro-Britannica, to have been in good repair in 1684, and then used as a school-house. This building partly fell down about the year 1700, and was never repaired, though part of it was later used as a school. The church of St Mary was resorted to thereafter. It was rebuilt and enlarged in 1884, in a great measure through the instrumentality of the Rev. Humphrey Allen, who was for a number of years curate of Hay. The small building consists of a nave and chancel, with a tower at the west end, containing one bell only. Architecture Sr Mary's consists of a nave and chancel with a square embattled tower at the west end. The nave is ceiled, and has a gallery on the north and west sides. The building is substantial but plain, and may be said to partake of that economic style of Gothic ecclesiastic architecture which prevailed during the first half of the 19th century. The tower, with the exception of the upper portion extending a few feet downward from the battlements, is of considerable antiquity, and although slightly out of perpendicular, is in substantial repair. Hay Church Both the interior and exterior of the church were repaired or restored in the mid-19th century, mainly through the efforts of Canon W. Latham Bevan, who was supported by the congregation and friends. The improvements were commenced 1866-7 by the erection of a porch at the principal entrance, and enlargement of the chancel by the addition of an apsis, of a horseshoe form, together with an organ chamber and vestry. The chancel was at the same time made available for seats, by the removal of a single arch of small proportions, which divided the chancel from the nave, and substituting the present three gothic arches, opening the full width of the chancel. In form, the pulpit is octagonal; it is constructed of alabaster and marble, the lower part being arcaded and carried upon polished marble pillars; the upper portion is panelled in quatrefoils filled with medallions of our Saviour and the four evangelists. Round the pulpit is the following inscription: \\"Erected by Francis Robert Trumper, to the glory of God, in memory of his beloved wife Emma, who died Nov. 15th, 1865, and of her mother, Fortune Higgins, who died April 28rd, 1860.\\" In the 1870s, the pews were removed, substituted by open seats, and the former high front to the galleries replaced by one of a light and ornamental character. The latter portion of the work was effected in the years 1878-4. Three stained windows in the apse, to the memory of Emma Meredith, were also presented by Trumper. The current stained windows include Scenes from the Passion of Christ (circa 1870) in the sanctuary apse, Abraham by the artist Arthur J. Dix (1906) on the south wall of the nave, adjacent to pulpit, and \\"Virgin and Child\\" (circa 1950) on the north wall of the nave. Fittings The silver chalice formerly used in the administration of the sacrament at Hay Church is an interesting relic, supposed to be of the date of about 1575; it has engraved upon it in rude letters the legend, \\"Our Lady Paris of the Haia\\" (Our Lady, or St. Mary, Parish of Hay). In 2010, a Victorian-era pipe organ was placed in the west gallery. Monuments Previous to the church being rebuilt, there stood within the wooden rails on the south side of the communion table, a tombstone upon the graves of several members of the Gwynn family; the slab is still preserved in the church, and appended is a copy of the inscription. At the top are the arms, in a lozenge quarterly, Brychan or Gwyn, and Boyle; round the inscription is a border of bine and leaves extremely well executed. \\"Here were interr'd the bodyes of Thomas Gwynn of ye Hay Castle Esq. Howell Gwynn his son and heir and ye vertuous and most charitable virgin Elizabeth Gwynn daughter and co-heir of ye said Thomas Gwynn. She founded an Almes house in the Hay for six poor people and endowed it with an anual gift towards their reliefe for ever. She departed this life the 12th day of May ano dni 1702.\\" The living of Hay is a vicarage in the diocese of St. David's and archdeaconry of Brecknock. It is in the gift of Sir Joseph R. Bailey, Bart. The register of baptisms and deaths commences in the fourth year of James II. In the church is a block of stone rudely carved into the semblance of a monk, probably one of the monks of Brecknock Priory, but popularly known as Moll Walbee, for to that form has oral tradition distorted the name of Maud de St. Valeri. The legend connected with Moll Walbee ia described in the account of Hay Castle. Bell In 1886, there was one bell, though at the time the church was rebuilt in 1884 (when the upper portion of the tower was renewed), the timber supports for several bells were removed. The bell was encircled with the inscription: \\"We move thee to God's glory.\\" It also bears the initials of the founder \\"W.E.\\" and the date 1740. The initials probably indicate William Evans, of Chepstow, who was a founder of bells in and about the year 1782. This conjecture is supported by a local tradition that the bell was brought to Hay by one of the barges formerly used on the Wye for the transport of timber and bark. Many of these boats traded from Chepstow. The original peal were probably sold or melted down to provide the present solitary occupant of the steeple. The historian Jones considers the fact of there being but one bell a fortunate circumstance for the town, but afterwards qualifies this statement by saying \\"though a peal would not be as troublesome here as bells frequently are to the inhabitants residing in houses adjoining or surrounding a steeple.\\" Grounds Churchyard of St. Mary the Virgin The parish churchyard of Hay is small; it is somewhat of a triangular shape, and was formerly bounded upon two sides by a deep dingle or ravine; that on the east having a small stream flowing through it is called the Llogyn. Some writers have supposed this ravine to have been originally used as a moat. The hollow on the west side of the churchyard was partially filled up at the time of rebuilding the church. In Hay churchyard may be found specimens of most of the quaint epitaphs commonly met with upon tombstones in rural churchyards, but none that we have seen are from their originality entitled to especial notice. Outside the north wall of the church is a walk composed of old tombstones removed there from the interior, where they had previously been used for paving the floor of the church. Several of these stones bear dates of the latter half of the eighteenth century, and upon a recent visit we only found one dated in the seventeenth, and that one as late as \\"1694.\\" References * * Bibliography * * External links * *Official website Hay-on-Wye Hay-on- Wye Hay-on-Wye Category:Hay-on-Wye ","title":"St Mary's Church, Hay-on-Wye"},{"id":"50388976","text":"John Samuel Pughe (3 June 1870 ‚Äì 19 April 1909), was a Welsh-born American political cartoonist, best known for his illustrations for Puck magazine.

He was first capped for Wales when he was selected for the opening game of the 1914 Five Nations Championship, an away fixture at Twickenham against England. Evans was one of five new players brought into the Welsh side as the team attempted to rebuild their side, which saw Wales lose to their old rivals, 10-9. Evans earned his second cap three weeks later, laying Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park. In a rough match Scotland lost by a heavy 24-5 result. Evans' third successive Wales appearance was a second home encounter, this time against France. Wales dominated the game and Evans scored his first and only international try, one of seven scored by Wales that day, in a convincing 31-0 victory. His final international appearance was the last of the 1914 Championship and the last international Welsh game until 1920, as the outbreak of the First World War ended international rugby.

It is located in the Mosul District, and it is the seat of Qayyarah subdistrict. It has a population of 15,000. The town is located near the Qayyarah oil field and has an oil refinery on its south-western outskirts. The Qayyarah Airfield West is 20 kilometers west of the town. The town and subdistrict fell to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in June 2014. It was reported that its recapture was of strategic importance for the offensive to retake Mosul in 2016. In August 2016, Qayyarah was fully captured by Iraqi forces, with Lieutenant General Riyadh Jalal Tawfiq stating that they controlled all parts of the city and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi hailing the capture of the city as a \\"key step in the fight\\" against ISIL. In July 2016, the Pentagon said they were sending another 560 troops to Iraq, mainly to develop the Qayyarah airfield and use it as support for the planned attack on Mosul. Following the town's liberation, members of the Jubur tribe from Qayyarah and surrounding villages formed the Popular Mobilization Forces' 39th Regiment (nicknamed \\"Commandos of al-Jubur\\" or \\"Lions of the Tigris\\") to fight against ISIL. This unit subsequently took part in the Battle of Mosul (2016‚Äì2017). The town's name derives from the Arabic word for tar. Qayyarah has been known for its bitumen springs since at least the middle ages. Ibn Battuta passed through Qayyarah and described how its bitumen was exported to other towns; Shihab al-Din al-'Umari also noted that Qayyarah's bitumen springs produced a large revenue for the sultans.

Raven in 1985 led to the genus being greatly enlarged, merging it with other genera Hapalopinus, Leptofischelia, Merothele, Obaerarius and Stothis.

It was listed as a monument historique by a decree of December 31st, 2015.Pr√©fecture de r√©gion Bretagne : Arr√™t√© n¬∞ 2016-12336 du 31 d√©cembre 2015 portant inscription au titre des monuments historiques du phare de T√©vennec (Finist√®re)  Securing the Raz de Sein  The construction of the Ar Men lighthouse to the west, designed to secure ship navigation off the island of Sein, began in 1867. But there is also a sea passage between the √Æle de Sein and the Pointe du Raz which constitutes a shortcut: the Raz de Sein and navigation would be protected by T√©vennec. The T√©vennec light was first activated in March 1875, having a maximum range of 9 miles.  Legends  According to Jean-Christophe Fichou and Francis Dreyer, the lighthouse is said to be \\"one of the strangest places in the history of lighthouses,\\" and is rumored to be haunted. During the Napoleonic Wars, the French ship S√©duisant was wrecked there, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of men. The lighthouse was classified as the fourth category, requiring a single keeper and a service period of a year. A series of 23 keepers lived at the light until automation. According to legend, the first lighthouse keeper, Henri Guezennec, was driven insane by ghostly voices demanding his departure. Allegedly Guezennec‚Äôs replacement, Minou, had a similar experience. The French government then reclassified T√©vennec as a two-man lighthouse however applications were rare. In 1897 the government began recruiting married couples to keep the lighthouse. Some unexplained deaths occurred. The first couple to accept the job were the Milliners. The most durable keepers, Louis and Marie-Jacquette Qu√©m√©r√©, followed them with their three children and a cow and remained five years. In 1907 a new couple replaced them, Msr. Roparz and his wife. More deaths occurred and a storm destroyed a part of the lighthouse while the keeper‚Äôs wife was in childbirth. Around this time the d√©partment decided to automate the T√©vennec light and service it every six months.

During a brief but prolific career, Kunda won several trophies with Wanderers until his career was prematurely ended by injury in 1966. Early life Kunda was born in Mufulira where his father Thomas Chipayeni worked as a miner and had also played football for Mufulira Tigers, now known as Mufulira Blackpool. He was the first born in the family and his immediate younger brother Thomas Bwalya would also go on to feature for both Wanderers and the national team. He began playing football in Section 5 of the Mine township and also played for his school Buyantanshi Primary.Musonda, Alick (14 September 1986). \\"Deadliest soccer striker called ‚ÄòOrlando‚Äô Kunda\\", Times of Zambia, p.8 He later proceeded to Kantanshi Secondary School where he featured for the school team and came to the attention of Mufulira Wanderers‚Äô scouting system leading to him joining Wanderers‚Äô reserve side in 1962.Liwena, Ridgeway (1981). The Zambian Soccer Scene, p.268 (published by Ridgeway Liwena) Playing career Kunda made his debut for Wanderers‚Äô senior team as a right winger in the 1963 season at the age of 17, joining an already formidable front line made up of players like Samuel ‚ÄòZoom‚Äô Ndhlovu, Ron Jervis, Elijah Mwale, Laurent Chishala and Ken Simwanza as Wanderers unseated Zambian National Football League champions Roan United to take the title to Shinde Stadium at the end of the season.\\"Four goals by Jervis gives Wanderers NFL championship\\", p.11 (15 October 1963). The Northern News Due to his clinical finishing, Kunda who was still in secondary school, was soon entrusted with the centre-forward position and did not disappoint as he became Wanderers leading scorer and though Wanderers lost the 1964 championship to City of Lusaka, they reclaimed it in 1965 and added the Heinrich Cup, the Castle Cup and the Inter-Rhodesia Castle Cup, and just missed out on the Challenge Cup in an unprecedented trophy haul.\\"League Championship goes to Mufulira ‚Äì The Happy Wanderers ‚Äì Ten men fight back to get the vital point from Roan United\\" (9 September 1965). Times of Zambia, p.10 Wanderers‚Äô fans loved their young striker and nicknamed him ‚ÄòOrlando,‚Äô though Kunda later admitted that he had no idea about the origins of the name.Musonda, Alick (15 September 1986). \\"Ex-soccer star Kunda walks barefoot\\" (15 September 1986) Times of Zambia, p.12 The following season, Kunda started off well and was once again Wanderers‚Äô leading scorer but in June 1966, Wanderers hosted Kabwe United in a league match at Shinde stadium. His hat-trick had given Wanderers a 3-1 lead and as they pushed on for more goals, Kunda and Ken Simwanza collided in trying to head the same ball. Kunda came off worse and was stretchered off the pitch after suffering a broken nose. He bled profusely from the nose and this continued long after so doctors advised him to quit playing football. National team Kunda was named in the first Northern Rhodesian national team in June 1964 soon after the country affiliated to FIFA.\\"N.R Footballers show well in national trials\\" (25 May 1964). The Northern News p.12 Despite being 18 years old, he was chosen to lead the front line and he scored the first goal in a 3-0 win over Tanganyika and two more when Northern Rhodesia swamped Nyasaland 5-0 to win the Ufulu Cup in Blantyre.\\"Freedom Cup for N.R. XI\\" (6 July 1964). p.12The Northern News Despite this, he was left out of the Zambian team during the country‚Äôs independence tournament in October 1964 which featured Kenya, Ghana and Uganda, and Zambia lost all their games. He returned to the team when Zambia traveled to Nairobi in December 1964 for the Kenyan Republic Cup two-match series. He watched from the bench as Zambia were beaten 4-2 in the opening match but starred in the second game, scoring four goals as Zambia turned the tables 8-2 to lift the trophy 10-6 on aggregate.\\"Zambia win soccer cup\\" (14 December 1964). p.12The Northern News\\"Zambia win Jamhuri soccer\\" (14 December 1964).

Uganda Argus p.6 This proved to be his last outing with the national team. Life after football Unable to deal with a life outside football, Kunda quit his job as a Records Clerk with Mufulira Mine soon after hanging up his boots. Excitement was generated in Mufulira when he started training with Wanderers at the beginning of the 1967 in a comeback bid but the nose bleeds continued and he never played for Wanderers again.\\"Kunda plans to make a come-back\\" (9 March 1967). Times of Zambia, p.10 When his father retired from the mines three years later, he relocated to Mansa with his parents and kept himself busy by playing for, and coaching amateur side Mansa Wanderers though he vowed never to go back to the Copperbelt.Willie Kunda returns to football wars (21 March 1971). Sunday Times of Zambia, p.12 In September 1986, an article in the Times of Zambia brought to light Kunda‚Äôs plight in a village called Chamalawa 3 km from Mansa on the Samfya highway. He was still living with his mother and stepfather and was often seen walking around the streets of Mansa barefoot. The man they used to call Orlando took the opportunity to appeal to his friends in Mufulira to send him clothes and shoes through the Times reporter. He disclosed that he had recovered from the nasal injury and only saw the doctor once in a while unlike in Mufulira where he was perpetually on tablets. He further claimed that Wanderers only gave him K56 (about GBP23) when he left Mufulira to go and live in the village after his parents were pensioned off and the only support he got was from his brother Thomas. Death True to his word, Kunda lived the rest of his life in Mansa and died in December 2007 after illness. = Honours =  Club Honours  *Zambian League Title: 1963, 1965 *Castle Cup: 1965 *Heinrich Cup: 1964, 1965 *Super Castle Cup: 1965.

The diocese was established by Pope Clement VIII on 5 June 1592, in the bull \\"Cum Super Universas\\", with territory taken from the Archdiocese of Florence, the Archdiocese of Siena, the Diocese of Fiesole, and the Diocese of Volterra. The new diocese was made a suffragan of the metropolitanate of Florence.Cappelletti, pp. 277-282. On 18 September 1782 the diocese gained additional territory from Diocese of Volterra.

In 1061, Pope Alexander II ordered the creation of a Chapter of Canons.Biadi, pp. 188-189. Biadi cites a document of Pope Sergius IV, no longer extant, in which privileges are mentioned. Kehr, p. 305, no. 1, note, expresses doubt. Pope Paschal II, in 1112, joined the parish of S. Giovanni, Faustina and Giulitta with the parish of S. Salvatore in Colle under one and the same archpriest. They were directly subject to the pope.Kehr, pp. 304 and 305, no 2. That status was contested regularly by the bishops of Volterra, however, and they finally obtained a favorable ruling from Pope Clement III on 24 January 1188. The archpriests, though, continued the litigation, until Pope Clement VIII settled the matter in 1592.Kehr, pp. 304, 308 nos. 16 and 17. The Collegiate Church nullius dioecesis of Ss. Giovanni, Faustina e Giulita in Val d'Elsa was apparently established by Pope Urban VI in 1386, from territory removed from the Diocese of Volterra.Cappelletti, p. 277. The diocese of Colle was established by Pope Clement VIII on 9 June 1592, in the bull \\"Cum super universas\\". The territory (it was not even a village, or oppidum) of Colle was created a city (civitas).Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico- ecclesiastica Vol. XIV (Venice: Tip. Emiliana 1842), p. 138. The impulse for the new diocese came from Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the papal bull and a letter from Ferdinando to the people of Colle indicate.Ughelli III, pp. 205, 208. The new bishop, Usimbardo Usimbardi, a Canon of the cathedral of Florence and a personal friend of Duke Ferdinando, was appointed on the same day as the establishment of the diocese.Ughelli III, p. 207, quoting a letter of Pope Clement of 9 June 1592; and p. 208. Usimbardo's brother Pietro was already Bishop of Arezzo (1589‚Äì1612): Eubel III, p. 112. The Chapter, which staffed and administered the new cathedral, was composed of three dignities (the Archpriest, the Dean, and the Archdeacon) and twelve Canons.Ughelli III, p. 204. Bishop Usimbardo Usimbardi (1592‚Äì1612) held the first diocesan synod in April 1594, and promulgated a set of Constitutions for the government of the diocese.Biadi, pp. 185-186. =Reorganization of dioceses= In a decree of the Second Vatican Council, it was recommended that dioceses be reorganized to take into account modern developments.Directoriae normae clare a Concilio impertitae de dioecesium recognitione; indicia atque elementa apta ad actionem pastoralem aestimandam ab episcopis suppeditata quibus plurium dioecesium regimen commissum est. A project begun on orders from Pope John XXIII, and continued under his successors, was intended to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy. The change was made urgent because of changes made to the Concordat between the Italian State and the Holy See on 18 February 1984, and embodied in a law of 3 June 1985. The change was approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Papal Curia on 30 September 1986. The diocese of Colle di Val d‚ÄôElsa was united to the dioceses of Siena and of Montalcino. Its name was to be Archidioecesis Senensis-Collensis-Ilcinensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Siena. The former cathedral in Colle and the former cathedral in Montalcino were to have the honorary title of co-cathedral, and their chapters were to be the Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one episcopal curia, one seminary, one ecclesiastical tribunal; and all the clergy were to be incardinated in the Archdiocese of Siena-Colle di Val d'Elsa- Montalcino.Acta Apostolicae Sedis An. et Vol. LXXIX (Citt√† del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 783-786..

The home field of the CSU Rams of the Mountain West Conference, it opened in 2017 on August 5, and hosted its first game on August 26. It replaced Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium, which had been the Rams' home since 1968. The field has a conventional north-south alignment at an elevation of above sea level.  Development  After a nearly two-year process including cost and financing changes, protests, community outreach, and an inter-governmental agreement with the city of Fort Collins, the $220 million, 41,000-capacity on-campus multi-purpose stadium began construction in May 2015. In 2013, the university began raising funds for a ~40,000-seat on-campus facility to replace Hughes Stadium. The project was partially driven by major decreases in state funding for CSU in recent decades. As a result, CSU has been seeking to draw more out-of-state students, whose current tuition is three times that of Colorado residents. CSU president Anthony A. Frank included the new stadium as part of this goal saying \\"the new facility will help build a winning football team while advancing one of the school's highest priorities: attracting more out-of-state students\\". According to The Wall Street Journal, > \\"Skeptics, including some alumni and faculty, see the project as a > boondoggle‚Äîespecially for a team that plays in a relatively low-profile > athletic conference and doesn't sell out its current 32,500-seat stadium off > campus. The debate has sparked dueling websites, animated letters to the > editor and arguments about the role of sports at a university.\\" Many community members expressed frustration that they did not feel they were being heard at the CSU Board of Governors meeting when final approval was given. After the vote Board chair, Dorothy Horrell, thanked those making comments for their input and reiterated her feeling that > \\"the decision to build an on-campus stadium was made after \\"thoughtful and > thorough examination of this issue\\" that is reflected in the board's > records. \\"As my parents used to tell me, just because I ask a question and > didn't get the answer I wanted, it isn't that the question wasn't answered,\\" > Horrell said. \\"And I would just remind us all of that.\\" The new stadium, initially estimated to cost $246 million, was originally only to be built if $125 million in private funds had been raised by October 2014. Plans were put on hold after fundraising support for the project failed to materialize as expected, according to a September 26, 2014, story in the Denver Business Journal. On November 29, 2014, Frank sent a memo to the school's board of governors recommending that the new stadium be approved without raising the 50% cost in public funds as previously planned. The memo estimated that a 35,900-seat facility would cost $195 million; building with a capacity of 41,200 would cost $220 million. Frank also estimated that renovating Hughes Stadium to last 30 to 40 years would cost a minimum of $149 million. The board of governors approved a new on campus multi-purpose stadium on December 5, 2014. At that time NBCSports.com writer Brent Sobleski speculated that the hiring of Rams head coach Jim McElwain for the head coaching vacancy at Florida days earlier may have swayed the board, noting, \\"An improving program and a new stadium could help lure another top-level candidate like the school previously did when McElwain was initially hired.\\" CSU went on to hire Mike Bobo from the SEC like McElwain before him. University of Georgia's Coach Bobo was named the nation's Offensive Coordinator of the Year in 2013 by 247Sports.com. Georgia also had the top scoring offense in the SEC in 2014, Bobo's last season before heading to CSU. Construction of the new stadium, tentatively known as Colorado State Stadium, began in May 2015; the official groundbreaking ceremony was held the weekend of CSU's September 12, 2015 home football game against Minnesota. The first game in the new stadium was August 26, 2017, when the Rams defeated Oregon State 58-27.  Stadium donations  In March 2016, the university announced that it had received an anonymous gift of $20 million over a 30-year period with the express purpose of naming the playing field at the new stadium after former Rams head coach Sonny Lubick, whose name was also attached to the playing field at Hughes Stadium. This gift was roughly the amount that the university had hoped to make by selling the naming rights to both the stadium and the field. In August of that year, New Belgium Brewing Company, an iconic, local Fort Collins brewery, donated $4.3 million to put its name and its product on the party deck of the north end zone of the $220 million stadium.http://source.colostate.edu/csu-new-belgium-brewing-craft-agreement- creating-new-belgium-porch-at-on-campus-stadium New Belgium Brewing craft agreement creating New Belgium Porch at on-campus stadium This new bar area is called the New Belgium Porch. On April 19, 2018, CSU announced it had sold the naming rights of the stadium itself to Public Service Credit Union for $37.7 million over 15 years. The actual name was not revealed at that time because PSCU was in the process of adopting a new name, which was ultimately revealed on June 5 of that year as Canvas Credit Union. Accordingly, the stadium became Canvas Stadium.

History The original manor, never fortified, was built in 1680. Its successive owners continued to enlarge the area to develop the castle. In 1712, Joseph Charpentier, Lord of Brandelong and M√©liers, bought Boisgibault. The family obtained the right to have a chapel in Boisgibault in 1756. His son, Jacques Charpentier de Boisgibault (1721-1794), was Senior Judge and Pr√©sident of Court of Aids with Malesherbes and an advisor to King Louis XV, and later died in the French Revolution. The two wings of the castle have most likely been added in the 18th century. During the French Revolution, the castle and its backyard were sold. In 1829, the ch√¢teau was acquired by the Marquis de Gasville who made of Boisgibault one of the finest hunting property in Sologne by extending the walls of the park by more than a kilometer fence. The woods were drilled in wide avenues. He built a square pavilion called the telegraph. The ch√¢teau, oriented east-west, consists of an elongated building flanked by two wings. This set is characteristic of a residence of Sologne built for hunting, without much concern for outdoor setting. It nevertheless has a sober and balanced plan whose single character has remained very authentic.Gardens in spring, Ch√¢teau de Boisgibault on French TV France3 Preservation as a monument On December 31, 2001, the Ch√¢teau de Boisgibault was classified as a historic monument.Decree of Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau de Boisgibault See also *Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley *Gardens of the French Renaissance *List of castles in France  References  External links Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 16th century Category:Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley Category:Ancien R√©gime French architecture Category:Historic house museums in Centre-Val de Loire Category:Ch√¢teaux in Loiret Category:Loire Valley ","title":"Ch√¢teau de Boisgibault"},{"id":"50389586","text":"This is a list of members of the 26th South African Parliament.

This type of boot is said to be for traction, power, and agility, designed for deceptive players. Therefore, it is endorsed/worn by players, notably forwards, such as Robert Lewandowski, Harry Kane, Edinson Cavani, Gonzalo Higua√≠n, Mauro Icardi and Thiago. In 2017, 18-year-old prodigy Kylian Mbapp√© was given his own personalised boots, Nike Hypervenom 3. History A pair of HypervenomX Proximo Indoor (IC), which has a flat gum rubber sole. In May 2013, the Nike Hypervenom Phantom was launched. It was launched and designed for Brazilian forward Neymar. The boot is currently in its third version. There is one high- end model for the first version, the Hypervenom Phantom; whereas, there are two high-end models for the second version‚Äîthe Nike Hypervenom Phantom II, which is a mid-cut variant and the Nike Hypervenom Phinish, the low-cdmvut variant. However, Nike chose to discontinue the Nike Hypervenom Phinish from the third silo onwards due to confusion that the mid-cut version was better than the low-cut. The mid-cut version will be called \\"Hypervenom Phantom DF\\". The boot is available in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) or Artificial Ground (AG) versions in which all feature a glass nylon soleplate. There are also Turf (TF) and Indoor (IC) versions, in which the high-end model of these variants is the Nike HypervenomX Proximo. The SG soleplate features 6 removable aluminium studs, in which different studs with different lengths can be used, and 6 fixed bladed studs. The FG version has 12 bladed and conical studs. The AG model contains many circular and hollow studs, meant to have more pressure distribution and trapping air to reduce impact and prevent injuries. The silo was replaced by the \\"Phantom Venom\\" in January 2019.  Background  The Nike Hypervenom Phantom introduced several new features from other football boots at the time. It was made to replace the previous line, Nike Total 90 (T90), a line from Nike that has been around since 2000. This decision was met with mixed feelings, in which some say it is a good decision to replace the older line, and the others saying it was not a beneficial idea, as there were not many 'power' boots on the market. The Hypervenom was launched in May 2013, with the Barcelona player, at the time, Neymar, the main poster boy for this new line. The launch colourway was black/bright citrus. All boots were made in Soft Ground (SG), Firm Ground (FG) varieties, with the SG version using removable studs. The upper of the first boot has a newly developed material of NikeSkin.  Hypervenom Phantom  The Hypervenom Phantom was released in May 2013. The boot was first known through a Nike commercial \\"Nike Hypervenom - Deadly Breed\\". Later on, more commercials will be made starring Neymar in which the video is counting down to the released date of the Hypervenoms. The boot are advertised to be for \\"fit, touch and traction\\". The boots are originally released in the black/bright citrus colourway. The Hypervenom Phantom features a NikeSkin upper, combining mesh webbing and thin layers of polyurethane to create a material that is soft and flexible, All-Conditions Control (ACC) for the same control for any condition, whether wet or dry. The upper of the Hypervenoms is honeycomed-like in design. It also feature a lightweight, perforated anatomical sockliner for low-profile cushioning and has a responsive glass nylon chassis with agility traction stud pattern for agility, comfort and durability. Those who use these boots have said that they are able to move freely with ease and felt comfortable in those boots. However, some argue that it lacks proper tightness that they encounter issues such as roll-over or heel slippage. There are also some who said that the boots are not durable and lasted quite a short time under frequent use. During the knockout stages of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, following a 4‚Äì1 win over Cameroon in which Neymar scored the tournament‚Äôs 100th goal, Nike commemorated this with a special edition pair of Gold/Volt/Black Hypervenom boots. This was also made because Neymar spray painted his football boots gold when he was 12 years old. In early 2015, the Liquid Diamond Hypervenom was released. It was made to help Neymar \\"stand out\\" in a match, to describe Neymar's energetic style of playing and the feelings that Neymar had to his sister was \\"rare, like diamonds\\" as stated in a Nike commercial. In mid-2015, the Hypervenom Phantom Transform SE was released. It features a special upper that changes from black to orange when heat is applied to it. This was the last edition of the Hypervenom Phantom I. Models = Hypervenom Phantom II/Hypervenom Phinish = Two years after the Hypervenom Phantom I was released, the new Hypervenom Phantom II and Hypervenom Phinish was released. This time, there were significant changes to the upper in terms of design and fit. The launch colourway is Wolf Grey/Total Orange/Black. = Hypervenom Phantom II = The Hypervenom Phantom II is a mid-cut boot due to the Nike Dynamic Fit Collar which is made out of Flyknit said to provide ankle support. As before, it has an ACC upper. It also features a different NikeSkin upper from the previous version. One of the difference was the use of Nike's Flywire technology to provide a lock-in and tightened feel for a cleaner strike. = Change of upper = Due to the complaints about the new upper being too stiff, Nike opted to change the upper to the original ones on the Nike Hypervenom 1, effective 29 May 2016. = Hypervenom III = In February 2017, Nike introduced the next generation of Hypervenom shoes with the Nike Hypervenom III. Nike did away with the Phinish and renamed erent experience from the Phantom II. = Hypervenom X = As the demand for urban football (street/cage football) is high, Nike created urban football boots using the same materials and/or design of their pitch football boots. The main difference in this line of Hypervenom is the use of gum rubber for the sole of the indoor and turf design. = HypervenomX Proximo = The HypervenomX Proximo has exactly the same upper as the Hypervenom Phantom III. The only difference is use of a non- marking rubber sole for traction on indoor or turf courts and not including the PORON foam inserts = HypervenomX Finale = The HypervenomX Finale is the high-end low-cut model of the HypervenomX line. However, the upper is different compared to the upper used on the Hypervenom Phantom model. The upper is rather similar to the upper on the first version of the Hypervenom line, the Hypervenom Phantom 1. It also lacks ACC(All-Conditions Control).

The Dulas bridge, near Hay station, was a joint counties bridge‚ÄîBrecknock and Radnor. Those counties refused to widen the bridge to correspond with the improvements of the Local Board, and the chairman of the Local Board (F. R. Trumper, Esq.) undertook and succeeded in raising the money for doing the work by public subscription. The rebuild was completed in 1884. Preceding the rebuild, the bridge was partly of stone and partly of wood, which itself replaced a stone bridge of seven arches, destroyed by a flood in 1795, and some remains of which form part of the later structure. Toll was taken on this bridge under the authority of an act of parliament obtained in the 29th of George II., which granted that privilege for a term of 98 years, from the first day of August, 1763, at the expiration of which the bridge was to be tollfree. Early history There is no record of there having been a bridge over the River Wye at Hay, till past the middle of the 18th century. In remote times the inhabitants of the town and feudal lords of Hay Castle, most likely looked upon the Wye as a serviceable barrier against a sudden incursion of an enemy from that quarter; whilst for all legitimate purposes the coracle or the ford would give ample accommodation. But as the people of the district became more civilized, they would naturally desire a less primitive means of crossing the river; public subscriptions were invited, and as a result a large abutment wall and three piers were built, but then the work stopped for want of funds, but in the 29th year of the reign of George II., an act of parliament was obtained, appointing commissioners with powers to erect a bridge and to levy tolls for its maintenance. The following were the commissioners first appointed, viz.: Sir Edward Williams, Bart.; Thomas Beavan, of Court Evan Gwynn, George Devereux, Thomas Hughes, Esq.; Roger Jones, gent.; James Price, gent.; William Stephens, clerk; Henry Probert Howarth, clerk; John Jones, apothecary; Hugh Price, John Gwynn, Edward Allen, Henry Wellington, mercer; and Thomas Beavan, of the Court of Clyro. By authority of this act the commissioners entered into a covenant with Thomas Jones, of Llanthomas, John Harris, of Eardisley, and James Lloyd Harris of the town of Kington, for the erection of a bridge, and granting to them and their heirs a lease of the tolls arising therefrom for a period of 98 years, from 1 October 1768, at the expiration of which term the bridge would revert to the trustees for the time being. The said Thomas Jones was to pay the expense of procuring the Act of Parliament, which cost ¬£278 8s. 4d., and other things! The lessees built a stone bridge consisting of seven arches over the Wye, and made the approaches on both sides. In February, 1795, the centre part and south end of the bridge was washed away by a great flood, which happened after the breaking up of a long and severe frost. Two arches only were left standing on the Raduorshire side, or north side, of the river. Long before this period the three lessees were dead. After the flood and the falling down of the bridge, James Lloyd Harris (son of one of the lessees) erected a temporary bridge of wood across the river, and continued to receive the tolls. Within the following five years he erected a timber bridge from the Brecknockshire side of the river, to communicate with the two stone arches of the old stone bridge which had been left standing by the flood. This was in contravention to the lease, because a stone bridge should have been erected. In 1839, the Dulas Bridge was described as having one arch. 1884 rebuild On the breaking up of a severe frost in the winter of 1854-5, a great part of the timber bridge was broken down by the ice, and all communication between the county of Radnor and the town of Hay was stopped. During the suspension of traffic a boat was put upon the river by the inhabitants of Hay and neighbourhood, a little above the fallen bridge, for the convenience of foot passengers. In 1861 the lease expired, and consequently the Commissioners were empowered to make what arrangements they liked. They found it necessary to rebuild the bridge,* but they had no remedy against the original lessees. They entered into negotiations with Mr. Thomas Savin (the contractor for the Hereford, Hay, and Brecon Railway), with the result that in 1862 he agreed with the Commissioners to rebuild the bridge in consideration of having the tolls assigned to him for 99 years. The present bridge was completed in 1865, and the Commissioners then granted a lease to Mr. Savin for 99 years. The lease dated from 7 April 1862. The lease was afterwards transferred to T. E. Williams (Peterchurch), William Farr (Dorstone), and John Andrew. A new site has recently been purchased for a toll-house by the Commissioners from the Midland Railway Company, and a toll- house erected thereon by the lessees. The present bridge, which cost between ¬£7,000 and ¬£8,000, was designed by W. E. Hughes, of London.

Loyal Publication Society, 1864, p17-22 Hanks' sympathy for blacks in the department occasionally put him at odds with department commander General Nathaniel Banks, who struggled to balance the needs of the ex-slaves with gaining support of Louisiana planters for his command. Hanks strongly advocated for opening schools for young blacks, and together with Thomas W. Conway, organized a system of freedman schools in New Orleans. Schools began opening in the fall of 1863.Peyton McCrary, Abraham Lincoln and Reconstruction: The Louisiana Experiment, Princeton University Press, 2015, pp. 156-158 On August 27, 1863, Hanks was appointed by Major General Nathaniel Banks, along with Colonel John S. Clark and Major B. Bush Plumley, to a commission to regulate the enrollment, recruitment, employment, and education of blacks in the Department of the Gulf, of which Banks was the senior commander.\\"The Negroes of Louisiana\\", Press (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), Friday, September 4, 1863. Page: 1 A woodcut of the slaves Hanks brought northeast that appeared in Harper's Weekly on 30 January 1864 with the caption, \\"Emancipated Slaves, White and Colored\\", based on a photograph by Myron Kimball With the support of Major General Nathaniel Banks, in November and December 1863, Hanks embarked on a publicity campaign to eastern Union States with the goal to raise money for the education of former slaves in Louisiana. At the time, Hanks was also colonel of the 18th Infantry Regiment, Corps d'Afrique, a unit raised in Louisiana that consisted mostly of free persons of color who had formerly been in the state militia. Hanks took eight former slaves on tour with him, five of them children, and four of these appearing to be white. He took the group to photo studios to have cartes de visite printed, which he sold to raise money for schools. Myron H. Kimball took photos of the former slaves, one of which was published as a woodcut in Harper's Weekly on January 30, 1864.Hambourg, Maria Morris.

Photography and the American Civil War. Metropolitan Museum of Art, 7 May 2013, p157 During his trip, Hanks visited his wife, who was living in Burlington, Connecticut. In that town, there were protests against him and his mission, which included an egging of the house where he was staying. In April 1864, Hanks returned to New Orleans where he was Superintendent of Negro Labor. One task he pursued was extending freedom to the children of emancipated slaves who were still being held by their parents' former owners.Rothman, Adam. Beyond Freedom's Reach. Harvard University Press, 2015 p163 Hanks worried that Southern planters felt no loyalty to the United States and had no interest to the freedom of blacks, saying that after the war, \\"to be left without national guarantees for the maintenance of their civil rights as freemen would be worse than slavery.\\"Escott, Paul D. \\"What Shall We Do with the Negro?\\": Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America. University of Virginia Press, 2009. p88 In September 1864, Hanks was suspended by Banks for mismanagement, but was quickly exonerated and reinstated.Colonel Hanks.

After Herschel Walker, he remains the most highly recruited signee in the history of Georgia football. As a senior at Carver High School, he was named the top offensive prospect in the entire country by The National Recruiting Advisor. But in college, Sanks was kicked off the team for violating the Bulldogs‚Äô three-strikes drug policy, ending a promising career in professional football. As a result of that, Sanks was not drafted, nor did he even have a free-agent tryout with an NFL team. A documentary titled Inches Away is being made about his career and choices. Biography Jasper Sanks was born to Joe and Jeanette Sanks in 1978 at Columbus, Georgia. He went to Carver High School, for academic reasons he was forced to attend Fork Union Military Academy in 1997. He spent the next four years at University of Georgia where he majored in education. After college, he worked as an engineer handling explosives for Pro Oil Fields an oil company in Houston, Texas. He received a bachelor of science degree in management from the University of Phoenix in 2006. He married UGA volleyball player, Kristine Keese who lettered from the university the same year as him. They together have two daughters. In 2008, his twin brother Jarvis Sanks was shot dead. All the three accused were indicted on charges of the deaths of Jarvis Sanks. Career =High school and prep school= In 1996 during his high school days, he set a school record with 5,043 career rushing yards. He also kicked a school-record 48-yard field goal. Sanks was named in All-USA first team by USA Today. Atlanta Journal-Constitution named him in Super Southern 100, top 50 in Georgia and First Team class AAAA All-State. Fox Sports named him All-South player of the year. He was invited to play in the 1997 Georgia North-South All-Star Game. In prep school, he was named most valuable offensive player. =College= In 1998 during his freshmen year, Sanks underwent hernia surgery. He was out most of the season due to his injuries. He played only two games as a backup running back. In 1999, he led the team in rushing with 896 yards on 177 carries. He started at right back in Georgia's 28‚Äì25 come-from- behind overtime victory over Purdue in the Outback Bowl, the biggest comeback in bowl history (from 25-0 deficit). In the year 2000, he was again the team's leading rusher. In 2001. he missed most of the games due to right knee sprain. He was also kicked off the team towards the end of his senior season for receiving a third strike against UGA‚Äôs marijuana-use policy. During his sophomore year, in the Georgia-Georgia Tech game, the seven-man crew of referees ruled that Sanks fumbled at the 1-yard line in the final seconds of the game. Television replays showed that the ball popped out after Sanks hit the ground. The score was 48‚Äì48 when the ball was awarded to Tech. Georgia Tech won 51‚Äì48 in overtime. Documentary A documentary about his life titled Inches Away was expected to be released in 2016. The movie is directed by Will Santana.

III, Count of Werl, and Richenza of Swabia. Rudolf was the brother of his predecessors Henry I the Long and Lothair Udo III. In 1106 Rudolf became Margrave of Nordmark and Count of Stade after the death of his brother Lothair Udo III, as regent and guardian for Lothair's son Henry II. The Count of Stade was effectively administered by Friedrich while Henry II was still underage. In 1112, Rudolf allied himself with Lothair of Supplinburg, then Duke of Saxony (and later Holy Roman Emperor) in opposing Emperor Henry V, and as a result was deposed from his position. He was replaced as margrave by Helperich von Pl√∂tzkau until 1114 when his nephew Henry became of age. Rudolf was married to Richardis (Richgard), daughter of Hermann von Sponheim, Burgrave of Magdeburg, and granddaughter of Siegfried I, Count of Sponheim. Rudolf and Richardis had five children: * Udo IV, Margrave of the Nordmark and Count of Stade (as Udo V) * Rudolf II, Margrave of the Nordmark and Count of Stade * Hartwig, Count of Stade and Archbishop of Bremen * Lutgard of Salzwedel, married to Frederick II, Count of Sommerschenburg, Herman II, Count of Winzenburg, and Eric III, King of Denmark * Richardis von Stade, Abbess at Bassum and close confidant of Saint Hildegard von Bingen. Rudolf was deposed as margrave in 1112 and replaced by Helperich until his nephew Henry reached the age of maturity. Rudolf was succeeded as Count of Stade by Friedrich, not part of the House of Udonids, although it is unclear as to the precise dates of transition.

At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number PIN 3429/1157 was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva named the species L. incognitum, with the specific epithet derived from the Latin \\"incognitum\\", which means unknown. L. incognitum is one of a number of species in Liometopum that have been described.

The episcopal see was the town of Mottola, where the church of Santa Maria Assunta, also dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, patron of the city, served as a cathedral. History The Diocese of Mottola was erected in Norman times, after they conquered the city in 1023. The first bishop historically documented is John, mentioned in the diploma of 1081 in which Riccardo Siniscalco, Lord of Mottola and Castellaneta, donated some churches of Mottola and Massafra at the abbey of Cava, \\"assensum Ioannis Mutulensis episcopi,\\" that is, \\"with the consent of John, the bishop of Mottola.\\"Testo del diploma in: Guerrieri, Il conte normanno Riccardo Siniscalco..., pp. 53-54.

In the diploma Amuro he signs as Mutulensis atque Castellanitensis ecclesie presul, bishop of the church of Mottola and Castellaneta, suggesting that at the time the two dioceses were united with one bishop. However, the union must have been short-lived, because in 1110 the Diocese of Mottola was again autonomous.

The Diocese of Mottola had several notable bishops: Bishop Angelo Pascali (1537-1550) participated in the Council of Trent; Scipione Rebiba (1551-1556), later Archbishop of Pisa and Cardinal Ludovico della Quadra (1664-1695), completed the construction Of the Rosary Chapel;http://www.beweb.chiesacattolica.it/diocesi/diocesi/576/ in 1600 Bishop Silvestro Tufo established the diocesan seminary, and Michele Palmieri (1798-1804) was the last bishop of Mottola. Fourteen years after the death of Palmieri, a period in which the seat remained vacant, with the agreement (6 February 1818) between Pope Pius VII and Ferdinand I of Bourbon King of Naples, the diocese was suppressed and its territories were united to the diocese of Castellaneta .

Life and career Boyle was born in 1910 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, one of two daughters of Effie L. Boyle and James E. Boyle. Her family moved to Ithaca, New York, when she was eight, and she would reside there for most of her adult life. She attended Ithaca High school and went on to graduate from Vassar College. Boyle studied photography for a time in New York City and thereafter opened a commercial and portrait photography business in Ithaca. One of her earlier bodies of documentary work is a set of photographs of Pennsylvania coal miners she took for Survey Graphic. \\"Three black children playing with dolls and alphabet blocks at Delta Cooperative\\" by Boyle Boyle was a member of a group of young socialists who volunteered to help the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (SFTU). In 1937 she was invited to photograph the life and work of Arkansas members of the SFTU, which had been organized three years earlier by struggling tenant farmers. Her photographs, shot with a Leica camera, document farmers and their families in the fields, at home, and at union meetings. Like the work of her contemporaries Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, her photographs unsparingly show the enormous difficulties faced by Southern farmers in this period, especially African Americans. At the same time, they record the strong communal spirit among Southern labor organizers and farmers. More than forty years later, Boyle returned to rephotograph some of the same people and places in 1982. Boyle served for a time as an editor for the Cornell University Press. A collection of her photographs is held at the Kheel Center, Cornell University, as part of its SFTU-related holdings. Boyle died in Ithaca on the last day of 2005.  Work  \\"A young Black girl operates a water pump at Delta Cooperative with balloon in her mouth\\" by Boyle Boyle often documented African Americans who persevered through the struggles of the Depression. Especially prominent in her work are the ideas of togetherness and shared struggle. Her photos depict how southern African Americans worked together to form a collective future that would benefit everyone. Many of her photos show African Americans picking cotton, working for unions, or just living daily life in their homes.

Life and career The son of a schoolteacher, Lloyd was born in March 1868 in Ystalyfera, Glamorgan. When he was five, the family moved to Ruthin, Denbighshire. Lloyd attended Ruthin Grammar School, where he later taught. He was an athletic schoolboy, excelling in the high jump, and his speed earned him a place on the left wing in the school football team; only later did he settle in the full-back position. He played for amateur touring teams and for Rhyl, and it was while a Rhyl player that he was selected as reserve for Wales' match against Ireland in Belfast in February 1891. When Seth Powell withdrew, Lloyd took his place at left back in a match that ended as a 7‚Äì2 win for the hosts. He played once more for Wales, in March 1895by which time he was a Ruthin playerin a 2‚Äì2 draw with Scotland. Lloyd married Helen Speakman in 1900. He studied for the priesthood at Trinity College Dublin, and in 1909 was ordained as a deacon and licensed to the curacy of St Matthew, Bootle. His last clerical post was as rector of Hughley, Shropshire, after which he lived in retirement first in Gloucester and then in Tickenham, Somerset, where he died in January 1942.

The residence time of a set of parcels is quantified in terms of the frequency distribution of the residence time in the set, which is known as residence time distribution (RTD), or in terms of its average, known as mean residence time. Residence time plays an important role in chemistry and especially in environmental science and pharmacology. Under the name lead time or waiting time it plays a central role respectively in supply chain management and queueing theory, where the material that flows is usually discrete instead of continuous.  History  The concept of residence time originated in models of chemical reactors. The first such model was an axial dispersion model by Irving Langmuir in 1908. This received little attention for 45 years; other models were developed such as the plug flow reactor model and the continuous stirred-tank reactor, and the concept of a washout function (representing the response to a sudden change in the input) was introduced. Then, in 1953, Peter Danckwerts resurrected the axial dispersion model and formulated the modern concept of residence time.  Distributions  Control volume with incoming flow rate fin, outgoing flow rate fout and amount stored m The time that a particle of fluid has been in a control volume (e.g. a reservoir) is known as its age. In general, each particle has a different age. The frequency of occurrence of the age \\\\tau in the set of all the particles that are located inside the control volume at time t is quantified by means of the (internal) age distribution I. At the moment a particle leaves the control volume, its age is the total time that the particle has spent inside the control volume, which is known as its residence time. The frequency of occurrence of the age \\\\tau in the set of all the particles that are leaving the control volume at time t is quantified by means of the residence time distribution, also known as exit age distribution E. Both distributions are assumed to be positive and to have unitary integral along the age: :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty E(\\\\tau,t)\\\\,d\\\\tau = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty I(\\\\tau,t)\\\\,d\\\\tau = 1 In the case of steady flow, the distributions are assumed to be independent of time, that is \\\\partial_tE=\\\\partial_tI=0 \\\\; \\\\forall t, which may allow to redefine the distributions as simple functions of the age only. If the flow is steady (but a generalization to non-steady flow is possible) and is conservative, then the exit age distribution and the internal age distribution can be related one to the other: :\\\\left.\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\frac{\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\frac{dm}{dt}=0 & \\\\[4pt] f_\\\\text{in}=f_\\\\text{out}=f & \\\\end{aligned}\\\\ \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\implies fE=-m\\\\frac{\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} Distributions other than E and I can be usually traced back to them. For example, the fraction of particles leaving the control volume at time t with an age greater or equal than \\\\tau is quantified by means of the washout function W, that is the complementary to one of the cumulative exit age distribution: : W(\\\\tau,t)=1-\\\\int_0^\\\\tau E(s,t)\\\\,ds Averages =Mean age and mean residence time= The mean age of all the particles inside the control volume at time t is the first moment of the age distribution: : \\\\tau_a(t) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\tau I(\\\\tau,t) \\\\,d\\\\tau The mean residence time or mean transit time of the particles leaving the control volume at time t is the first moment of the residence time distribution: : \\\\tau_t(t) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\tau E(\\\\tau,t) \\\\,d\\\\tau. The mean age and the mean transit time generally have different values, even in stationary conditions: * \\\\tau_a < \\\\tau_t: examples include water in a lake with the inlet and outlet on opposite sides and radioactive material introduced high in the stratosphere by a nuclear bomb test and filtering down to the troposphere. * \\\\tau_a = \\\\tau_t: E and I are exponential distributions. Examples include radioactive decay and first order chemical reactions (where the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of reactant). * \\\\tau_a > \\\\tau_t: most of the particles entering the control volume pass through quickly, but most of the particles contained in the control volume pass through slowly. Examples include water in a lake with the inlet and outlet that are close together and water vapor rising from the ocean surface, which for the most part returns quickly to the ocean, while for the rest is retained in the atmosphere and returns much later in the form of rain. =Turnover time= If the flow is steady and conservative, the mean residence time equals the ratio between the amount of fluid contained in the control volume and the flow rate through it: :\\\\left.\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\frac{\\\\partial I}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\frac{dm}{dt}=0 &  f_\\\\text{in}=f_\\\\text{out}=f & \\\\end{aligned}\\\\ \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\implies \\\\tau_t = \\\\frac{m}{f} This ratio is commonly known as the turnover time or flushing time. When applied to liquids, it is also known as the hydraulic retention time (HRT), hydraulic residence time or hydraulic detention time. In the field of chemical engineering this is also known as space time.Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering (4th Edition) by H. Scott Fogler, Prentice Hall PTR, 2005. Note that the residence time of a specific compound in a mixture equals the turnover time (that of the compound, as well as that of the mixture) only if the compound doesn't take part in any chemical reaction (otherwise its flow isn't conservative) and its concentration is uniform. Although the equivalence between the residence time and the ratio m/f doesn't hold if the flow isn't stationary or it isn't conservative, it does hold on average if the flow is steady and conservative on average, and not necessarily at any instant. Under such conditions, which are common in queueing theory and supply chain management, the relation is known as Little's Law. Simple flow models Design equations are equations relating the space time to the fractional conversion and other properties of the reactor. Different design equations have been derived for different types of the reactor and depending on the reactor the equation more or less resemble that describing the average residence time. Often design equations are used to minimize the reactor volume or volumetric flow rate required to operate a reactor.Chemical Engineering Kinetics and Reactor Design by Charles G. Hill, Jr. John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1977. =Plug flow reactor= In an ideal plug flow reactor (PFR) the fluid particles leave in the same order they arrived, not mixing with those in front and behind. Therefore, the particles entering at time t will exit at time t + T, all spending a time T inside the reactor. The residence time distribution will be then a Dirac delta function delayed by T: :E(\\\\tau) = \\\\delta(\\\\tau-T)\\\\, The mean is T and the variance is zero. The RTD of a real reactor deviates from that of an ideal reactor, depending on the hydrodynamics within the vessel. A non-zero variance indicates that there is some dispersion along the path of the fluid, which may be attributed to turbulence, a non-uniform velocity profile, or diffusion. If the mean of the distribution is earlier than the expected time T it indicates that there is stagnant fluid within the vessel. If the RTD curve shows more than one main peak it may indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation. In PFRs, reactants enter the reactor at one end and react as they move down the reactor. Consequently, the reaction rate is dependent on the concentrations which vary along the reactor requiring the inverse of the reaction rate to be integrated over the fractional conversion. : \\\\tau = C_{AO} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{(-r_A)}\\\\,df_A =Batch reactor= Batch reactors are reactors in which the reactants are put in the reactor at time 0 and react until the reaction is stopped. Consequently, the space time is the same as the average residence time in a batch reactor. : \\\\tau = N_{AO} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{(-r_A)V_R}\\\\,df_A =Continuous stirred-tank reactor= In an ideal continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR), the flow at the inlet is completely and instantly mixed into the bulk of the reactor. The reactor and the outlet fluid have identical, homogeneous compositions at all times. The residence time distribution is exponential: :E(\\\\tau) = \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\tau}{T}\\\\right). The mean is T and the variance is 1. A notable difference from the plug flow reactor is that material introduced into the system will never completely leave it. In reality, it is impossible to obtain such rapid mixing, as there is necessarily a delay between any molecule passing through the inlet and making its way to the outlet, and hence the RTD of a real reactor will deviate from the ideal exponential decay, especially in the case of large reactors. For example, there will be some finite delay before E reaches its maximum value and the length of the delay will reflect the rate of mass transfer within the reactor. Just as was noted for a plug- flow reactor, an early mean will indicate some stagnant fluid within the vessel, while the presence of multiple peaks could indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation. Short-circuiting fluid within the reactor would appear in an RTD curve as a small pulse of concentrated tracer that reaches the outlet shortly after injection. Reactants continuously enter and leave a tank where they are mixed. Consequently, the reaction proceeds at a rate dependent on the outlet concentration: : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{C_{A\\\\text{ in}}- C_{A\\\\text{ out}}}{-r_A}\\\\ =Laminar flow reactor= In a laminar flow reactor, the fluid flows through a long tube or parallel plate reactor and the flow is in layers parallel to the walls of the tube. The velocity of the flow is a parabolic function of radius. In the absence of molecular diffusion, the RTD is :E(\\\\tau)=\\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\tau \\\\leq T/2\\\\[5pt] \\\\dfrac{T^2}{2 \\\\tau^3} & \\\\tau > T/2. \\\\end{cases} The variance is infinite. In a real reactor, diffusion will eventually mix the layers so that the tail of the RTD becomes exponential and the variance finite; but laminar flow reactors can have variance greater than 1, the maximum for CTSD reactors. =Recycle reactors= Recycle reactors are PFRs with a recycle loop. Consequently, they behave like a hybrid between PFRs and CSTRs. : \\\\tau = C_{AO}(R+1) \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{(-r_A)}\\\\,df_A In all of these equations : -r_A is the consumption rate of A, a reactant. This is equal to the rate expression A is involved in. The rate expression is often related to the fractional conversion both through the consumption of A and through any k changes through temperature changes that are dependent on conversion. =Variable volume reactions= In some reactions the reactants and the products have significantly different densities. Consequently, as the reaction proceeds the volume of the reaction changes. This variable volume adds terms to the design equations. Taking this volume change into consideration the volume of the reaction becomes: : V_R = V_{R\\\\text{ initial}}(1-\\\\delta_A f_A) Plugging this into the design equations results in the following equations: Batch : \\\\tau = N_{AO} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{(-r_A)V_R(1-\\\\delta_A f_A)}\\\\,df_A Plug flow reactors : \\\\tau = C_{AO} \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{(-r_A)(1-\\\\delta_A f_A)}\\\\,df_A Continuous stirred-tank reactors : \\\\tau = \\\\frac{C_{A\\\\text{ in}}- C_{A\\\\text{ out}}}{-r_{AF}(1-\\\\delta_A f_A)}\\\\ Generally, when reactions take place in the liquid and solid phases the change in volume due to reaction is not significant enough that it needs to be taken into account. Reactions in the gas phase often have significant changes in volume and in these cases one should use these modified equations. Determining the RTD experimentally Residence time distributions are measured by introducing a non-reactive tracer into the system at the inlet. Its input concentration is changed according to a known function and the output concentration measured. The tracer should not modify the physical characteristics of the fluid (equal density, equal viscosity) or the hydrodynamic conditions and it should be easily detectable. In general, the change in tracer concentration will either be a pulse or a step. Other functions are possible, but they require more calculations to deconvolute the RTD curve. =Pulse experiments= This method required the introduction of a very small volume of concentrated tracer at the inlet of the reactor, such that it approaches the Dirac delta function. Although an infinitely short injection cannot be produced, it can be made much smaller than the mean residence time of the vessel. If a mass of tracer, M, is introduced into a vessel of volume V and an expected residence time of \\\\tau, the resulting curve of C(t) can be transformed into a dimensionless residence time distribution curve by the following relation: : E(t) = \\\\frac{C(t)}{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty C(t)\\\\, dt} =Step experiments= The concentration of tracer in a step experiment at the reactor inlet changes abruptly from 0 to C_0. The concentration of tracer at the outlet is measured and normalized to the concentration C_0 to obtain the non-dimensional curve F(t) which goes from 0 to 1: : F(t) = \\\\frac {C(t)}{C_0}. The step- and pulse-responses of a reactor are related by the following: : F(t) = \\\\int_0^t E(t')\\\\, dt' \\\\qquad E(t) = \\\\frac {dF(t)}{dt} A step experiment is often easier to perform than a pulse experiment, but it tends to smooth over some of the details that a pulse response could show. It is easy to numerically integrate an experimental pulse response to obtain a very high-quality estimate of the step response, but the reverse is not the case because any noise in the concentration measurement will be amplified by numeric differentiation. Applications =Chemical reactors= An RTD curve for a reasonably well-mixed reactor In chemical reactors, the goal is to make components react with a high yield. In a homogeneous, first-order reaction, the probability that an atom or molecule will react depends only on its residence time: :P_\\\\mathrm{R} = \\\\exp\\\\left(-k t\\\\right) for a rate constant k. Given a RTD, the average probability is equal to the ratio of the concentration a of the component before and after: :\\\\overline{P_\\\\mathrm{R}} = a_\\\\mathrm{out}/a_\\\\mathrm{in} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp\\\\left(-k t\\\\right)E(t) \\\\, dt. If the reaction is more complicated, then the output is not uniquely determined by the RTD. It also depends on the degree of micromixing, the mixing between molecules that entered at different times. If there is no mixing, the system is said to be completely segregated, and the output can be given in the form :a_\\\\mathrm{out} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty a_\\\\mathrm{batch}(t)E(t) \\\\, dt. For given RTD, there is an upper limit on the amount of mixing that can occur, called the maximum mixedness, and this determines the achievable yield. A continuous stirred-tank reactor can be anywhere in the spectrum between completely segregated and perfect mixing. The RTD of chemical reactors can be obtained by CFD simulations. The very same procedure that is performed in experiments can be followed. A pulse of inert tracer particles (during a very short time) is injected into the reactor. The linear motion of tracer particles is governed by Newton's second law of motion and a one-way coupling is stablished between fluid and tracers. In one-way coupling, fluid affects tracer motion by drag force while tracer does not affect fluid. The size and density of tracers are chosen so small that the time constant of tracers becomes very small. In this way, tracer particles exactly follow the same path as the fluid does . =Groundwater flow= Hydraulic residence time (HRT) is an important factor in the transport of environmental toxins or other chemicals through groundwater. The amount of time that a pollutant spends traveling through a delineated subsurface space is related to the saturation and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil or rock. Porosity is another significant contributing factor to the mobility of water through the ground (e.g. toward the water table). The intersection between pore density and size determines the degree or magnitude of the flow rate through the media. This idea can be illustrated by a comparison of the ways water moves through clay versus gravel. The retention time through a specified vertical distance in clay will be longer than through the same distance in gravel, even though they are both characterized as high porosity materials. This is because the pore sizes are much larger in gravel media than in clay, and so there is less hydrostatic tension working against the subsurface pressure gradient and gravity. Groundwater flow is important parameter for consideration in the design of waste rock basins for mining operations. Waste rock is heterogeneous material with particles varying from boulders to clay-sized particles, and it contains sulfidic pollutants which must be controlled such that they do not compromise the quality of the water table and also so the runoff does not create environmental problems in the surrounding areas. Aquitards are clay zones that can have such a degree of impermeability that they partially or completely retard water flow. These clay lenses can slow or stop seepage into the water table, although if an aquitard is fractured and contaminated then it can become a long-term source of groundwater contamination due to its low permeability and high HRT. =Water treatment= Primary treatment for wastewater or drinking water includes settling in a sedimentation chamber to remove as much of the solid matter as possible before applying additional treatments. The amount removed is controlled by the hydraulic residence time (HRT). When water flows through a volume at a slower rate, less energy is available to keep solid particles entrained in the stream and there is more time for them to settle to the bottom. Typical HRTs for sedimentation basins are around two hours, although some groups recommend longer times to remove micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and hormones. Disinfection is the last step in the tertiary treatment of wastewater or drinking water. The types of pathogens that occur in untreated water include those that are easily killed like bacteria and viruses, and those that are more robust such as protozoa and cysts. The disinfection chamber must have a long enough HRT to kill or deactivate all of them. =Surface science= Atoms and molecules of gas or liquid can be trapped on a solid surface in a process called adsorption. This is an exothermic process involving a release of heat, and heating the surface increases the probability that an atom will escape within a given time. At a given temperature T, the residence time of an adsorbed atom is given by :\\\\tau=\\\\tau_0 \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{E_\\\\mathrm{a}}{R T}\\\\right), where R is the gas constant, E_\\\\mathrm{a} is an activation energy, and \\\\tau_0 is a prefactor that is correlated with the vibration times of the surface atoms (generally of the order of 10^{-12} seconds). In vacuum technology, the residence time of gases on the surfaces of a vacuum chamber can determine the pressure due to outgassing. If the chamber can be heated, the above equation shows that the gases can be \\"baked out\\"; but if not, then surfaces with a low residence time are needed to achieve ultra-high vacuums. =Environmental= In environmental terms, the residence time definition is adapted to fit with ground water, the atmosphere, glaciers, lakes, streams, and oceans. More specifically it is the time during which water remains within an aquifer, lake, river, or other water body before continuing around the hydrological cycle. The time involved may vary from days for shallow gravel aquifers to millions of years for deep aquifers with very low values for hydraulic conductivity. Residence times of water in rivers are a few days, while in large lakes residence time ranges up to several decades. Residence times of continental ice sheets is hundreds of thousands of years, of small glaciers a few decades. Ground water residence time applications are useful for determining the amount of time it will take for a pollutant to reach and contaminate a ground water drinking water source and at what concentration it will arrive. This can also work to the opposite effect to determine how long until a ground water source becomes uncontaminated via inflow, outflow, and volume. The residence time of lakes and streams is important as well to determine the concentration of pollutants in a lake and how this may affect the local population and marine life. Hydrology, the study of water, discusses the water budget in terms of residence time. The amount of time that water spends in each different stage of life (glacier, atmosphere, ocean, lake, stream, river), is used to show the relation of all of the water on the earth and how it relates in its different forms. =Pharmacology= A large class of drugs are enzyme inhibitors that bind to enzymes in the body and inhibit their activity. In this case it is the drug-target residence time (the length of time the drug stays bound to the target) that is of interest. Drugs with long residence times are desirable because they remain effective for longer and therefore can be used in lower doses. This residence time is determined by the kinetics of the interaction, such as how complementary the shape and charges of the target and drug are and whether outside solvent molecules are kept out of the binding site (thereby preventing them from breaking any bonds formed), and is proportional to the half life of the chemical dissociation. One way to measure the residence time is in a preincubation-dilution experiment where a target enzyme is incubated with the inhibitor, allowed to approach equilibrium, then rapidly diluted. The amount of product is measured and compared to a control in which no inhibitor is added. Residence time can also refer to the amount of time that a drug spends in the part of the body where it needs to be absorbed. The longer the residence time, the more of it can be absorbed. If the drug is delivered in an oral form and destined for the upper intestines, it usually moves with food and its residence time is roughly that of the food. This generally allows 3 to 8 hours for absorption. If the drug is delivered through a mucous membrane in the mouth, the residence time is short because saliva washes it away. Strategies to increase this residence time include bioadhesive polymers, gums, lozenges and dry powders. =Biochemical= In size-exclusion chromatography, the residence time of a molecule is related to its volume, which is roughly proportional to its molecular weight. Residence times also affect the performance of continuous fermentors. Biofuel cells utilize the metabolic processes of anodophiles (electronegative bacteria) to convert chemical energy from organic matter into electricity. A biofuel cell mechanism consists of an anode and a cathode that are separated by an internal proton exchange membrane (PEM) and connected in an external circuit with an external load. Anodophiles grow on the anode and consume biodegradable organic molecules to produce electrons, protons, and carbon dioxide gas, and as the electrons travel through the circuit they feed the external load. The HRT for this application is the rate at which the feed molecules are passed through the anodic chamber. This can be quantified by dividing the volume of the anodic chamber by the rate at which the feed solution is passed into the chamber. The hydraulic residence time (HRT) affects the substrate loading rate of the microorganisms that the anodophiles consume, which affects the electrical output. Longer HRTs reduce substrate loading in the anodic chamber which can lead to reduced anodophile population and performance when there is a deficiency of nutrients. Shorter HRTs support the development of non-exoelectrogenous bacteria which can reduce the Coulombic efficiency electrochemical performance of the fuel cell if the anodophiles must compete for resources or if they do not have ample time to effectively degrade nutrients.

A fragment of the late fifteenth- century painting, originally some 30 meters (98.4 ft) wide, is displayed in the St. Nicholas Church, Tallinn. It is regarded as the best-known and as one of the most valuable medieval artworks in Estonia. It is the only surviving medieval Dance Macabre in the world painted on canvas. The Dance of Death theme is frequent in the art and literature of the late Middle Ages, where it functions as a memento mori, the admonition that all must die. In the face of Death all are equal. The skeletal figure of Death dances with mortals, hierarchically arranged to begin with popes and emperors and ending with peasants, fools, or infants.Anu M√§nd, Bernt Notke. Uuenduste ja traditsioonide vahel, n√§ituse kataloog, Eesti Kunstimuuseum, 2010 The figures are accompanied by a winging band in the Low German language, a dialogue in verse between Death and the other characters. \\"Dance Macabre\\", Death and the Pope Created at the end of the 15th century, Bernt Notke's Tallinn fragment reproduces the artist's work with 49 figures (finished by his workshop in 1463) in St. Mary's Church in L√ºbeck. The L√ºbeck work was at the beginning of the 18th century in such a bad condition that a copy was made by the painter Anton Wortmann in 1701. This copy perished in 1942. According to most accounts, the painting was installed at the St. Nicholas church sometime around 1493-95. The Tallinn version as preserved begins with the thirteenth figure; it is not certain how many figures the work originally depicted. Not recorded in the accounting records of St. Nicholas up to 1520 (with a first written reference from 1603), Notke's painting was most likely commissioned and paid for by private donors, a guild, or a brotherhood. It differs from the L√ºbeck original by its background and the content of its verses. St. Nicholas Church in Tallinn was badly damaged in a Soviet air raid on the city on the evening of March 9, 1944; most of the valuable interior was destroyed. Fortunately the Danse Macabre as well as other priceless artworks (notably the Hermen Rode altar from 1478) were stored elsewhere as the air raids were anticipated. The surviving fragment was restored in Moscow between 1962 and 1964 by P. Baranov, S. Globacheva, S. Titov, and G. Karlsen under the direction of V. Karaseva.

Description  The painting is in oils on canvas and its dimensions are 157 x 210 cm. It is owned by the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid. Ribera painted two other known canvases of the same subject. One is in the San Martino Museum and the other is in the National Gallery, London. History The painting comes from the collection of the Marquis de Heredia. The work's commissioner is unknown. The canvas is signed in the lower right corner on a rock according to the usual formula the artist used at the time: \\"Jusepe de Ribera 1633 Spanish.\\" Ribera was one of the most prolific painters, both in the quantity of works that came out of his workshop and its quality. Ribera painted the subject of the Piet√° on numerous occasions and with many different variations throughout his life. The earliest of his extant Piet√°s dates to 1620 (National Gallery) whilst two others were produced in 1633 (Thyssen Museum) and 1637 (Charterhouse of San Martino, Naples). Description The work is part of a transition period in which the artist, without leaving the shadows of tenebrism, began to experiment with new coloring. The body of Christ is framed horizontally to other figures in the composition. On the right John the Apostle subject's back while lying at her feet, Mary Magdalene kisses with grief. In the center, veiled by the chiaroscuro technique it shows us a Mary with a face ravaged by pain looking to the sky while hands together in prayer. Finally, the bottom right, the face of Joseph of Arimathea is appreciated. The spotlight of the composition focuses on the recumbent body giving an appearance of marble statue that enhances the expression of the physical pain of his wounds (especially from his side), the psychic pain expressed in his face, and the laxity of the body.

FHTS) is a steel plant established in the Vung Ang Economic Zone, Vietnam by the Hung Nghiep Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Company under the backing of the Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group. Development of the plant began in the 2010s. Steel production started in May 2017. History Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Corporation was formed in 2008 to establish a large iron and steelmaking plant at a deepwater port in Vietnam. The primary investor and developer was Formosa Plastics Group of Taiwan. In 2010 of land in K·ª≥ Anh District was allocated to the development company (Hung Nghiep Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Co) by Ha Tinh Province. Initially statements by the company estimated a $15 billion development cost to install 7.5 million tons pa steel capacity. In 2012 the developer Hung Nghiep Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Co estimated an increased project of $22 billion. Governmental incentives for the plant included low taxation in imported capital goods, low land taxes, and the development of infrastructure supporting the project. Employment due to the project was expected to be c. 10,000 person; with a second phase increasing production to 22 MT pa, and creating c. 30,000 jobs. A groundbreaking ceremony for the plant took place in 2 December 2012 in the presence of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. Associated developments included the Th·∫°ch Kh√™ iron mine (reserves 544 MT), 60km north; GW scale thermal electric powerstations; and the Vuang Ang-Son Duong deep sea port, capable of berthing ship of up to 300 to 500 thousand tons. In 2014 Formosa Plastics reached an agreement to invest $1.15 billion to acquire approximately one third of Fortescue Metals Group's Iron Ore Bridge project in western Australia, together with a $123 million investment into a related port project. In early 2015 China Steel (Taiwan) increased its holding in the plant from 5% to 25%, investing c. $940 million into the development of the plant. In mid 2015 JFE Steel (Japan) acquired a 5% stake ($215.2 million) in the plant. In late 2015 the plant outputted the first hot rolled coil manufactured in Vietnam. \\"Phase 1\\" Blast furnace iron production was scheduled to begin in 2016, with two blast furnaces at the plant having a total production capacity of 7.5 MT pa; approximately 6 MT were for flat steel production, and 1.5 MT for rebar and other rolled steels. Two further expansion phases, were planned to increase production to 15 MT and then 22.5 MT pa. The first blast furnace began production in May 2017. In 2017 the company announced an additional ~$350 million investment into the plant, part of which was for the installation of a coke dry quenching system. Equipment for the dry coke quenching was to be supplied by Nippon Steel & Sumikin Engineering Co. Ltd. (NSENGI) Formosa Ha Tinh Steel‚Äôs second blast furnace started operations in May 2018, a feasibility plan for the third blast furnace is expected for 2020 . 2016 mass fish deaths In April 2016 a mass fish poisoning in the sea near off the Vietnam coast was initially blamed on the steel plant - analysis of the sea water showed high phosphate and pH levels; subsequently Vietnamese authorities stated no link had been shown between the plant and fish deaths. The plant was later ordered to dig up and modify a waste pipe to allow easier monitoring by Vietnamese authorities. In May 2016 the company was found to have systematically evaded taxes and claimed excess tax refunds through stating the wrong tax codes for imported equipment - VND1.55 trillion (US$69.2 million) in tax refunds and VND5.5 billion ($245.54 million) in taxes were required to be paid to the government. In late June 2016 a government report found Ha Tinh steel responsible for the 2016 fish poisoning incident. Formosa Ha Tinh Steel agreed to pay $500 million (11.5 trillion VND) compensation for the discharge, which contained phenol, cyanides and iron hydroxides. The company blamed the discharge on errors by subcontractors during a trial operation phase. A governmental report found the origin of the pollution to be from water from wet coke quenching, which was released into the sea after a power supply failure at the plant's waste treatment facilities. According to experts monitoring human trafficking the environmental disaster at Ha Tinh led to increased trafficking of young vietnamese to Europe, due to the loss of livelyhood to local fishermen from the event; victims of the 2019 Essex lorry deaths included people from Ha Tinh province. Other incidents *In ~2013 Chinese workers at the complex, some of who lacked proper work visas, were reported as causing some security and order issues in the local are - an affray between vietnamese locals and chinese workers was reported at Lien Phu village in Aug 2013. *During anti-Chinese riots in May 2014 (see 2014 Vietnam anti-China protests.) the plant was attacked by rioters, with fires started; four Chinese workers were killed, with 3,000 forced to leave due to the riots. As a result of the riots construction work was halted for ten weeks, resuming in July 2014. *In March 2015 a scaffolding collapse at the construction site caused the deaths of 16 workers, and injuring or trapping over 100. *On 30 May 2017, a day after test operations were resumed since the marine life disaster in 2016, a lime kiln at the steel plant exploded. No casualties were reported. The explosion was caused by a blocked Lime kiln dust filter.

He was active in Heraklion, Crete during the second half of the 15th century.  Life  He lived and worked in Heraklion, Crete (referred to at the time by the Venetians as Candia) during the second half of the 15th century. In 1470 there was evidence he was teaching painting to children of nobles. He died between 1504 and 1512. Like other contemporaries Cretan School painters painted pictures by following different styles and yielding various iconographic themes in the Byzantine and \\"italokritika\\" works. His works addressed Orthodox and Catholic doctrine. Main means of expression of an image, an object of reverence looked up positions both in churches and monasteries as well as in residential homes.  Art and work  Considered a teacher, master of art and literature his clientele consisted of wealthy burghers and nobles. The project is small in number but high quality, but the artistic activity was so long it is likely to assume that even latent projects mainly western churches or in private collections. Archival documents in Venice provide information about the life of the painter in Heraklion, Crete, covering the period from 1470, appearing as a teacher of painting, until 1512 when he is recorded as already dead. The years 1471, 1473 and 1479 he was involved in economic affairs in Heraklion, where he lived.

On October 24, 1492 by Andreas Pavias pentor signed a contract with Manousos Koukou, a resident of Heraklion, to teach his son painting for five years. In 1493 he was again involved in economic affairs in Heraklion. During the period of the years 1493-1505 we know that the Catholic Bishop Giovanni Battista Lagni commissioned an image of the Pieta in Crete, which is currently in Rossano. On 23 May 1499, he agreed to teach painting for three years to Niccolo da Napoli, and on July 16 of the Andreas Pavias depentor same time signed an apprenticeship contract for four years with John Ploraio. On November 19, 1499 he agreed with Jewish Aquilo (Soulouma) to teach her son not only painting but also letters to eight years. On 7 May 1500, he requested to be returned a picture of the Nativity Angel painter. In March of the same year again referred to economic matters.

Oidupaa created his own style of kargyraa performance (high-tone kargyraa accompanied by the bayan), known as Oidupaa style and developed further by notable Tuvan performers including Chirgilchin. The Oidupaa style has been compared to Blues. He spent 33 years in jail before he became known as musician. In jail, he converted to Christianity. In 2007, Oidupaa appeared at the Channel One Russia in Moscow in one of the contest programs, but was booed from the podium before he could finish his performance, and Tatyana Tolstaya, one of the jury members, arrogantly called his style \\"discordant\\" and \\"disharmonious\\".

The fuel, suction gas, was generated on-board the locomotive from coal. In 1923, the South African Railways experimented with gas-electric motive power and constructed a single experimental producer gas- electric locomotive. The locomotive remained in service for several years and was followed by another, built by the General Electric Company, which was not successful and never entered line service after undergoing experimental trials. The gas-electric concept was eventually superseded by diesel-electric traction.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, October 1945. pp. 782-783.Heymans, Brig. H.B.; Parsley, Dr. G.M.J. (2000).The SAR Experimental Suction Gas-Electric Locomotive. Paper dated 28 September 2000. Branch line non-profitability The non-profitability of many branch line operations had been a problem for the South African Railways (SAR) from the outset. The question of non-paying branch lines was raised by Sir William Hoy, South African Railways and Harbours General Manager, in a paper read at the Imperial Motor Transport Conference in London in 1913. He drew attention to the fact that, in isolated districts with vast agricultural and mineral capabilities in many parts of the Union of South Africa, development was hampered by the lack of means of transportation. In an attempt to reduce the cost of using steam locomotives on infrequently used and non-profitable branch lines, other forms of motive power were considered in the early 1920s. Diesel and diesel-electric locomotives were still in their infancy and were therefore not yet an attractive proposition, while the cost of electrification of such branch lines would be prohibitive. The first alternative form of traction to enter service was the Dutton road-rail tractor system in 1923. During October 1922, Hoy encouraged further experiments to determine the practicability of the use of suction gas (also known as producer gas) as fuel for an alternative form of motive power, suitable for use on branch lines. Mr. C. Lawson, Superintendent Mechanical of the SAR, was tasked with the experiment. Suction gas principle Combustion gases, rich in carbon monoxide and known variously as water gas, producer gas and mond gas, are generated by passing air and steam through some kind of red-hot burning carbonaceous fuel, usually coal. The gas generator consists of a combustion portion, where the fuel is initially burned to generate the required steam. The steam is then blown through this same burning fuel, taking air with it, and the producer gas is then liberated as a by-product of this combustion. Ordinarily, burning produces carbon dioxide, but by forcing steam through the burn a certain amount of incomplete combustion is caused which produces carbon monoxide. Depending on the vessel used, the gas created may be under a slight pressure caused by the velocity of the steam and an expansion chamber is used to reduce this pressure. Experimenting established that the suction created by a petrol engine running on the gas actually increased the generation of the producer gas by drawing more steam and air through the burn. This could possibly make the expansion chamber superfluous. Producer gas generated by this method became known as suction gas. With a suction gas engine, the amount of gas produced is therefore partially dependent on the speed and throttle setting of the engine using it. Development Lawson's experimental locomotive was based on the same principle as contemporary Swedish diesel-electric locomotives, except that the diesel engine prime mover would be replaced by a petrol engine running on carbon monoxide producer gas. As with a diesel-electric locomotive, an electric generator and traction motor combination would be used to transfer the engine's power to the wheels. The locomotive was constructed on an old bogie truck underframe. The producer gas generator was constructed from the smokebox section of a scrapped 6th Class locomotive's boiler. Smokebox char was used as fuel and the gas was passed from the gas generator through suitable wet scrubbers to remove tar to two Tilling-Stevens petrol engines. The engines came from Whippet tanks and were obtained from the Defence Department. A gas expansion chamber was constructed from an old chimney. The two engines drove shunt wound dynamos, obtained from General Electric, to power the traction motors which were two tramway motors obtained from De Beers in Kimberley. Since the gas was generated by the suction from the two internal combustion engines, the vehicle became known as a suction gas locomotive. The locomotive ran in three forms. During the experimental stage, it was run from Germiston to Johannesburg station as a flat truck with all the components assembled on top and occupying about half of the deck space, but uncovered, to be viewed by the members of the Railway Board. During the testing stage, an enclosed body was added. During a test run to Volksrust, various adjustments were made to the water circulating arrangements. This improved the power output to the extent that the tram traction motors were unable to stand the continuous current which was generated, and they were replaced by two Siemens traction motors supplied by General Electric. These, in turn, required more current than the Whippet engines could generate and they were replaced by a Holt engine from a Caterpillar tractor, supplied by Messrs Fraser and Chalmers of Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia. The gas generator was never altered in principle from the first experiment and the expansion chamber was kept as it was, but the original wet scrubber was replaced with a dry scrubber early during development. Control of electrical current was by two tramway series- parallel controllers and resistors to ensure a range of speeds. The current generated with the engine at its normal working of 750 revolutions per minute was 140 amperes and 500 volts. 600 volts could be obtained by speeding up the engine, but this could place a too heavy load on the generator. Service In its final guise, a small third-class compartment for twenty passengers was added on the unused deck space at the rear. The locomotive, numbered GE1, was capable of negotiating a 3% curve at and could attain a top speed of on level track. The Gas-electric locomotive was finally placed in service on the Winter's Rush branch line from Kimberley, where it often hauled a passenger coach. It remained in service on that line for several years. Termination In June 1923, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, the SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer, approved plans for a suction gas locomotive, but it never materialised. In 1925, a new suction gas locomotive was purchased instead. It was designed to SAR specifications by Mr. Harry Ricardo of Ricardo Brothers of Shoreham and built by the General Electric Company in England. At the time, it was claimed to be the largest of its type in the world, but it never emerged from the trial stages. It was found that the variable demand on the gas generator precluded a regular supply of gas of the required quality. The gas-electric locomotive was eventually superseded by the diesel-electric locomotive, which proved to be a far more convenient and much less cumbersome machine to operate over long distances. No more suction gas locomotives were acquired. The experimental gas-electric locomotive's frame, bogies and traction motors were used c. 1935 to construct a unique electric motor coach, numbered 9181 and classified as U-34-M. It was placed in service hauling a trailer coach between Mason's Mill and Pietermaritzburg, where it was known as the Mason‚Äôs Mill Shuttle. Since the earlier Cape motor-coaches still worked under 1,500 V DC at the time, EMU no. 9181 was the first SAR motor-coach to operate under 3 kV DC catenary.Soul of A Railway, System 6, Part 5: The New Main Line from Rossburgh to Pietermaritzburg compiled by Les Pivnic.

It was recorded on 22 April 2016 at the Royal Albert Hall, with accompaniment from the Parallax Orchestra conducted by Simon Dobson. The album was released on 2 December 2016 through the crowdfunding platform PledgeMusic, with all proceeds being donated to Teenage Cancer Trust. Concert and response On 26 November 2015, it was announced that Bring Me the Horizon would be performing at the Teenage Cancer Trust concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 22 April 2016, being accompanied for the first time by a full live orchestra and choir. Tickets for the show went on sale on 4 December 2015. American rock band PVRIS performed as the opening act. Bring Me the Horizon performed alongside Parallax Orchestra conducted by Simon Dobson, and gave live debuts for That's the Spirit tracks \\"Avalanche\\" and \\"Oh No\\", as well as performing \\"It Never Ends\\" and \\"Empire (Let Them Sing)\\" (from There Is a Hell... and Sempiternal, respectively) for the first time since 2014. Response to the concert was widely positive. Writing for The Independent, Steve Anderson awarded it four out of five stars, praising the performances of both the band's recent, more subtle material and their earlier, heavier songs. Similarly, Tomas Doyle of Rock Sound hailed the show as \\"a special, special night\\", highlighting \\"It Never Ends\\" as the best song. Metal Injection's Greg Kennelty proclaimed that \\"Like 'em or not, Bring Me the Horizon performed a fantastic set\\". Following the success of the show, Fish hinted at the possibility of completing a full tour with an orchestra, noting that \\"It seems almost a bit of a shame to go to all this effort for months and months for just one night\\". Promotion and release In March 2016, it was announced that the show would be recorded and later released as a live video album, with all proceeds from the release going to Teenage Cancer Trust. After being initially slated for a 1 September 2016 release, the album was issued on 2 December 2016 on double CD, triple LP, double DVD, Blu-ray and digital download.

It was opened in July 1921 and is located in Hamburg, Germany, in the quarter of Langenhorn. Langenhorn is part of the borough of Hamburg-Nord. History The station was opened in July 1921, after the Langenhorn railway was in preliminary operation with steam trains since 5 January 1918. However, a preliminary platform at Langenhorn Nord station was opened only on 1 September 1919. The steam trains then used the track of the freight railway from Ohlsdorf to Ochsenzoll, which was located east of the U-Bahn tracks. It was used until 1991 and removed in 2008. There was little traffic at the beginning, but it increased during the 1920s, after nearby Fritz-Schumacher- Siedlung (Fritz Schumacher settlement) had been built. However, major apartment buildings in the area were constructed in the 1950s and 60s. In 1940 the platform was extended to facilitate the stop of longer trains. In 2013, the platform was fully renovated and elevated at the same time to allow handicapped persons a better access to the trains. The addition of a lift is projected. Station layout Langenhorn Nord is an elevated station with an island platform and two tracks. The station is not accessible for handicapped persons, as there is no lift. Service Langenhorn Nord is served by Hamburg U-Bahn line U1; departures are every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes in non-busy periods. Bus line 192, and night bus line 606 have a stop at the station, whereas the night buses and buses in northern direction stop at the nearby street of Tangstedter Landstra√üe, 100m east of the station.

The initiative was launched in 2015 by South Staffordshire MP, Gavin Williamson. Williamson gave the rationale for the celebration: \\"I‚Äôve seen other great counties pay tribute to their history and traditions and I think it‚Äôs only right that we honour the wonderful County of Staffordshire. There is so much to celebrate from history, food, tradition and people that hail from this extraordinary area.\\" 2016 was chosen for the first celebration as it marks the 1000th anniversary of the first mention of the county of Staffordshire. Williamson proposed that Staffordshire Day be held on 18 September, the birthday of Samuel Johnson (born in Lichfield). Staffordshire County Council took the idea on board and held a poll to decide the date. The candidate dates were: * 1 May - the anniversary of the founding of Josiah Wedgwood & Sons * 5 July - the anniversary of the discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard * 6 September - to commemorate Charles II hiding in a South Staffordshire oak tree after the Battle of Worcester * 18 September - the birthday of Samuel Johnson * 27 September - the anniversary of the death of James Brindley The poll was held in July 2015 and the chosen date was 1 May receiving 36% of the votes cast. Staffordshire Day 2016 Over 50 events were held across the county on Sunday 1 May. Locations included Lichfield Cathedral, Alton Towers, and Rudyard Lake.

He remained with West Brom for three years but never made a first team appearance for the club. At the end of the 1928‚Äì29 season, Martin was forced to undergo surgery after suffering a cartilage injury and was released by West Brom as the club believed he would never fully recover. In July 1929, Martin was offered a contract by Newport County manager Jimmy Hindmarsh and spent two months playing for the club's reserve side before being handed his professional debut. He embarked on a prolific scoring run, netting a hat-trick against Queens Park Rangers in his third appearance before scoring five in Newport's 10‚Äì0 victory over Merthyr Town shortly after. His form, scoring 34 goals in 27 league appearances, quickly attracted attention from other clubs and he signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers in May 1930 in exchange for ¬£1,500 and Cyril Pearce. He also won his only international cap for Wales in 1930 against Northern Ireland. Martin spent two seasons with Wolverhampton, scoring 9 goals in 15 league games, but struggled to establish himself in the first team and was allowed to join Swansea Town in July 1932. He made over 100 appearances for Swansea before joining West Ham United in July 1936. He was sent off in a match for West Ham for retaliating, becoming the first player to be dismissed for the club in 25 years and was allowed to leave the club without making any further appearances. He finished his career with Southend United.

He was involved in many social causes, notably the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movements of the 1960s and the gay pride movement. Background J. McRee Elrod worked in Korea, the United States, and Canada. He played a significant role in the creation of modern library practices in South Korea and his innovations in card cataloguing were adopted widely in the pre-digital age. He also pioneered a remote cataloguing service for special Libraries. As a minister and social activist, Elrod's beliefs and values evolved from liberal Christian to Humanist. He volunteered his efforts in support of many liberal political causes, including universal medical care, a medical rather than a criminal approach to problems created by drug addiction, as well as racial and sexual orientation equity., Mac's Values Family and education Elrod, known all of his life as \\"Mac,\\" was born in Gainesville, Georgia, on March 23, 1932, the only child of Angus Warren Elrod, a salesman, and Lona Mary McRee Elrod, a schoolteacher, and was christened Jefferson McRee Elrod. He subsequently rejected the name \\"Jefferson\\" because of its association with Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America. His parents separated when he was eleven years old and he was raised by his mother, who worked as a bookkeeper and office manager. He and his mother survived the devastating Gainesville tornado tragedy of 1936. For his elementary and secondary education, he attended a special demonstration school created by the University of Georgia where student teachers could conduct their practicums. It was considered to be the best school in the area at a time when Georgia, a poor state, had two separate school systems, one for whites and one for blacks. As a child, his opposition to the Jim Crow laws and racism was awakened when he heard some of his schoolmates hurling racial taunts at black children. As he himself knew how it felt to be ostracized and ridiculed by taunts of \\"fatty,\\" the young Mac Elrod felt empathy for the black children., Mac's Odyssey Elrod obtained his B.A. in History (magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa) at the University of Georgia in June, 1952. He attended the George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville, Tennessee as a Carnegie Fellow and obtained an M.A. in Information Technology in 1953. The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program He attended Scarritt College for Christian Workers, in Nashville, Tennessee and received a Master's in Theology in August, 1954. He later obtained a third master's degree in 1960, a Master of Science in Library Science (MLS), also from Peabody College. Elrod married Norma Lee Cummins, (1932 - ), the daughter of William \\"Buck\\" Cummins and Mary Evelyn Dunn Cummins, of Vienna, Illinois, on June 4, 1953. They met at the 16th quadrennial Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions conference in Lawrence, Kansas in 1951 as delegates of their respective universities. They had six children, five surviving, including one mixed-race adopted daughter, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Mac Elrod and his wife attended the Yale University Institute of Far Eastern Languages to learn Korean, prior to serving in Korea as educational missionaries.He received his certificate of completion of the two semester intensive course in May, 1955. He was also sent to work with African-American church congregations as it would give him, a white man, experience in working in a culture different from his own. I Invited Negroes To My Home Librarian =South Korea= Mac and Norma Elrod in Korea The Elrods were confirmed as missionaries to South Korea in June, 1955.[ https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=shNNAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=MjEDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6944%2C4186501] Rome News-Tribune - Jun 10, 1955 Elrod lived in Seoul, South Korea with his family from 1955-1960, sponsored by the Methodist Board of Missions. Elrod worked as a librarian at Yonsei University. Conditions in that country were very primitive, compared to the United States. The university library had sustained some bombing damage during the Korean War; some books had to be excavated from fallen plaster before being catalogued. The building was unheated and ink froze in the inkwells overnight., The Beginning Of Modern Library Science Education In Korea Korea has its own phonetic alphabet, (Hangul) which made it adaptable to classification systems such as the Dewey Decimal System. However, at that time, modern library procedures were not in use due to the Japanese occupation of the country from 1910 to 1945 and the suppression of the Korean language, followed by the devastating civil war. To adapt modern library cataloguing to Korean needs, Elrod designed a card catalogue with three parts. Eastern materials were listed in a Hangul section by author, title, and the usual added entries, plus Korean index cards for the classed catalogue. Western materials were listed in a Roman alphabet section by author, title, and the usual added entries, plus English index cards to the classed catalogue. These two sections flanked a third, a class catalogue, in which all library materials were listed by class number, and which for some material, included cards under class numbers in addition to the one by which the items were shelved. All material on the shelves were interfiled by class number, regardless of language. The rebuilding of the library led to Peabody Library School (now defunct) choosing Yonsei University as the institution to sponsor Korea's first library school. Elrod taught library science at the school. =United States= The Elrods returned to the United States in 1960, and lived in Nashville, Tennessee for a year while Elrod studied for his third master's degree. In 1961 he became the librarian at Central Methodist College. They lived next door to Bishop Abel Muzorewa, later Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, and their children played together. Subsequently, Elrod served as a guest professor in Nashville, Tennessee while obtaining his Master of Library Science. The Elrods moved to Ohio in 1963 when Elrod accepted a position as head cataloger at Ohio Wesleyan University. He supervised a re-classification from Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) to Library of Congress Classification (LCC). At this time, the Elrods became involved in the anti-Vietnam war movement, and eventually decided to emigrate from the United States. =Canada= Elrod served as head of the cataloguing department at the University of British Columbia (UBC) from 1967 to January 1979. There he devised an easier-to-use and maintain card catalogue which divided the catalogue into subject and author title portions, referred to as the divided ticked tracing catalogue. Classification headers were not typed at the top of cards but were rather ticked, or checked, in the tracing (tracing is the term for other cards created for additional access to resources recorded at the bottom of the main entry card) and filed behind subject cards in the subject catalogue. This system greatly speeded the cataloguing process because headers did not have to be checked ahead of time, but rather returned for a guide card if not found. This practise spread across Canada, however, the appearance of the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) made this distinction largely moot. While at UBC, Elrod noticed that librarians from local special libraries used to visit the university to manually copy information from the card catalogue to assist them in cataloguing their own collections. Recognizing a need for services to medical, forestry, government, legal, and corporate libraries, Elrod left UBC and founded Special Libraries Cataloguing in January 1979. Remote library cataloguing services became possible at that time because digital services such as the University of Toronto library automation service (UTLAS) had just come to Western Canada. =Special Libraries Cataloguing, Inc. (SLC)= Established in 1979, at the dawn of the digital age of library cataloguing, SLC provides remote cataloguing services to small special libraries worldwide and increasingly provides Machine-Readable Cataloguing Standards (MARC records) for electronic publishers and aggregators as opposed to individual libraries., Special Libraries Cataloguing, Inc. =Autocat= Elrod very much enjoyed participating in the automated cataloguing electronic discussion list (AutoCat listserve). His posts emphasized his belief that cataloguers should encourage practicality in cataloguing and service to patrons as a top priority.Rules Were Made for the Patrons, not Patrons for the Rules When he officially retired in March 2016 at age 84, he received numerous private accolades from colleagues from countries as diverse as Lebanon, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and Spain. Minister =Methodist= J. McRee Elrod Elrod was ordained in the Methodist Church before going to Korea,He was ordained in the Methodist Church on January 14, 1955. although he did not serve as a minister there. Raised in the Methodist church, Elrod's religious views evolved, particularly when he studied the works of Adolf von Harnack while a student at Scarritt College. Harnack's scholarship elucidated the difference between the historical Jesus and his sayings and Pauline Christianity. =African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME)= Elrod's ordination was transferred to the AME after his return to the United States. While living in Ohio, Elrod volunteered to be the minister for several small African Methodist Episcopal churches. Upon moving to Vancouver, Elrod briefly revived an AME church there, serving as a volunteer minister, but the black population at the time proved too small to sustain a church. The move to Vancouver coincided with a search for a new spiritual home. =Unitarian= The Elrods attended the newly-formed North Shore (North and West Vancouver) Unitarian Church and became Unitarians. The Elrods felt that the Unitarian congregations in the Vancouver area were more responsive to helping American war-objectors than many other denominations. Elrod was admitted as a Unitarian minister in 1973. As a minister, Elrod officiated at hundreds of weddings, including same sex unions.Getting Married In A Unitarian Ceremony Activism =Civil Rights Movement= thumb Elrod and his wife were both interested in the concept of civil disobedience to protest the unjust Jim Crow laws of the South. When boarding an interstate bus after a visit to Georgia in 1954, the young couple decided to sit in the back of the bus, in the \\"colored\\" section. The bus driver told them he could not drive the bus until they moved but they refused to change seats. Finally the driver gave up and let them stay where they were and the bus went on its way.Sitting at the back of the bus This incident occurred before the Montgomery bus boycott and the Freedom Riders campaign. While living in Nashville after their return from Korea, the Elrods became involved in the 1960 Nashville sit-in protests and attended the non- violence workshops led by James Lawson. As portrayed in the 2013 movie The Butler, Elrod would sometimes act the part of an abusive racist to help the young black activists prepare themselves for what they would encounter during the sit-ins. He also participated in the sit-ins themselves. The Elrods experienced some harassment and threats to their family as a result of their involvement in the movement. Negroes in the Neighborhood Elrod, along with some of his students, volunteered to catalogue the library at the Highlander Folk School, then located in Tennessee. This school was instrumental in the civil rights movement. Rosa Parks received training there prior to the Montgomery bus boycott, and the civil rights anthem, \\"We Shall Overcome,\\" was first popularized there. =Vietnam War= The Elrods moved from the United States to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in the summer of 1967 because of their strong opposition to the Vietnam War. Although Elrod was not subject to the draft, being, as he put it, \\"too old and too flat-footed,\\" High Society interview regarding helping American draft-dodgers and drug war refugees. he was sympathetic to the young American men who faced conscription into the army to fight in Vietnam. With his wife, Elrod counselled and provided temporary housing for hundreds of war objectors who moved to Canada, among them Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler [Weyler, Rex. Greenpeace: How a Group of Ecologists, Journalists, and Visionaries Changed the World, 2004, Rodale Books, p. 137.] and political philosopher Mark Satin.Satin, Mark New Age Politics, Fairweather Press, 1976, p. 8 The Elrods worked together with an informal network of anti-war activists, including many other Unitarians. Elrod was a \\"central figure in the effort to aid American war resisters arriving in Canada,\\" often interviewed by the media as he advocated on behalf of the anti- war protestors. His wife was a member of Another Mother for Peace. =Gay pride= In the late 1970s, Elrod came out as a gay man. After moving from Vancouver to Vancouver Island in 1990, he joined the Unitarian Church of Victoria, although not serving as a minister, and advocated for the congregation to be welcoming, initially to gays, subsequently to other diversities. He served on several national-level committees of the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC), including as chair of the Equal Marriage Working Group. The president of the CUC reported in 2004, \\"Mac contributed an enormous amount of his time to this effort and without his generous financial support, and the pro bono work of our Counsel Robert J. Hughes and Kenneth W. Smith, the CUC could not have been one of 26 interveners who participated in the [2004] Canadian Supreme Court hearings [concerning same sex marriage].\\"Report on Supreme Court HearingsReference re Same-Sex Marriage =Drug policy reform= As chair of the Drug Policy Monitoring Group of the Canadian Unitarian Council, Elrod drafted and championed the CUC social responsibility resolution, \\"Alternatives to Drug Prohibition,\\" adopted at the CUC AGM, Winnipeg, 2003. CUC Resolutions ‚Äì 2003 ‚Äì Alternatives to Drug Prohibition Miscellaneous An enthusiastic patron of the arts, Elrod attended the Fats Waller musical revue, \\"Ain‚Äôt Misbehavin‚Äô\\" over 100 times during its Vancouver run in 1984-1985. Canadian author and humorist Bill Richardson modeled the character \\"J. Macdonald Bellwether II\\" in his book, Bachelor Brothers' Bed and Breakfast after Elrod, describing him as \\"short-tempered, intolerant, and disinclined to suffer fools gladly.\\" Elrod appeared in 1990 comedy movie Short Time, playing the part of a minister officiating at a funeral.

Hungarian photographers, most known for her portraits. She was known for her lighting techniques and utilized lighted backgrounds to enhance her portraits and still life compositions. In 1912 she won a Gold Medal in Stuttgart at an international photography exhibit. Perhaps her best-known images are portraits she took of Mih√°ly Babits and Margit Kaffka. She was also an early suffragist in Hungary and during the Hungarian White Terror assisted several intellectuals in their escapes. Biography Olga Mauthner was born on 1 January 1878 in Szigetv√°r, during the Austro‚ÄìHungarian Empire to Hanna (n√©e Spiegel) and L≈ërinc Mauthner. There were two daughters and four sons in the family and changed their name from the German spelling to the Hungarian form, M√°t√©. Originally L≈ërinc Mauthner made his living as a merchant, while his wife did tailoring piecework, but when the family moved to Budapest, the father gave up his trade and opened a sewing factory. There were few business opportunities open to women but M√°t√© studied in Budapest to become a photographer. Career 1908 portrait of Olga M√°t√© by Rudolf D√ºhrkoop In 1899, M√°t√© opened a studio in the central business district of Budapest at #21 F≈ë utca (Main Street). After working for several years to obtain sufficient capital in 1908, M√°t√© went to Germany to study in Hamburg with and with Nicola Perscheid, who at that time was in Berlin. She studied at least two years in Germany and began participating in exhibitions in 1910. Her photographs showed the influence of D√ºhrkoop, as instead of formal settings, her subjects appeared more natural and were placed against lighted backgrounds, to focus the eye on the darker subject of the work. The following year, she exhibited in London at the London Salon of Photography. M√°t√© returned to Budapest and began working on a variety of subject matter including advertising, nudes, urban landscapes, but by far her most known works were portraits. In 1911 she began contributing to the journal A F√©ny (The Light). In that year's publication, about half of the photograph's submitted were by four Hungarian photographers, including M√°t√©, Erzsi Gaiduschek, , and Frigyes Widder. In 1912, she opened a studio at #12 Veres P√°ln√© utca, (a street in Budapest named after the educator and feminist P√°ln√© Veres), and lived in an apartment above the studio, located on the building's sixth floor. In the fall of that year, M√°t√© married the philosopher and academic , a widower with two children. Their home became a meeting place for intellectuals to gather and discuss ideas. Her circle of friends had always included artists, such as , No√©mi Ferenczy, and and his family. After her marriage to Zalai, it expanded to include the \\"Sunday Circle\\", () of Hungarian intelligentsia, like B√©la Bal√°zs, Paul Dienes, J√°nos Fogarasi, Arnold Hauser, Gyula Juh√°sz, Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Karl Mannheim, and others. She took portraits of many in her circle, as well as society figures. Two of her best-known works were portraits of Mih√°ly Babits and Margit Kaffka. M√°t√© continued exhibiting, appearing at the International Photographers show in Stuttgart, where she won a gold medal with J√≥zsef P√©csi in 1912. In 1913, she was invited by Rosika Schwimmer to take photographs at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. She not only took photographs but was a supporter and organizer for the Hungarian feminist movement. M√°t√© exhibited in 1914 at the Professional Photographers Society of New York State and later that year, Zalai was drafted to serve in World War I. He was taken prisoner in December, 1914 and died of typhus on 2 February 1915 in a POW camp in Omsk, Siberia. M√°t√© struggled to raise his two children, but she cared for them and felt the later death of his daughter deeply. At the end of the war, with the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the country struggled against decline. A F√©ny, in which M√°t√© had published since 1911 was closed. After the Hungarian Soviet Republic was defeated, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs had been ordered by B√©la Kun to remain behind with Ott√≥ Korvin, when the rest of the leadership evacuated to Austria. Luk√°cs and Korvin's mission was to clandestinely reorganize the communist movement, but the mission was impossible. Luk√°cs was forced into hiding to avoid the communist purge and M√°t√© hid him in her home. After Korvin was captured, Luk√°cs fled to Austria. M√°t√© also helped Jen≈ë Hamburger flee along with others. These actions resulted in her censure by the courts. During the 1920s and 1930s, her compositions were transformed, moving from the studio to outdoor settings with sepia tones replacing the sharp black and white contrasts of her earlier works. The subject matter also changed from the elite classes to working classes. In 1922, she did an exhibit for the Museum of Applied Arts and then in 1934 shared a studio with her student, Ferenc Ha√°r. When Ha√†r moved to Paris in 1937, M√°t√© closed the shop and the following year went to work in the studio of Marian Reismann. Though one of Hungary's earliest professional women photographers, M√°t√© died in obscurity. She died on 5 April 1961 in Budapest, Hungary and was buried in the Farkasr√©ti Cemetery of Budapest. Legacy In 2006, Csilla E. Csorba, director of the Petofi Museum of Literature, published a book M√°t√© Olga fot√≥m≈±v√©sz (Olga M√°t√© Photographer) with Helikon Publishing in Budapest to recapture the history of M√°t√©'s contributions to photography. The hosted an exhibit of her work in 2007. In 2009, Csorba took an exhibition of Hungarian women photographer's works on tour in New York City and Washington, D. C. for the year. It was the first time several of the artists' works had been seen in the United States. M√°t√©'s Still Life with Eggs and Mushrooms (1920) was praised for communicating beauty with everyday objects.

Mr. Miller, a gentleman of a wide range of information and extended experience, whose life for nearly forty years was devoted to chronicling the events of the world for the instruction and advancement of the people, established the Tribune in 1846 and edited continuously until 1886. Robert Miller, age 44 in 1870, typified the inhabitants of Clay County, Missouri in lineage. His family migrated from Virginia to Kentucky when he was six, and to Missouri when he was 12. As a teenager he was apprenticed first to the Columbia Patriot and then to the Missouri Statesman and in April 1846, with support from John B. Williams of the Fulton Telegraph and encouraged by Dr. William Jewell of Columbia, Miller ventured to Liberty on Missouri's western fringe. Miller, gifted with rare business acumen, was one of the rare few who made a fortune in the printing office. Early life and education Robert Hugh Miller was born November 27, 1826, in the City of Richmond, Virginia, a son of John E. and Mary A. (Rogers) Miller, the father a planter of Scotch descent and a kinsman of Hugh Miller, the eminent Scottish geologist and writer, author of \\"Old Red Sandstone,\\" and the mother a native of the Old Dominion, her parents Achilles and Mary (George) Rogers of Albemarle County, Virginia being patriots of the Revolution. Mary (Rogers) Miller's parents were first cousins, both grandchildren of John Rogers and Mary Bird/Byrd, and her father a first cousin to surveyor and militia officer George Rogers Clark and his brother William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. After her marriage and the death of her husband in Virginia, Miller's mother removed with her family to Southern Kentucky and thence to Missouri in 1838. They were the parents of two children, Robert H. and Edmund, the latter of whom died in 1859. Miller's first years were spent on his father's plantation in Albemarle County, Virginia. When his father was killed by a slave fleeing from another plantation who mistook the identity of his father, his mother moved to Glasgow, Barren County, Kentucky to stay with relatives. Here, living with Edmund P. Rogers, patriarch of the Rogers family of Virginia, and military surveyor of the Green River country, young Miller absorbed the political, Revolutionary War veteran atmosphere which colored his later thinking. Subsequently, the mother with her children, removed to Paris, Monroe County, Missouri and there she taught school. She remarried in Missouri and died in 1870. Robert H. Miller was reared and educated under the influences of the old school Presbyterian church. His educational advantages were such as could be obtained in his youth in the common schools of the country, and this he supplemented by research and observation. He passed his youth at Columbia, Missouri, going from the schoolroom to the printing-office. In 1840, when fourteen years of age, Mr. Miller was apprenticed to the printer's trade in the office of the Patriot, a newspaper published at Columbia, Missouri, and when that sheet was discontinued Mr. Miller joined the force of the Statesman, where, under the editorship of Col. William P. Switzler, he gained experience which was invaluable to him in later years. Marriage and Family Mrs. Robert Hugh Miller (Louise Wilson) at Forest Hill with granddaughter Catherine Day in foreground and grandson Roger Owen Day on horse. c. 1906 Robert H. Miller was twice happily married. He was married first June 27, 1846, to Miss Enna F. Peters, of Liberty, Missouri, a daughter of John R. Peters, a noted pioneer of Missouri, born in Kentucky. She died December 3, 1867 at the age of 37, leaving four children. On May 3, 1871, Mr. Miller married Miss Louise \\"Lulu\\" Wilson, daughter of one of Missouri's foremost criminal lawyers of that day and a law partner of Col. Alexander William Doniphan, Hon. John W. Wilson, of Platte City, Missouri. Of this union, five children were born. Miller's second wife Louise was a member of a distinguished American family; her grandfather Robert Patterson Clark was a member of the committee that drew up the first Missouri state laws; her great-grandfather was Col. Stephen Trigg, son of John Johns Trigg of Virginia; a great-uncle, James Clark, was a governor of Kentucky; another great-uncle, John Bullock Clark, was a national representative from Cooper County and a general in the Confederate army. She lived at Forest Hill, the antebellum mansion built by her husband Robert H. Miller in 1857, since going there as a bride sixty-two years before her death in 1933 at the age of 85. Miller opened the grounds of Forest Hill to Indians on their way to and from buffalo hunting grounds. You could usually find a few teepees on the north side of the property in the summer and the south side in the winter, seemingly not to bother Miller that genteel Liberty had to work its way through camp groups on their way to Forest Hill, which was for many years a center of social activity in the county. Career On March 20, 1846, a young man stepped from the gangplank of the steamboat \\"Tobacco Plant,\\" looked over the little outpost of civilization, and congratulated himself on his choice of Liberty for the start of his career as editor and publisher. This 19-year-old journalist was to make a remarkable impact on this community, and with John B. Williams started the Tribune, the latter retiring at the end of the year, leaving Mr. Miller sole proprietor. Dr. William Jewell, whose college bears his name, lent Robert H. Miller $5,000 to go to Liberty, Missouri, to found a newspaper and in five years Miller, the founder of the Liberty Tribune had paid back this sum with interest. The Tribune was started as a Whig paper, but after the extinction of that party drifted in the Democratic party and continued as such as long as he conducted it and under his faithful management it attained a wide circulation and was noted for its plain statement of facts and its fearless vindication of the right, as well as for its denunciation of wrong. In an early editorial, Miller told of his nearly unlimited dreams for Liberty: \\"The day will come, if good colleges are erected speedily, when Liberty will be to western Missouri what Lexington is to Kentucky‚Äìthe focus of intelligence and literature. His pride was in the mechanical neatness and beauty of the Tribune. Mr. Miller's reverence for the past and his keen sense of historic values led him to fill his paper with the most valuable data and in the files of the Tribune we are able to find the facts which go to make up the history of Clay County, socially, educationally, and politically. He was a public spirited citizen of high ideals and no man had greater influence on his generation. Miller became friends with another newspaperman, William Rockhill Nelson, founder of The Star, who offered to buy the Tribune. Miller later said he didn't want to sell at the time because he didn't realize he was getting old. Miller sold the Tribune to John Dougherty in 1885. In an article written by a lifelong friend, D.C. Allen, which was published in the Tribune at the time of Mr. Miller's death, Mr. Allen says, in part: \\"As can be understood, the Tribune remained staunchly Whig until in 1852, when the Whig party went down in defeat under Scott and Graham, leaving 'trailing clouds of glory' all over its past. With the characteristic devotion of old Whigs to the names of Clay, Webster, Crittenden and their compeers, it declined to support the democracy in 1856 and 1860, but in those years gave its countenance respectively to Fillmore and Donelson, and Bell and Everett. After 1860, it gave its adherence to the democratic party, and remained one of the truest democratic newspapers in Missouri.\\" Death Robert H. Miller died on February 14, 1911. His remains were laid to rest at Fairview Cemetery, Liberty, Missouri.

Biography Belli was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, and began drumming at the age of 12. At age 16, he started work as a professional musician before serving in the U.S. Navy, where he also played in a band. After his discharge he moved to California, where he performed in clubs and toured with Anita O'Day and Billy May. After opening a store, Drum City, on Santa Monica Boulevard in 1950, he realized after a few years that the growth of rock and roll meant that there were insufficient supplies of calfskin, the traditional material for drumheads, to meet the demands. He bought a supply of Mylar, a durable polyester film, and after testing its qualities by stapling it to a drum hoop, established a partnership with chemist Samuel Muchnick who developed a way of bonding the plastic membrane to an aluminum hoop. After founding the company Remo Inc., he started marketing the new synthetic drumheads in 1957, with endorsements from leading drummers such as Buddy Rich and Gene Krupa. The new drums, marketed as Remo Weather King, eventually became a huge commercial success. Belli later said that the invention \\"changed everything in the whole musical instruments category; it was no longer woodwinds and brass winds and strings. It became guitars and amplification and drums.\\" His company grew to accommodate a large factory in Valencia, California, where he lived. He also developed a range of other percussion instruments, and became an advocate for the use of drumming as therapy. Belli died of pneumonia in Pasadena, California, aged 88.

The lake originally drained north through Eagle Lake and Churchill Lake into the Allagash River tributary to the Saint John River. Nineteenth-century logging operations diverted the lake into the Penobscot River before designation of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway in 1966. History Telos Lake drained into the south end of Chamberlain Lake until the Telos Cut was excavated in 1841 to allow Telos Lake to drain east into Webster Lake and the Penobscot River. In the 1850s Eben S. Coe built the timber crib Lock Dam across the outlet from Chamberlain Lake causing Chamberlain Lake to overflow southward through Round Pond, Telos Lake, Webster Lake and Webster Brook into the East Branch Penobscot River in Baxter State Park. These changes allowed logs harvested in the upper Saint John River watershed to be floated to Bangor sawmills. The combined level of Chamberlain Lake, Round Pond, and Telos Lake has subsequently been regulated by Telos Dam. Togue habitat Summer water temperatures range from 64¬∞ near the surface to 52¬∞ in the deepest pools. Cold water with high dissolved oxygen concentrations provides good habitat for togue if water levels are stable after autumn spawning occurs in the rocky shallows.

Cotton and Wrinkle live in a completely white world, where they care for eggs which fall from the sky, placing them in specially-designed birdhouses. Colour is banned, and whenever anything coloured is found, it must be placed in a large bin. Their lives are happy and uncomplicated until one day, a Red Egg falls. Cotton wants to care for the egg, but Wrinkle declares that it must go in the bin. That night, Cotton creeps out of the tent he shares with Wrinkle, and rescues the Red Egg, hiding it inside an empty birdhouse. The next morning, he is horrified to find that objects are beginning to change colour. He tries to hide the objects from Wrinkle, but eventually he is forced to admit what he has done. Wrinkle forgives him, and admits that he secretly loves colour too. They open up the birdhouses to discover that all the eggs have changed from white to pink, red, blue, green, yellow and purple, and together, they celebrate the arrival of colour into their lives.

She was a well-known advocate for the education of women. Sabin developed her own curriculum and teaching style which she practiced in both Wisconsin and Oregon before accepting the position as college president at Downer College. \\"‚ÄòEducation is liberation, and it may free women only from her ignorance, littleness, weakness, and fears.‚Äô\\" - Ellen Sabin.  Early life  Sabin was born November 29, 1850 in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin to Samuel H. and Adelia Bordine Sabin. When she was an infant, her family moved to California as part of the gold rush, and returned to Wisconsin in 1854.\\"Sabin, Ellen Clara (1850-1949)\\", historical essay, Wisconsin Historical Society, Madison, Wisconsin, accessed 2 May 2016 via www.wisconsinhistory.org. As the oldest of 11 children, Sabin was often responsible for her siblings. She, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and Clara Bewick Colby were close childhood friends. At the age of fifteen, Sabin enrolled in the University of Wisconsin. She was among the first women admitted to the university. At the university, she did not pursue any specific course of study. While attending college, she began teaching at the Sun Prairie Grade School in her hometown which was near the university. Sabin left the university after three years without graduating, accepted a job teaching seventh grade in Madison, Wisconsin. By the time Sabin was nineteen, she was the principal of the Fourth Ward School. thumb  Oregon educator  In 1872, Sabin moved with her family to Eugene, Oregon. She found the education system in Eugene unsatisfactory so she begin independently teaching the community. She began by teaching her siblings and a few neighbors. After a short while, her opened a private school with thirty children. A year later, she moved to Portland where she became the principal of a school known at the time as the Old North School of Portland. Sabin later became superintendent of Portland Public Schools and principal of the high school, overseeing 84 teachers and serving between 6,000 and 7,000 students. She was the first woman to hold a principal position in the Pacific Northwest.  College president  News of Sabin's success in Portland reached Sabra Warner Lewis, an acquaintance of Sabin's back in Wisconsin. Although she had always specialized in elementary education, Sabin was contacted by Lewis‚Äôs brother, a trustee of a \\"small backwoods college in Wisconsin\\" known as Downer College for Women in Fox Lake, Wisconsin. Downer was in need of someone to take over the school's presidency. Even though Downer offered her twice the salary they had paid to any previous president, it was still substantially less than she was making in Portland. So when Sabin decided to accept the position of college president, she took a major decrease in pay. After accepting the position of president in 1890, Sabin spent the next thirty years leading the Downer College and its successor institution. In 1895, Downer College merged with Milwaukee College, becoming Milwaukee-Downer College. Sabin continued as president of the new institution. For many years, Milwaukee-Downer was one of the few colleges in Wisconsin that admitted women. To ensure women students got a quality education, Sabin developed a curriculum that taught women a wide range of practical subjects. She was quoted in 1895 saying, \\"A strong course of study will be provided, which will be equivalent in work to any of the leading female colleges in the country. Greek, Latin, French, and German will be taught.\\" She also put emphasis on history and literature; however, mathematics was not a priority. Over the years, Sabin continued to introduce progressive and practical classes that were rarely offered to women, including physical education classes, despite the old fear the women were \\"too fragile\\" for such courses. Sabin was firm in setting goals for the women and strict courses so they could advance to their careers as rapidly, but also as well-prepared, as possible. She was an active part of the students lives, she would sit in on multiple classes to observe the teachings. Sabin was also known to \\"personally review each student‚Äôs program of study.\\" Sabin was known to be strict towards her students but they recognized that it was out of concern for their education. She was regarded as being able to \\"scould beautifully.\\" While Sabin never graduated from college, she was awarded three honorary degrees from University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Beloit College, and Grinnell College. She was also helped organize the Wisconsin Federation of Women's Clubs in 1896. That organization served as an important source of funding for many women's educational programs. Sabin remained president of Milwaukee-Downer College until 1921. She was then honored as president emerita from 1921 to 1949. After she retired, Sabin moved to Madison. She died there on February 3, 1949.  Role in women's education  Although higher education of women was an important issue to Sabin, it was still highly controversial during her time of presidency. Concerns circling women's education included belief that the female mind was not as apt to process information as a male's. From this \\"strain\\" of higher education, it was thought that women would become weak and lose the ability to produce healthy offspring. Furthermore, it was believed that if women were educated into college, women would hold higher positions and neglect any housework or housewife position and homes would fall-into disarray. Some women‚Äôs colleges at this time did not focus on \\"practical\\" and \\"classical\\" curriculum like Milwaukee-Downer, but rather, \\"preparing [women] for intelligent motherhood and properly subservient wifehood.\\" As mentioned previously, the Sabin administration strived to teach women more \\"rigorous\\" courses of study and have an advanced and broad range of topics so to fully educate the female mind. Sabin was the first female school principal in the Pacific Northwest, and later became Portland's school superintendent. In 1886 she led a successful effort to incorporate a night school into Portland's public school system. The night school, which had been founded by the Portland Woman's Union, was founded primarily to provide educational opportunities for wage-earning girls.

The machine can perform tide calculations much faster than a person could do with pencil and paper. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey put the machine into operation in 1910. It was used until 1965, when it was replaced by an electronic computer.  Early U.S. tide-prediction efforts  Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun, and rotation of the Earth. In 1867 the United States Coast Survey started printing annual tide tables to support safe and effective maritime, coastal, and defense activities. Before long, these tables showed the times and heights of high and low tides to the nearest minute and tenth of a foot, respectively. Tables were printed for a year at a time and distributed prior to the start of the year. The prediction of tides is very challenging as it depends on multiple factors‚Äìincluding the alignment of the Sun and Moon, the shape of the coastline, and near-shore bathymetry. Tide theories attempt to account for these factors but lead to complex calculations. Originally, calculations were performed by hand, which was very labor-intensive and error-prone. The burden became even larger when the United State Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS, the successor to the Coast Survey) started using the more accurate harmonic method for predictions of tides in 1884. To significantly reduce the work required to predict tides, in 1881 William Ferrel of the USCGS designed a tide-predicting machine. Fauth & Co. Instrument Makers built Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1 and delivered it in 1882. The Survey started using the machine routinely in 1883.  History and mechanism  In 1895 the USCGS grew concerned because Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1 had developed considerable wear from almost constant use over 12 years. The office decided to construct a new machine that was faster, more accurate, and more reliable. This became Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2. Rolin Harris and E. G. Fischer of the USCGS led the effort. The design team studied previous British and U.S. tide-predicting machines and incorporated their best attributes in the design of the new machine. The machine, also known as ‚ÄúOld Brass Brains‚Äù, used an intricate arrangement of gears, pulleys, slides, and other components. The design of the new machine was approved in 1895, and construction began in 1896. Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was the first tide- predicting machine to incorporate both a paper graph of the tides‚Äìthe approach used by earlier British machines‚Äìand dials and scales that showed the tide height and corresponding date and time‚Äìused by Tide-Predicting Machine No. 1. The dials and scales made it much easier for an operator to precisely determine the height and time of high and low tides. The paper graph, referred to as a tide curve, was very useful as a record of the computation that could be checked later to confirm the calculations were performed correctly. A hand crank turned by the operator provides the power for the machine‚Äôs mechanical calculations. Battery-powered electrical circuits are used to mark the start of hours and days on the paper graph and to stop the machine when high and low tides were reached so the operator can note the height and time. This photo shows the largest of the three sections of Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2. The gears on the left transmit power from the hand crank. The components on the right contribute to the computation of the time of high and low tides. Much consideration was given to the mechanical characteristics of the components to ensure reliability and accuracy. For instance, some components that were hard to replace were designed with a 50-year lifetime. Also, the summation chains were moved across gears under tension for a year of work days before being installed in the machine to ensure they were sufficiently flexible and their length would remain constant. Other work in the USCGS took precedence over construction of the new machine, and a reduction in staff levels precluded all work on the new machine for three years. As a result, Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 was not functional until 1910. It was first applied to predicting values for the 1912 and 1913 tide tables. Then the machine was disassembled, polished, plated, lacquered, and reassembled in time to provide predictions for the 1914 tide tables. Comparisons of the accuracy of the mechanical predictions of tides compared to hand calculations for two challenging locations demonstrated errors in heights of or less. Old Brass Brains is long, high, wide and weighs approximately .  Use  To compute tides for a coastal location, the operator has to configure the machine for that location. This is done by adjusting physical settings on the machine based on up to 37 factors. Those factors are determined empirically by harmonic analysis of a time series of tides at the location, and represent the influence of the moon, sun, depth of bay, offshore islands, etc. Once computed the factors for a location can be applied to past and future years. and are shared widely so anyone can perform tide calculations. A tide formula component crank on Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2. The mechanical arrangement (a slotted crank yoke) converts circular motion to a vertical motion that traces a sinusoid. The operator adjusts the position of the pin on the crank to represent a component of the tide formula at a specific coastal port before starting computations. The pin position affects the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid. Assuming the factors for a location are known, configuring the machine to compute tides for the location requires 2.5‚Äì4 hours. Predictions for a year‚Äôs tides at that location can then be produced in 8‚Äì15 hours. The calculations Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 can perform in 1 day would require a person 125 days to perform by hand. Around 1915, the machine was used to produce annual tide tables for 70 major ports worldwide. Additional ports were added in later years. During World War II the USCGS produced annual tide tables for major ports four years in advance in case Old Brass Brains broke down or was sabotaged. The USCGS also provided tide predictions for a number of additional locations in the Pacific, including potential locations for amphibious invasions. Obtaining tide observations for those locations to support computation of the factors required for predictions was often a significant challenge. Around 1960 Old Brass Brains was modified to replace the hand crank with an electric motor and to add an automatic readout of heights and times. In 1965, the USCGS retired the Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2, 55 years after it entered service, and started performing its tide calculations with an electronic computer.  Current status  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains Tide-Predicting Machine No. 2 in working condition. The machine is at NOAA‚Äôs facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. The public can occasionally view the machine during events such as the NOAA Open House.  Mathematical basis  Tide Predicting Machine No. 2 is based on the first accurate mathematical approach for predicting tides, which was developed around 1867 by Sir William Thomson (who later became Lord Kelvin) and later refined by Sir George Darwin. This approach, called ‚Äúharmonic analysis,‚Äù approximates tide heights by a summation of cosine terms, each of which has a different frequency. The formula for sea height is represented as : H_0 + A_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\varphi_1)+A_2 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_2 t+\\\\varphi_2)+A_3 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_3 t+\\\\varphi_3)+\\\\cdots containing 10, 20 or even more trigonometric terms. H_0 is the height of mean sea level. For each term i = 1, \\\\ldots, n, A_i is the amplitude of the term‚Äôs contribution to tide height above mean sea level, \\\\omega_i determines the frequency of the term, t is the time, and \\\\phi_i is the relative phase of the term. This is the equation computed by most tide- predicting machines, including Old Brass Brains which handles 37 such terms. The frequencies \\\\omega_i are determined from astronomical considerations, which were determined by Thomson and Darwin and have been almost universally used. For instance one speed represents the speed of a theoretical moon with a uniform speed in a circular orbit in the equatorial plane. Other components with their own speeds correct for the differences between the orbit of that theoretical moon and the real Moon. The coefficients A_i and \\\\phi_i are determined by Fourier analysis of a time series of tide heights. This analysis can be performed with a record as short as two weeks but a 369-day sample is standard. The longer sample minimizes the errors introduced by wind storms, freshets, and other non-regular influences. mechanism for generating sinusoidal motion component To compute those terms the USCGS designers incorporated the same \\"slotted yoke crank\\" approach for mechanically computing cosines as Thomson used, shown in the schematic (right). A rotating drive- wheel (\\"crank\\") is fitted with an off-center peg. A shaft with a horizontally- slotted section is free to move vertically up and down. The wheel's off-center peg is located in the slot. As a result, when the peg moves around with the wheel, it makes the shaft move up and down within limits. As a result of this arrangement when the drive-wheel rotates uniformly, say clockwise, the shaft moves sinusoidally up and down. The vertical position of the center of the slot, at any time t, can then be expressed as A_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega_1 t+\\\\phi_1), where A_1 is the radial distance from the wheel's center to the peg, \\\\omega_1 is the rate at which the wheel turns (in radians per unit of time) and is determined by gears, and \\\\phi_1 is the starting phase angle of the peg, measured in radians from the 12 o'clock position to the angular position where the peg was at time zero. An operator adjusted the location of each pin based on the empirically computed parameters for a port‚Äôs tides. This arrangement makes a physical analog of just one term in the tide equation. Old Brass Brains computes 37 such terms. The slotted yoke cranks at the top and bottom (with the triangular pieces) move vertically in a sinusoidal pattern. The locations of their pins determine their amplitudes and phases, representing factors in the tide equation. The pulleys across the center move with the attached cranks. The summation chain above and below the pulleys sums their influences. The USCGS designers also adopted from the earlier British machines the approach of summing terms by passing a chain over and under pulleys attached to the vertically oscillating yokes. The amount of chain remaining after passing over and under pulleys indicated the sum of the terms. For example, a large value for a term would move its pulley further from a neutral position, deflecting the chain, and reducing the amount of excess chain remaining in system. One side of Old Brass Brains is used to compute the height of the tide. A similar arrangement of components on the other side, but with cranks 90 degrees out of phase, represents the derivative with respect to time of the tide height formula. When the derivative is zero the time of high or low tide has been reached. An electrical circuit detects this condition and stops the machine so the operator can record the date, time, and tide height.

The summation chain that passes above and below the pulleys sums their influences. File:Dials on Tide Predicting Machine No. 2.jpgThe operator reads the height and time of high and low tides from these dials and scales. File:Looking into the Top of Tide Predicting Machine No. 2.jpgThis photo shows both the top and one side of Tide Predicting Machine No. 2. The tide prediction formula implemented by the machine includes the addition of a series of cosine terms. The triangular metal pieces are part of slotted yoke cranks which convert circular motion to a vertical motion that traces a sinusoid. Each slotted yoke crank is connected by a shaft to a pulley, which causes the pulley to follow the sinusoidal motion. A chain going over and under pulleys sums each of their deflections to compute the tide. Along the top of the photo, connecting shafts drive slotted yoke cranks on both sides of the machine. One side of the machine computes the height of tides while the other determines the times of high and low tides.

It was dedicated to Apollo, the god of the sun and music. The temple was built in the 2nd century AD, and it overlooked a semi-circular theatre. The temple's ruins were discovered in the 18th century, and many architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures. Parts of the temple's crepidoma still exist, having been rediscovered in 2002. History and architecture The Temple of Apollo might have been built on the site of an earlier Punic sacred structure. It is believed to have been built in the 2nd century AD, and an inscription recording a private benefactor paying for the construction of parts of the temple was discovered in 1747. The temple was built out of marble, and it had a tetrastyle portico with Ionic columns, raised on a podium. It overlooked a semi-circular theatre. The temple's architecture was influenced by the Carthaginian style, as it also resembled the style popular in Roman North Africa. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when the Christian Emperors issued edicts prohibiting all non-Christian worship and sanctuaries. Remains Some remains of the temple still survive beneath Villegaignon Street Some remains of the temple were discovered in 1710, and marble blocks from temple were taken and sculpted into altars and decorative elements for various houses and churches, including St. Paul's Cathedral in Mdina, St. Paul's Grotto in Rabat and the Franciscan Church of St Mary of Jesus and the Church of the Holy Souls in Valletta. More ruins of the temple and the nearby theatre were discovered near St. Peter's Monastery in Mdina in 1747. These remains included marble pillars, capitals, cornices and blocks, as well as an inscription recording the temple's construction. Another inscription recording the construction of a temple was found near the same monastery in 1868, and although the name of the deity to whom this temple was dedicated to is lost, it is possible to have originated from the Temple of Apollo. In A hand book, or guide, for strangers visiting Malta, written by Thomas MacGill in 1839, it is mentioned that \\"not a vestige of [the temple] is now visible\\". The archaeologist Antonio Annetto Caruana, writing in 1882, recorded that some of the remains discovered in 1710 and 1747 were in private collections, including that of Mr. Sant Fournier. In March 2002, a wall forming part of the temple's crepidoma was discovered during a public works project in Villegaignon Street, and it was subsequently excavated by the Archaeology Services Cooperative.

Portrait of Alexander Wielopolski is an oil painting by Jacek Malczewski from 1903, presenting the allegorical grandson Alexander Wielopolski and two different visions of the fate of the Polish nation.  Description  It is in the collection of the National Museum, Warsaw. It was painted in 1903, and is one of the most famous works of Malczewski. It presents the painter's grandson as Aleksander Wielopolski, Polish politician, a member of the Polish Kingdom government in the early 1860s, who tried to maneuver between the interests of the invaders and the Polish population. The figure is located in the center of the composition, surrounded by two women. He is dressed in yellow-green dress and belted pouch, in which instead of bullets are tubes of paint, and he thoughtfully pulls on the petals of chamomile. Analysis The painting is symbolic and patriotic, it can be read in several ways. The women placed on both sides of the picture are an allegory of two different visions of the fate of their homeland. Located to the right is an elderly woman with white hair, dressed in dark robes, her hands cuffed on shackles, and her face takes on an expression of sadness, despair and awareness of their situation. She embodies Poland enslaved, experienced by fate, remaining under the yoke of others, and who can not be liberated. On the left side there is a young girl, half-naked, shown at the time of breaking the shackles. She is full of energy, and her face is very expressive. It symbolizes the \\"young Poland\\" - capable of action and being able to release from the long-term captivity. The image can be interpreted as a question of choosing the right way and the future fate of the homeland, entering a new century. This dilemma clearly refers to the title character of Hamlet, William Shakespeare's drama and his life choice, as highlighted in the title of the work. Alexander Wielopolski is an example of the person making the difficult decision, and carrying the consequences of that choice, resulting from the need to accept or reject the attitude towards life of his grandfather. The artist does not in favor which solution. The figure of a man is pensive, lost in melancholy, and his indecision which highlights even more the flower in his hand and a belt on the body. The work is an expression of his concern for the future of the Polish.  Mistaken identity  thumbAleksander Wielopolski (grandfather). Photography by Karol Bayer, 1862 In the literature, due to the fact that actually portrayed in the picture grandson and Alexander Wielopolski name was the same as his grandfather, there is often the wrong suggestion that image presented his grandfather.Agnieszka ≈Åawniczakowa: Jacek Malczewski.

In fact, Jacek Malczewski could not portray his grandfather, because he died in 1877 and the picture was painted in 1903.

The group counts with social media presence and has appeared on the internet with protest action videos that counter the Mexican government's political narrative. Introduction Due to deteriorating human rights situation in Mexico and declining popular opinion abroad, Mexicans residing in the United States began to organize collectives to denounce the government of Mexico's human rights violations, and, in particular, the disappearance of the 43 students of Ayotzinapa. One such group was Somos Los Otros NY, a collective known for their online distribution of political content. Mexican activists began the collective \\"Somos Los Otros NY\\" in New York, New York during the fall of 2014 for the explicit purpose of developing a political message for the immigrant Mexican community. Activism Somos Los Otros NY is a New York based Mexican activists collective that has maintained pressure on the Mexican government over their human rights record and derailed the public relations efforts of the Mexican government in Washington D.C. The group has maintained protests visibly active since the disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students. In the fall of 2014, the group established activities in the New York area, but also made its presence felt in Washington D.C. during Enrique Pe√±a Nieto's meeting with President Obama. In parallel with their advocacy for the Ayotzinapa cause, they have begun spearheading a campaign against Plan Merida too in order to call attention to the client state status the Mexican government currently enjoys from the US government. Under Plan Merida (or Merida Initiative), hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of military equipment, training and diplomatic support have been provided to the Mexican government since the end of 2007.

History Prior to the tribunal, cases were previously heard in the sheriff court. The tribunals were established in November 2005 by the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. By 2006 the panels were ready to hear cases. The tribunals dealt with disputes concerning pupils with additional support needs. The remit of the tribunals included placing requests to special schools, transition and disability discrimination. In 2010 the Scottish Government consulted on secondary legislation that could enable the tribunal to hear disability claims cases that related to school education. Its functions were transferred to the Health and Education Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland in January 2018. Decisions of the ASNTS could be appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. The caseloads for the ASNTS had risen because of the \\"inadequate\\" provision for special-needs students in mainstream education, one academic said.

There, she joined a union for female tailors, which soon affiliated to the Women's Trade Union League.

She often attended the London Trades Council, which supported her successful nomination to London County Council's technical education board in 1897. Through her trade union work, Barry this met Pete Curran, the two marrying in 1897 or 1898, and she thereafter was known as \\"Mrs Pete Curran\\". The couple had four children, and Marian withdrew from political activity until 1906 in order to bring them up. In 1906, Barry was appointed as an organiser for the Women's Trade Union League. She founded a branch in Jarrow, where her husband won a by-election, in 1907, a campaign in which Marian was prominent. She campaigned locally for reforms including free school meals, and was elected to the League's executive in 1908. She is believed to have also campaigned for women's suffrage.

She was perhaps best known for her work on the radio version of Your Hit Parade. She also was a vocalist for Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. Early years Edwards' father was Ben Edwards, a song plugger. Music ran in her family; uncle Gus Edwards was a vaudeville entertainer, uncle Leo Edwards wrote music, and aunt Dorothy Edwards was a vocal teacher. Despite the family's show business background, she was urged to go in a different direction. In fact, Gus Edwards told her, \\"Stay out of show business.\\" As a child, Edwards had a heart murmur, and doctors advised her to start playing the piano \\"to keep her busy outside of school hours.\\" She graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan, where she directed the glee club. She went on to major in music at Hunter College, planning to be a teacher. However, her interest in singing and playing the piano won out, leading to a career in music. Radio Edwards' early appearances on radio came \\"via small stations in New York City.\\" Her first network appearance was on Fred Allen's program. Beginning March 3, 1941, Edwards had her own program, Girl About Town, on CBS. The 15-minute show was broadcast Wednesdays and Fridays at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Although her singing was featured, she played the piano for one song in each episode. In December 1941, Edwards was selected as the new female soloist on Your Hit Parade. Three years later, an article in Tune In magazine observed, \\"Joan Edwards sets something of a record, lasting through the regimes of three male singers -- Barry Wood, [Frank] Sinatra, [Lawrence] Tibbett -- in a three-year period.\\" Her tenure on the program eventually reached five years, and the list of male singers' names grew to include Dick Todd and Johnny Mercer. She was dropped from Your Hit Parade in 1947 when the sponsor, American Tobacco Company, changed format, using guest stars rather than regular soloists.

Approximately 450-750 attendees come to celebrate Beltane, also known as May Day. It is a musicfest with several days of diverse performances and also a spiritual retreat focusing on Earth consciousness and the modern nature-based spirituality movement. Beltane has been celebrated for millennia and dates back to pre-Christian Celtic times, and is a fire festival celebrating the bright half of the year. Traditionally, the Balefire is lit to signal the return of the sun's strength, and people dance around the maypole which symbolizes fertility. There's a lot more to the history, lore, activities, and symbology of Beltane, but Beltania is not designed to reenact or recreate ancient Pagan ways. Rather, it's a modern celebration and interpretation of this May Day tradition. Spiritual and religious rituals and ceremonies of a wide variety of Earth-honoring, Magickal, Metaphysical, or other Alternative traditions are represented at Beltania, including a sweat lodge, labyrinth walk, yoga, as well as eclectic and traditional ritual. Since 2008, when the festival was founded by Joy Burton of Living Earth, a Denver, CO based nonprofit, several nationally and internationally known guests and performers have headlined at Beltania: * Selena Fox of Circle Sanctuary * Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone * Christopher Penczak * S. J. Tucker * Wendy Rule * River and Joyce Higginbotham * Betsy Tinney * Lunar Fire * Frenchy and the Punk In 2009, a Guinness Book of World Records attempt was made for the largest maypole dance on Earth, with 196 ribbons. Ordinarily, a 20‚Äì30 foot tall maypole at Beltania includes 50-100 ribbons and is repeatedly the largest maypole dance in Colorado. Throughout the festival, ceremonies are interspersed with workshops with special guest presenters and many local talented teachers, ritualists, and local/regional community leaders. Music performances run Friday and Saturday all day and into the evening. Trance drumming, ecstatic dancing, and chanting takes place throughout the festival and until the early morning hours. The \\"Green Man\\" and \\"May Queen\\" are crowned each year as a symbol of the masculine and feminine aspects of the Divine. A Rainbow Welcome Center hosts and celebrates the diversity of the LGBT community at Beltania. Beltania is the main annual fundraiser event for Living Earth, a nonprofit church in Denver, Colorado. Joy Burton is the festival's Executive Director and the Executive Director of Living Earth. From 2010 to 2017 Living Earth partnered in hosting Beltania with Northern Colorado Covenant of the River (aka NCCR). In 2019 the Beltania Festival announced that it would be their last year of operations.

It does not refer to a singular invective, but rather a style of communication.  Etymology and Use  The German dictionary Duden traces the word Schm√§h back to the middle high German sm√¶he, which means \\"insult\\" or \\"contumely treatment.\\" In Austrian German slang Schm√§h means \\"gimmick,\\" \\"trick,\\" \\"swindle\\" or \\"falsehood\\" as well as \\"compulsory friendliness,\\" \\"saying\\" or \\"joke.\\"Schm√§h, der, duden.de, accessed on 28. November 2014. According to Peter Wehle, Schm√§h is derived from the Yiddish schem√° (story, something overheard) whereas Robert Sedlacek suggests an origin in Rotwelsch, in which Schmee means something to the extent of Thieves' cant, lie or joke.Robert Sedlacek: Das √∂sterreichische Deutsch. Wie wir uns von unserem gro√üen Nachbarn unterscheiden. Ein illustriertes Handbuch. Verlag Ueberreuter, M√ºnchen 2004, , S. 342. The Variantenw√∂rterbuch des Deutschen (a German dictionary that documents geographical and dialectic differences in the German language) defines Viennese Schm√§h as a typically Austrian - often perceived as superficially friendly - charm that is ascribed, especially in Western Austria, to the Viennese. The Term is derived from Viennese German and has been carried over into the Standard German and even in Germany is sometimes used in the form Wiener Schm√§h.Ulrich Ammon, Hans Bickel, Jakob Ebner: Variantenw√∂rterbuch des Deutschen ‚Äì Die Standardsprache in √ñsterreich, der Schweiz und Deutschland sowie in Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Ostbelgien und S√ºdtirol. Verlag Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 2004, S. 675, online in Google B√ºcher. Wiener Schm√§h is strongly associated with Austrian Cabaret and stand-up comedy. In an article concerning Austrian humor, the German- language newspaper Kurier offered the following anecdote as an example of Schm√§h: \\"A woman died. In front of her open grave stood her husband next to his wife's lover. The lover was completely broken and cried bitterly. The woman's husband laid his arm consolingly across the lover's shoulders and said: 'Don't take it so hard. I'll definitely marry again!'\\"http://kurier.at/kultur/die-geschichte-des-oesterreichischen- humors/812.373 Reception Often Wiener Schm√§h is treated as synonymous with Viennese German. It is considered to be subtle, indirect and full of hidden innuendo, sometimes analogous to black humor. The cabaret artist Reinhard Nowak defined Schm√§h as a combination of crass and endearing and as an often not earnest form of togetherness. Likewise, cabaret artist Josef Hader suggests that Schm√§h unites charm and a certain kind of unfriendliness that are normally incompatible.Irene Binal: DeutschlandRadio Berlin vom 28.

He won a single cap for Wales in the 1929 Five Nations Championship. Personal history Roberts was born in Toxteth, Liverpool in 1909. He was educated at Cardiff High School for Boys before matriculating to Oxford University. In 1934 he married Betty Elliot, daughter of former Wales international Jack Elliot. He served his country in the Second World War, joining the Welsh Guard as an acting captain. Roberts was a freelance journalist and a breeder of prize Welsh pigs. He died in Bodfari in 1969. Rugby career Roberts first came to note as a rugby player while a student representing Cardiff High School. He played for Cardiff RFC while still a teenager, making his first appearance for the club in the 1926‚Äì27 season. On entering Oxford he was selected for the Oxford University student team and won four sporting Blues, playing in the Varsity matches of 1928 through to 1931. In the 1929 match he faced his older brother John Roberts, who was playing for Cambridge. In 1931 Roberts was made the secretary of Oxford University RUFC, and for that year's Varsity game he was made captain of the team. Under his captaincy, Oxford won a 'splendid game'. Writing in 1951 Marshall opined that Roberts 'did more than anyone to win the match for Oxford; Roberts weaving and swaying his way in short, powerful strides'. In 1929 Roberts was selected to play for Wales. This time he was on the same side as his brother, as they faced England in the opening match of the 1929 Five Nations Championship. Roberts played in his preferred fly-half position outside the more experienced Wick Powell. The game ended in an England victory and Roberts was dropped for the next match and didn't represent Wales again. Despite a long association with Cardiff RFC, Roberts only played 31 matches for the club.

The station opened on 29 October 1896 and is located on the Wroc≈Çaw‚ÄìPozna≈Ñ railway and Sulech√≥w‚ÄìLubo≈Ñ ko≈Ço Poznania railway. The train services are operated by Przewozy Regionalne and Koleje Wielkopolskie. History In 1853, the Prussian authorities granted the Society of Upper Silesian Railways a concession to build a railway line from Wroclaw to Leszno and Leszno to Poznan. The work was completed on 29 October 1856, when a single-track railway line from Wroclaw via Leszno to Poznan opened. In Lubon the Upper Silesian Railway bought the land for the construction of the line from August Cieszkowski, owner of the ≈ªabikowo country estate. The boundaries of the property included a part of the village Lubo≈Ñ and hence in 1904, the original name of the station ≈ªabikowo was changed in accordance with its location to Lubo≈Ñ (in German Luban). Building the station building in Lubon was probably simultaneously with the opening of the railway line. Built of red brick floors, with attic housed the waiting room and room service, and the main entrance was from the street. On 1 July 1909 was opened the newly built line from (Poznan) - Lubo≈Ñ - Grodzisk. During World War I Lubo≈Ñ station was already an important strategic point passed by military transport. Gunpowder and explosives were made in Lubon at this time. From 29 November 1918 the Polish Union of Railwaymen was established in Poznan, who gradually took control of the railways in the Greater Poland region, preventing deportation to Germany of rails, food and military equipment. One of the episodes of the Greater Poland Uprising took place at the station in Lubon, where on 30 December 1918 the insurgents captured German military train with six guns and fifteen cars flour. After regaining independence, the service on the railways was by Polish railwaymen. Some of them found work and settled in Lubon ( Bocian√≥wko ). During World War II, Germany took over the management of the whole rail network. Most Lubo≈Ñ railway workers were forced to work on the railway for the Third Reich. After the liberation, the railway infrastructure was rebuilt. In February 1945 fixed tracks Poznan-Lubon, where there was only undamaged water intake for steam locomotives, and in the spring launched a line Poznan Central - Leszno, which was electrified (all the way) on 20 December 1969. For the next 40 years there has been tremendous development of rail passenger and freight transport. By the end of the 1980s Lubo≈Ñ was a major station marshalling yard, which employs about 300 railroad workers.

Built between 1964 and 1968, it is a distinctive local example of the International Style of architecture, designed by architect Anthony Scoville for his own year-round use. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. In early 2016, it was for sale. Description and history The Scoville house stands on a rural parcel of rolling terrain. The house is located on the west side of Dawley Road, a short way south of Shunpike Road, and is accessed via a long and winding drive that ends up approaching it from the south. The house is a square structure, with its second story overhanging the first on all four sides. A tall concrete tower rises at the center of the building. The upper level's exterior is characterized by tall casement and plate glass windows and vertical flushboarded siding that is either composite particle board (as originally built) or plywood (which has been laid over deteriorating portions of the original particle board). The ground level has exposed rough concrete walls as well as similar finishes to the upper level. The house was designed by architect Anthony Scoville, a recent graduate of Yale University, and was built between 1964 and 1968 by fellow Yale students and friends of Scoville's, on land he had purchased a few years earlier. The house is based on the architectural ideals espoused by Le Corbusier, prompting Scoville to name the property \\"Corbu\\". The house bears some conceptual resemblance to Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye in France.

Gerard, an aristocrat, is in mourning over the death of his mistress Leonora. He listens to tape recordings of them having sex and records his recollections of the day he met Leonora for the first time at the carnival of Venice many years ago, on a day he felt sexually adventurous. In a flashback, we see him meet her on the streets and introducing himself as Giacomo Casanova. After chasing her through the city, he finds her waiting for him behind a column in a passageway, where he lifts her dress and has sex with her. Later that day in an opium den, after having a smoke, they are initiated by Haunani into the cosmic secrets of pleasure and join in a threesome with her. Back in the present, Gerard and Fiorella dress Leonora's naked body for her funeral. When Ursula and Edmund, Leonora's children from another man, arrive for the funeral, Gerard, who has not seen either of them for ten years, at first mistakes Ursula for Leonora. Gerard is now legal guardian to both until they come of age. In a sudden fit, Edmund cries out that his mother was only a whore and suffers an epileptic attack. He is calmed down by his sister breastfeeding him like their mother did. Later, it is Fiorella who repeatedly breastfeeds him and with whom he has his first sex. Ursula eavesdrops on Gerard listening to his recordings of her mother's voice during sex. Later, she dresses exactly like her mother used to and dances with both Edmund and then Gerard, to whom she cites her mother's words from the recording, outraging him. At night, while Gerard is asleep, Ursula enters his room and listens to the tapes herself. She decides she wants to lose her virginity to him and makes the offer directly by feigning her mother wanted him to do so. Gerard, however, is unwilling to comply, which encourages Ursula to start acting like her mother. At the movies with Gerard, she fondles a stranger next to her. Going for a ride with Gerard, she incites the well endowed stable master Boris to have sex with her when Gerard interrupts them and whips him away. Finally, she visits a brothel run by Rosa, a friend of Leonora's. She starts to work there, planning to give away her virginity in order to take revenge on Gerard for not doing so himself. However, her customers are such that it never happens. One night, Ursula and Edmund disappear, Ursula having vandalised Gerard's mementos of Leonora and rerecorded the tapes with her own voice. Gerard, upset, has sex with Fiorella on the couch. They then go to the police to initiate a search but are not given proper attention because Gerard's father was a well-known anti-fascist. Later, Gerard and Fiorella visit the opium den to get help, where after a smoke they have a threesome with Haunani. At Rosa's, Ursula's virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder. In the meantime, Haunani helps Gerard track down Ursula at Rosa's. When he tries get the police to intervene due to Ursula and Edmund still being underage, they refuse. They admit they have already known about Ursula and the auction for a few days, claiming that all of Venice has heard of it. However, the highest bidder is the commander of the Venetian fascist militia. Gerard and Fiorella therefore visit Rosa by themselves and Gerard pays Rosa more than the highest bidder in order to save Ursula's virginity. When Ursula consequently offers her virginity to him again, he refuses, but by threatening to deflower herself with a candle, she finally convinces Gerard to have sex with her. In the final scene, Gerard and Ursula walk towards the passageway where Leonora and he first had sex. She walks ahead, and when he follows, she waits for him behind a column to offer herself by lifting her dress, addressing him as Casanova.

Background Addison was born in Scotland in 1758. At age 19, he earned his Master of Arts at Aberdeen University. After his University education he was educated to become a minister and admitted to the Aberlowe Presbytery in 1781. Afterwards, he immigrated to the United States in 1785. He was not able to obtain a license from the Redstone Presbytery to become a minister. He became a lawyer in Washington County, Pennsylvania in 1787 and was elected to the bar at that time. In 1791, he became the president judge of the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania and possessed authority over both state and federal laws. Westward expansion at this time created new legal questions about the tax on whiskey, land ownership and battles with Native Americans. This was to be important during the Whiskey Rebellion during which upheld the authority of state and federal laws over Western Pennsylvania. He owned land in Washington county and 620 acres in Donegal Township, and 500 acres in Franklin Township. Writings Addison wrote extensively with other jurists. He was impeached due to disagreements with Justice John B.C. Lucas in 1802. He was a regular contributor to the Pittsburgh Weekly Gazette (now the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) expressing his opinions on the political events of the period. In his March 16, 1793 contribution, he describes President George Washington: Law practice Addison practiced law during politically divisive issues in early America.

Usually it is found at the start of the volume, as a frontispiece before the main text, but may also be placed at the end, as in the Vivian Bible,Calkins, 116 or at the start of a particular text in a collection.Kren & McKendrick, 197 In earlier manuscripts the recipient of the book may be a dead saint, the founder of a monastery or monastic order, for example, and the person handing over the book the abbot, or sometimes the scribe of the book. The genre is an extension of other forms of dedication portraits, for example wall-paintings or mosaics in churches showing the person who commissioned the church holding a model of it. Ultimately they stretch back to scenes where classical rulers receive tribute, or those where a procession of Early Christian martyrs carry their crowns to present Christ.Alexander, 83 The miniatures are often found in luxury books presented to the emperor or another major figure, which usually followed significant donations of land to the monastery concerned. In the early period the manuscripts concerned are normally religious books, especially liturgical ones. The texts are old, and the \\"offering\\" represented is the creation of an expensive illuminated manuscript. In the late Middle Ages works,Brown, 102, places this revival in the 15th century, but 14th century examples are numerous, as Cynthia Stone points out. Two are illustrated here. often secular ones, are generally presented by their author or translator, though lavish copies of older texts may also still receive presentation miniatures. In these first cases the \\"offering\\" is usually the text itself, and the patron had presumably often paid for his own luxury copy himself, though some translators and even authors were also scribes. Now the text dedication to the patron, at this period often long and flowery, came to form part of the work itself, and at least the text was repeated in further copies. Such author's dedications, now far shorter, have remained part of the printed book. Sometimes presentation miniatures were also repeated in subsequent copies.Brown, 102 Michelle Brown distinguishes between presentation miniatures, where the actual book containing the miniature passed between the parties shown, and dedication miniatures in subsequent copies made for other people.Brown, 102 Early medieval Two royal visits to respectively the author and translator of Vincent de Beauvais's work translated in French by Jean de Vignay as Le Miroir historial, c. 1333 Royal presentation miniatures are especially a feature of Late Carolingian and Ottonian art, providing a series of portraits of the Ottonian emperors, mostly not actually shown with the book, and a precedent for later rulers. In a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor.Calkins, 116‚Äì118 In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St Pirmin, founder of Hornbach Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the \\"command structure\\" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.Solothurn Zentralbibliothek Codex U1 (ex-Cathedral Treasury), folios 7v to 10r; Alexander, 89‚Äì90; Legner, Vol 2, B2, all eight pages illustrated on pp. 140‚Äì141; Dodwell, 134 The Egbert Psalter also has four pages of presentation scenes, with two each spread across a full opening, the left with a bowing offeror in near profile, the right with the enthroned receiver. Egbert, Archbishop of Trier receives the book in the first pair, then presents it to Saint Peter in the second.Head, Thomas. \\"Art and Artifice in Ottonian Trier.\\" Gesta, Vol. 36, No. 1. (1997), pp 65‚Äì82. A large proportion of the portraits that survive of monastic scribes, who may also have been the artists for the miniatures, come from presentation miniatures, more typically showing presentations to either saints or other clergy who had commissioned books. Such scenes continue to appear in the Romanesque period.Alexander, 89‚Äì93 The earliest surviving portrait of a reigning English king (coins excepted) and the earliest English presentation miniature shows √Üthelstan presenting Saint Cuthbert with the copy of Bede's Life of Saint Cuthbert containing it, probably in 934.Webster, 170; This was presented by √Üthelstan to the saint's shrine in Chester-le-Street; southern-based medieval English kings were always careful to pay due respect to Cuthbert, the great saint of the North.Foot, √Üthelstan: The First King of England, pp. 155‚Äì156 In the High Middle Ages presentation miniatures in luxury copies of the main liturgical and devotional books, showing the book being presented, tended to be replaced by miniatures of the owner or donor at prayer, sometimes using a book which can be taken as the volume containing the miniature. These often include the object of the prayer, Christ, the Virgin Mary, or a saint.Kren & McKendrick, 180‚Äì181, 194‚Äì196, 227‚Äì229, 321‚Äì323, 371‚Äì373 Sometimes the owner is shown being \\"presented\\" to Christ or the Virgin by his patron saint, as though at court, but these are not generally called \\"presentation miniatures\\". The form did not die out, however. The earliest surviving copy of the Grandes Chroniques de France was presented by the monks of Saint-Denis, who had compiled the text, to Philip III in about 1274, with two presentation scenes, though neither act as frontispieces.Hedeman, 11‚Äì17; figs. 3 and 4 File:Athelstan.jpg√Üthelstan presenting a manuscript of Bede's Life of Saint Cuthbert to Cuthbert, the earliest surviving portrait of a reigning English king.

Miniature by Jean Bondol, who was also a valet de chambre. Vaudetar was a nobleman, already in charge of the Louvre palace, who was to progress further at court. As book culture increased in the Late Middle Ages, authors still relied on gifts from patrons to reward their efforts, and it is in this context that the dedication miniature revived. Very often the miniature was in the personal copy made by the patron for his library. The author or translator kneels, holding out his book, and the patron is often surrounded by a group of courtiers, advertising his generosity in encouraging literature. The public and ceremonial presentation of gifts from, but mostly to, the monarch or lord was a great feature of medieval court life, concentrated on the New Year.Stratford, 126‚Äì133 A high proportion of the surviving portraits of late medieval scholars and artists, and a significant proportion of those of the patrons, come from these miniatures, many of which show individualized features and were probably by artists who had had good opportunity to observe their subjects. The French royal family, including their Burgundian cousins, led the fashion, which spread to England and elsewhere. Extensively illuminated books were also presented to royalty as diplomatic gifts, or by ambitious courtiers to the monarch, and these might include presentation miniatures. Sometimes the presentation miniature might be the only one in a book; such was the case with Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of Boccaccios De mulieribus claris translated into French (BnF, Ms Fr. 133, f 2r).Lie, 34‚Äì35 King Charles V of France (r. 1338‚Äì1380), one of the first great bibliophile medieval monarchs, had a large library and especially encouraged and commissioned translations of books into French, which were very often given a presentation miniature.Alexander, 143 He continues to be shown in dedication miniatures a century after his death. Louis de Gruuthuse's copy of about 1470 of the \\"Pseudo-Seneca\\"'s De remediis fortuitorum translated into French for Charles V has a miniature showing the king receiving the text, but with de Gruuthuse standing to the side (BnF, Ms. fr. 1090, fol. 1).Kren & McKendrick, 246‚Äì247 The copy made about 1475 for Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy had a different image. This is a double presentation where firstly Seneca himself hands the text to the translator, who bends a knee to receive it, and then down a passageway in the background the translator kneels to present it to two male figures.Kren & McKendrick, 197‚Äì198 As here, dedication miniatures for old texts sometimes go well back in history, sometimes giving historic figures the features of contemporary ones. Guillebert de Lannoy (1386‚Äì1462), a leading Burgundian nobleman, diplomat and traveller, wrote around 1440 L'Instruction de josne prince (\\"Advice for a Young Prince\\"), which he dressed up with a fictional origin in the court of Norway \\"long, long ago\\", followed by a rediscovery of the manuscript text. The dedication miniature in Charles the Bold's copy illustrates the Norwegian story, but using up-to-date Burgundian costume and, it seems, the faces of the ducal family.Kren & McKendrick, 235‚Äì237 Another variation was to show the patron visiting the author, or even the illuminator, as they worked, an indication in the rise in status of those producing manuscripts.Alexander, 32 The form survived the arrival of printed books, though they became much rarer. When Edward IV of England's brother in law, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers had William Caxton print his own translation of the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers in 1477, the book he presented to Edward was a special manuscript copied from the printed edition, with a presentation miniature, implying \\"that a printed book might not yet have been regarded as sufficiently distinguished for a formal gift of this kind\\".Backhouse, 269 Some printed books continued the form in woodcut, with printers such as Antoine V√©rard in Paris joining the types of presenters depicted.

A Democrat, he was most notable for serving as mayor of Albany, New York after winning an election in 1921 that ended control of Albany by the Republican organization headed by William Barnes, and established the dominance of the Democratic organization led by Daniel P. O'Connell and Edwin Corning. Early life Hackett was born in Albany on December 7, 1868, the son of John Hackett and Martha Stormont. His family resided in Albany's South End neighborhood, and Hackett was educated in Albany. He began working while still a boy, including delivering the Albany Evening Journal newspaper, which was later owned by Republican Party leader William Barnes Jr.. After two years at Albany High School, Hackett dropped out in order to begin studying law in the office of Albany attorneys Amasa J. Parker Jr. and Edwin Countryman. He was admitted to the bar in 1889, and then practiced law in Albany.Machine Politics: A Study of Albany's O'Connells, p. 41 Hackett also joined the New York National Guard, serving in Albany's Company A, 10th Battalion (formerly the Albany Zouave Cadets).Mayor Erastus Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma He was a member of the unit from 1890 to 1899, and attained the rank of sergeant.Mayor Erastus Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma Hackett later served as treasurer and president of Company A's veterans association.

O'Connell, another South End resident, who worked in the early 1900s to reestablish Albany's Democratic Party following over 20 years of domination by the Republican organization of William Barnes Jr., the grandson of Thurlow Weed. In 1921 Hackett agreed to become the Democratic candidate for mayor. He was successful in the race against Republican William Van Rensselaer Erving,Machine Politics: A Study of Albany's O'Connells, p. 50 which enabled implementation of the O'Connell organization's longtime strategy of running wealthy non-ethnic Protestants like Edwin Corning, Parker Corning, and Erastus Corning 2nd for major offices including mayor and Congressman to enhance the respectability and credibility of a Democratic organization run by working class Irish-American, Catholic figures like O'Connell.

While campaigning for his third term, Hackett emerged as a likely candidate to be the Democratic nominee for Governor of New York in 1928, when incumbent Al Smith intended to be a candidate for President of the United States. Hackett indicated to friends in late 1925 and early 1926 that he intended to enter the campaign for governor in 1928, presuming that Smith won reelection in 1926 and made the presidential race in 1928.Mayor Erastus Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma, pp. 64‚Äì65 Death Hackett was visiting Cuba in February 1926 when, without warning, the car in which he was a passenger hit an obstruction or a rough patch of road.

Wagner, George R. Lunn, Peter G. Ten Eyck. After those efforts failed, the party turned to Franklin D. Roosevelt to make the 1928 governor's race.Mayor Erastus Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma, pp. 64‚Äì65 He was nominated by acclimation at the state party convention, and went on to defeat Republican Albert Ottinger in the general election.

During his career, he made over 50 appearances in the Football League during spells with Cardiff City and Wrexham and won two caps for Wales in 1939. His career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II which began just after he was signed by First Division side Liverpool meaning he never played for the side. During wartime, he also gained four international caps for Wales. Career Born in Penarth, Cardiff, Poland began his career playing as a forward with local amateur sides Cogan and Penarth Mission where his performances attracted the attention of Third Division South side Swindon Town who offered him a trial. Converted to playing as a winger by manager Ted Vizard, he impressed enough to sign for the club but failed to break into the first-team and left the club at the end of the 1934‚Äì35 season without making an appearance. He instead began playing as a goalkeeper and joined his hometown club Cardiff City, who had previously rejected him as an outfield player prior to his move to Swindon. Despite having conceded seven goals in a reserve fixture several days before, he was handed his professional debut on 11 January 1936 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Torquay United after replacing Jack Deighton in the starting line-up, becoming the third goalkeeper used by the club as they struggled at the bottom of the Third Division South. Following his debut, he played in six consecutive matches but did not return to the first-team until midway through the following season when he replaced Bill Fielding as first choice goalkeeper. In 1938, he joined Third Division North side Wrexham where he spent one season, breaking into the first-team following an injury to Pat McMahon, and impressed enough to earn a call-up to the Wales national football team, playing 2 matches. He played his first match on 15 March 1939 in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Ireland and his last match on 21 May 1939 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to France. His form attracted the attention of Liverpool and he joined the club on 28 June 1939 for a fee of around ¬£4,000. However, the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of World War II and he never played for the side. During the war years, he served in the Welsh Guards and appeared as a guest player in wartime fixtures for Brentford, Cardiff, Crystal Palace, Fulham and Leeds United and also earnt four wartime international caps for Wales. When the Football League resumed at the end of the war, Poland rejoined Cardiff City and played in the opening two matches of the 1946‚Äì47 season, defeats to Norwich City and Swindon Town, but lost his place in the side to Danny Canning. He later played for non-league side Lovell's Athletic.

(often referred to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uro≈° Prediƒá. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst the mother of one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting is said to have been inspired by a frequent sight in Prediƒá's home village of Orlovat‚Äîthat of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Prediƒá painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted. One art historian suggests the painting was influenced by the works of Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet, while another believes it was informed by those of the satirists William Hogarth and Honor√© Daumier. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Prediƒá painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. Background Uro≈° Prediƒá (1857‚Äì1953) was one of the most successful 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Prediƒá drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Prediƒá was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. \\"I observed this every day\\", he explained. \\"I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots.\\" Prediƒá had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door (1886). Painting =Description= Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!, often referred to simply as Happy Brothers, is an oil painting that measures . \\"It is a glimpse into village life in early fall\\", Prediƒá explained. \\"The harvest has been gathered and the pigs slaughtered. The fires have been lit, the spits turned, the drinks dispensed and the celebrations fully under way. The air is filled with the aroma of ... cooking meat ... and the sounds of music and drunken song that disturb the village's peace.\\" Prediƒá's self-portrait on a 1982 Yugoslav postage stamp According to Prediƒá, the painting shows four intoxicated youths who have been drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge down the middle of the dirt road, keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The gajda (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son. She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads Szeszf≈ëzde (\\"distillery\\" in Hungarian). Prediƒá's initials in Cyrillic, –£.–ü., can be found in the bottom-right corner. In his notes, Prediƒá identified the individuals depicted in the painting as \\"Maks\\" (the gajda player), Nikola Bojiƒá (the man waving his hat) and Nikola Mad≈æarov (the man bobbing between friends). Prediƒá described the person to Mad≈æarov's right as simply \\"a young man from Orlovat\\". =Analysis= The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that the painting is informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet. She concedes that there is no documentary evidence to suggest Prediƒá was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Prediƒá rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850‚Äì51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans. The art historian Dejan Medakoviƒá once suggested that Prediƒá was imitating the style of satirists William Hogarth and Honor√© Daumier. Filipovitch-Robinson writes that if this were so, Prediƒá's attempt at emulation was almost certainly unsuccessful. \\"Perhaps this was due to the inherent limitations of his subject\\", she writes, \\"the fact that the figures are not caricatured and that the painting is devoid of biting or mocking humor\\". According to Filipovitch- Robinson, Prediƒá's treatment of Balkan rural life differs in a number of ways from that of his contemporary Paja Jovanoviƒá, who was known for painting similar subjects. Jovanoviƒá's paintings were based on careful ethnographic studies of rural costumes and everyday objects, whereas Prediƒá's works lack Jovanoviƒá's precision, owing to the artist's tendency not to produce detailed studies of his subjects beforehand. \\"The images\\", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, \\"are more gestural because of the combination of generous brush strokes and minimal linear definition. This painting also brings Prediƒá much closer to the more daring experimentations of the Munich School not only because of the textural play of the mud-laden soil against rough peasant garb but in his convincing presentation of the atmosphere of the quiet predawn hours.\\" Reception and legacy Critic Milan Re≈°etar considered the painting one of Prediƒá's best works Upon seeing reproductions of the painting, the villagers did not interpret it as a call to change their ways. Instead, they were flattered by Prediƒá's decision to depict them. \\"To local audiences in particular\\", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, \\"such lighthearted didacticism entwined with a familiar and beloved world was immensely satisfying\\". It is said that on one of his visits home, Prediƒá went to the local pub and encountered the patrons examining a calendar with a reproduction of his painting inside it. A number of patrons‚Äîsome of whom were included in the composition‚Äîtapped him on the shoulder in drunken stupor and commended him on how accurately he had captured them. What Filipovitch-Robinson calls Prediƒá's \\"well-meaning and subtle moralizing\\" had thus been rendered ineffectual. Writing for the Novi Sad-based publication Javor in 1890, the critic Milan Re≈°etar ranked the painting among Prediƒá's finest works up to that point. The Croatian magazine Vienac offered a positive review of the work, saying it offered a sad look at conditions in the Banat. The magazine praised Prediƒá as \\"a true artist ... one who isn't afraid to use his talent to educate people and nurture the nobler aspects of human nature\\". Critics were satisfied with Happy Brothers because it not only offered an instructive narrative but also demonstrated the artist's technical abilities. Such vignettes of village life contributed greatly to Prediƒá's popularity among collectors from the emerging Serbian middle class. Reproductions of the painting met with commercial success, further contributing to its popularity. This led Prediƒá to paint two replicas, one in 1918 and the other in 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.

History  Legion M was founded by Paul Scanlan and Jeff Annison in March, 2016. Legion M is the world's first entertainment studio that allows fans to invest in and be part of the creation of new movies, television shows, virtual reality and other pieces of entertainment content. Scanlan and Annison were able to create Legion M after the SEC passed Title IV of the JOBS Act, which allowed non-accredited investors to make investments in small businesses. Legion M is currently partnered with Seth Green, co-creator of Emmy-winning TV series Robot Chicken, Gaston Dominguez of Meltdown Entertainment, and gaming studio Animal Repair Show. Legion M added a unique creative ally to its side by partnering with Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. This partnership adds a distribution component for Legion M as well as strengthening its expertise in film. On August 14, 2016, Legion M closed its initial funding round, and became the second company utilizing Reg. CF to earn $1,000,000. This record setting offering was completed in just three months with the contributions coming from over 3,000 investors. Legion M worked with the SEC to launch their 2nd funding round as a Reg A+ in March 2017. A Reg. A+ round allowed for a higher funding threshold ($50,000,000), which provides two benefits to Legion M; the addition of capital, and the possibility of additional individual investors. The latter benefit being especially important as Legion M strives forward toward its goal of 1,000,000 investors. Their Reg. A+ 2nd round was extended through Sept. 2, 2017 to accommodate for the growing demand from fans. On May 16, 2018, Paul and Jeff rang the opening cowbell on one of their frequent Facebook Live updates to announce the launch of Legion M's round 3 as a Reg. CF. With round 3 closing date right around the corner, they have already oversubscribed again. On December 12, 2018, Legion M and Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (\\"CSS Entertainment\\") announced the formation of a strategic partnership to bring community driven content to television fans. The companies will develop a variety of crowdsourced TV projects, including POSITV, a weekly collection of inspirational news stories submitted by people from around the world; a sketch comedy show called Comedy Royale where viewers play the role of production executive as up-and-coming creators, actors, and others compete for cash, prizes, and opportunities to break into the entertainment industry; a Shark Tank-like show called Up$ide where viewers become venture capitalists as entrepreneurs pitch their ideas on live television; and a weekly music showcase called New York Rock Exchange that puts audience members in a music executive's seat. Another series, titled Legion M, will allow creators and directors to pitch their TV or film concepts to a TV audience who will green light their favorite projects into production.  Projects  Legion M partners with filmmakers to create and/or distribute movies and television shows. Some of Legion M's projects include the following: *Save Yourselves is a science-fiction comedy film staring Sunita Mani and John Reynolds as a young couple from Brooklyn who travel to upstate New York and disconnect from everything, only to later discover the planet is under alien attack.

Annear completed a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology and psychology in 1973, but later dismissed his degree as 'unimportant'. As a jeweller, Annear was self-taught, like many of his contemporaries. Annear's early work was made in silver, and he also made paintings early in his career. In 1976 Annear read Theo Schoon's book Jade Country, and a few years later the work of John Edgar further piqued his interest in pounamu (New Zealand greenstone). On a 1986 trip to the west coast of New Zealand's South Island Annear gathered his first pieces of pounamu, and the material became very important for him. In 1991 he was awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Fellowship to study ancient jade carvings in Asia, Europe, and North America. In a 1988 article for Craft New Zealand craft historian Helen Schamroth discussed Annear's work, with particular reference to his 'bangles'. She wrote: > Not all of them are necessarily wearable - rather they function as visual > objects. 'Bangle' seems an easily recognisable descriptive label he uses to > describe a series of circular and cylindrical forms. It seems of little > consequence that the aperture might be too tight to fit over a hand, or that > a hollow cylindrical shape would imprison the arm. By simplifying the > imagery Paul has in fact driven the function out, leaving a form, a shape to > be admired, sculpture rather than jewellery. Annear was one of twelve artists selected for the 1988 Bone Stone Shell exhibition, a touring exhibition developed by the New Zealand Craft Council for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to \\"show overseas audiences the new and important direction of New Zealand jewellery\\". The works Annear made for Bone Stone Shell were all made of pounamu: he noted in the exhibition catalogue that 'Jade is the material that dominates my work at this time'. He described his work from this time as being inspired by an ‚Äòimagined neolithic culture‚Äô rather than specifically MƒÅori forms: the strong geometric shapes of the pieces are derived from arrowheads, adzes and other implements. From 1991 to 1996 Annear was a member of the contemporary jewellers collective, the Fingers group. His work was included in the 1993 survey of New Zealand jewellery Open Heart, curated by Elena Gee for The Dowse Art Museum. He also experimented with cast glass as a medium, with music and with animation, and in 2003 published The Artist ‚Äì a colouring book for adults. Annear retired to Cambodia in about 2000, where he continued to make jewellery. He died in Cambodia in April 2016. Annear's work is held in a number of New Zealand public collections, including Auckland War Memorial Museum, The Dowse Art Museum and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.
