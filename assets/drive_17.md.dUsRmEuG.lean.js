Its collection includes many original pioneer artifacts, a large railroad exhibit, ranching and timber industry displays, furniture, garments, and historic photographs. The museum also has a research library.  Arthur Bowman  The museum is named after Arthur Ray Bowman, a Prineville businessman and civic leader. Bowman was born in Kansas and came to Prineville in 1910 after receiving a law degree from the University of Washington. He established a successful title and insurance company in Prineville the county seat of Crook County. Bowman was active in civic affairs throughout his life. He served as the County Judge for Crook County from 1936 to 1942. He also helped establish the Ochoco Irrigation District and the Prineville Airport. Bowman helped bring U.S. Highway 26 through Crook County. He was particularly interested in the construction of the Prineville Dam on the Crooked River. Because of his dedication to the project, the dam was renamed the Arthur R. Bowman Dam in his honor. He died in 1970, leaving a legacy of business success and civic responsibility.\\"Arthur Ray Bowman\\" , A. R. Bowman Memorial Museum, Prineville Historical Society, Prineville, Oregon, 2008. In 1971, Bowman's wife and two daughters donated the Crook County Bank building to Crook County for use as a museum. At that time, the Crook County Historical Society assumed the responsibility of operating the A. R. Bowman Memorial Museum through a contractual agreement with Crook County.\\"Crook County Historical Society\\" , A. R.

The building was constructed in 1910. It is a two-story Romanesque style building constructed using stone blocks from a local quarry located west of the Ochoco Viewpoint. This is the same quarry that provided the stone used to build the Crook County Courthouse in 1909.\\"Bowman Museum\\" , A. R.

Bowman Memorial Museum, Prineville Historical Society, Prineville, Oregon, 2008. The building's interior has not significantly changed since it was a community bank. The first floor still has the bank's original bronze teller cages, marble counter tops, etched art-glass, gilt and alabaster chandeliers, and the mahogany paneling that were the trappings of a prestigious banking institution in the first half of the 20th century. The building was first occupied by the Crook County Bank. When the Crook County Bank left in 1923, it was replaced by the Bank of Prineville and later the Prineville National Bank. When that bank became insolvent during the Great Depression, the building was purchased by A. R. Bowman for his title and insurance business. Bowman used the building for his various businesses from 1935 until his death in 1970.\\"Walking Tour\\" , Prineville Crook County Chamber of Commerce, www.visitprineville.com, Prineville, Oregon, 2008. The bank is an excellent example of Prineville's early 20th century development. Because of its unique architecture and its importance to the history of Prineville, the Crook County Bank Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 19 June 1991.\\"Crook County Bank Building\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 18 February 2008.  Museum exhibits  The museum is run by the Crook County Historical Society and highlights the history of Crook County and central Oregon. The building's original bank interior has been maintained and is utilized in the museum's floor plan. There are major sections on local industry, transportation, and military history. On the first floor is the Hall of History, which highlights Crook County's past. This includes exhibits on the City of Prineville Railroad, the local timber industry and United States Forest Service as well as pioneer furniture, garments, tools, and other artifacts. There are also many photographs of Crook County people, local landmarks, and historic event. The museum's displays include the bank's original teller cages with their marble counters and elegant woodwork. Museum visitors can look inside bank's safe and see old ledgers and other documents on display.\\"Welcome to Bowman Museum\\" , A.R. Bowman Memorial Museum, Prineville Historical Society, Prineville, Oregon, 2008. The second floor rooms include a ranch tack room, an old-time bedroom, a dining room, a re-creation of the old Paulina store and post office, and exhibits of early medical and dental equipment. The museum's research library is also located on the second floor. The museum's research room contains approximately 700 reference books on Oregon history. Researchers can investigate the local timber industry, the Crook County range war between cattlemen and sheepherders, the Lost Meek Wagon Train, and many other subjects. The museum's gift shop has books on local history as well as souvenirs. In 1980, the Crook County Historical Society was offered a 1907 Studebaker Phaeton along with some old farm equipment. However, there was no place in the museum to house the vehicle and the large artifacts. As a result, the Society established a building fund to raise money for another building. In 1987, a museum annex was constructed at the Crook County fairgrounds. The building is owned by Crook County, but is operated by the Crook County Historical Society in the same manner as the main Bowman Museum. In 1996, the Bowman Museum hosted a Smithsonian traveling exhibit called Barn Again. That was the first time a traveling Smithsonian exhibit was shown in central Oregon. In 1997, the museum was awarded a general operating support grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, an independent agency of the United States Federal Government. That was a significant achievement since less than 20 percent of more than 1,000 institutional applicants received one of the Institute's competitive national grants.  Visiting  The A.R.

In 1970 it was sold to the World Championship Tennis (WCT), a competing professional tennis league run by Lamar Hunt. History The National Tennis League (NTL) was formed by former U.S. Davis Cup captain George MacCall in 1967, as a governing body to an American professional tennis tour. MacCall signed several players to contracts, including Arthur Ashe, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson and Stan Smith. The NTL followed in the wake of MacCall's departure from the existing International Professional Tennis Association (IPTA), which had been created by promoter Wallace Dill in 1966 \\"Tennis 'New Deal' Keeps Dill Hopping\\", Orlando Sentinel, February 5, 1967, p1-D \\"Denny Ralston Turns Pro\\", Oakland Tribune, December 26, 1966, p55, and preceded the creation of World Championship Tennis (WCT), formed by Lamar Hunt and David Dixon \\"Switch to pro tennis\\", Windsor (ON) Star, December 23, 1967, p4C The NTL differed from the IPTA and from WCT in being the first to sign women to professional contracts in addition to men \\"Billie Jean Interested in Career as Pro\\", Los Angeles Times, November 28, 1967, pIII-2. In 1968 Billie Jean King became the first woman of the Open Era to sign a pro contract to tour, in a group with Rosie Casals, Françoise Dürr and Ann Haydon-Jones as the women's section of the National Tennis League. \\"On April 1, 1968, we signed with the National Tennis League, as George MacCall's troupe was called. Frankie (Durr) and Rosie (Casals) received a guarantee of $20,000 per annum for two years, mine (Ann Haydon-Jones) was $25,000 and Billie Jean King's was $40,000. George envisaged us playing a lot of matches and tournaments amongst ourselves and did not expect us to be as much involved in open tennis as later proved to be the case....We joined the six men that he already controlled - Emerson, Laver, Gimeno, Gonzales, Rosewall and Stolle. A group of ten was an attractive proposition to offer and he believed he was going to do very well from it. His main problem was one of administration. He had to keep flying all over the world to tie up arrangements with the various associations but didn't leave sufficient time to organize his professional tours in America, the most important part of the operation, and didn't seem to be able or willing to delegate.\\"—From A Game to Love by Ann Jones. Published 1971 by Stanley Paul & Co Ltd; p. 135 and 136 In June 1969 Fred Podesta's formed Tennis Champions Inc. and became the parent company of the NTL with Podesta as president and MacCall as executive director. Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed the Australian Open, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day), and the low prize money. In 1970 the National Tennis League (NTL), which employed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrés Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle, prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was ultimately won by Arthur Ashe. Both professional organizations, the NTL and WCT, banned their contracted players from contesting the grand slams at some stage during their short tenure and this made the International Lawn Tennis Federation, the predecessor of the current ITF, very nervous. That was the catalyst that led to the abandonment of the distinction between amateur and professional tennis players and by 1968, the beginning of the Open Era, all tennis players could compete in all tennis tournaments George MacCall sold the NTL's player contracts to Lamar Hunt in July 1970. He became the first Commissioner of World Team Tennis in 1974. Some of the players he signed to contracts were: Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Roy Emerson, Pancho Gonzales, Fred Stolle, Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals. He traveled the world to sign players.

The measure was legislatively referred by the State Legislature. If approved, the proposition would have authorized a one-time reallocation of tobacco tax revenue to help balance the state budget. Background In February 2009, the State Legislature narrowly passed the 2008–2009 state budget during a special session, months after it was due. As part of the plan to lower the state's annual deficits, the State Legislature ordered a special election with various budget reform ballot propositions, among them Proposition 1D. The proposition was part of Assembly Bill 17 (Third Extraordinary Session), which was authored by Assemblywoman Noreen Evans, a Democrat from Santa Rosa. The bill passed in the State Assembly by a vote of 75 to 3 and in the State Senate by a vote of 37 to 0. Proposal Proposition 1D, officially entitled \\"Budget Act of 2008. Children and Families Act: use of funds: services for children.\\", would have authorized a fund-shift of $268 million in annual tobacco tax revenue currently earmarked for First Five early childhood development programs under the terms of Proposition 10. That revenue, plus $340 million in unspent First Five tobacco tax money held in a reserve fund at the time, would have instead been used to pay for other state government health and human services programs that serve children, including Medi-Cal, foster care, child care subsidies, preschool programs, and more. Money for these programs came from the state's General Fund at the time. At the time, 80% of First Five money was distributed to county governments for similar programs, including government \\"school readiness\\" programs for pre-schoolers, Medi-Cal health coverage to children whose family income is above the cap for that program, government parent- education training, food and clothing subsidies, and more.

When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead. Meanwhile, Peter, with help from Chris and Meg, decides to create an animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks due to Lois' newfound connections with Fox. Meg's reasonable, albeit banal, suggestions are ignored by Peter in favor of Chris' outlandish ideas, and Peter eventually fires her. He and Chris settle on developing the show's pilot episode around a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although it is suggested that the crudely-animated and written pilot will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to produce the show, but Peter is insulted when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion for Handi- Quacks impresses Chernin, who allows him to retain complete creative control over its production, but a still-aggrieved Peter rebuffs the deal entirely, which he quickly regrets. At the end of the episode, Lois is revealed to no longer work as a reporter; she does not bother to reveal how or why due to a perceived lack of interest from the audience. Production Actor Seth Rogen guest starred in the episode. \\"Fox-y Lady\\" is the tenth episode of Family Guys seventh season. The episode was written by former iCarly writer Matt Fleckenstein and directed by former supervising director Pete Michels. \\"Fox-y Lady\\", along with the seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season and seven from the seventh season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The DVDs included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane, and various crew and cast members from several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature that discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and a mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. The set also includes a reprint of the script for the episode. In addition to the regular cast, actor Seth Rogen cameoed as himself, this being his second appearance on the show after \\"Family Gay\\". Then-Fox Entertainment Group CEO Peter Chernin and The Wonder Years star Fred Savage also guest-starred, along with Daniel Stern as that series' narrator, and Ed Helms, Sharon Tay, John Moschitta, Jr. and Mark DeCarlo appeared as well. Recurring voice actors Jackson Douglas, Jennifer Tilly, and Kim Parks, and writers Kirker Butler, Steve Callaghan, Mark Hentemann, Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, and John Viener made cameo appearances in the episode as well. Actress Meredith Baxter-Birney voices herself in a cutaway. Actors Adam West and Patrick Warburton appeared in the episode as well. Cultural references When Lois is given her contract after getting a job at Fox News, she happily runs home in a way reminiscent of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory when that film's protagonist, Charlie Bucket, runs home after receiving his golden ticket. She then falls and starts moaning, much like Peter did after he won a tour of the Pawtucket brewery in \\"Wasted Talent\\", but instead of grabbing her kneecap as Peter did, she grabs her right breast. Later on at the studio, Stewie's broadcast on Fox News is a parody of a viral video clip of an angry Bill O'Reilly during a teleprompter malfunction. When Fred Savage is proven to be Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore, he also reveals himself to be Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe, and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich. After Savage confesses to his multiple identities, the voice-over from The Wonder Years is heard and Fred shouts at him, \\"I don't need you anymore!\\". Reception In its original airing in the United States, \\"Fox-y Lady\\" was watched by 7.45 million viewers, surpassing the other shows in the \\"Animation Domination\\" block. It gained a 3.7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, finishing second in its timeslot. The episode received generally mixed reviews from television sources and critics. Alex Rocha of TV Guide called it a \\"pretty dull episode, but with some bright humorous spots [...] The episode looked like it had potential, but definitely did not perform to its best.\\" Ahsan Haque of IGN called it \\"far from perfect\\" but \\"definitely a lot better than the terrible O.J. Simpson episode from last week.\\" He called the Handi-Quacks scenes \\"fantastic\\" and called the episode overall \\"definitely a step in the right direction.\\" Robin Pierson of The TV Critic said: \\"More purpose in the plot and more jokes related to the story than usual\\" and gave the episode 40 out of 100. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote that \\"tonight's Family Guy was the best it's been in a looooong time\\". He stated that in both plotlines \\"the game is established early [...] and the show escalates nicely\\", and graded the episode a B.

The manga was serialized between the November 2005 and September 2011 issues of Kodansha's Monthly Afternoon manga magazine, and was collected into 10 volumes. A 12-episode anime adaptation by Studio Comet and directed by Shinji Takamatsu aired in Japan between July and September 2009. Plot Sora no Manimani revolves around Saku Ōyagi, a bookworm who moves back to the town he lived in as a child after seven years. He had a childhood friend named Mihoshi Akeno who loved astronomy and would always take Saku outside against his will to look at the stars, or do other outdoor activities, whereas Saku would rather have stayed inside with his books. Saku broke his arm the day he moved away after trying to catch Mihoshi falling out of a tree; Saku resented her for this, and that she never saw him off. However, this was a misunderstanding since he was too stubborn to listen to the whole story (the fall had put her in the hospital so she could not see him off), and later becomes friends with Mihoshi again after they meet attending the same high school. Mihoshi convinces Saku to join the astronomy club she is a member of, despite Saku actually wanting to join literature club instead. Hime Makita, a girl in Saku's class who has a crush on him, also joins the astronomy club. Characters ; : :Saku is the main protagonist for this story, who grew up traveling around Japan due to his father constantly changing jobs. Saku loves to read books and can often be seen reading, whether it be on the bus, at school, or at home. He generally likes to stay indoors and read, but after joining the astronomy club, he starts to enjoy going out and stargazing or participating in other club activities. As Fumie notes, his writing skills are top notch, making him better suited for the literature club. While he is constantly annoyed by Mihoshi, he does enjoy her company. However, because of how Mihoshi shows up to his class a lot, many of his classmates believe that they are dating (much to the dismay of Hime and Saku). ; : :Mihoshi is a cheerful girl who is a childhood friend of Saku's though she is one year older than him and has a tendency to act childish. She is very enthusiastic about and has a strong love for all things astronomy, an interest she learned about from her late father. She has always enjoyed going outside and stargazing or doing other activities, and would usually drag Saku along with her, often against his will. She is thrilled to be reunited with Saku and convinces him to join the astronomy club at their school. She becomes the club president after Roma graduates. ; : :Sayo is a calm and intelligent girl who is in the same year as Mihoshi and is also a member of the astronomy club. Her family runs a Buddhist temple. ; : :Hime is a girl who is in the same class as Saku, whom she has a crush on. After Saku joins the astronomy club, she quickly follows suit so as to spend more time closer to him and getting to know him. She had originally met Saku briefly on the bus before taking their entrance exam for the school, and was surprised to see him again in her class. She is generally a calm girl though is known to get jealous of Mihoshi when she is sticking close to Saku. Though she has a crush on Saku, she is easily put off by other guys trying to make advances on her. Hime's hair gets frizzy in high- humidity weather, and her sister can use this trait to gauge the humidity in the air. ; : :Masashi Edogawa is one of Saku's classmates and friend, and while he often takes part in astronomy club activities, is actually a member of the photography club. He enjoys hanging around the astronomy club because of Mihoshi, Sayo and Hime, whom he sees as all very attractive, and is jealous that Saku is surrounded by beautiful girls. However, he also enjoys astronomy and actively participates in stargazing events. His photography skills tend to come in handy in promoting the astronomy club. ; : :Takeyasu Roma is the president of the astronomy club. He has always had a poor constitution and as such is generally very weak and often spits up blood or passes out after doing something straining. He has an intense love of astronomy, akin to Mihoshi's own enthusiasm. After graduating, he goes to college with Ayumi Ōmi, a girl with the same passion for astronomy as him, and who has a crush on him. ; : :Fumie is the student council president and also a member of the literature club, where she often takes charge of club events despite not being the club president. She notices how Saku also enjoys books and reading and has invited him to join the literature club on multiple occasions. She admires Saku's writing skills and develops an interest in him. She feels that the astronomy club and its members are not what a club should be and is generally not favorable about their activities. She has known Mihoshi for several years and feels animosity towards her. She has terrible eyesight and has trouble distinguishing objects and people without her glasses on.

It was an amendment of the Constitution of California prohibiting pay raises for members of the State Legislature, the Governor, and other state officials during deficit years. It was proposed by the legislature and approved in a referendum held as part of the May 19, 2009 special election ballot, in which the California electorate also voted on five other propositions. Background In February 2009, the State Legislature narrowly passed the 2008–2009 state budget during a special session, months after it was due. As part of the plan to lower the state's annual deficits, the State Legislature ordered a special election with various budget reform ballot propositions, among them Proposition 1F. The measure was proposed by the State Legislature as a joint resolution called Senate Constitutional Amendment 8 of the 2009–10 Regular Session (Resolution Chapter 3, Statutes of 2009). It was authored by Senator Abel Maldonado, a Republican from Santa Maria, and passed both houses unanimously. The legislature later voted in an extraordinary session to submit the amendment and five other proposals to a special election held in May. The other propositions were all rejected by voters. Provisions The measure amended Article III, Section 8 of the California constitution, which concerns the Citizens Compensation Commission. The amendment prohibits the commission, which sets salary levels for the governor, other top state officials, and members of the California State Legislature, from increasing those salaries if the state General Fund is expected to end the year with a deficit. Specifically, if the state's Director of Finance reports that there will be a negative balance in the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties at the end of that fiscal year. While there would be a financial benefit to the state, such savings would be minimal.

Because of its importance to the history of Prineville, the Crook County Bank Building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Crook County Bank Building was built in 1910 and opened in 1911. It was the home of three different banks. It was first occupied by the Crook County Bank. When the Crook County Bank left in 1923, it was replaced by the Bank of Prineville and later the Prineville National Bank. When that bank became insolvent during the Great Depression, the building was purchased by A. R. Bowman for his title and insurance business.

In 1971, Bowman's wife and their two daughters donated the Crook County Bank Building to Crook County for use as a museum. The Crook County Historical Society assumed the responsibility of operating the A. R. Bowman Memorial Museum through a contractual agreement with the county government. Initially, the museum was run by volunteers, with the county paying for utilities.

After acquiring the building, the Crook County Historical Society constructed a new staircase to the second floor, replacing an old wooden stairs on the east end of the building. However, the building's interior has not significantly changed since it was a community bank. The first floor still has the bank's original bronze teller cages, marble counter tops, etched art-glass, gilt and alabaster chandeliers, and the mahogany paneling that were the trappings of a prestigious banking institution in the first half of the twentieth century.  Bowman Museum  Today, the old Crook County Bank building houses the A. R. Bowman Memorial Museum.

He played for the Packers from 1980 to 1991, starting 122 of 147 games at both safety positions. He finished his career with 20 interceptions, 11 sacks, and a touchdown.

It centred on the accusations that Manchester City player Billy Meredith had offered a rival player from Aston Villa a bribe to purposely lose their final league match of the season between the teams. It resulted in the Manchester City manager Tom Maley) and former chairman (W. Forrest) being banned from English football sine die, two directors (Allison and Davies) suspended for seven months, a further five directors dismissed, and a total of 17 players banned from ever playing for the club again. Among the players was Billy Meredith, who was banned from football for 18 months and transferred to City's local rivals Manchester United before the end of his ban. Key figures Billy Meredith had played for Manchester City since 1894. He was the key participant in the 1905 scandal, where he allegedly tried to bribe Alex Leake, a rival player with Aston Villa, a sum of £10 to throw the final match of the 1904–05 English football season (City were in contention for the title, while Villa had dropped out of the running). Aston Villa won the match 3–2.Aston Villa Results  Season 1904/05, SoccerBase After losing the match and thus any hopes of winning the league, Manchester City player Sandy Turnbull physically fought with Alex Leake, and the resulting investigation into the violence revealed the bribery scandal, Leake turning Meredith in to The Football Association when asked about the incident; however, Meredith always pleaded innocence. Although no evidence was taken from Meredith, he was suspended for one year and fined. Manchester City refused to pay him, as they did not want to upset the Football Association, and Meredith retaliated by exposing Manchester City's illegal payments to their players of over £4 (which was the set wage given at the time). In his statement to the press, he said, \\"What was the secret of the success of the Manchester City team? In my opinion, the fact that the club put aside the rule that no player should receive more than four pounds a week... The team delivered the goods, the club paid for the goods delivered and both sides were satisfied\\" As a result, he claimed, \\"You approve of the severe punishment administered by the Commission AGAINST ME and state that the offence I committed at Aston Villa should have wiped me out of football forever. Why ME ALONE? when I was only the spokesman of others equally guilty\\" in a letter to the Athletic News. After the Football Association looked into and verified Meredith's accusations of overpaying players, Manchester City's manager Tom Maley was suspended from football for life. Maley was pointed out by name by Meredith, who claimed that Maley ordered him to bribe Leake, also stating that corruption was common among Manchester City's administration. Aftermath As a result of the scandal at Manchester City, the club was forced to pay £900. 17 players were fined individually and were suspended until New Year's Day 1907. The Football Association also forced Manchester City to auction off all of their players at the Queen's Hotel in Manchester. Manchester United's manager, Ernest Mangnall, bought up many of the most talented players, including Billy Meredith (for £500), Herbert Burgess, Sandy Turnbull, and Jimmy Bannister. In fact, Meredith moved to Manchester United in May 1906, while still banned; he soon became the heart of the United team as they proceeded to win the 1907–08 championship. All of the Manchester City players' bans were lifted on 31 December 1906.

The M1870 was a single-shot bolt action rifle chambered for the 10.4mm Vetterli centrefire cartridge, at first loaded with black powder and later with smokeless powder. The M1870 was based upon the M1869 Swiss Vetterli but simplified for economy. M1870/87 *10.4mm Fucile di Fanteria, Modello 1870/87 Vetterli-Vitali In 1887 (until 1896), the Italian Army began converting the M1870 to a four-shot repeating rifle, based on the system designed by Italian artillery captain, G. Vitali. This conversion added a box magazine fed from a Swiss-style fabricated steel and wood stripper clip holding four cartridges, in the same caliber (10.4x47R mm) as before. The clip is pressed into the magazine, until the last round catches under the Cartridge retainer, and then the clip is withdrawn using the \\"pull string\\" in the top wooden frame of the clip. Clips of cartridges were supplied in a soldered sheet steel box, holding six clips. The conversion to the Vitali magazine was done on the long rifle, the TS (special troops musketoon) and possibly some of the Carabinieri carbines; No Vitali conversions were done to the Moschetto da Cavalleria for metropolitan Italian troops. In 1888, the Fondo Coloniale (Eritrea) requested 500 Vitali-converted Vetterli cavalry carbines for the Eritrean Native Cavalry (\\"spahi\\"—Swahili for \\"horse-soldier\\"). There are currently five known examples still in existence ( one in Australia, two in the US, two in Italy). Collectors refer to it as the M1870/88 V.V.Eritrean cav carbine. The Regio Esercito (Royal Army) Cavalry units maintained the M1870 single shot Moschetto da cavalleria until replaced by the M1891 Moschetto da cavalleria, in 1893. The conversion is indicted by a cartouche \\"Artig. Fab. D'armi Terni 1888\\" (dates vary), on the butt stock. The center of the cartouche displays a Crest of Savoy and the word, Riparazione (Italian for repair) is directly below the cartouche. Shortages of small arms appeared from the very beginning of Italy’s entrance into World War I on the side of the Allies. As more of the population mobilized for the first total war in European history, the supply of modern small arms fell short before the end of 1915 and a large number of obsolete Modello 1870/87 Vetterli-Vital were issued to newly formed regiments that were not expected to be in combat, however, troops carried these antiquated rifles into battle on several occasions. As well, in 1916, Italy sent a large number of Vetterli-Vitali rifles to Russia; ammunition and components were contracted for by Britain to the Remington Armory. These \\"tsarist\\" rifles eventually ended up in Republican hands in the Spanish Civil War, as the Soviet Union emptied its depots of all the old black powder and early smokeless rifles it had inherited after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. M1870/87/15 During World War I, many M1870/87 rifles were converted to share the same 6.5mm smokeless powder round instead of the inferior black powder rounds as the primary service rifle, the Carcano, by adding a 6.5mm barrel lining and a modified M91 Carcano magazine. The barrel sleeving was called the \\"Salerno method\\"; The bolt face was also machined to accept the smaller diameter 6.5 mm cartridge head, and the firing pin shortened. These conversions were used for rear echelon troops (guards, training, etc.) and were rarely, if at all, fired with standard 6.5 mm military ball ammunition. After WWI, many of these rifles were assigned to the colonies of Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica (Libya) and also to Eritrea and Somalia, again, as rarely-fired training rifles. These rifles were used again in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, mostly by native African soldiers.http://candrsenal.com/rifle-italian-vetterli-carcano-m708715/ C&Rsenal; During World War II, they were used only by fascist Blackshirts paramilitaries. It is considered by knowledgeable collectors that due to the rifle's age and general condition (manufactured in 1870-1890s) and converted twice (1887-90s and again 1915-16), that the black powder technology of the Vetterli design is not suitable for repeated use (i.e. intense combat use) with normal Italian ball ammunition of 6.5 mm, or its present-day commercial equivalent. Even back in the 1920s, anecdotal accounts of Salerno sleeves loosening under \\"hot\\" fire (they were soft-soldered in place) and subsequent \\"blow-by\\" experience since the 1950s appearance of these rifles as surplus has led to safety concerns.https://gunsmagazine.com/emergency-stopgap/ Guns Magazine  Comparison with contemporary rifles Gallery File:Vetterli- Vitali bayonet and scabbard.pngBayonet and scabbard File:1870G.jpgM.70 cartridge File:VetG.jpgM.90 cartridge Sources *Italian Vetterli MILITARY RIFLES IN THE AGE OF TRANSITION *M1870/87 Italian Vetterli-Vitali MILITARY RIFLES IN THE AGE OF TRANSITION For the specifications and the service history of the Italian Vetterli-Vitali rifles.

HSC-14 was established as Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 14 (HS-14) in 1984 and was redesignated HSC-14 in 2013. The squadron is equipped with the Sikorsky MH-60S Seahawk.  Mission  HSC-14 flies the MH-60S Seahawk helicopter, an all-weather, day and night multi-mission helicopter. The primary mission of the squadron is Anti-Surface Warfare(ASUW). Additionally, the squadron is trained and equipped to conduct Search and rescue (SAR), MEDEVAC, Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Naval Special Warfare operations (NSW), Anti-ship Missile Defense (ASMD) and Fleet Logistics support, including VERTREP.  Command history  HS-14 was established on 10 July 1984 at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California and originally flew the Sikorsky SH-3H \\"Sea King\\" helicopter. Assigned to Carrier Air Wing TWO from 1984 to 1993, the Chargers deployed aboard the aircraft carrier . In 1989, while deployed off the coast of Vietnam in the South China Sea, HS-14 participated in one of the largest rescue operations ever by a deployed helicopter squadron when they rescued 37 Vietnamese refugees who were trapped aboard a foundering boat. SH-3H Sea Kings of HS-14 in 1990 Squadron insignia, 1984–1994 In 1991, HS-14 participated in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During Desert Storm, the Chargers participated in an operation that resulted in the capture of four Iraqi commandos on a small island off the coast of Kuwait. Additionally, HS-14 played an important role in the destruction of one Iraqi gunboat and two anti-shipping mines. In 1992, the squadron deployed in support of Operation Southern Watch to the Northern Persian Gulf and to the coast of Somalia in support of Operation Restore Hope. In December 1992, the squadron surged to support the first eleven days of Operation Restore Hope with such determination and efficiency that the operational commander wrote, \\"without HS-14, the first ten days of RESTORE HOPE simply could not have happened.\\" In May 1993, the squadron moved 175 men and women, seven aircraft, and all their support equipment from San Diego to Mayport, Florida in four days. The cross-country move was executed to embark on board for her transit around South America to San Diego. During this transit, the squadron participated in coordinated anti-submarine warfare (ASW) with several South American navies. In October 1993, the Chargers began the transition from the Sea King to the SH-60F Seahawk helicopter. Soon afterward, military downsizing dictated the decommissioning of HS-12, a sister squadron in Japan. For HS-14, this meant an accelerated transition schedule and training program to complete a homeport change to Atsugi, Japan by October 1994. The squadron's progress in this endeavor was rewarded with a personal visit from then Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Frank B. Kelso. HS-14 executed back-to-back deployments to the Persian Gulf in 1998 and 1999, participating in Operation Southern Watch. Additionally, the squadron began its annual participation in the bilateral exercises Foal Eagle and ANNUALEX. In 1998, the Chargers made their permanent sea-based home, traveling to Hawaii aboard in July for the complicated cross-deck move. A HS-14 SH-60F Seahawk drops a torpedo in 1996 In early 2002, the HS-14 supported Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan by deploying a detachment on board USS Kitty Hawk. During this deployment, Kitty Hawk served as a mobile staging base for elite United States Army special operations units. In March 2003, as the situation in Iraq escalated, HS-14 and Kitty Hawk received orders to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Chargers were assigned to provide a naval special warfare (NSW) capability to forward operating bases in support of SEAL operations. The squadron also affected the recovery of a CVW-5 strike fighter pilot who was downed in hostile territory. After returning from the Persian Gulf, HS-14 participated in several training and operational deployments, including the historic PULSE EX 2004. This exercise represented a shift in naval policy from set \\"work-up\\" periods and deployment schedules to a rapid- responding, surge capable force. During PULSE EX the Navy deployed six carriers simultaneously around the world to demonstrate the projection of power available under the new doctrine. It was during this deployment that an S-3B Viking from CVW-14 crashed on the remote and rugged island of Kita Iwo Jima. HS-14 deployed two Seahawks within three hours to Iwo Jima to conduct search and recovery operations. Working closely with United States Air Force Pararescuemen from 33rd Rescue Squadron, the cruiser and the frigate , HS-14 was able to locate the wreckage, salvage parts of the aircraft and return the remains of the Viking crew. This accomplishment was noted in a personal letter from President George W. Bush to the wife of one of the fallen aviators. In the fall of 2004, an HS-14 detachment deployed two HH-60H helicopters on board in support of Operation Enduring Freedom Philippines. The overall effort proved to be a success and established the HS community as a leading participant in the Global War on Terrorism. In the first week of December 2004, typhoons Imbudo and Namando struck the Philippines, causing extensive damage. Helicopters of HS-14 provided humanitarian assistance. The squadron was able to provide immediate relief to the most stricken victims of the typhoons and rescue over 100 refugees. At the same time, another HS-14 detachment was deployed on board the guided-missile cruiser to support several 7th Fleet ASW exercises, operating in conjunction with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). Additionally, the squadron operated a third detachment out of Atsugi, Japan. After being deployed or detached eleven out of twelve months in 2004, the HS-14 operated from Kitty Hawk in January 2005, operating off the southeast coast of Japan. In February 2005, the squadron deployed for routine training operations in the Okinawa Fleet Operations Areas. Simultaneously, HS-14 deployed a one-plane detachment and 18 personnel to the destroyer to operate with Destroyer Squadron 15 in bilateral ASW operations with the South Korean Navy. After some rest and relaxation in Hong Kong, Kitty Hawk headed north toward Korea for Operation Foal Eagle. HS-14 spent most of the year deployed and participating in exercises such as Talisman Saber, Orange Crush, JASEX, SHAREM, MULTI-SAIL, and ANNUALEX. 2006 Squadron insignia, 1994–2013 June 2006 marked the start of another eventful summer deployment aboard Kitty Hawk for HS-14. Before deploying, HS-14 earned the \\"Golden Wrench Award\\" for having the most outstanding maintenance department in the airwing. This marked the third time the Chargers had taken home the award, more than any other squadron in CVW-5. With maintenance operating at full potential and the flight crews ready to fight, the Chargers were ready to start the cruise. The deployment began with a short port call to Otaru, Japan, a suburb of Sapporo on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. After Otaru, Kitty Hawks Carrier Strike Group Five joined up with Carrier Strike Group Nine, led by , and the Carrier Strike Group, along with Marine Corps, Air Force, and various foreign militaries for the largest operation in over a decade, Valiant Shield. This exercise involved more than 30 ships, 280 aircraft, and 22,000 sailors, marines, and airmen, and focused on the strike groups' ability to maintain a very robust air strike schedule while being attacked by multiple submarine and surface threats. HS-14 performed incredibly, scoring many simulated torpedo attacks on the American, Australian, and Singaporean attacking subs, while allowing almost no attacks against the carrier Kitty Hawk. While defending the carrier from simulated submarine attacks, HS-14 also had a dedicated Combat Search and Rescue detachment working out of Guam. This detachment focused on joint operations with HS-2 while conducting NSW insertions and extractions. The detachment also gave the crews a chance to learn different techniques when operating in low light, tactical environments. HS-14 worked with several other units from different services and countries during the remainder of the year. Further exercises included \\"Allies in the Outback\\", ANNUALEX, and an Atsugi CSAR Detachment. 2007 A HS-14 HH-60H in 2005 In 2007, HS-14 sent a four helicopter detachment to Kadena Air Base on the island of Okinawa, Japan to practice weapons employment and terrain flying. The crews were able to take advantage of the area's weapons ranges and fired two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and three Mk 46 practice torpedoes. Additionally, HS-14 practiced joint operations with multiple commands and services. HS-14 practiced anti-submarine warfare tracking and attacking techniques with the P-3C Orion aircraft from Patrol Squadron 4. HS-14 was also able to practice fast roping, rappelling, and High Altitude Low Opening and static-line paradrops with the 1st of the 1st Airborne Rangers, U.S. Army. The 320th Tactics Squadron also worked with HS-14 practicing similar techniques. Kitty Hawk, began another deployment in May, making stops in Guam, Sydney, Brisbane, Guam again, and Kuala Lumpur. HS-14 participated in multiple exercises during the deployment, including Talisman Saber, Valiant Shield, and Malabar 2007. During a port call in Muroran, Northern Japan, in October, HS-14 detached two HH-60Hs and four aircrews to Misawa Air Base for FLIR/Hellfire training. The detachment rejoined Kitty Hawk prior to ANNUALEX 19G, the naval portion of a larger U.S./Japanese exercise. Following the exercise, Carrier Strike Group Five made international headlines when it was denied entrance to the port of Hong Kong for the Thanksgiving holiday. HS-14 returned to Atsugi in early December. 2008 HS-14 began 2008 with another weapons detachment to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, beginning in early February. The detachment used four helicopters to fire Hellfire missiles, drop torpedoes, and conduct ASW, CSAR, NSW, and close air support (CAS) training with Marines, Air Force, and Army personnel. Detachment \\"B\\" joined the guided missile destroyer in January 2008 and conducted independent operations until March. HS-14's main body embarked aboard Kitty Hawk for sea trials in March, followed by workups in April, including a port call at Hong Kong. Detachment A embarked aboard the guided missile cruisers and from February through May. Carrier Strike Group Five left Yokosuka in May, marking Kitty Hawks final departure from Japan. Detachment A rejoined the main squadron aboard Kitty Hawk for this cruise, while Detachment B returned to NAF Atsugi. The strike group visited Guam in June, then proceeded to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. At the end of the port call, HS-14 Detachment A \\"Misfits\\" debarked Kitty Hawk and embarked aboard the guided missile frigate as its air department for exercise RIMPAC 2008. HS-14 Det. A conducted intensive ASW operations in a separate surface action group, providing support as a \\"pouncing\\" aircraft, as well multiple logistics flights in support of the ship. HS-14's main body aboard Kitty Hawk provided similar support to Carrier Strike Group Five. Following RIMPAC, Kitty Hawk proceeded to San Diego as the carrier was replaced by . Before arriving in San Diego, HS-14 provided VERTREP for Kitty Hawks ammunition offload. The squadron moved over 900 loads in two days. CVW-5 flew off Kitty Hawk for the final time off the coast of California on 6 August. HS-14 provided photographic platforms for the flyoff, then flew off to Naval Air Station North Island on 7 August. When HS-14 landed at North Island that morning, it marked 14 years since the squadron was forward deployed to Japan. After Kitty Hawk tied up at NAS North Island, CVW-5 immediately began crossdeck operations required to establish itself aboard George Washington. For two weeks in August, HS-14 was divided between Kitty Hawk, George Washington, and HS-4's squadron spaces ashore. George Washington pulled out of San Diego with CVW-5 embarked on 21 August. HS-14 flew aboard that afternoon, and following a Blue Water Certification and workups over the next couple weeks, the aircraft carrier began its trek west. The following month consisted of heavy flight operations for HS-14, to get CVW-5 and the George Washington Air Department working together as a cohesive team. George Washington arrived at Yokosuka on 25 September. 2008 Fall Cruise began on 30 September. HS-14 left a CSAR detachment back aboard NAF Atsugi for the month of October. Along with Detachment B, the composite detachment managed to qualify several pilots and aircrew in CSAR Syllabus. HS-14's main body continued to provide ASW and SAR service to George Washington as the Strike Group visited Pusan, South Korea, and Guam. Following the Guam port visit, Detachment A left the ship to embark the guided-missile cruiser , while Detachment B departed Japan aboard . Both ships joined the George Washington Strike Group for ANNUALEX 20G, an exercise involving US and Japanese surface, subsurface, and air units. During the exercise, HS-14 provided round the clock ASW coverage, with George Washington-based helicopters covering days and detachment helicopters covering nights. The squadron scored numerous submarine kills, helping to validate the detachment concept. HS-14 and CVW-5 returned to Atsugi on 21 November, marking nearly nine months of underway time for the air wing in 2008.  2009  During the 2009 Summer Deployment HS-14 participated in TALISMAN SABRE 2009. While the main body of HS-14 supported the air wing on the West coast of Australia, Detachment Bravo, on the destroyer conducted continuous ASW missions in support of multinational operations. In conjunction with two permanent Detachments, the Chargers sent a temporary detachment to Darwin, Australia to work with Australia Special Forces. As the Summer Deployment wound down, HS-14 celebrated both their 25th birthday on 10 July marking 25 years of service and 50,000 hours Class \\"A\\" mishap free. During the Fall Deployment (October – November 2009), HS-14 flew over 500 additional Class \\"A\\" mishap free hours. While Chargers on board George Washington worked ASW for Talisman Sabre, Detachment Bravo conducted actual ASW operations tracking a Russian . For the squadron's unequaled performance in its primary mission areas of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Anti-Surface Warfare (ASU) they were awarded with the 2009 Captain Arnold Jay Isbell Trophy for Anti- Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare Excellence.  2010  From 19 February to 5 March, HS-14 sent a detachment to Kadena AFB, Okinawa, Japan. During this detachment the squadron flew over 250 hours enhancing their readiness for the 2010 Deployment.  2011  HS-14 and HSL-51 conducted humanitarian flights over Japan since 11 March 2011 as part of Operation Tomodachi from Naval Air Facility Misawa.http://www.dvidshub.net/news/67650/hs-14-and-hsl-51-join- forces-support-operation-tomodachi  2013  A MH-60S of HSC-14 off San Diego in February 2015 In March 2013, HS-14 left Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) at NAF Atsugi, Japan, and conducted a permanent duty station change to NAS North Island. HS-14 transitioned to the MH-60S Seahawk helicopter and was redesignated Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron FOURTEEN (HSC-14) in July. HSC-14 is currently assigned to Carrier Air Wing Nine (CVW-9) which deploys aboard .  HS-14 achievements  HS-14 celebrated over thirteen years and 50,000 mishap-free flight hours in August 2009. The squadron's impressive history is highlighted by many awards including *Navy Unit Commendation Medal - 1991 (OPERATION DESERT STORM), 1998 (USS Independence (CV-62)) *Meritorious Unit Commendation Medal - 1989, 1994, and 1996 while attached to CVW-2, USS Ranger (CV 61), and the USS Independence (CV 62) Battle Group *Seven Battle Efficiency Awards - 1989, 1992, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, and 2010 *Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal - 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1998, 1999, and 2003 *Joint Meritorious Unit Award - 1993 *Humanitarian Service Medal - 2001 (USS Gary (FFG-51)) *Southwest Asia Service Medal -1991 *Nine Chief of Naval Operations Safety Awards - 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2006, and 2010 *Two consecutive DESRON SEVEN \\"Golden Arrow\\" Awards *Nine Arnold J.

A player might decide to shoot toward the end of a game, when he judges that he needs to win, not just average-plus results. Shooting is generally considered an ethical maneuver when it is used sparingly in an attempt to improve one's score. It is regarded as contrary to the if a player, perhaps angry with his partner, starts bidding and playing every hand in ways that disregard winning technique. In contrast, a player who is shooting makes a bid or play that is only slightly inferior, in the hope that the cards lie in such a way that the normal, percentage action will lose. In the long run, even slightly inferior actions lose to the better bid or play, so it is not sensible to shoot unless the only hope left is an unusual situation, such as a 4–1 instead of a 3–2 trump break, or a normal 3NT contract that goes down on normal play. Although it is possible to shoot in either the bidding or the play, authorities disagree on whether it is wise to do so in the bidding. For example, Marshall Miles has written that \\"There is no way to estimate the effects of weird bidding on a particular hand, and it is almost impossible to start shooting in the bidding without having partnership confidence suffer.\\"Miles, Marshall. How to Win at Duplicate Bridge. Exposition Press, 1957. Chapter 9. On the other hand, if shooting, Hugh Kelsey recommendsKelsey, H. W. Match-Point Bridge. Faber and Faber, 1970. . Chapter 16. a pass with over RHO's opening bid of 1. Kelsey notes that everyone else will double, because in the long run it is the best call. But if LHO has a good redouble, or if the takeout double leads to an unmakeable game, or if declarer misguesses because you pass, then you might get a very good result (more often, you'll get a bottom). Notice that Kelsey's suggestion conforms to the basic notion of taking an action that is slightly against the odds. To pass with a much stronger hand would be far too extreme an action. Examples Miles gives these hands as examples of shooting in the play: West leads the 4 against a typical 3NT contract. South wins East's K and plays the K, East and West following with the 6 and 10. The correct play now at rubber bridge or IMPs is to duck a round of clubs. By ducking, declarer maintains an entry to dummy if he gets a 3–1 split. Doing so guarantees the contract. At pairs, if South is shooting, he might lead the 9 to the A, hoping for a 2–2 split (only somewhat against the odds). If he gets that split, South wins at least 11 tricks. This will be a likely top, because declarers who are not so desperate, and who duck a club in deference to the odds, will win a trick fewer. Of course if South doesn't get a 2–2 split, he'll probably go down one or two, for a bottom. This 4 contract is complex. At rubber bridge or IMPs, South should play to ruff two hearts in dummy, to guard against either opponent's holding of queen-fourth of spades. That play would hold South to ten tricks (losing two spades and a heart when either opponent holds Q 8 x x) but gives South the best chance of ten tricks against either a 3–2 or 4–1 trump split. But at pairs, South should not give up on overtricks to guard against the 8.4% possibility of Q 8 x x. After winning the opening lead of the K, strong declarers will finesse the 10 at trick two. If the finesse loses, the K will stop the hearts. If South gets the more likely 3–2 spade split, he'll win 12 or 13 tricks, depending on the success of the finesse at trick 2. (Miles does not discuss the 9.6% possibility of a 4–0 club split.) If South wants to shoot, Miles notes that declarer could adopt the rubber bridge approach of ruffing two hearts, in effect playing for the spades to split badly. But a better shot is to lead to the K and then finesse the J. This play will get South a top when East holds one, two or three spades to the Q, but if it is West who holds Q x or Q x x, South will get a bottom.

This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the prefrontal cortex. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of consciousness and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR). Thomas Metzinger advanced the theory in his 1993 book Subjekt und Selbstmodell (Subject and self-model).Metzinger, T. (1993). Subjekt und Selbstmodell. Paderborn: Schoningh. Overview of the PSM The PSM is an entity that \\"actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future—for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain\\". Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, \\"a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,\\" or the idea of ownership.Being No One The second is perspectivalness, which is \\"a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole\\".Being No one More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is \\"the phenomenal target property\\" or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first-person perspective as the \\"existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject\\". The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to self and to perceived objects. People are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe they are perceiving reality directly when in actuality they are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are \\"transparent\\" so that people can introspect on their representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves. These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the phenomenal model of intentionality relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a \\"conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation\\". The model is a result of the combination of a unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, a unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and unique positions in space that give a person's perception perspectivalness. Role of the prefrontal cortex The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the parietal lobes, unity and the temporal lobes. Relation to psychopathology Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and depersonalization. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to theory of mind deficits and weak central coherence theory. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benefic sense extreme in narcissism.

Porter continued to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney General until July 1919, when he became chief counsel for the Federal Trade Commission, serving in that position until October 1, 1920. Statewide elections 1920–1926 In November 1920, Porter again ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. Once again, he was the Democratic nominee against Cummins, who had served as a senator since defeating Porter in 1908. Porter's chances for a victory in a statewide election were the greatest in 1926, when he again ran for the U.S. Senate, this time against insurgent Republican Smith W. Brookhart. Brookhart was fiercely opposed by many within his own party because of his anti- business, pro-labor views, and Brookhart's opposition to Republican President Calvin Coolidge, and had officially lost the 1924 race for Iowa's other Senate seat to Democrat Daniel Steck. However, Porter again lost in the general election. Porter never again ran for statewide office. Porter also served as a delegate from Iowa to Democratic National Conventions in 1908, 1912, and 1924.

It extends more than from northeastern Manitoba through northwestern Ontario, southern Nunavut to northern Quebec. Igneous rocks of the Circum-Superior Belt are mafic-ultramafic in composition, deposited in the Labrador Trough near Ungava Bay, the Cape Smith Belt near the southern shore of Hudson Strait and along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in its northern portion; the Thompson and Fox River belts in the northwest and the Marquette Range Supergroup in its southern portion. The Circum Superior Belt also hosts a rare example of Proterozoic Komatiite, in the Winnipegosis komatiite belt. A number of magmatic features are present in the Circum-Superior Belt, including dikes, sills and volcanics that comprise geologic formations. This geologic belt is considered to be a large igneous province because its magmatic rocks were emplaced over an extremely short geological time span. Even though the Circum- Superior Belt was emplaced during an extremely short geological time span, the associated magmas were probably derived from a number of separate sources. Most of the Circum-Superior Belt lies along the margin of the Superior Craton, which is the most extensive fragment of Archean crust on Earth. The Circum- Superior Belt contains two large copper-nickel mining districts; the nickel- bearing Thompson Belt at the northwestern portion of the Superior craton and the Cape Smith Belt at the northern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt. GeologyFormation= The Circum-Superior Belt was formed 1,884 to 1,870 million years ago when the Superior craton was surrounded by mountain building processes, including the Trans-Hudson, New Quebec and Penokean orogenies. The major Trans-Hudson orogeny had its appearance when the Superior craton collided with the Rae-Hearne and Sask cratons 1,900 to 1,800 million years ago. Massive orogenic belts with a change in horizontal direction are represented by the double promontory structure of the Superior craton that seem to have come from the beginning of a rifting event. The New Quebec orogen, also known as the Labrador Trough, lies at the northeastern portion of the Superior craton and is related to ocean closure and collision with the southeastern portion of the Rae craton. At 1,900 and 1,800 million years ago, an ocean closure and collision with the Wisconian arc terrane resulted in the creation of the Penokean orogeny at the southern Superior craton margin. The last collision occurred on the southeastern portion of the Superior craton to produce the Grenville orogeny 1,100 million years ago. Because most of the Circum-Superior Belt was formed by widespread mafic-ultramafic magmatism 1,884 to 1,870 million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, a number of different suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province. It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins. Suggestions include back-arc rifting, foredeep flexure, mantle plumes and the breakup of a microcontinent. The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; either it contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone. With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880 million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains. This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated. The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age magmatism throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown. This includes the 1,860 million year old magmatism of the East Kimberly event in Australia and 1,860 million year old magmatism of the Mashonaland event in Africa. The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900 million year old global superplume event. =Geologic features= The long Labrador Trough, extending from Ungava Bay through Quebec and Labrador, includes two volcano- sedimentary series, the first ranging from 2,170 to 2,140 million years old and second ranging from 1,883 to 1,870 million years old. This magmatism is considered to have formed as a result of back-arc volcanism. The youngest magmatic series (1883-1870 Ma) contains 1,880 million-year-old carbonatites and lamprophyres. 1,883 to 1,874 million-year-old mafic and a few ultramafic magmas comprise the Willbob and Hellancourt formations and Montagnais sills. The youngest magmatism of the youngest magmatic series is 1,870 million-year- old felsic and carbonatitic volcanics. These igneous rocks of the Labrador Trough cover an area of . To the northwest at the northern tip of Quebec near Hudson Strait, the Cape Smith Belt includes the 2,040 to 1,970 million-year- old Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group and the 1,880 million-year-old Chukotat Group. The thick Chukotat Group is made of picritic and tholeiitic basalts. These basaltic lavas are intruded by narrow mafic and ultramafic sills. At least three different types of lava compositions exist in the Chukotat Group, including olivine phyric, pyroxene-phyric and plagioclase phyric. The upper unit of the Chukotat Group is 1,870 million years old whereas the lower unit is associated with the Katiniq Suite sills, which cut through the underlying Povungnituk Group. In 1989, the Katiniq Suite sills were thought to be 1,918 million years old, but more recent dating and a reinterpretation of the original age in 2004 suggests that the Katiniq Suite sills are closer to 1,880 million years old. Therefore, the age range for the Chutotat Group is 1,880 to 1,870 million years. Volcanism of the Chukotat Group might have originated from rifting of a microcontinent that now forms the southwestern portion of Baffin Island. Map showing the age of geologic features related to the Circum-Superior Belt. Geologic features include: 1 = Carbonatite feeder, 2 = Montagnais gabbro sills, 3 = rhyodacite, 4 = Chukotat volcanics, 5 = Belcher and Sleeper Island sills, 6 = Fox River sill, 7 = Molsen dikes, 8 = Thompson belt mafic-untramafic magmatism, 9 = Winnipegosis komatiite, 10 = Hemlock formation, 11 = Gunflint formation, 12 = Pickle Crow dike. On the Belcher Islands of southern Nunavut, two volcanic groups are known as the Flaherty and Eskimo volcanics. The underlying Eskimo volcanics are related with the Richmond Gulf, Persillon, Pachi and Nastapoka Group volcanics. The 1,998 million-year-old Minto dikes are also interpreted to be related with the Eskimo volcanics. The overlying Flaherty volcanics remain undated apart from a lead-lead dating of . However, the Flaherty volcanics are suggested to have relationships with the Sutton Inlier and Haig sills. Geochemical indications suggest that the overlying Flaherty volcanics might also have relationships with the Povungnituk volcano-sedimentary group in the Cape Smith Belt, indicating the Flaherty volcanics might be 2,040 to 1,960 million years old. Sills on the Belcher and Snowy islands in Hudson Bay are dated to 1,870 million years old, indicating the 1,880 million-year-old magmatism also exists in this section of the Circum–Superior large igneous province. The Fox River Belt in northern Manitoba is composed of sediments, volcanics and sills. Fox River Belt sills and Molsen dikes are 1,883 million years old, but the Molsen dikes at the northwestern Superior craton margin intrude an older, 2,090 to 2,070 million-year-old dike swarm. The Ospwagan Group is younger than and the 1,864 million-year-old Winnipegosis komatiite belt lies to the southwest. Numerous tectonic settings have been suggested for triggering magmatism in the Fox River Belt, including a marginal basin rifting event. At the southern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt, a group of fragmental sediments composed of iron formation was formed during a period of magmatic activity in the Marquette Range Supergroup. Included in the Marquette Range Supergroup is the Hemlock Formation, a bimodal volcanic group that is estimated to have an age of . Another volcanic series in the Marquette Range Supergroup, known as the Gunflint Formation, has an age of . Further geologic units that are related to the Gunflint Formation include the Badwater volcanics and the Kiernan sills. A number of origins have suggested for the Marquette Range Supergroup magmatism. This includes subsidence being driven ahead related to thrusting of the Penokean orogeny or a possible back-arc basin, and lateral flow through the Pickle Crow dikes transported magma from the Fox River Belt area through the Superior craton for placement in the Marquette Range Supergroup. This suggested long-range origin has been suggested for magmatism of the 2,215 million-year-old Nipissing sills as well, which the Ungava dike swarm could have transported magma to the Nipissing sills area. Before 2003, all magmatism of the Circum-Superior Belt was thought to only occur along the outer margin of the Superior craton. However, the Pickle Crow dike was discovered in 2003 in the interior of the Superior craton and it has since been recognized as a magmatic event related to the Circum- Superior Belt. The dike is dated to 1,880 million years old and associated dikes are traced for at least . These dikes likely extend over across the western portion of the Superior craton from near the Fox River Belt in the north to near Lake Superior in the south. This magmatic crossing creates a relationship with the 1,880 million-year-old magmatism in the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt and magmatism in the Marguette Range Supergroup on the southern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt. In addition, the north-northwest trend of the Pickle Crow dikes and the absolute north- northeastern trend of the Molson dike swarm combine to an area north of the northwestern portion of the Circum-Superior Belt. This might determine the zone of a mantle plume that was the source for the 1,880 million-year-old magmatism in the Circum-Superior Belt. =Mineralization= The Circum- Superior Belt is the host for widespread mineral deposits, including copper, nickel and platinum group elements. However, the origins of this widespread mineralization is unknown. The Thompson Belt in Manitoba is one of the most comprehensive nickel producing zones on Earth. It has the potential to contain platinum group elements, but the age of the mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks comprising the nickel deposits are not well known. Since its foundation during the 1950s, numerous mining operations throughout the Thompson Belt have produced over four billion pounds of nickel. At least two nickel deposits are in progress by Vale Inco at the Thompson and Birchtree mines. At least 70 million pounds of nickel has been mined since 2005. At the city of Thompson, nickel of the Thompson Belt is smelted and refined in facilities. This smelting and refining process contributes to about one-third of the total nickel output in Canada. In the Cape Smith Belt of northern Quebec, the Raglan Mine lies in copper-nickel deposits of the ultramafic Katiniq Suite sills. The Katiniq Suite sills are also within an area that is presently explored for nickel, copper and platinum group element deposits. Copper, nickel and platinum group elements are associated with mafic-ultramafic rocks in the Labrador Trough that were formed during a period of magmatism 1,883 to 1,870 million years ago.

Genus theory was first published in the book On Numbers and Games, and later in Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays Volume 2. Unlike the Sprague–Grundy theory for normal play impartial games, genus theory is not a complete theory for misère play impartial games. Genus of a game The genus of a game is defined using the mex (minimum excludant) of the options of a game. g+ is the grundy value or nimber of a game under the normal play convention. g- or λ0 is the outcome class of a game under the misère play convention. More specifically, to find g+, *0 is defined to have g+ = 0, and all other games have g+ equal to the mex of its options. To find g−, *0 has g− = 1, and all other games have g− equal to the mex of the g− of its options. λ1, λ2..., is equal to the g− value of a game added to a number of *2 nim games, where the number is equal to the subscript. Thus the genus of a game is gλ0λ1λ2.... *0 has genus value 0120. Note that the superscript continues indefinitely, but in practice, a superscript is written with a finite number of digits, because it can be proven that eventually, the last 2 digits alternate indefinitely... Outcomes of sums of games It can be used to predict the outcome of: * The sum of any nimbers and any tame games * The sum of any one game given its genus, any number of nim games *1, *2 or *3, and optionally one other nim game with nimber 4 or higher * The sum of a restive game and any number of nim games of any size In addition, some restive or restless pairs can form tame games, if they are equivalent. Two games are equivalent if they have the same options, where the same options are defined as options to equivalent games. Adding an option from which there is a reversible move does not affect equivalency. Some restive pairs, when added to another restive game of the same species, are still tame. A half tame game, added to itself, is equivalent to *0. Reversible moves It is important for further understanding of Genus theory, to know how reversible moves work. Suppose there are two games A and B, where A and B have the same options (moves available), then they are of course, equivalent. If B has an extra option, say to a game X, then A and B are still equivalent if there is a move from X to A. That is, B is the same as A in every way, except for an extra move (X), which can be reversed. Types of games Different games (positions) can be classified into several types: * Nim * Tame * Restive * Restless * Half tame * Wild =Nim= This does not mean that a position is exactly like a nim heap under the misère play convention, but classifying a game as nim means that it is equivalent to a nim heap. A game is a nim game, if: * it has a genus 01, 10, 22, 33... * it has moves only to single nim heaps, i.e. move to a position *1, or *2, but not e.g. *x+*y (but see next point) * it may also have moves to games which are not nim, provided they are not required to determine the genus, and those games each have at least one option to a nim game of the same genus =Tame= These are positions which we can pretend are nim positions (note difference between nim positions, which can be many nim heaps added together, and a single nim heap, which can only be 1 nim heap). A game G is tame if: * it has a genus 01, 10, or 00, 11, 22, 33... * all options of G are tame * G may also have wild options (positions which are not tame or nim) if they do not affect the genus, and each option have reversible moves to tame games with genus g? and ?λ. Note the moves to g? and ?λ may actually be the same option. ? means any number.

There are two insurable types of weather insurance: conditional weather insurance and weather cancellation insurance.  Weather cancellation insurance  Weather cancellation insurance reduces an organization’s risk in planning an outdoor event. When a company or organization is holding a concert, running a special event, having a sale, or executing any form of outdoor activity and the weather prevents that activity from taking place, the organization risks losing whatever money that has been invested in the planning, organization, marketing and operation of the event. Weather cancellation insurance ensures that if inclement weather does occur, the organization will not lose their investment. Instead, an insurance company will cover those costs based on the size and type of the weather cancellation insurance purchased.  Conditional weather insurance  Conditional weather insurance gives companies the ability to make promotional sales offers based on the weather; this form of insurance used by businesses and organizations to increase publicity and drive traffic and sales. With conditional weather insurance an organization can run a promotion advertising up to a 100% rebate on all items purchased during a designated promotional period if a particular type and/or volume of weather occurs on a specific day. For example, a retailer could give a year's worth of payments to the first 100 people who bought a car in November if it snows 6” on New Year’s Day. This form of insurance is typically used by retailers to drive sales prior to national holidays such as New Year’s or 4th of July.  How weather insurance is rated  Insurance companies rate weather insurance based on the weather peril date, the location of the event (city and state) and history of the weather peril that is being underwritten (temperature, rain, snow, etc.) as well as the size of the policy that is being insured. For example, a state fair may wish to purchase weather cancellation insurance to cover the costs associated with running an outdoor concert in the event it rains heavily during their outdoor concert hours. The fair would contact their insurance agency no less than two weeks prior to the event date. The insurer would look up the weather history for their particular location. If the client's venue has a history of heavy rains during those dates over the past x years, the premium would be higher than if it were held in an area where rain rarely occurs. The total amount the client wishes to insure is also taken into consideration. If a car dealership wanted to insure a conditional weather promotion in which new car buyers would receive a rebate if at least 2 inches of rain fell at their location on the day after Easter, the client would need to contact the insurance company about two weeks prior to the peril date. The insurer, in turn, would price the insurance policy based on weather history for that city and state on the date that is being \\"insured\\", the type of peril being covered, and the volume of sales expected during the promotion.

Whole genome sequencing is ostensibly the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time. This entails sequencing all of an organism's chromosomal DNA as well as DNA contained in the mitochondria and, for plants, in the chloroplast. In practice, genome sequences that are nearly complete are also called whole genome sequences. Whole genome sequencing has largely been used as a research tool, but was being introduced to clinics in 2014. In the future of personalized medicine, whole genome sequence data may be an important tool to guide therapeutic intervention. The tool of gene sequencing at SNP level is also used to pinpoint functional variants from association studies and improve the knowledge available to researchers interested in evolutionary biology, and hence may lay the foundation for predicting disease susceptibility and drug response. Whole genome sequencing should not be confused with DNA profiling, which only determines the likelihood that genetic material came from a particular individual or group, and does not contain additional information on genetic relationships, origin or susceptibility to specific diseases.Kijk magazine, 01 January 2009 In addition, whole genome sequencing should not be confused with methods that sequence specific subsets of the genome - such methods include whole exome sequencing (1-2% of the genome) or SNP genotyping (<0.1% of the genome). As of 2017 there were no complete genomes for any mammals, including humans. Between 4% to 9% of the human genome, mostly satellite DNA, had not been sequenced. Terminology It is also known as WGS, full genome sequencing, complete genome sequencing, or entire genome sequencing. History The first bacterial whole genome to be sequenced was of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. The worm Caenorhabditis elegans was the first animal to have its whole genome sequenced. Drosophila melanogaster's whole genome was sequenced in 2000. Arabidopsis thaliana was the first plant genome sequenced. The genome of the lab mouse Mus musculus was published in 2002. It took 10 years and 50 scientists spanning the globe to sequence the genome of Elaeis guineensis (oil palm). This genome was particularly difficult to sequence because it had many repeated sequences which are difficult to organise. The DNA sequencing methods used in the 1970s and 1980s were manual, for example Maxam-Gilbert sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Several whole bacteriophage and animal viral genomes were sequenced by these techniques, but the shift to more rapid, automated sequencing methods in the 1990s facilitated the sequencing of the larger bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. The first organism to have its entire genome sequenced was Haemophilus influenzae in 1995. After it, the genomes of other bacteria and some archaea were first sequenced, largely due to their small genome size. H. influenzae has a genome of 1,830,140 base pairs of DNA. In contrast, eukaryotes, both unicellular and multicellular such as Amoeba dubia and humans (Homo sapiens) respectively, have much larger genomes (see C-value paradox). Amoeba dubia has a genome of 700 billion nucleotide pairs spread across thousands of chromosomes. Humans contain fewer nucleotide pairs (about 3.2 billion in each germ cell - note the exact size of the human genome is still being revised) than A. dubia however their genome size far outweighs the genome size of individual bacteria. The first bacterial and archaeal genomes, including that of H. influenzae, were sequenced by Shotgun sequencing. In 1996 the first eukaryotic genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was sequenced. S. cerevisiae, a model organism in biology has a genome of only around 12 million nucleotide pairs, and was the first unicellular eukaryote to have its whole genome sequenced. The first multicellular eukaryote, and animal, to have its whole genome sequenced was the nematode worm: Caenorhabditis elegans in 1998. Eukaryotic genomes are sequenced by several methods including Shotgun sequencing of short DNA fragments and sequencing of larger DNA clones from DNA libraries such as bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). In 1999, the entire DNA sequence of human chromosome 22, the shortest human autosome, was published. By the year 2000, the second animal and second invertebrate (yet first insect) genome was sequenced - that of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster - a popular choice of model organism in experimental research. The first plant genome - that of the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana - was also fully sequenced by 2000. By 2001, a draft of the entire human genome sequence was published. The genome of the laboratory mouse Mus musculus was completed in 2002. In 2004, the Human Genome Project published an incomplete version of the human genome. In 2008, a group from Leiden, The Netherlands, reported the sequencing of the first female human genome (Marjolein Kriek). Currently thousands of genomes have been wholly or partially sequenced. Experimental detailsCells used for sequencing= Almost any biological sample containing a full copy of the DNA—even a very small amount of DNA or ancient DNA—can provide the genetic material necessary for full genome sequencing. Such samples may include saliva, epithelial cells, bone marrow, hair (as long as the hair contains a hair follicle), seeds, plant leaves, or anything else that has DNA-containing cells. The genome sequence of a single cell selected from a mixed population of cells can be determined using techniques of single cell genome sequencing. This has important advantages in environmental microbiology in cases where a single cell of a particular microorganism species can be isolated from a mixed population by microscopy on the basis of its morphological or other distinguishing characteristics. In such cases the normally necessary steps of isolation and growth of the organism in culture may be omitted, thus allowing the sequencing of a much greater spectrum of organism genomes. Single cell genome sequencing is being tested as a method of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, wherein a cell from the embryo created by in vitro fertilization is taken and analyzed before embryo transfer into the uterus. After implantation, cell-free fetal DNA can be taken by simple venipuncture from the mother and used for whole genome sequencing of the fetus. =Early techniques= An ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer. Such capillary sequencers automated the early efforts of sequencing genomes. Sequencing of nearly an entire human genome was first accomplished in 2000 partly through the use of shotgun sequencing technology. While full genome shotgun sequencing for small (4000–7000 base pair) genomes was already in use in 1979, broader application benefited from pairwise end sequencing, known colloquially as double-barrel shotgun sequencing. As sequencing projects began to take on longer and more complicated genomes, multiple groups began to realize that useful information could be obtained by sequencing both ends of a fragment of DNA. Although sequencing both ends of the same fragment and keeping track of the paired data was more cumbersome than sequencing a single end of two distinct fragments, the knowledge that the two sequences were oriented in opposite directions and were about the length of a fragment apart from each other was valuable in reconstructing the sequence of the original target fragment. The first published description of the use of paired ends was in 1990 as part of the sequencing of the human HPRT locus, although the use of paired ends was limited to closing gaps after the application of a traditional shotgun sequencing approach. The first theoretical description of a pure pairwise end sequencing strategy, assuming fragments of constant length, was in 1991. In 1995 the innovation of using fragments of varying sizes was introduced, and demonstrated that a pure pairwise end-sequencing strategy would be possible on large targets. The strategy was subsequently adopted by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) to sequence the entire genome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae in 1995, and then by Celera Genomics to sequence the entire fruit fly genome in 2000, and subsequently the entire human genome. Applied Biosystems, now called Life Technologies, manufactured the automated capillary sequencers utilized by both Celera Genomics and The Human Genome Project. =Current techniques= While capillary sequencing was the first approach to successfully sequence a nearly full human genome, it is still too expensive and takes too long for commercial purposes. Since 2005 capillary sequencing has been progressively displaced by high-throughput (formerly \\"next-generation\\") sequencing technologies such as Illumina dye sequencing, pyrosequencing, and SMRT sequencing. All of these technologies continue to employ the basic shotgun strategy, namely, parallelization and template generation via genome fragmentation. Other technologies are emerging, including nanopore technology. Though nanopore sequencing technology is still being refined, its portability and potential capability of generating long reads are of relevance to whole-genome sequencing applications. =Analysis= In principle, full genome sequencing can provide the raw nucleotide sequence of an individual organism's DNA. However, further analysis must be performed to provide the biological or medical meaning of this sequence, such as how this knowledge can be used to help prevent disease. Methods for analysing sequencing data are being developed and refined. Because sequencing generates a lot of data (for example, there are approximately six billion base pairs in each human diploid genome), its output is stored electronically and requires a large amount of computing power and storage capacity. While analysis of WGS data can be slow, it is possible to speed up this step by using dedicated hardware. Commercialization NHGRI. A number of public and private companies are competing to develop a full genome sequencing platform that is commercially robust for both research and clinical use, including Illumina, Knome, Sequenom, 454 Life Sciences, Pacific Biosciences, Complete Genomics, Helicos Biosciences, GE Global Research (General Electric), Affymetrix, IBM, Intelligent Bio-Systems, Life Technologies, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and the Beijing Genomics Institute. These companies are heavily financed and backed by venture capitalists, hedge funds, and investment banks. A commonly- referenced commercial target for sequencing cost until the late 2010s was $1,000, however, the private companies are working to reach a new target of only $100. =Incentive= In October 2006, the X Prize Foundation, working in collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation, established the Archon X Prize for Genomics, intending to award $10 million to \\"the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 1,000,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $1,000 per genome\\".\\"PRIZE Overview: Archon X PRIZE for Genomics\\". The Archon X Prize for Genomics was cancelled in 2013, before its official start date. =History= In 2007, Applied Biosystems started selling a new type of sequencer called SOLiD System. The technology allowed users to sequence 60 gigabases per run. In June 2009, Illumina announced that they were launching their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30× for $48,000 per genome. In August, the founder of Helicos Biosciences, Stephen Quake, stated that using the company's Single Molecule Sequencer he sequenced his own full genome for less than $50,000. In November, Complete Genomics published a peer-reviewed paper in Science demonstrating its ability to sequence a complete human genome for $1,700. In May 2011, Illumina lowered its Full Genome Sequencing service to $5,000 per human genome, or $4,000 if ordering 50 or more. Helicos Biosciences, Pacific Biosciences, Complete Genomics, Illumina, Sequenom, ION Torrent Systems, Halcyon Molecular, NABsys, IBM, and GE Global appear to all be going head to head in the race to commercialize full genome sequencing. With sequencing costs declining, a number of companies began claiming that their equipment would soon achieve the $1,000 genome: these companies included Life Technologies in January 2012, Oxford Nanopore Technologies in February 2012, and Illumina in February 2014. In 2015, the NHGRI estimated the cost of obtaining a whole-genome sequence at around $1,500. In 2016, Veritas Genetics began selling whole genome sequencing, including a report as to some of the information in the sequencing for $999. In summer 2019 Veritas Genetics cut the cost for WGS to $599. In 2017, BGI began offering WGS for $600. However, in 2015 some noted that effective use of whole gene sequencing can cost considerably more than $1000. Also, reportedly there remain parts of the human genome that have not been fully sequenced by 2017. Comparison with other technologiesDNA microarrays= Full genome sequencing provides information on a genome that is orders of magnitude larger than by DNA arrays, the previous leader in genotyping technology. For humans, DNA arrays currently provide genotypic information on up to one million genetic variants, while full genome sequencing will provide information on all six billion bases in the human genome, or 3,000 times more data. Because of this, full genome sequencing is considered a disruptive innovation to the DNA array markets as the accuracy of both range from 99.98% to 99.999% (in non-repetitive DNA regions) and their consumables cost of $5000 per 6 billion base pairs is competitive (for some applications) with DNA arrays ($500 per 1 million basepairs). ApplicationsMutation frequencies= Whole genome sequencing has established the mutation frequency for whole human genomes. The mutation frequency in the whole genome between generations for humans (parent to child) is about 70 new mutations per generation. An even lower level of variation was found comparing whole genome sequencing in blood cells for a pair of monozygotic (identical twins) 100-year-old centenarians. Only 8 somatic differences were found, though somatic variation occurring in less than 20% of blood cells would be undetected. In the specifically protein coding regions of the human genome, it is estimated that there are about 0.35 mutations that would change the protein sequence between parent/child generations (less than one mutated protein per generation). In cancer, mutation frequencies are much higher, due to genome instability. This frequency can further depend on patient age, exposure to DNA damaging agents (such as UV-irradiation or components of tobacco smoke) and the activity/inactivity of DNA repair mechanisms. Furthermore, mutation frequency can vary between cancer types: in germline cells, mutation rates occur at approximately 0.023 mutations per megabase, but this number is much higher in breast cancer (1.18-1.66 somatic mutations per Mb), in lung cancer (17.7) or in melanomas (≈33). Since the haploid human genome consists of approximately 3,200 megabases, this translates into about 74 mutations (mostly in noncoding regions) in germline DNA per generation, but 3,776-5,312 somatic mutations per haploid genome in breast cancer, 56,640 in lung cancer and 105,600 in melanomas. The distribution of somatic mutations across the human genome is very uneven, such that the gene-rich, early-replicating regions receive fewer mutations than gene-poor, late-replicating heterochromatin, likely due to differential DNA repair activity. In particular, the histone modification H3K9me3 is associated with high, and H3K36me3 with low mutation frequencies. =Genome-wide association studies= In research, whole-genome sequencing can be used in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) - a project aiming to determine the genetic variant or variants associated with a disease or some other phenotype. =Diagnostic use= In 2009, Illumina released its first whole genome sequencers that were approved for clinical as opposed to research-only use and doctors at academic medical centers began quietly using them to try to diagnose what was wrong with people whom standard approaches had failed to help. The price to sequence a genome at that time was US$19,500, which was billed to the patient but usually paid for out of a research grant; one person at that time had applied for reimbursement from their insurance company. For example, one child had needed around 100 surgeries by the time he was three years old, and his doctor turned to whole genome sequencing to determine the problem; it took a team of around 30 people that included 12 bioinformatics experts, three sequencing technicians, five physicians, two genetic counsellors and two ethicists to identify a rare mutation in the XIAP that was causing widespread problems. Due to recent cost reductions (see above) whole genome sequencing has become a realistic application in DNA diagnostics. In 2013, the 3Gb-TEST consortium obtained funding from the European Union to prepare the health care system for these innovations in DNA diagnostics. Quality assessment schemes, Health technology assessment and guidelines have to be in place. The 3Gb-TEST consortium has identified the analysis and interpretation of sequence data as the most complicated step in the diagnostic process. At the Consortium meeting in Athens in September 2014, the Consortium coined the word genotranslation for this crucial step. This step leads to a so-called genoreport. Guidelines are needed to determine the required content of these reports. Genomes2People (G2P), an initiative of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School was created in 2011 to examine the integration of genomic sequencing into clinical care of adults and children. G2P's director, Robert C. Green, had previously led the REVEAL study — Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer's Disease – a series of clinical trials exploring patient reactions to the knowledge of their genetic risk for Alzheimer's. In 2018, researchers at Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine in San Diego, CA determined that rapid whole-genome sequencing (rWGS) can diagnose genetic disorders in time to change acute medical or surgical management (clinical utility) and improve outcomes in acutely ill infants. The researchers reported a retrospective cohort study of acutely ill inpatient infants in a regional children's hospital from July 2016-March 2017. Forty-two families received rWGS for etiologic diagnosis of genetic disorders. The diagnostic sensitivity of rWGS was 43% (eighteen of 42 infants) and 10% (four of 42 infants) for standard genetic tests (P = .0005). The rate of clinical utility of rWGS (31%, thirteen of 42 infants) was significantly greater than for standard genetic tests (2%, one of 42; P = .0015). Eleven (26%) infants with diagnostic rWGS avoided morbidity, one had a 43% reduction in likelihood of mortality, and one started palliative care. In six of the eleven infants, the changes in management reduced inpatient cost by $800,000-$2,000,000. These findings replicate a prior study of the clinical utility of rWGS in acutely ill inpatient infants, and demonstrate improved outcomes and net healthcare savings. rWGS merits consideration as a first tier test in this setting. Ethical concerns The introduction of whole genome sequencing may have ethical implications. On one hand, genetic testing can potentially diagnose preventable diseases, both in the individual undergoing genetic testing and in their relatives. On the other hand, genetic testing has potential downsides such as genetic discrimination, loss of anonymity, and psychological impacts such as discovery of non-paternity. Some ethicists insist that the privacy of individuals undergoing genetic testing must be protected. Indeed, privacy issues can be of particular concern when minors undergo genetic testing. Illumina's CEO, Jay Flatley, claimed in February 2009 that \\"by 2019 it will have become routine to map infants' genes when they are born\\". This potential use of genome sequencing is highly controversial, as it runs counter to established ethical norms for predictive genetic testing of asymptomatic minors that have been well established in the fields of medical genetics and genetic counseling. The traditional guidelines for genetic testing have been developed over the course of several decades since it first became possible to test for genetic markers associated with disease, prior to the advent of cost- effective, comprehensive genetic screening. When an individual undergoes whole genome sequencing, they reveal information about not only their own DNA sequences, but also about probable DNA sequences of their close genetic relatives. This information can further reveal useful predictive information about relatives' present and future health risks. Hence, there are important questions about what obligations, if any, are owed to the family members of the individuals who are undergoing genetic testing. In Western/European society, tested individuals are usually encouraged to share important information on any genetic diagnoses with their close relatives, since the importance of the genetic diagnosis for offspring and other close relatives is usually one of the reasons for seeking a genetic testing in the first place. Nevertheless, a major ethical dilemma can develop when the patients refuse to share information on a diagnosis that is made for serious genetic disorder that is highly preventable and where there is a high risk to relatives carrying the same disease mutation. Under such circumstances, the clinician may suspect that the relatives would rather know of the diagnosis and hence the clinician can face a conflict of interest with respect to patient-doctor confidentiality. Privacy concerns can also arise when whole genome sequencing is used in scientific research studies. Researchers often need to put information on patient's genotypes and phenotypes into public scientific databases, such as locus specific databases. Although only anonymous patient data are submitted to locus specific databases, patients might still be identifiable by their relatives in the case of finding a rare disease or a rare missense mutation. Public discussion around the introduction of advanced forensic techniques (such as advanced familial searching using public DNA ancestry websites and DNA phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, and unfocused. As forensic genetics and medical genetics converge toward genome sequencing, issues surrounding genetic data become increasingly connected, and additional legal protections may need to be established. People with public genome sequences The first nearly complete human genomes sequenced were two Americans of predominantly Northwestern European ancestry in 2007 (J. Craig Venter at 7.5-fold coverage, and James Watson at 7.4-fold). This was followed in 2008 by sequencing of an anonymous Han Chinese man (at 36-fold), a Yoruban man from Nigeria (at 30-fold), a female clinical geneticist (Marjolein Kriek) from the Netherlands (at 7 to 8-fold), and a female caucasian Leukemia patient (at 33 and 14-fold coverage for tumor and normal tissues). Steve Jobs was among the first 20 people to have their whole genome sequenced, reportedly for the cost of $100,000. , there were 69 nearly complete human genomes publicly available. In November 2013, a Spanish family made their personal genomics data publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The work was led by Manuel Corpas and the data obtained by direct-to-consumer genetic testing with 23andMe and the Beijing Genomics Institute). This is believed to be the first such Public Genomics dataset for a whole family.

Diplomatic relations between the countries were active between the independence of Niger in 1960 and 1973. Relations were renormalised in 1996, but terminated by Niger in 2002. There are no special travel or trade restrictions between citizens of the nations. Previous relations Niger obtained independence from France in 1960, and at the time established relations with the government of Israel, although Niger never established a permanent mission there. During the early 1960s, several Israeli development programmes, mostly concerned with exchange of experts in agricultural development in arid regions, were established in Niger. The Israeli government also helped in the founding of the Young Pioneers of Niger, a national youth and civil group. In the mid 1960s, Niger opened an embassy in Israel.Joel Peters. Israel and Africa: The Problematic Friendship. I.B.Tauris, (1992) p.17, 34–38, passim Following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Nigerien popular and government feelings toward Israel cooled. The Israeli government for its part disapproved of Niger's closer relations with Libya, beginning in 1969. The continued Israeli conflict with its neighbors, increased pressure from allies like Libya, and the movement of a number of African nations in a similar direction, caused the Republic of Niger to formally end all diplomatic relations with the government of Israel on 1 January 1973. Arab, African, and non-aligned organisations had made a number of moves towards breaking relations with Israel following 1967, and these continued in the early 1970s. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its summit meeting in June 1972 went beyond its 1971 criticism of Israel in unanimously calling for a virtual UN arms embargo of Israel. That same year, Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Israel in March; Chad followed in November. Israel announced on December 25 the closing of its embassies in Niger and the Republic of the Congo \\"for budgetary and administrative reasons\\", leaving only non-resident accreditation in these two countries. The Congo reacted by severing relations completely, denouncing Israeli policies as \\"imperialist and expansionist\\".

The actual opening, coming from the Nigerien end in October 1996, was spurred by the 27 January 1996 military coup of Col.

It is a rural or agricultural area, with one village, Monkton. Monkton first developed around a water-powered grist mill and later became a station on the Northern Central Railway. The manor itself was established in 1713. Over 60 principal structures, plus numerous important outbuildings associated with them, are included in the district. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Thomas Brerewood Thomas Brerewood (c.1670 - 22 December 1746), was an 'English Gentleman and Entrepreneur. He was also a 'fraudster' on an epic scale. The son of Thomas Brerewood (senior) of Horton, Cheshire, England. Thomas came from a wealthy and very prominent Chester family; the son of an Anglican rector and the grandson of Sir Robert Brerewood, a justice of the Court of Common Pleas during the English Civil War (1642–51). He also had a well-known professor, a mayor of Chester, and a clerk of the House of Commons in his family tree. By 1705, when he was in his mid-thirties, Brerewood was already a man of considerable personal fortune, when he was involved in what was known as the Pitkin Affair in 1705 An Extract from American Bankruptcy Law Journal, Vol. 84, p. 483, 2010 \\"The Pitkin Affair: A Study of Fraud in Early English Bankruptcy\\" by Professor Emily Kadens, University of Texas at Austin, School of Law. www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?59+Duke+L.+J.+1229+pdf It was a financial scandal that rocked England. Unravelling the scam required three large insolvencies (including his bankers Coggs & Dann) and four acts of Parliament over the course of more than forty years. However, Brerewood's ability to negotiate successfully with his creditors, resulted in his Pardon, and he was fully discharged by 1709. He was thus permitted to rebuild his fortunes. This he seems to have done. The opportunity came about offering him a new career in the Colonies. In September 1716, his son Thomas Jr., then in his early twenties, married Charlotte Calvert, the fourteen-year-old daughter of the fourth Lord Baltimore Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore.

In July 1731, Charlotte inherited 10,000 acres in northern Maryland called My Lady's Manor. The following month, Charlotte and her husband deeded the land to Brerewood with the intent that he would use the property to pay off Thomas Jr.’s creditors, of whom Brerewood was likely the largest. In order to better organize the property, Brerewood, by then in his early sixties, went to Maryland, where he would spend the rest of his life. He is believed to have been an innovative and successful land manager,Robert Nelson Turner, St. James of My Lady's Manor 1750 - 1950, Monkton, Maryland, 1950 (describing Brerewood’s work as land manager). dividing the property into lots, obtaining tenants, (whom he insisted pay their debts), and founding a short-lived town called Charlotte Town on the site of the present Monkton, Maryland. Completing his resurrection as a man of importance, in 1741, Brerewood became clerk of Baltimore County, a well-remunerated position he held until his death on December 22, 1746.

Montague Island, known in Spanish as Isla Montague, is an island at the mouth of the Colorado River in the municipality of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, and is part of the Colorado River Delta and part of a broader region called the Salton Trough. It is about in length along its longest axis.The Delta of the Colorado River, David L. Alles (ed.), Western Washington University, August 6, 2006. The Colorado River Delta region experiences some of the highest tidal ranges in the world, up to , and at the highest tides, Montague Island is completely inundated. Although the islands in the delta have changed much over time, a map of the region shows Montague Island in 1873.Geology of the Salton Trough , David A. Alles (ed.), Western Washington University, Edited May 28, 2005. The island is uninhabited, as the climate is very hot, arid and the area occasionally floods. The nearest inhabited town is El Golfo de Santa Clara. Ecology The climate in the region of the Island is extremely hot and arid, with average annual rainfall of 2.4 in (60 mm). Montague Island, as part of the Colorado river delta, has had its ecology radically altered by diversion and use of water upstream in the river. The only water reaching the delta, with the exception of occasional floods, is agricultural wastewater. At least seven species of water birds are known to breed on Montague Island. The island is one of two known active breeding colonies of elegant tern in Mexico. During two years, a large number of nests were destroyed by tidal flooding, but there were only low levels of nests lost to predation. The birds nesting on Montague Island have reacted strongly to El Niño, with brown boobies being replaced by blue-footed boobies, and an increase in nesting of least, elegant, and royal terns, as well as black skimmers. Montague Island is one of the few locations where Mulinia coloradoensis, an endangered species of clam, is found. This species was once extremely abundant near the mouth of the Colorado river, but now only exists in a few isolated places. The decline of this clam is explained by the increase in salinity of the water due to diversion of and use of water from the Colorado river. Energy resources In 1981, Pemex discovered natural gas near the island, prompting a scramble for oil and gas leases in the nearby city of Yuma, Arizona.\\"Find prompts scramble\\", The Courier, Vol. 90, No. 152, Aug 4, 1981. The area has also been studied for the potential use of tidal power.

Gabbott also wrote many hymns published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in its Primary Children's Songbook, 16 of which are included in the current English edition. These include \\"Jesus Came to John the Baptist\\", \\"Did Jesus Really Live Again\\", \\"Samuel Tells of the Baby Jesus\\", and \\"He Sent His Son\\". She also wrote several works of poetry.  Biography  Gabbott was born in Malad, Idaho to Mary Lusk Jones and Bernard Jones. She was raised in Malad, a city settled primarily by Welsh Latter-day Saints, where the Welsh tradition of the eisteddfod was carried on. As a teenager she would often go to visit various wards in the stake to read works of poetry. Gabbott went to college and then returned to Malad to work as a teacher. When she was in her late twenties Gabbott served as a Mormon missionary in the Northwestern States Mission (primarily Washington and Oregon) where she met her future husband J. Donald \\"Don\\" Gabbott. Both he and her mission president, Preston Nibley, encouraged her to begin writing. Gabbott worked as a secretary to LeGrand Richards after her return from her mission in 1938. While in this position she had her first poem published, by the relief society magazine, at the urging of its editor Belle Spafford. In 1941 she married Don Gabbott and left the workforce to focus on motherhood. The Gabbotts eventually became the parents of five children. Throughout the 1940s Gabbott continued to write, occasionally doing editing work for The Children's Friend and having some of her hymns included in the 1950 LDS hymnal. In 1964 Gabbott took a job as manuscript editor for the Relief Society Magazine. In 1965 she joined the staff of The Improvement Era. This work prompted her literary work as well. In 1967 she wrote the poem Eve and I in reaction to what she felt was not enough emphasis on Eve in existing writings of the creation. It was also during the late 1960s that Gabbott began to write children's hymns, with 3 of her works included in the 1969 Primary hymnbook, Sing With Me. Gabbott was on the General Church Music Committee from 1973 to 1985 serving as chair of the Text Committee for the new hymnbook. She retired from working for the LDS Church magazines in 1975. Her husband died of Leukemia in 1976 and much of her work was produced after this date. It was in the 1980s that much of Gabbott's music aimed at children was published. A children's cantata of the Book of Mormon in 1981, her song He Sent His Son, in 1982 and Samuel Tells of Baby Jesus in 1985. Death Gabbott died on February 13, 2004 in Bountiful, Utah, and is interred at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

It was an open-frame model, with the barrel unit attached to the frame by a screw beneath the cylinder arbor. The arbor pin was screwed into the barrel unit and fitted into a recess in the standing breech. The cylinder was gate-loaded from the right side, and a rod ejector was carried beneath the barrel. A unique safety bar will usually be found on the right of the frame, below the cylinder. This carries pins which pass through holes in the frame to engage the lock mechanism. Slightly retracting the hammer allows one of these pins to move inward, preventing the hammer moving forward again when released. The pistol can thereafter be carried safely when loaded. Pressure on the trigger withdraws the pin from the path of the hammer before firing. The M1870 Gasser became the Austro-Hungarian cavalry revolver. It chambered a long 11.25mm centerfire cartridge which had earlier been used in Fruwirth carbines.  Gasser-Kropatschek M1876  The Gasser-Kropatschek M1876 was adopted by Austria Hungary in 1876 as a refinement of the 1870 Gasser design. Instigated by Alfred Kropatschek, the changes being principally a matter of reducing weight by reducing the caliber to 9mm.  Montenegrin \\"Gasser Pattern\\" revolvers  Specification = The title 'Montenegrin Gasser' covers a variety of six-chamber large calibre revolvers. The standard issue in the Montenegrin military was the Austrian Gasser Model 1870 in 11.2mm which became known as the Montenegrin Gasser.Geoffrey Boothroyd, The Handgun, Bonanza Books, 1970, p.271, p.273, p.275. . Montenegrin revolvers originally appeared as open-frame models, similar to the Austrian Gasser M1870 and usually in 11mm nominal (11.3mm actual) calibers. Single and double-action locks were used, grips were often in ivory or bone, engraving and gold inlay work was common, and the predominant impression was one of weight and bulk. Later Montenegrin revolvers offered hinged-frame construction, with Galand cylinder locks and a self- extracting mechanism. Most are marked 'Guss Stahl' (crucible cast steel frame), 'Kaiser's Patent' and similar phrases. = Mandatory ownership = In 1910 King Nicholas I of Montenegro proclaimed that all male citizens were members of a national militia and had both a right and a duty to own at least one Gasser Pattern revolver under penalty of law. The official reason for the King's decree was to create an armed populace that would deter neighbouring countries from attacking Montenegro, which was unable to field a large army. However, it was widely believed in Montenegro that this decision was actually taken because the King owned shares in Leopold Gasser Waffenfabrik in Vienna - the patent holder and sole manufacturer of the pistol at that time. Despite this, the decree actually obliged Montenegrin adult males to own a Gasser Pattern revolver, not neccesarily one made by Gasser itself. In fact Leopold Gasser was faced with such heavy demand for the pistol internationally, that it could not fulfil all of the orders placed for it. This led the revolver's manufacturer to license out production to other companies and many Gasser Pattern pistols were then manufactured and sold by other European firms, most notably based out of Belgium and Spain. Even these licensed models did not satiate demand for the pistol and this, alongside a lax enforcement of intellectual property rights in Montenegro, led to many unlicensed local models of the pistol also being produced, with quality ranging from very good to outright dangerous to its user. Subsequently, the weapon quickly became a status symbol for Montenegrin men and was commonly worn alongside traditional attire. Many Montenegrin immigrants that travelled to North America brought their Gasser pattern revolvers with them and at least two batches of several thousand pistols were smuggled into Mexico during the Mexican Revolution, leading to the Gasser revolver becoming widespread in the Americas. However, as the original reason for their mass production and the generation that grew around it faded, the pistol eventually lost its place as a status symbol and many were either given away or sold in the secondhand market.  Later Gasser models  Genuine Austrian Gasser products are marked 'L. GASSER PATENT WIEN' or 'L. GASSER OTTAKRING PATENT', and often carry the Gasser trademark of a heart pierced by an arrow. Gasser also produced revolvers for the commercial market. The Gasser-Kropatschek, for example, appeared with fluted cylinders instead of the smooth-surfaced military pattern. He also produced the 9mm 'Post & Police' solid frame non-ejecting double-action revolver, with a hexagonal barrel. A commercial version of this gun was also made, generally offering better finish. There was also a commercial version of the open-frame M1874 in 9mm, and a 9mm hinged frame self-extracting model with the Galand double-action lock.

It was Acura's second Le Mans Prototype, following their ARX-01 which competed in the LMP2 category. Development Unlike the ARX-01, the ARX-02 is a bespoke LMP designed entirely for Acura by Wirth Research. The original 3.4L V8 was expanded to 4 liters for more durability and drivability with the larger power developed with P1 rules. Wirth Research developed a chassis to generate as much mechanical grip to overcome the power deficit to Diesel centric rules created by the ACO by exploiting the engine's low mass (low compared to larger Diesel engines). Rear tires are now fitted onto the front of the car, increasing the contact patch by 7%, indicating that the vehicle center of mass was more forward placed than its contemporaries. Racing history The ARX-02a were campaigned by two teams, de Ferran Motorsport (Gil de Ferran, Simon Pagenaud and Scott Dixon) and Highcroft Racing (David Brabham, Scott Sharp and Dario Franchitti), and made its competition debut at the 2009 12 Hours of Sebring. Scott Dixon put the de Ferran entry on pole position at Sebring ahead of all the diesels of Audi and Peugeot due to slippery but dry track conditions. However, within the first corner of the race Acura were overcome by Allan McNish in the Audi. Neither Acura finished the race due to mechanical issues and never featured as a threat to win the race, lapping at 2.5 seconds off the winning pace. Throughout the ALMS, the Acura gained overall wins until the Petit Le Mans. In all of the races, the bigger tyres took longer to warm up than most competitors resulting in position loss to the turbo charged P1 Lola's at race starts and restarts. Scott Sharp crashed heavily at Petit Le Mans and spend the next 24 hours rebuilding the car with assistance from de Ferran. At the final race at Laguna Seca, Gil de Ferran won a hard-fought battle with the Fernandez ARX-01. In 2010, de Ferran closed shop and Highcroft was forced to abandon the car, ending the career of the ARX-02. Highcroft went back to campaigning an updated version of the existing ARX-01 for the combined LMP class in 2010.

The conference drew around, 2,000 delegates along with 15,000-20,000 observers in Houston, Texas. The United States Congress approved $5 million in public appropriations for both the state and national conferences as HR 9924, sponsored by Congresswoman Patsy Mink, which Ford signed into law. In 1977 at the start of his presidency, President Jimmy Carter chose a new Commission and appointed Congresswoman Bella Abzug to head it. Numerous events were held over the next two years, culminating in the National Women's Conference. The conference represents a turning point for the political history of second-wave feminism in the United States. A number of controversial issues, including abortion rights and sexual orientation, were flashpoints in the event's program. Historian Marjorie J. Spruill argues that the anti-feminists led by Phyllis Schlafly had a more successful follow-up. They moved the Republican Party to a more socially conservative position.Marjorie J. Spruill,Divided We Stand: The Battle Over Women's Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics (2017) As the Reagan administration came into office in January 1981, much of the political support for the conference and its output, The Spirit of Houston, dissipated in national politics.  History  In 1972, the United Nations proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year. In the spirit of that proclamation, U.S. President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11832, creating a National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year \\"to promote equality between men and women.\\" Jill Ruckelshaus would be appointed its first chairperson. This commission would become the organizing body for the conference as part of the provisions of congressional legislation that would appropriate $5,000,000 for the conference. Event The goal was to hammer out a \\"Plan of Action\\" to be presented to the Carter Administration and Congress for consideration and/or adoption. Each of the twenty-six Resolutions on Women's Rights in the Plan was proposed to the attendees and voted upon collectively. The Conference was chaired by Congresswoman Bella Abzug. The opening ceremony speakers included: First Ladies Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford and Lady Bird Johnson, activists Coretta Scott King, Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, Barbara Jordan, Liz Carpenter, and Jean Stapleton. Maya Angelou read the Declaration of American Women 1977. American Women on the Move, the cover of the program for the National Women's Conference Heated debates ensued over 26 major topics addressed at the conference, such as the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), reproductive rights, the nuclear family, child care funding, sexual orientation, education reform, and the rights of disabled, minority, and aging women. At the conference, there was also a lengthy discussion about nuclear disarmament and a series of talks featuring women who had reached important positions of responsibility in government such as chair of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Assistant Secretary for the United States Department of Commerce, and head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). On the other side of Houston, at the Astrodome, almost fifteen thousand conservative women under the leadership of Phyllis Schlafly held their own counter-conference in which they vowed to uphold traditional pro-family values. The competing Houston conferences demonstrated the discord among women over key issues, and Schlafly's message that women had something to lose, not something to gain, from feminism continued to resonate in the increasingly conservative political climate. Nowhere was this clearer than in the battles over reproductive freedom and the Equal Rights Amendment, the issues most associated with feminism in the public mind in the 1970s. An abundance of people attended the 1977 National Women's Conference and \\"delegates ranged from students and homemakers attending their first women's conference to Presidents of National Women's groups.\\" The head of the conference was Congresswoman Bella Abzug who spoke in front of more than 20,000 of her fellow advocates. Many people who were interested in feminism were at the 1977 National Women's Conference to support women's rights. The inspiring author Betty Friedan attended the conference, the feminist Gloria Steinem attended the conference along with a new feminist leader Eleanor Smeal.

Congresswomen included Bella Abzug, Republican Jill Ruckelshaus, Congresswoman Margaret Heckler, Mary Louise, Mary Crisp, Republican Elly Peterson, Democrat Elizabeth Holtzman, Pat Schroeder, Lindy Boggs, Martha Griffiths, and Barbara Jordan. Past, and at the time, current first ladies Rosalynn Carter, Betty Ford, and Lady Bird Johnson were also in attendance at this conference. All of these women banded together in the Conference to create the 26 planks described above and discuss the rights of women as well as how women should not be discriminated against. Outcomes Cover Page of The Spirit of Houston, including the adoption of the 26 planks of the National Plan of Action agreed by delegates The Spirit of Houston, the official report on the first national women's conference, was submitted to President Carter and Congress in March 1978. A month later, Carter established the National Advisory Committee for Women. The Senate granted a three-year extension for ratification of the ERA within a year of the Houston meeting; this unprecedented move was viewed as a major post- conference achievement, despite the final failure of the amendment in 1982, at which point only 35 of the required 38 states had ratified the amendment. Under political pressure, President Carter fired Abzug from the Commission. No further action was taken by the Administration or Congress on the Plan. = National Plan of Action = Included in the official conference report, the conference produced a National Plan of Action, a culminating document that comprised a series of demands for more revisions, changes in enforcement, and new policies to improve the living conditions of women in American society. The National Plan of Action included 26 planks representing issues and concerns of interest to American women. The planks were discussed at the state-level women's meetings that preceded the 1977 conference and were then open to debate on the floor at the Houston conference. Seventeen of the planks were adopted by conference delegates by wide majorities, and only 20% of delegates opposed certain planks, representing a consensus among conference delegates and attendees on \\"what American women need and want to achieve equal rights, equal status, and equal responsibilities with men.\\" The 26 planks contained in the National Plan of Action are: = Declaration of American Women = This plank declared that all women from different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs deserved the same rights and privileges as men. Equality was an important theme throughout this conference and this plank brought to light the significance of women finally being able to achieve the same privileges as men. At the time, women did not have the right to vote in politics, own housing property, have more power politically, or have the same pay as men in the workplace. The conference concentrated on emphasizing the why women's rights should be implemented into society, and how close women were to achieving these rights. = Arts and Humanities = Opportunities for manager positions and employment jobs in Arts and Humanities were little to non-existent before this conference. This plank was introduced to point this out to society and hopefully inspire a change. Another issue in this department was that women were having a difficult time obtaining art grants, whereas their male counterparts were finding success in this area. If men were the only ones receiving funding for art projects, how would women ever be able to showcase their talent and education to be able to do the same? Being withheld from receiving art grants would be very detrimental to the progression of an artist's career. This was unfortunately the sad reality many aspiring female artists were having to face and a large reason why this plank was brought up at the conference for debate. = Battered Women = A common theme in society was violence against women, which because of its prevalence and importance, earned its own plank at the conference for discussion. They voiced that the amount of violence that women were receiving should be stopped/minimized however possible. A solution that came out of the conference was to provide shelters for women who have experienced violence. It was also announced that these programs should be offered with bilingual and cultural options in order for them to be able to help and benefit a larger portion of society. = Business = At the time of this conference, \\"less than one percent\\" of businesses were owned by women. This statistic, among other reasons, gained this issue a spot as a plank at the conference. It was determined that female entrepreneurs in government activities were to be included as a part of government and granted the same opportunities as men to own a business. Additionally, the Executive Order 11625 of October 13, 1971, was put into place to protect minorities and women with small businesses and the benefits of this order were applauded at this conference. = Child Abuse = Another important issue in society was the problem of child abuse. There really was not any support for the victims of this, so the conference brought up the topic of Child Care to work towards a way to help the victims. The conference determined that the government should provide support, funds, and protective services to help prevent child abuse and assist those affected by it. Also, it was decided that the government should provide equal child care programs for minority women, and improve schools as well as parenthood programs. The \\"care must be low cost and high quality\\" in programs in order for Child Care programs to be efficient in assisting the public. = Credit = This plank argued that women should have equal credit and be informed of their rights pertaining to credit. In order to ensure that women had equal access to credit, regardless of gender, the conference determined that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act needed to be passed. Consequently, the credit issue was the only plank out of all 26 that \\"was approved unanimously\\". Everyone at the conference was in agreement that due to the prevalence of this important issue in society, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act needed to be passed immediately. = Disabled Women = During this time period, society did not give much credit to people that were disabled; additionally, they were not given equal opportunities. The conference discussions led to the decision that disabled women should be able to have the right to education and employment, take care of their children, and be protected from discrimination. = Education = Due to the discrimination against women's education, the conference brought up this plank to argue for law prohibiting this. Discussion on this plank brought to light the lack of women in educational textbooks and leadership positions in society. In order for young women to have more influential role models to inspire them to benefit future generations, there needed to be more female leadership in education. To ensure that these changes were placed into society, \\"Title IX must be enforced\\". = Elective and Appointive Office = There was a serious lack of women in leadership roles before this conference. Most high status and upper pay grade jobs went to males and this kept women from aspiring to achieve more in the workforce. Instead of settling for the less important jobs and positions, the conference decided that women should be allowed more positions in office and more opportunities to move up in the work force. The prejudice that women belonged at home and not in an office was old-fashioned and the discussions at this conference helped to open people's eyes to the importance of aiming higher in the job arena. This factor would also be crucial in inspiring the younger female generations into believing that they too could succeed in the world and were able to do more than past generations. = Employment = The employment plank goes along with the elective and appointive office plank; more women should be allowed into the workforce with higher paying positions. The conference decided that there should be no discrimination in employment and all employment should have equal pay, no discrimination for pregnancy, and special attention to minority women. = Equal Rights Amendment = The ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment which establishes equal rights for all people was discussed. Although this amendment was never ratified, the conference succeeded in earning a three-year extension from the Senate for further discussion on it. = Health = All women should have equal opportunities to health benefits. Additionally, the food and drug administration should be expanded so that food overall could be safer to consume. Another aspect of this plank the conference deemed important was low- cost reproductive health services as well as research into the effects of women's contraception. = Homemakers = All women should be equal to their partners when it comes to owning property. If divorced with children, then the children's needs should come first as well. These topics were reviewed by the convention and ultimately ended up deciding that homemakers should have access to social security because a difficult economic situation would arise from a divorce or death of a spouse. If their significant other passed away and the homemaker did not have social security, they would be left broke. = Insurance = There should be no discrimination between women and insurance, all insurance should be equally provided to women and insurance. = International Affairs = Women should be allowed to be more involved with international affairs, especially in the UN Commission and the UN Decade, Country Development, Human Rights, Peace and Disarmament, Education = Media = All jobs in the media should be able to hire women and women should be given the proper training as well. Additionally, more women should have leadership roles in the media jobs. Federal agencies should look into how mass media impacts sex discrimination. = Minority Women = Some people at the convention felt that the needs and concerns of women of color were not accurately discussed or solved. For example, attendee, Jane Hickie commented, \\"I don't believe that Anglo women had heard directly expressed sorts of frustrations from other women who were Mexican American or Puerto Rican Americans, Latinas, ever before\\". The conference discussed how all minority women should be respected and treated equally, and the government should give them equal rights to work and education, etc. Another aspect that the conference went over about minorities was how all minority cultures should be accepted into the United States. = Offenders = There should be no discrimination with women in facilities, the health services should be improved, and protection from sexual abuse should be more prominent. Also, children should have special care if their mother is in prison. The mother in prison would not be able to adequately care for her children due to her situation, so an alternate care program would need to be open to the children that this circumstance applied to. = Older Women = All health and social services should be provided to older women so that they can \\"live with dignity\\". These services would allow the older population to live comfortably after they retire and not have to worry about running out of money in their old age. = Rape = The government should revise their rape laws to have \\"graduated penalties depend on the amount of coercion, apply assault by or upon both sexes, include all types of sexual assault\\". The creation of rape centers to help survivors and provide survivor compensation, would make it more accessible for those that have been hurt by rape to get help. In order to make it financially easier on married women that attempt to file a rape accusation against their spouse, the definition of rape should be broadened to include marital rape. Additionally, the government should provide programs to schools to help prevent rape and try to stop this issue from being as prevalent in future generations. = Reproductive Freedom = The convention argued that women should have reproductive freedom and be able to have private facilities relating to reproductive freedom. Sex-education should be in schools to educate teens to promote STD awareness and hopefully lessen teenage unplanned pregnancies. Also, the convention determined that promoting the backing of Roe v Wade, family planning, and Medicaid payment use for abortion would be in the best interests of everyone. = Rural Women = Rural women should have the same rights as rural men, as well as establish a rural education policy. The convention was centered around eliminating female discrimination in mostly all debates and planks. = Sexual Orientation = The discussion on this plank was centered around how there should be no discrimination on women's sexual orientation. This topic was intensely debated at the conference before it was eventually passed; never before had this topic been talked about at any event of this size. = Statistics = The government should collect data on the basis of sex in the workplace, its impact on jobs, and its effect on women in the workplace so that the information acquired can be studied and improved to help future generations of women. = Welfare = \\"The Federal and State governments should assume a role in focusing on welfare and poverty as major women's issues\\" \\"Improve social security and retirement systems, raise minimum wage, provide child care and focus on welfare and poverty as major women's issues\\". = Continuing Committee of the Conference = Required an establishment of a Committee to assemble a second conference so the progression towards female equality could continue to grow. =Education reform= Although the Equal Rights Amendment was a significant stride towards demanding the reforms called for in the National Plan of Action, the states ultimately failed to ratify it, and therefore it did not pass into law. Even so, its momentum produced significant ripple effects on the many facets of society that the National Plan of Action sought to change. One such facet is education. Mostly attributed to the outspoken efforts of Betty Friedan, reforms in education policy and enforcement became notably prominent. Other prominent organizers for education reform from women present at the conference were: * Patricia Alberjerg Graham, a representative of the National Institute of Education, who advocated for holding the federal government accountable to efforts that reduce inequality in educational opportunities. * Eileen Shanahan, the assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in the Health, Education and Welfare Department during the Carter administration, who advocated for an emphasis on the ways in which funds are allocated for government programs in education. * Beth Abramowitz, Assistant Director of the Domestic Council Policy Staff during the Carter administration, who proposed an increase in funds for women involved in higher education and academia. * Mary F. Berry, Assistant Secretary of Education, who emphasized the potential of the recent Title IX efforts to increase educational opportunities and to assist women to pursue higher education. Organizing around identities Concerning the aforementioned rights of disabled, minority, and aging women, the National Plan of Action included separate planks devoted specifically to several such groups of women based on identity. These separate planks were intended to create a space in which women who fit distinctions such as 'Minority Women,' 'Rural Women,' and 'Older Women' could address concerns uniquely related to these identities. Hundreds of women sought to have their voices heard and to be included in the document. Maxine Waters, a black woman, worked ceaselessly to pass the 'Minority Women' resolution. Waters described the moment of its passing: \\"Everyone joined in singing 'We Shall Overcome' and women were crying and hugging each other. It was an especially big moment for me because I led off the reading of the resolution we had spent three days and nights drafting.\\" Waters also explained the importance of including minority women's perspectives in all of the planks, ensuring that they did not simply become isolated within the 'Minority Women' section. She wrote: \\"There is a black perspective in all the feminist issues in the National Plan. Battered women, for example. There's a special black perspective because of the frustration of men in the black community. Black women have been able to get jobs when black men could not, and are often hired under affirmative action plans because they meet two criteria: 1) as women, and 2) as blacks. The frustration of the men in seeking employment added to other sexist socialization, often leads to wife-beating. When I was growing up, I often saw women beaten in the streets.\\" The diverse nature of the women who attended the Conference contributed to many debates between individuals and between various groups of women. Women had to organize and debate across identity in order to reach solutions. In Sisters of '77, Jane Hickie commented: \\"I don't believe that Anglo women had heard directly ... those sorts of frustrations from other women who were Mexican American or Puerto Rican American [or] Latinas ever before.\\" Of significant importance to Latina attendees were the discussions revolving around deportations of mothers of American-born children and rights for migrant farm workers. Vera Brown Starr, a member of the Yavapai-Apache Nation and Lorraine White, a Quechan- Pueblo woman of the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, were especially gratified that the resolution against discrimination included language regarding removal of Native American children from their homes and tribes. Women from Asian- American communities brought up issues regarding sweatshop labor practices and discriminatory practices towards wives of U. S. servicemen. The Conference thus helped many women achieve a broader intersectional lens through which to view women's issues. Maxine Waters elaborated on her experience with this: \\"I try to explain to white women the reasons why black women can't support some of the feminist issues. For example, in California, we have a midwifery bill. Midwives were very common in the history of the black community. Because they were too poor to go to the hospital, black women's babies were delivered at home by midwives. The new mothers suffered torn tissues ... the scar tissue is still there ... Black women just don't understand white women who say they don't want to go to sterile hospitals to deliver their babies.\\" These differences emphasized the importance of injecting multiple perspectives into every plank. As stated in the beginning of the 'Minority Women' plank: \\"Every recommendation of this National Plan of Action shall be understood as applying equally and fully to minority women.\\" Kimberle Crenshaw explains the necessity of intersectional approaches to address women's issues: \\"Where systems of race, gender, and class domination converge, as they do in the experiences of battered women of color, intervention strategies based solely on the experiences of women who do not share the same class or race backgrounds will be of limited help to women who because of race and class face different obstacles.\\"  First Ladies at the conference  Rosalynn Carter with Betty Ford and Ladybird Johnson at the 1977 National Women's Conference The conference was attended by former First Ladies Lady Bird Johnson and Betty Ford, as well as Rosalynn Carter, wife of then-president Jimmy Carter. These women were not the only political figures in attendance, but their position as direct connections to the president made their presence significant. After President Lyndon B. Johnson entered office, his wife Lady Bird began to focus on social issues of the time rather than social status or being the ideal American housewife. Johnson was a key component in her husband's political career, serving as an adviser and working to present herself in the best way possible. While in the White House, Johnson sought to link her political influence with the traditional roles and responsibilities of the position of First Lady. During President Johnson's second inauguration, she became the first wife to hold the Bible while her husband was sworn in. During her term as First Lady, she focused on beautification of natural areas which stemmed from a lifelong love of nature. Betty Ford took the office of First Lady in 1974 following the resignation of President Richard Nixon, and would spend the rest of her term pushing for greater rights for women. She was an advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment and campaigned for it whenever her schedule allowed. It was during the Ford administration that the idea for a women's conference began to surface, and many believe that Betty Ford was largely responsible for this. She was the main voice leading her fellow First Ladies to attend the conference, and would continue to use her political power to advocate for women's rights after the conference. Rosalynn Carter, who was First Lady when the conference took place, was a strong proponent of feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment. She was the first First Lady to use the office in the East Wing, and was a known advocate for several social issues such as mental health and services for senior citizens. She attended the conference with Johnson and Ford, stating that Ford was the major force in bringing them all together. The First Ladies all delivered speeches during the opening ceremony and accepted the torch when it arrived onstage.  Catholic women at the conference  Bette Hillemeier attended the conference as the at-large delegate from Minnesota. She was from Olivia, Minnesota and called herself a “Christian feminist.” She was an example of the intersection and controversy between traditional Catholic values and the women's liberation movement. She was the President of the National Council of Catholic Women in 1978 & 1979\\\\. This organization represented 10-14 million Catholic women and advocated for “pro-family” ideals. Hillemeier was“personally opposed the ERA.” She wanted “equality,... but [thought] existing laws would take care of equal rights if they were enforced.” {{ cite news publisher= Star Tribune, Minneapolis, Minnesota date=December 25, 1977 When she was elected president of the NCCW the organization did not support the ERA while many nuns were in support of ratification. This differing of opinion created tensions within the group. Many nuns supported the ERA as it improved chances for ordination of women as deacons and priests. = List of Catholic women attendees = * Bette Hellemeier * Donna Quinn from Chicago Catholic Women * Sr. Jacinta Mann * National Council of Catholic Women exhibit * Leadership Conference of Women Religious * Sister Jeanne Schweickert * Mary Helen Madden, Delegate at large for National Council of Catholic Women  Controversial issues Reproductive freedom= The 21st plank of the National Action Plan was titled \\"Reproductive Freedom.\\" In this plank, the women of the National Women's Conference stated their full support of women's reproductive freedom and encouraged all levels of government to comply with the Supreme Court's decisions to guarantee it, such as Roe v. Wade. The plank also included the support of abortion and pregnancy-related care being available to all women as well as encouraging organizations to hold the government responsible for maintaining these principles. The delegates also called for the requirement of consent for all sterilization procedures, concomitant to Department of Health, Education and Welfare's April 1974 regulations. Repeatedly holding all levels of government responsible, they insisted on developing sex education programs and programs for teenage parents in all schools. Delegates' articulation of women's reproductive freedom encompassed a variety of reproductive rights and family planning issues confronting women around the time of the conference in 1977. The goal of the Reproductive Freedom plank was to ensure that every woman had the fundamental right to access the available means to control her reproduction. Before the legalization of abortion, women, and often disproportionately poor women and women of color, were not able to obtain safe abortions and often resorted to self-procedures. These illegal abortion procedures frequently resulted in complications and sometimes death. In 1972, an estimated 88 abortion-related deaths were reported and about 63 were associated with illegal abortions. One of the landmark decisions that affected the reproductive freedom movement was Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right to privacy includes a women's right to terminate her pregnancy and affirmed the right for a woman to choose abortion. Between the Supreme Court decision in 1973 and the National Women's Conference in 1977, the number of safe and legal abortions steadily increased from 744,600 to 1,270,000; however, in 1977 approximately 560,000 women were not able to obtain the abortion services they needed.Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch, Christopher Tietze, and Ellen Sullivan. \\"Abortion in the United States, 1976-1977\\". Family Planning Perspectives 10.5 (1978): 271–279. Web. Women still faced many obstacles in obtaining abortion services. In 1976, approximately 458,000 women who were able to obtain services had to travel outside of their counties to do so, and 118,000 had to travel to different states. Though one of the goals of the plank was to ensure the availability of safe and legal abortions, it encompassed a wide variety of concepts that the delegates also recognized as necessary for reproductive freedom. The plank also emphasized the opposition to involuntary sterilization and upheld that spousal consent should not be a requirement for sterilization procedures. Sterilization abuse was an issue that gained attention in the 1970s and activists called on the women's movement to incorporate the concept into their fight. The 21st plank also presented the need for confidential family-planning services and sex education programs in schools. The plank read \\"Federal, State, and local governing bodies should take whatever steps necessary to remove existing barriers to family planning services for all teenagers who request them.\\" Ultimately, the delegates called for the freedom of all women and girls to be able to be informed about and control their own reproduction. Today, challenges surrounding reproductive freedom are still being addressed, and women are still fighting to obtain the reproductive freedom they called for in 1977. Many of these challenges have centered around abortion debates involving the healthcare provider Planned Parenthood. The debates have become a focal point of the political and legal sphere, with members of Congress deliberating on government funding allocated to the organization. Supporters of reproductive freedom and Planned Parenthood argue that defunding the organization, which provides a variety of healthcare services to women, men, and young people including safe and legal abortions, would detrimentally affect preventative and reproductive care. =Liberal feminist analysis of \\"Plank 8\\"= All of the demands from Plank 8 can be analyzed through a liberal feminist approach. Feminist concerns with education focused on reallocation of government funds. The delegates of the conference decided that the ways in which money was being dispensed into education opportunities for women in academia was not enough. This sentiment is echoed in Adrienne Rich's Claiming an Education, where she writes, > One of the devastating weaknesses of university learning, of the store of > knowledge and opinion that has been handed down through academic training, > has been its almost total erasure of women's experience and thought from the > curriculum, and its exclusion of women as members of the academic community. Liberal feminist theory grounds itself on the firm belief in education. Donovan says that education is an imperative tool that must be available to women so that they can impact society, without access to it, the patriarchy continues to makes women \\"civilly dead\\". In asking for educational opportunities to be expanded to women, the attendees of the 1977 conference were in agreement with Wollstonecraft's thought. Wollstonecraft asserted that only through proper education would women be able to free themselves from patriarchal oppression. The delegates of 1977 were asserting the rights they felt were guaranteed to them as citizens of the United States.

Fossils are present from Madagascar, Morocco, Niger, Argentina, and Brazil (in the case of Caririsuchus, where some specimens have been found in the Romualdo Member of the Santana FormationKellner, A.W.A. and Campos, D. A. (1999). Vertebrate Paleontology in Brazil - a review. Episodes, vol. 22, p. 238-251.). Possible trematochampsids have been found from Spain and France, but classification past the family level is indeterminant. The trematochampsids first appeared during the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous and became extinct during the late Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Description Trematochampsids are deep-snouted and have a ziphodont tooth structure.Buckley, G. A., and Brochu, C. A. (1999). An enigmatic new crocodile from the Upper Cretaceous of Madagascar. In Unwin, D. (ed.), Cretaceous Fossil Vertebrates: Special Papers in Palaeontology No. 60, The Palaeontological Association (London), p. 149-175. The dentition differs from most other crocodilians in that the teeth are recurved, serrated, and lateromedially compressed. This may be an adaptation to a terrestrial or at least semiterrestrial lifestyle as such teeth would be better suited for cutting and tearing into prey as opposed to capturing them and holding them underwater. Despite this, most trematochampsids are presumed to have been aquatic.Rogers, Raymond R.; Krause, David W.; Curry Rogers, Kristina; Rasoamiaramanana, Armand H.; & Rahantarisoa, Lydia. (2007). Paleoenvironment and Paleoecology of Majungasaurus crenatissimus (Theropoda: Abelisauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 27(sp8): 21-31. Taxonomy There has been much controversy surrounding the family's phylogeny, and the group's monophyly has been questioned.Gasparini, Z., Chiappe, L. M. and Fernandez, M (1991).A New Senonian Peirosaurid (Crocodylomorpha) from Argentina and a Synopsis of the South American Cretaceous crocodilians. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 11(3): 316-333. Relations between taxa within the family are also poorly understood. Many crocodylomorphs such as Mahajangasuchus, Bergisuchus and Iberosuchus had originally been assigned to Trematochapsidae but have since been assigned to the family Sebecidae or put into their own families. Neogene sebecosuchians of Europe have been reclassified as trematochampsids but have recently been supported as true sebecosuchians as was originally proposed.Buckley, G. A., and Brochu, C. A. (1999). An enigmatic new crocodile from the Upper Cretaceous of Madagascar. In Unwin, D. (ed.), Cretaceous Fossil Vertebrates: Special Papers in Palaeontology No. 60, The Palaeontological Association (London), p. 149-175.Turner, A. H. and Calvo, J. O. (2005). A new sebecosuchian crocodyliform from the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 25(1): 87–98. Itasuchus had originally been assigned to Trematochapsidae. The phylogenetic analysis of Carvalho et al. (2004) found a sister relations between Malawisuchus and Itasuchus. They named this node family Itasuchidae, and found it to be a member of Peirosauroidea. However, their analysis didn't include any neosuchians or (other than Itasuchus) trematochampsids. All more recent phylogenetic analyses found a close relations between Trematochapsidae and Peirosauridae, and the two clades might be synonymous. Recent studies suggest that Itasuchus is a trematochampsid (and not closely related to the more derived notosuchian Malawisuchus). In 2012, the new trematochampsid Barreirosuchus was described from the Bauru Basin as Itasuchus and it shares with it, and with Caririsuchus camposi from the Araripe Basin, several synapomorphies that are absent in other trematochampsids and peirosaurids. The cladistic analysis of Rukwasuchus found Trematochampsa a member of Peirosauridae.a b c d e Sertich, J. J. W.; O’Connor, P. M.

More recently, Trematochampsa taqueti was declared a nomen dubium by Meunier and Larsson (2018), who found that the materials assigned to it were from several different taxa. They also recommended that the taxon Trematochampsidae be abandoned.

His brother, Pavel Shkot, was a vice-admiral. Shkot was promoted to midshipman in 1848, and participated in the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, during which he was badly wounded in the battle. Shkot became a senior commander of the troopship Yaponets at the rank of lieutenant in 1856, before accepting command of corvette-steamship Amerika a year later on June 6, 1857. Shkot led an expedition in Amerika to the recently acquired region of the Russian Far East known as Outer Manchuria, which had been ceded by Qing China to the Russian Empire. The expedition recorded numerous geographic discoveries in largely undocumented region, particularly along the coast of modern Primorsky Krai and Sakhalin, including Peter the Great Gulf, the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan, Nakhodka Bay, and Moneron Island.Шкот Николай Яковлевич In 1860, Shkot became one of the founders of Vladivostok, the largest city in the Russian Far East and capital of Primorsky Krai, at the south-western tip of Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula. Shkot also founded a hydrographic post on the site of modern Nakhodka and another in Posyet Bay. From October 2, 1864, Shkot was appointed captain over Russian ports on the Pacific Ocean, and in 1868 was promoted to captain 1st rank. Shkot began to suffer from a serious illness in 1870, returning to Saint Petersburg where he died on September 1, and was buried in Krasnenkoye Cemetery. Several sites in southern Primorsky Krai were named in honor of Shkot, including Shkot Island in the Eugénie Archipelago, the town of Shkotovo, the Shkotovka River, and a cape in Olga Bay.

Most of the eight tornadoes that touched down were produced by two supercell thunderstorms over North Carolina. At 12:25 a.m. EST, the National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina as the risk of tornadoes increased. Not long after, the first tornado of the outbreak, an EF2, touched down in South Carolina. Almost an hour later, the second tornado touched down in Robeson County, North Carolina. Three other minor tornadoes, two EF0 and an EF1, touched down over the next two hours. Around 3:10 a.m. EST, the first of two killer tornadoes touched down near Kenly, North Carolina. The EF2 tornado destroyed a few homes and damaged several others. Roughly 20 minutes later, an EF3 tornado touched down in Wilson County. This tornado killed one person and injured a few others after destroying several homes. Total damages from the outbreak amounted to $2.5 million, about half of which was a result of the EF3 tornado. Synopsis Radar image of the system at the time the tornado watch was issued On November 14, the National Weather Service issued a slight risk of severe weather for the early hours of November 15 for the Carolinas and northern Gulf coast. Although conditions were not favorable for a large-scale severe weather event, the possibility of small clusters of thunderstorms existed. Strong wind shear was forecast to persist, which would allow small bow-echo line of thunderstorms which could produce damaging winds. The result of a weak disturbance which passed through the area of slight risk lowered the chances of tornadic thunderstorms developing. At 12:25 a.m. EST, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina. A broken line of thunderstorms had already developed and the risk of tornadoes greatly increased, with the chances of an EF2 or stronger touching down reaching 20%. The first tornado touched down shortly after in South Carolina. Over the following several hours, two supercell thunderstorms spawned seven more tornadoes throughout North Carolina. The final tornado dissipated around 4:36 a.m. EST, just 3 hours and 46 minutes after the outbreak started. The tornado watch remained in effect until before being cancelled at 8:00 a.m. EST. Confirmed tornadoes Radar images of the thunderstorm which spawned the EF3 Elm City tornado The first tornado of the outbreak touched down around 12:50 a.m. EST about east of Carolina Mills, South Carolina in Dillon County. Large pine trees were snapped and a mobile home was rolled about 20 yards (18.2 m) before being completely destroyed. A truck was also flipped outside a church parking lot before the tornado lifted. However, several minutes later it touched down again, destroying the roof and severely damaging the walls of a brick home. After traveling for about one third of a mile, the tornado destroyed the roof of another brick home. The tornado was estimated to have become a strong EF2 tornado with winds between as it hit a third brick home, nearly destroying it. In all, the tornado damaged 25 structures and destroyed seven others. Three cars were also damaged and another three were destroyed along the tornado's path. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $325,000. Around 1:35 a.m. EST, a weak tornado touched down near several mobile homes about east-southeast of St. Pauls, North Carolina in Robeson County, one of which sustained severe damage. Afterwards, the tornado traveled towards the north-northeast and crossed North Carolina Highway 20. An auto repair shop located along the highway sustained significant damage with all of the bay windows being blown out and 17 nearby storage sheds were destroyed. Several trees were knocked down onto railroad tracks before the tornado damaged another mobile home and dissipated. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $50,000. The tornado was rated as an EF0 with winds up to . The third tornado touched down around 2:15 a.m. EST near the town of Autryville in Sampson County. Several trees were damaged along the tornado's path and one home sustained notable damage. A carport near the home was blown down and twisted into nearby trees. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $25,000. The tornado was rated as an EF0 by the National Weather Service. A home destroyed by the Kenly tornado The fourth tornado of the outbreak touched down around 2:45 a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, some of which were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of the outbreak touched down around 3:03 a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwards, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service. The sixth and first killer tornado of the outbreak touched down around 3:10 a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for three quarters of a mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30 ft down the driveway of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50 ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service. A home destroyed by the Elm City tornado The most significant tornado during the outbreak touched down around 3:30 a.m. EST near Harrison Drive where a tree was snapped. Traveling towards the northeast, the tornado blew a home off its foundation and completely destroyed it near Route 1330. Local firefighters and rescue responders estimated that the home rolled four times before being destroyed. At the time the tornado struck, three people were in the home, one of which was killed. After destroying the home, the tornado caused major damage to the upper portion of another home and tore off the roof of another. Afterwards, the tornado tracked into Elm City where numerous trees were damaged and a porch was blown off a home. An estimated 8,000 residents in Wilson County were left without power following the tornado. Four other people were injured as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $1.2 million. About 100 people were also displaced due to the tornado. The tornado was rated as a low-end EF3 along its discontinuous track. The final tornado of the outbreak touched down near U.S. Route 64 around 4:30 a.m. EST. The tornado traveled towards the northeast, damaging two mobile homes and a chapel. Several outbuildings were also damaged or destroyed near a farm before the tornado dissipated. The tornado was rated as an EF1 along its track. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $50,000. Aftermath The estimated cost to clean up debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads to make way for aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year- old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November 17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38 million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November 21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2 million. On November 24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.

Ringkøbing Fjord, despite its name, is in fact a shallow lagoon on the west coast of Jutland. Skjern River terminates in Ringkøbing Fjord with a large river delta system to the east, and the lagoon is shielded from the North Sea by a long isthmus named Holmsland Dunes to the west. On the Hvide Sande Canal in the middle of the isthmus, there is a floodgate that provides access to the sea to the west. The fjord is about 30 kilometers long and 2 to 3 meters deep with an area of almost 300 square kilometers (115 square miles). In the southwestern corner is the Tipperne peninsula, where there is a bird reservation. The town of Ringkøbing lies to the north-east. Ringkøbing Fjord was once affected by oxygen depletion, but today both plant and fish life abounds. Ringkøbing Fjord was originally a bay, around which two sandbars have gradually built up, with a sandbank that has shifted repeatedly over time as a result of shifting water currents. In the mid-17th century, the bank was near Sønder Havrvig, but it gradually moved south as sand was deposited on the shoal from the north. By the late 18th century, it was close to the town of Nymindegab. On several occasions, the surrounding dunes collapsed from the effects of the water, causing the old outflow to fill with sand and creating problems for local fisherman. In 1891, a channel was therefore dug south of Nymindegab but, in 1910, it was replaced by a channel in Hvide Sande. A storm surge in 1911 created an opening of 230 meters and extensive flooding around the fjord. In 1915, the passage at the southern end of the fjord was therefore reopened while the one near Hvide Sande was closed. It was, however, later reopened with the establishment of a lock in 1931.

She officially became an independent MK on 15 March 2017. Due to leaving Yisrael Beiteinu during a Knesset term, she was limited by Knesset protocol from running for the next elections. As a result, in March 2018, she announced plans to form a new party. In December 2018, the party was named Gesher, reviving the name of the party founded by her father in 1996. In the April 2019 elections, the new party failed to cross the electoral threshold. However, after a failure to form a new government, the newly elected Knesset voted to dissolve itself in May 2019, and snap elections were called for September. On 18 July, Gesher agreed to form an electoral alliance with Labor, with Levy placed second on the joint list. She returned to the Knesset as the alliance won six seats. Views and opinions Levy's political views are primarily focused on social issues and issues of economic justice. Whilst a member of Yisrael Beiteinu, she was one of two members of the governing coalition to abstain from the controversial Nation State Law.

The hill dominates the skyline above the village of Golspie and is visible from many parts of east Sutherland. The statue which is perched on top is that of George Leveson-Gower, Marquess of Stafford and first Duke of Sutherland who became notorious through the part he played in the Highland clearances. George Leveson-Gower Leveson-Gower was born in 1758, the son of the Marquess of Stafford. In 1785 he married Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Sutherland. She had inherited the Earldom and its associated estates following a well-known legal case which established the unusual principle that the Earldom could pass through the female as well as the male line. In the early nineteenth century the couple initiated sweeping reforms to their estate in Sutherland. This is where the Duke's reputation will vary, depending upon whom you are talking to. Some would say that he was shocked by the conditions his tenants were living in and he became convinced that the interior of Sutherland could not support these subsistence farmers long term. Advised to follow the latest economic and social theories he decided to resettle the population in new villages along the coast to make way for large sheep farms inland. The other – and probably more common view – is that he decided it would be more profitable for the estate to turn the land over to large scale sheep farming, and so the tenants would have to go, whether they wanted to or not. Either way, these reforms led to thousands of people being evicted from their homes and farms. Across the Highlands, it was common for the roof timbers of cleared houses to be burnt, to prevent re-occupation after the eviction parties had left. In 1819 the coincidence of this practice with a spell of dry weather and the eviction of 425 families led to the Observer newspaper running the headline: \\"the Devastation of Sutherland\\". 1819 became known as \\"the year of the burnings\\" (bliadhna na losgaidh). The Sutherland clearances were not by any means the only clearances – this period saw similar occurrences throughout Scotland, not just in the Highlands but in many rural lowland areas as well. However, the Sutherland clearances were probably the largest clearance in the Highlands, measured in terms of the probable number of people evicted. The Countess of Sutherland, Leveson-Gower's wife, had a substantial role in oversight of the management of the Sutherland Estate. This was unusual for the time - but Leveson-Gower delegated most of this activity to her. She visited the estate every year and was in extensive correspondence with both the estate factor and the commissioner. Her husband's main activity was to provide the substantial amounts of money needed for the reorganisation of the estate. Leveson-Gower was created first Duke of Sutherland for his services to politics in 1833, just a few months before his death. He died in July of that year at Dunrobin Castle and was buried at Dornoch Cathedral. In 1834 a subscription was started in order to pay for a monument in his memory. Subscriptions came in from far and wide, which is surprising given his reputation today. Work soon began and the stone for the massive base and plinth was quarried from the north east side of Ben Bhraggie, about from the monument's location. The statue itself was sculpted by Sir Francis Chantrey and it was taken up to the top of the Ben in pieces by horse and cart. The monument was completed in 1837 and it has dominated the views of east Sutherland ever since; it is known locally as the \\"Mannie\\". The Mannie There have been calls for the statue to be removed or demolished. Graffiti has been sprayed across the plinth several times and the word \\"monster\\" was sprayed across it in green paint. As recently as November 2011 two large sandstone sections were wrenched out from the massive plinth supporting the statue – the sections were left lying on the grass beside the statue. \\"The Mannie\\"-- statue erected to George Leveson-Gower on the summit of Ben Bhraggie Since the first attempt, recent repair work has since been undone and even more stones have been extracted from the northwest corner of the plinth. Police believe an ongoing campaign is being waged to topple the statue over. An unsuccessful campaign was launched in 1995 by the late Sandy Lindsay, of Newtonmore, to tear down the statue, and erect a commemorative Celtic Cross or plaque dedicated to the victims of the Clearances. The campaign began a dialogue about the statue’s destruction and removal which still continues. There was a failed attempt by vandals to topple the statue in November 2011. A BBC news report of this incident quoted a local person saying that few people wished the statue removed; instead they saw it as an important reminder of history. Sport and the arts A network of mountain bike trails, the Highland Wildcat Trails, have been built on side of Ben Bhraggie. This features black and red graded routes, going from the summit of the hill down to the village of Golspie, including the longest singletrack descent in the UK at around 7 km.

Perspectives in Music Theory, p.216. New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company. . Original with Roman numeral analysis only. The Symphonic Variations (Variations symphoniques), M. 46, is a work for piano and orchestra written in 1885 by César Franck. It has been described as \\"one of Franck's tightest and most finished works\\", \\"a superb blending of piano and orchestra\\", and \\"a flawless work and as near perfection as a human composer can hope to get in a work of this nature\\". It is a fine example of Franck's use of cyclic unity, with one theme growing into various others. The piano and orchestra share equally in the continuous evolution of ideas. The work is in F minor (with the last movement in F major). Duration in performance is about fifteen minutes, and the instrumentation is piano solo and orchestra: pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons; four horns; two trumpets; timpani; and strings.  History  The work was dedicated to Louis Diémer, who on 15 March 1885 had premiered Les Djinns, a symphonic poem for piano and orchestra that brought Franck one of his rare critical successes. He promised to reward Diémer with \\"a little something\\", and the similarly scored Symphonic Variations was the result. Franck started work in the summer of 1885, and completed the piece on 12 December.  Premiere  The premiere on 1 May 1886, at the annual orchestral concert of the Société Nationale de Musique, went almost unnoticed. The soloist was Diémer, and the composer conducted. The second performance was not until 30 January 1887, at a concert devoted entirely to Franck under the conductor Jules Pasdeloup, with Diémer again as soloist. It still failed to impress. Before and after Franck's death, however, his works were championed by his students, including Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, Paul Dukas, and Ernest Chausson; and the Symphonic Variations soon entered the repertoire of major pianists. It was mainly through the Symphony in D minor and the Symphonic Variations that Franck became posthumously famous. The work is now regularly performed, and has been recorded many times. It was later arranged for two pianos, four hands.  Structure  While there is no doubt that it demonstrates Franck's mastery of variation form, the overall structure of the Symphonic Variations has been a matter of debate. Donald Tovey called it \\"a finely and freely organized fantasy, with an important episode in variation form\\". It has three broad parts, played without a break: introduction, theme and variations, and finale. These parts resemble the fast–slow–fast layout of a three-movement concerto. While the whole piece is thematically unified, the proper variations occupy only the central third of the work. The introduction has reminded many commentators of the theme of the slow movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 in G. The entire work is based on two themes. The first part begins in the home key of F minor with different elements of the themes played by the orchestra and the piano (Poco allegro). Soon both themes get a proper statement, the first (ascending) in A major by the orchestra (L'istesso tempo), the second (descending) in C minor by the piano (Poco più lento). A transitional section with orchestra and piano interplay (Allegro — Allegretto quasi andante) lead to the second part of the work. It is this second part that contains the variations. The main theme (the ascending one) is announced by the piano. It is in F minor. The variations follow. Their number is debated, ranging from six to fifteen, depending on how one counts: brief variations having similar character can be analyzed as just sections of longer and more complex variations. The last variation is marked Molto più lento. It changes the mode from minor to major (F major). After this, the music returns to minor for a new transitional episode, in which the descending theme reappears played by the strings con sordini with a mysterious piano arpeggio accompaniment. It is quite long (about 2 minutes) and ends with a piano trill announcing the final part. The work ends with a brilliant final in the parallel F major (Allegro non troppo). It is a compact sonata-form movement, complete with first (the descending theme) and second (the ascending theme) subjects, development, and recapitulation. The second subject appears at first in D major and returns in F major.  Arrangements  In 1946 the choreographer Frederick Ashton used Franck's work for a ballet, also called Symphonic Variations. Ralph Vaughan Williams's Fantasia (quasi variazione) on the Old 104th Psalm Tune for piano, chorus, and orchestra (1949) has some similarities to the Symphonic variations, but it lacks Franck's adherence to classical variation form.

The Nardin Park congregation met at East Junior High School on Middlebelt Road until the new building at 29887 W. 11 Mile Road was ready in September 1965. The former building was sold to the Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1963.

The cathedral also contains a Byzantine bas relief of the 6th century, a Byzantine altar and crucifix, and in the sacristy some magnificently carved cupboards by Jacopo Piazzetta from the Charity School of Venice. Behind the building a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes was constructed in the 1930s, which still attracts many visitors.

It has a student body of around 490. LAMP was once housed at Sidney Lanier High School but moved into the former site of Loveless Elementary in 1999. A 9th grade class was added in 2001. Rankings In 2008, it was named #18 on U.S. News & World Report's Gold Medal List and #56 in Newsweek's list of the top 1000 high schools in the United States. In 2011, Newsweek ranked LAMP as the number 13 best high school in the United States. In 2013, LAMP was named the #1 high magnet high school in the nation, #1 in the state, and #7 overall by U.S. News & World Report. LAMP has accrued extensive scholastic acclaim, particularly in its ability to produce National Merit Scholars. Admission Acceptance into LAMP is based on academic records indicating demonstrated ability to complete higher-level academic courses and maintain disciplined study and work habits. However, due to Federal mandates, LAMP has changed its acceptance requirements into a lottery-based system. IB program In 2014, LAMP was recognized as an International Baccalaureate World School and began its IB program in the fall of that year. May 2016 saw the first IB class graduate with great success inside and outside the classroom. However, the decision was made at the end of July 2017 to not renew the IB program; therefore, the last IB class graduated in May 2018. New building LAMP was originally a part of Sidney Lanier, but as the program grew, it soon moved to a vacated elementary school building, Loveless Elementary. On September 17, 2014, Montgomery Public Schools announced that LAMP would receive a new school site due to technical problems with the Loveless building that officials deemed highly unsafe. MPS said that, until 2016, the students would temporarily be moved into a previously closed school known as Houston Hills, a move that took place during the school year in November 2014. LAMP's site at Houston Hills boasted a custom classroom trailer park, lush recreational field, a variety of free-range domestic fowl, and a two-level parking deck. Due to the inevitable delays in construction the date for the school to move was postponed, but the new site of the school is at the Montgomery Mall's old site, alongside Montgomery's Technology school. The area has been reconstructed as OneCenter. Athletics LAMP currently fields 17 competitive athletic teams in 4A competition. These teams consistently compete at the highest levels of the 4A classification. In 2008-2009 Lamp's baseball, soccer and basketball teams went to their respective state tournaments. All won the area championships, but baseball was runner-up in the state and basketball and soccer would be stopped at third in state. From 2012-2015, LAMP's Boys Cross Country Team earned runner-Up in the AHSAA 4A State Championship, in addition to having 11 All-State runners over the same period .In 2016 the LAMP's Boys Cross Country finally won the AHSAA 4A State Championship. LAMP has had state tournament appearances as of 2007. In 2008-2009, the Tigers baseball team went to the state championship against Hokes Bluff and lost in two games to be the state runners-up. Also in that year, the basketball and soccer teams won the area but were defeated by Dallas County and Altamont respectively, resulting in both placing third in the state. Boys basketball advanced past the area championship in 2017 but lost to Bullock County in the region playoffs. Reputation LAMP has developed a national reputation for excellence in academics due to high, regular rankings of top high schools in the United States. Features of the program: * Ranked as one of the Top 10 Elite High Schools by Newsweek * Ranked as a Gold Medal School (top 100 in USA) by U.S. News & World Report * Sixteen Advanced Placement courses * Began its International Baccalaureate Diploma Program in 2014; program not renewed, with last class graduating May 2018 ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:High schools in Montgomery, Alabama Category:Magnet schools in Alabama Category:Educational institutions established in 1984 Category:Public high schools in Alabama Category:1984 establishments in Alabama Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Alabama ","title":"Loveless Academic Magnet Program"},{"id":"21648635","text":"Nymindegab lies in Southwest Jutland, Denmark, and is a former fishing village by the former outflow at the southern end of Ringkøbing Fjord.

The 31-story, structure was designed in the Renaissance Revival style by Thomas Hastings of Carrère and Hastings, in conjunction with Shreve, Lamb & Blake. 26 Broadway is located on a pentagonal site bounded by Broadway to the northwest, Bowling Green to the west, Beaver Street to the south, New Street to the east/southeast, and the axis of Morris Street to the north. It contains a tower topped by a stepped pyramid, as well as a curved facade along Broadway. The original structure was built in 1884–1885 for Standard Oil on the former site of U.S. treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton's house. The Standard Oil Building was expanded in 1895 and again after World War I, when Walter C. Teagle bought four neighboring buildings to create a continuous lot. The building was greatly expanded to its current size in a multi-phase construction project that took place between 1921 and 1928. 26 Broadway was sold to another owner in 1956 but remained a prominent structure on Bowling Green. In 1995, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated 26 Broadway as an official city landmark.  Description  26 Broadway is bounded by Broadway to the northwest and west (along Bowling Green), Beaver Street to the south, and New Street to the east/southeast. It occupies the physical lots of 10-30 Broadway, 1-11 Beaver Street, and 73-81 New Street. Immediately to the south is 2 Broadway, while the Cunard Building (25 Broadway), 11 Broadway, and the Charging Bull sculpture are located directly to the west. The New York City Subway's Whitehall Street station (served by the ) and Bowling Green station (served by the ) are both located less than a block south. The building was designed by Thomas Hastings of Carrère and Hastings in the Renaissance Revival style, in conjunction with Shreve, Lamb & Blake. Of the principal architects in the latter firm, Richmond Shreve oversaw the construction of the building's expansion and was tasked with solving logistical issues; however, not much is known about the tasks performed by William F. Lamb and Theodore Blake. The structure is tall, with 31 stories. = Form = The top of 26 Broadway's tower section contains a finial and kerosene cauldron. The building has a complex massing: its lower portion occupies the entire pentagonal lot, following the curving contour of Broadway at that point, while its tower is aligned with the grid to which Lower Manhattan's other skyscrapers conform. A deep light court cuts through the center of the Beaver Street facade, which was the last section to be constructed due to the presence of a holdout lot occupied by Childs Restaurants. The original Standard Oil Building, a 15- or 16-story building initially faced in brick, still exists at the base of the modern skyscraper. The interior floors of the annex portions were designed so that they were at the same level as the floors in the original building. The newer floors are carried by trusses over the original structure, rather than resting on the older building's walls. In total, the base of the building is 16 stories. The tower section of 26 Broadway contains an additional 13 stories above the northern edge of the expanded base. A colonnade is located outside the top three stories on each side. The tower is topped by a ziggurat-style pyramid that was inspired by the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The pyramid was added when the building was expanded in the 1920s, and its top finial is above ground level. The pyramid contains a cauldron that initially was lit by kerosene, the material with which Standard Oil's founders, the Rockefeller family, made their first profits. The cauldron's light was extinguished after 1956. = Foundation = The modern building was constructed in several phases around the preexisting buildings on the site. The buildings were occupied by numerous tenants, who were allowed to temporarily stay in place due to the dearth of office space in Lower Manhattan in the 1920s. The structures included the Welles Building at 14-20 Broadway, at the modern building site's western boundary; the New York Produce Exchange at Broadway and Beaver Street, on the site's southwest corner; the Lisbon Building at Beaver and New Streets, at the site's southeast corner; and a five-story Childs Restaurants location in the middle of the block on Beaver Street, on the southern boundary.A diagram of the site is shown in The original Standard Oil structure was located on the northern boundary of the site. Further complicating work was the presence of quicksand some below ground, underneath which was a hardpan of clay, gravel, and boulders. The Welles Building and the original Standard Oil Building contained thick footings that went into the quicksand, though only a few of the footings reached the hardpan. Thus, a cofferdam wall was built underneath part of the expanded site, extending down to the bedrock at the deepest level. A complex system of underpinning was then undertaken so that the existing buildings would not collapse while excavation and construction of the foundation was ongoing. = Facade = Main arched entrance The modern building's facade is primarily composed of buff-colored Indiana Limestone, covering the tower and much of the base. The limestone facade at the lower stories is rusticated. The original building's facade was made of red brick and granite, making it appear as though the original section was separate from the expanded structure. Part of this facade is visible from New Street, but the Broadway facade was totally replaced with limestone. A small portion of the original building's southern facade is still visible but was given a limestone overlay. 26 Broadway features numerous setbacks on its facade, as mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The lowest such setback is located at the 10th floor on the New and Beaver Streets sides. Further setbacks are located above the 16th floor, where the building's base transitions into the tower, and above the 18th and 22nd floors of the tower. The Broadway facade slopes slightly downward to the south: at the northern part of the building, the ground level is at the same elevation as the building's second floor. The main entrance is located near the middle of the curved Broadway facade; it consists of a recessed double-height arch, with elaborately carved spandrels at its top. Double-height arched windows are located on either side of the main entrance arch. There are also two secondary entrances at 24 and 28 Broadway, located respectively to the south and north of the main arch; these entrances are located within doorways topped by pediments and clocks. The former was historically an entrance to retail space, while the latter provides access to the original building. On Beaver Street to the south, the ground level is at the same elevation as the first floor, and contains storefronts. The Beaver Street facade is divided into three sections. The center section only reaches to the third floor and contains a cornice above projecting vertical pilasters, while the taller outer sections contain double-height arched windows between smaller window openings. On New Street, the facade is divided into two sections: the northern section is made of brick and granite, and the southern section is made of limestone. = Features = Lobby passageway The entrance contains an entrance hall high. The interior features 19 elevators; the elevators in the original building were removed when the expansion was built. The 23rd floor contained squash courts with adjoining locker and shower rooms. The 21st floor, which housed Standard Oil successor Socony's board room, covered and contained a double-height ceiling with relief panels; a limestone fireplace; and oak wainscoting. The building contains a basement deep, as well as a sub-basement deep. All of 26 Broadway's mechanical equipment is located in the sub-basement.  History  Context = The site of the Standard Oil Building was occupied by Dutch houses after the colony of New Amsterdam was founded in the 17th century. In the late 18th century, 26 Broadway was the home address of Alexander Hamilton, his wife Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, and their family.From Alexander Hamilton to Philip Schuyler, 22 March 1801 . Founders Online. retrieved December 1, 2016. Hamilton occupied the house after resigning his position as United States Secretary of the Treasury. According to a 1786 directory, rum was also sold from the address in the late 18th century. Starting in the early 19th century, when New York City became a nationally prominent commercial hub, many firms chose to build their headquarters in Lower Manhattan, renting the unused space to subsidiaries or other companies. Corporations sought addresses in the Financial District as status symbols. Furthermore, many companies built their original headquarters in the 19th century and replaced these with larger structures in the early 20th century. = Initial structure = The brick facade of the original structure (right) can still be seen on New Street, next to the limestone facade of the expanded building (left). Standard Oil Trust moved its headquarters to New York City from Cleveland, Ohio, in 1870. By 1884, the company had acquired lots at 24-28 Broadway near Bowling Green, and had started erecting a headquarters building at the site. The Standard Oil Building, opened in 1885, was designed by architect Francis H. Kimball as a 9- or 10-story, building that extended between Broadway to the west and New Street to the east. It was designed by Ebenezer L. Roberts with a Renaissance Revival granite facade. In 1895, six stories were added and a annex was erected on 26 Broadway's north side; the extension was designed by Kimball & Thompson and continued the original Renaissance Revival design. A 1910 photograph showed that 26 Broadway was initially flanked by other buildings, and was 16 stories high. Initially, all of Standard Oil's 40 operations were controlled from 26 Broadway. So important was the building's role, The New York Times said that \\"Twenty-six Broadway was once to oil what 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is to politics.\\" By 1890, Standard Oil controlled 88 percent of the refined oil flows in the United States. In an attempt to avoid public scrutiny, in 1899 Standard Oil was reorganized as the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, a holding company based at 26 Broadway. This did not resolve the monopoly concerns: The New York Times in 1906 said that \\"every cent of [Standard Oil's subsidiaries] made found its way to 26 Broadway\\". When Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States was decided in May 1911, Standard Oil was required to be broken up into several smaller firms. As a result of the decision, several subdivisions were forced to move, including Tenant Corn Refining Products Company and U.S. Steel. By December 1911, half of the company's divisions were still housed at 26 Broadway. The building ultimately served as the headquarters of the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony, later Mobil) once the split was completed. = Expansion = After World War I, Standard Oil president Walter C. Teagle decided to greatly expand the structure by buying the neighboring buildings on the block. At the time, the area around Bowling Green was quickly developing into a shipping center within Lower Manhattan. To the north of the original Standard Oil Building was the 17-story Hudson Building, followed by a 21-story office building at 36-42 Broadway. Socony was reported to have purchased the latter in February 1920, paying $6 million and beating out two other bidders for the property. The next month, the company acquired or leased all four structures that stood between the existing building and Beaver Street to the south. According to The New York Times, the brokers valued the $30 million transaction as \\"probably the largest real estate transaction ever closed in the city\\". After the acquisitions were complete, Socony had a total frontage of facing Broadway, not all of which were to be part of the headquarters' expansion. This frontage was truncated soon after, as Socony sold the Arcade at 44-50 Broadway in March 1920. alt= In August 1920, Carrère and Hastings filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings for enlarging 26 Broadway to 24 stories. Thomas Hastings—the only living partner of Carrère and Hastings, who had helped design the Cunard Building across the street—was chosen as lead architect. Shreve, Lamb & Blake were named as the associated architects. Further details of 26 Broadway's major expansion were publicly announced in March 1921. The building was to cost $5 million and rise , covering a lot of , with a total floor area of , thus becoming one of Lower Manhattan's \\"largest structures\\". The project included replacement of the old building's Broadway facade. Construction was complicated by the Childs Restaurants location's decision to hold out until its lease expired; the difficulty of evicting the four buildings' occupants; and a dearth of available office space in the neighborhood. As a result, the expansion was to be undertaken in several phases, and the plans were changed in 1921 to allow for a lighted courtyard around the location of the restaurant. The existing buildings on the site were underpinned so that existing tenants could remain until construction started on these respective sections. Work started in 1921 at the southeastern corner of the site, at Beaver and New Streets, on the site of the Lisbon Building. The section at the southwestern corner, the former Produce Exchange at Broadway and Beaver Street, began two years later. The original building's brick facade on Broadway was replaced in 1924–1925, but the facade along New Street was kept in place. The last section of the site to be built was the lot occupied by Childs Restaurants, which was not developed until 1928, after the restaurant's lease had run out. = Later years = 26 Broadway was known as the \\"Rockefeller address\\" because the offices of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and John Sr. were located in the building. After the construction of Rockefeller Center, the offices of both Rockefellers moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1933. The same year, Standard Oil of New Jersey (by that time, also known phonetically as Esso) announced its intention to move as well, in order to consolidate its operations at Rockefeller Center. Ultimately, Esso moved some of its operations in 1933, but retained other offices at 26 Broadway until 1946, when these offices moved to 75 Rockefeller Plaza. National Fuel Gas also moved to Rockefeller Center in 1936. Socony, which had merged in 1931 with Vacuum Oil to form Socony-Vacuum, retained its headquarters in 26 Broadway. The structure thus was renamed the Socony-Vacuum Building in 1950. Socony- Vacuum moved to 150 East 42nd Street in 1954 and sold 26 Broadway two years later. Afterward, the Koeppel family purchased the building. Standard & Poor's leased spaces at 25 and 26 Broadway starting in the late 1970s. The Museum of American Finance (MOAF) was founded in the building in 1988, initially occupying of space on the ground floor. Alfred J. Koeppel's Independence Partners purchased the building for $16 million the following year. In 1995, 26 Broadway and several other buildings on Bowling Green were formally designated as New York City landmarks. S&P; started leasing space at nearby 55 Water Street in 1997, vacating its former quarters at 25 and 26 Broadway. Standard & Poor's moved out in late 1999, and the vacant space was completely filled by the following April. The ownership of the building and the underlying plots remained separate until 2007, when the Chetrit Group bought the building and two of the three lots underneath for $225 million. Chetrit bought the remaining leasehold for $34.93 million in 2010; the lease had been held by the estate of Elmer Ellsworth Smathers, who had signed a 99-year lease in 1920. , 26 Broadway is owned by Broadway 26 Waterview, while Chetrit Group is landlord for many of the interior spaces, and Newmark Group is the landlord's broker. The subsequent years also saw the departure or closure of several tenants. The MOAF opened a gallery at the building's 24 Broadway entrance in 1992, which was moved to the 28 Broadway entrance in 1996, and the entire museum finally relocated to 48 Wall Street in 2006. The Sports Museum of America was founded in the building in 2008. The Sports Museum closed in 2009 due to low patronage, since 95% of New York City residents were unaware of its existence. Starting in 2008, the PS 234 elementary school was supposed to have used 26 Broadway to alleviate classroom overcrowding at its main campus, but 26 Broadway was subsequently deemed \\"not appropriate for kindergartners\\" because the students would have to use elevators to reach the proposed classroom space.

The Lower Manhattan Community School, a middle school, serves grades 6-8. A second middle school, the New York City Charter School of the Arts, also serves grades 6-8 and moved into the building in 2018. A third, the Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women, is a high school serving grades 9-12, which had been founded in 2005. In addition, the New York City School Construction Authority leases the fourth through sixth floors.  Critical reception  A writer for The New York Times praised the building plans in 1922, saying that the expanded building would be a \\"landmark in the city skyline\\". As the building was completed, architectural critics praised the design of 26 Broadway as having more emphasis on its form instead of the articulation of windows and other details. The architect C.H. Blackall, for instance, stated that the building's specialty was in its massing, with the windows and other details as \\"incidents\\". The British architect Charles Herbert Reilly said that \\"the combination possible of stepped building and tower\\", as used in 26 Broadway, could contribute to a form \\"more interesting even than that of the Woolworth Building\\".

Skin growths such as benign tumors and basal cell carcinoma can arise in sebaceous nevi, usually in adulthood. Rarely, sebaceous nevi can give rise to sebaceous carcinoma. However, the rate of such malignancies is now known to be less than had been estimated. For this reason, excision is no longer automatically recommended.

Balfour approach to col off to the left Mt. Balfour from Ski Louise ski resort Mount Balfour seen from Iceline Trail Mount Balfour is a mountain located on the Continental Divide, part of the border between British Columbia and Alberta, in the Waputik Range in the Park Ranges of the Canadian Rockies.It is the 71st highest peak in Alberta and the 113th highest in British Columbia; it is also the 52nd most prominent in Alberta. The mountain was named by James Hector in 1859 after Professor John Hutton Balfour, a Scottish botanist and instructor at the University of Edinburgh where Hector had studied.  Climbing History  Early attempts to climb the mountain were made from Niles Pass via Sherbrooke Lake. The first ascent was made on August 18, 1898 by C.L. Noyes, C.S. Thompson, G.M. Weed; members of the Appalachian Mountain Club. The party started their ascent from Hector Lake which they had reached by crossing Dolomite Pass to Bow Lake and then continuing south. C.E. Fay had also attempted the mountain in 1898 via the Sherbrooke Lake/Niles Pass approach but were eventually turned back by poor weather and inexperience. Parties from the ACC completed ascents of Balfour in 1909 via Sherbrooke Lake, Niles Pass, Daly Glacier and then summitting via the SE arête. Geology Mount Balfour is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Balfour is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Along with the underbanked, they may rely on alternative financial services for their financial needs, where these are available. Causes Some reasons a person might not have a bank account include: * Lack of access via a nearby bank branch or mobile phone * Minimum balance fees * Distrust of the banking system * No access to government-issued ID, which is required to open a bank account The unbanked in the United States The unbanked are described by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as those adults without an account at a bank or other financial institution and are considered to be outside the mainstream for one reason or another. The Federal Reserve estimated there are 55 million unbanked or underbanked adult Americans in 2018, which account for 22 percent of U.S. households. One report found the nationwide rates to be 7.7% unbanked and 17.9% underbanked, with the most unbanked state Mississippi, at 16.4%. Places where over 20% of residents have no bank accounts include Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; Laredo, Texas; Newark, New Jersey; Hialeah, Florida; Hidalgo County, Texas; The Bronx; and Cameron County, Texas. Many counties with fewer than 100,000 residents had even higher rates, including Starr County, Texas, at 32.7%. Some census tracts in Savannah, Georgia; Cleveland, Ohio; Nashville, Tennessee; and Atlanta, Georgia had over 40% unbanked residents. The majority of the unbanked and underbanked are American-born while a growing number are immigrants where the two groups have low income as a commonality and lack the minimum balance to open checking and savings accounts. According to Congressman Hinojosa, half of the unbanked had a bank account previously but are choosing to not have an account and opting to using the services of check cashers and payday lenders instead. Research has shown that immigrants who have experienced a banking crisis in their countries of origin are significantly less likely to have bank accounts in the U.S.,Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Bank Crises and Investor Confidence, November 2008 and researchers also found that lower rates of financial market participation tend to persist even for immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for several years.\\"Immigrant-Native Differences in Financial Market Participation\\", Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, December 2006 Attributes that contribute to these decisions, however, vary for each racial/ethnic group.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, The Importance of Check- Cashing Businesses to the Unbanked: Racial/Ethnic Differences, August 2003 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger started the Bank on California initiative to help the unbanked in 2008. Previously, in 2001, a financial education curriculum called Money Smart was launched by the FDIC to help the financially unsavvy. Prior to becoming the FDIC chair in 2006, Sheila Bair ran a research project at for the Inter-American Development Bank at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to discover ways to help unbanked Latin American immigrants use the U.S. banking system. She found that the primary reason recent Latino immigrants often do not use banks to remit money is because they are undocumented. Around the same time, the Treasury Department put in place Section 326 regulations that allow banks and credit unions to accept identification from foreign governments at their own discretion. Banks like Mitchell Bank in Milwaukee have taken up the Treasury Department on their relaxing of identification standards. They have even \\"offered pamphlets on how to apply for a Wisconsin state ID and driver's license, and invited the Mexican consulate in Chicago to visit with a mobile unit that issues 'matricula' cards\\".

Described by John Isaac Briquet in 1896, it is not very well known in horticulture, with only a few gardeners growing it since the 1990s. It is becoming more well known in the United States, France, England, and Italy because it is easy to grow and makes a very attractive garden plant.

He was a cousin of the much more famous traitor Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606–1664). He is known in the annals of whaling as the man who drove the French out of Spitsbergen. Ulfeldt later fought and died in the Torstenson War. Family Ulfeldt was the son of Council of State member and High Admiral (Rigsadmiral) Mogens Ulfeldt (1569-1616) and Anne Christensdatter Lange (Munk). He was the grandson of Jacob Ulfeldt (1535–1593), who served as a member of the privy council. He had a sister and at least two brothers: Anne Mogensen Ulfeldt (1598-1655), Jacob Mogensen Ulfeldt (c.1600–c.1670) and Christian Mogensen Ulfeldt. He was married to Else Andersdatter Thot (d. 1652), widow of Hans Hansen Lindenov (d. 1620). Selsø Manor (Roskilde) Tapdrup Church (Viborg) Career In 1624, King Christian IV, wrote to Ulfeldt and his brothers, encouraging them to travel abroad. In order to cover travel expenses, they had to sell their father's estate Selsø at Roskilde. In 1631, Ulfeldt sold a manor in Bonderup; two years later he pledged his mother's estates at Tvis and Krogsdal. On July 9, in the same year he sold the latter estates, he was commissioned as a ship's captain. In July 1634 he was made Admiral of the Elbe, and was ordered to seize any Hamburg ships he came across between Øresund and Helgoland. In October he was ordered to remain on the Elbe through the winter with Nældebladet and Skiens Galej, while Hummeren, Havhesten and Kronegalej were to return to Copenhagen. In 1635 he spent a month recruiting seamen. In March 1637 Ulfeldt received orders to convoy the Danish whaling fleet to Spitsbergen in the man-of-war De To Løver Dalgård (1962) says it was De To Løver, while Lind (1889) says it was De Tre Løver. as well as to reassert Christian IV's claim of sovereignty over the land. Ulfeldt, with support from the fleet, seized some 600 barrels of whale oil and 60 barrels of baleen from the French ships under Petrissans de Larralde anchored in Hamburgbukta before driving them out of their harbor. In July of the same year he also met a French ship on the open sea at 78° N, the Fleur of Ciboure, under Dominique Daguerre, which had been hunting whales between 73° and 76° N. Ulfeldt brought it to Kobbefjorden, where about 400 barrels of blubber and 100 quintals of baleen were confiscated.Du Pasquier (2000), p. 82, p. 323. The following spring he again received orders to convoy the fleet, this time with three ships: De Tre Løver, Lammet, and Stokfisken. He again seized the French ships' goods (559 casks of oil and over 9,000 lbs of baleen) and drove them out of Port Louis, which the Danes renamed Ulfeldts Bay in his honor.Brica (1887), p. 17; Dalgård (1962), p. 223; and Lind (1889), p. 281. His actions led the French to temporarily abandon Hamburgbukta. Ulfeldt also detained two Dutch ships, the Sanct Pieter, under Claes Melchiorsz, and the Eenhoorn, under Adriaen Ollebrantsz, for over a month in Copenhagen Bay, but they were later released after a brief battle between Ulfeldt and the rest of the Dutch whaling fleet. The Dutch complained bitterly against this treatment. Three years of negotiations followed, resulting in the two countries agreeing to cease hostilities in Spitsbergen. Ulfeldt's cruises were the last in a two- and-a-half decade long struggle between European whalers there. In May 1640 he was appointed captain of Lindormen, and on August 5 was made Admiral of the former ship and Lammet, which were to sail to England with envoys. At Flækkerø (present-day Flekkerøya, an island off Kristiansand) Lammet struck a rock; later a storm separated the two ships for three days and nights. Ulfeldt was able to ride it out anchored off the English coast. He received a pay raise of 50 dalers later the same month. During 1641, from April 17 to September 13, Ulfeldt was at sea. At the Battle of Colberger Heide during July 1, 1644 (in which King Christian IV suffered the lose of an eye) Ulfeldt served aboard De Tre Kroner under Admiral Pros Mund as Vice-admiral of the squadron. He again served under Admiral Pros Mund in the Battle of Fehmarn off Lolland (October 13, 1644) as Rear-admiral aboard Stormarn. During the battle his ship ran aground. Ulfeldt was killed while defending it against capture by the Swedish forces. He was buried at Tapdrup Church (Tapdrup kirke) in Viborg.

In addition, he was one of the first U.S. artists to be assigned to camouflage in World War I. Early life Berry was born and raised in New Gloucester, Maine, where his father was a dairy farmer. In 1905, reluctant to follow a farming career, he enrolled at the University of Michigan, with the intention of becoming a marine engineer. After completing his undergraduate work, he moved back to New England, where he worked as a mechanical draftsman for an engineering firm in Massachusetts. Panama Canal In 1910, Berry joined an architectural firm in Portland, Oregon, and was sent to Panama to participate in the construction of the Panama Canal. After a year, however, he contracted malaria and was sent back to the United States to recuperate. While in the U.S., he began to take art classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Subsequently, when Berry was sent back to Panama as an inspector of construction, government officials were so impressed by his artistic abilities that they commissioned him instead to paint a series of large murals of the Canal's construction for the walls of the administrative building. Camouflage When Berry returned to the U.S. in 1915, he moved to New York City, where he earned his living as a commercial artist. Soon after, he married, and he and his wife raised a son. In 1917, when the U.S. entered World War I, he volunteered for service. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant, and assigned to camouflage. According to Rickard (1942, p. 190), Berry was one of the first seven officers (nearly all of whom were either artists or architects) attached to the American Camouflage Corps, along with Homer Saint-Gaudens, Evarts Tracy, Aymar Embury, Andre Smith, Lawrence Hitt and Victor White. In December 1918, he and his unit were shipped to France (Behrens 2009), where they spent the remainder of the war. Between the wars After World War I, Berry settled in Chicago, where he worked as a designer of installations and interiors for office buildings. He also met his second wife, Janet Laura Scott, a successful illustrator, who later designed Raggedy Andy dolls and books about the Bobbsey Twins. During the Depression, Berry and his wife left Chicago and moved back to New England, where they bought a house in Wiscasset, Maine. Their home became a meeting place for craftsmen and artists of the region. Meanwhile, with World War II on the horizon, the Bath Iron Works commissioned Berry to document (through a series of paintings) their construction of fighting ships for the U.S. Navy. These oil paintings depict the shipyard in full production, at a time when the phrase “the delivery of a destroyer every other Friday” was a common slogan (Hammond). Artistic life The Berrys sold their house in Wiscasset following World War II. They bought a home in Rockport, Maine, as well as an old three-story brick building on Main Street (just a short walk from their home), which served as Berry's studio for the rest of his life. It was there, equipped with a 19th-Century printing press, that Berry perfected his printmaking skills, in the process of which he made use of wood engraving, woodcut and linoleum block. Woodcut is a relief printing process in which carved raised shapes of wood are inked and then printed on paper. Berry would sometimes carve multiple wood blocks for a single print, each block being inked with a different color, such as a beige, blue, orange and so on. Realizing the great demand for some of his prints, he sometimes produced large editions, or returned to reprint the editions. Other works, in less demand, were never reprinted after the first run. Berry's work is sometimes said to fall within three distinct periods: His early linocuts and oil paintings are experimental, and reflect the changing artistic trends of the early 1900s. In the era of the Depression, he turned to the more affordable medium of the woodblock, which eventually evolved into the iconic style of his wood engravings. Finally, around 1973, his interests shifted to Jay Hambidge's theory of dynamic symmetry, a system of proportion and natural design that promoted the use of geometry in artistic compositions. In 1978, at age 90, Berry died in a Rockport hospital. He had led an active, fruitful life, and thereby left the people of Maine with a body of work “created with consummate skill and fidelity to their subjects” (Hammond).

Nymindegab Museum is a local history and art museum located at Nymindegab in Varde Municipality, Denmark. It is operated by Varde Museum (Vardemuseerne) together with the small museum at the former Nymindegab Rescue Station. History The museum includes the small house of the family of a local carpenter. The dwelling is from the 1930s, and includes a reconstruction of a buried vegetable garden. In earlier times one dug a large hole in the vegetable garden, which then was partially filled up with humic mulch. In this way the crop yield was sheltered, and the mulch was not blown away. In addition, the museum is about to restore an antique sawmill. The museum contains an archeological collection with finds from the excavation at Lønne including textile remnants and burial gifts. From Viking times one can find, among other things, posts from a bridge in Nybro from the year 761. From more recent times there are exhibitions on navigation, fishing, wrecks and rescuing, and from the very latest times, tourism on the west coast. The museum does not refer to itself as an art museum, but also illustrates the story with approx. 200 paintings. The museum's art collection includes a wide range of images from local artists and artist associated with the region including: Johannes Larsen (1867–1961), Carl Trier Aagaard (1890–1961), Laurits Tuxen (1853–1927) and Christen Lyngbo (1871-1968).

The manga was released by Tokyopop on August 14, 2007. The magazine, New York, offered an exclusive preview of Undertown on its online-only comics page. The manga gets syndicated in over 50 newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Denver Post, Vancouver Sun and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. It was dropped from Los Angeles Times Sunday pages on July 5, 2009. Plot 10-year-old Sama is a shy young boy who is something of a crybaby, as his father apparently constantly reminds him. Sama cries so often that the tears stain his cheeks, but he finds comfort in his teddy bear, Eddie. Sama's father is hospitalized after a heart attack, and given only a month to live. A stranger at the hospital tells Sama that he can find a cure for his father, the Sugar Stone, a magical healing item, but it is located in the mysterious realm of Undertown. All Sama need do is crawl under his bed, close his eyes, and countdown from ten to one. When his father’s condition turns worse, Sama takes a chance and does as the stranger told him. He wakes up in a strange place where anthropomorphized animals and insects do battle for the one thing that is most valuable in Undertown: sugar. Sama gets an even bigger surprise when his teddy bear, Eddie suddenly comes to life. With the help of a rabbit named B.W., a porcupine name Joey P.P., and a reticent penguin named Broom, Sama takes on The Cloud, the leader of the Insect Insurgents, to find the Sugar Stone. In a place called the Sand Sea, they find lizards who choose to fight alongside them but not join their group. But mystery and secret histories swirl around the boy and his teddy bear, and before Sama can save his father, he’ll have to discover them.  Characters  * Sama: A young boy at age ten who is lonely and has only one friend. His teddy bear Eddie is from somewhere where teddy bears are made and they can move and talk. * Eddie: He is Sama's teddy bear and Sama's only friend. Eddie lost his memory when he was sent up to Sama's world, so now he wants to find the Teddy Bear Bell. In the first volume, he finds it, and it makes Eddie remember everything about his past, including what happened to the other Teddy bears.

For the English Historian, see James Williamson (historian) James A. Williamson (February 8, 1829 – September 7, 1902) was a politician and lawyer who served in the Union army during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of brigadier general. He received the Medal of Honor for his actions at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou. Biography Williamson was born in Columbia, Kentucky in 1829. When he was fifteen years old his family moved to Iowa, where he worked as a farmer, before studying law and being admitted to the bar. In the years prior to the Civil War he served as the chairman of the Iowa State Democratic Committee. When the Civil War began Williamson volunteered in the 4th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Serving as a first lieutenant he fought at the battle of Pea Ridge where he was wounded on the first day of fighting there. On March 4, 1862 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and then on July 21, 1862 to colonel of the 4th Iowa. Colonel Williamson and his regiment spent the fall of 1862 on garrison duty at Helena, Arkansas. In December Williamson was part of William T. Sherman's force which attacked the Confederate forces at the Battle of Chickasaw Bluffs. Williamson was again wounded and for his services here was eventually awarded the Medal of Honor in 1895. Williamson recovered in time to take part in the Vicksburg Campaign and the following Siege of Vicksburg. After the fall of the city, he assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, XV Corps until September, 1863 then commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, XV Corps at the Battle of Chattanooga. Williamson's division, commanded by Peter J. Osterhaus was temporarily attached to the forces under Joseph Hooker and took part in the Battle of Lookout Mountain. The division was returned to the Army of the Tennessee and Williamson led the 2nd Brigade during the Atlanta Campaign. At the Battle of Jonesborough he was wounded in the hand. On December 19, 1864 he received a brevet promotion to brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers, on January 13, 1865 a full promotion to brigadier general and on March 13, 1865 a brevet promotion to major general of volunteers. Briefly during the summer of 1865 he commanded the District of St. Louis and was mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, but was on an inspection tour of army posts in the West and did not find out until he returned in October 1865. In 1864 Williamson had been elected chairman of the Iowa delegation to the National Republican Convention in Baltimore, but did not attend due to duty to the army. After the War he resumed his law practice in Iowa. He served as Commissioner of the General Land Office from 1876 to 1881. During this time he served as chairman of the Public Land Commission, which was created by Congress in 1879. He later became President of the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad. He was in Jamestown, Rhode Island when he died on September 7, 1902. Medal of Honor citation 70px Rank and Organization: Colonel, 4th Iowa Infantry.

At that time, it was Europe's largest. The park was closed for World War I but reopened after Armistice. Luna Park closed for the last time in October 1933.Spiegel einestages Article and photos of Luna Park from Spiegel Online HistoryOrigin= Around 1900 the businessman Saeger operated the Wirtshaus (guest house) am Halensee near the popular outdoor swimming pool on the east shore of Halensee Lake. At that time, the shopping district Kurfürstendamm was a forest path where on Sundays families took carriages from the nearby Grunewald train station (now Halensee) and drove in the Grunewald forest. Here rest breaks were made and there was a motto: \\"Families can make coffee here.\\" On the grounds of the inn there was already a fairground with carousel, shooting dice and stalls, and a water slide, where a similar pontoon-like barge rolled down the mountain into the lake. =Opening and Heyday= Luna Park Water Slide, 1904 On 14 May 1909 the gourmet August Aschinger together with the former chef at the Kempinski Hotel, Bernd Hoffmann, opened the terraces at Halensee, which were renamed that year Luna Park. It was a modern fairy-tale palace, with magnificent towers and a large staircase down to the lake. Swivel House (1923) The park attractions included all the typical fairground attractions of the time, like a water slide that ended in the lake. It had as a special feature a water chute, which the Berliners called the \\"tart aquarium\\" because the ladies in the newest bathing attire presented themselves to the sitting gentlemen on the rim. Other attractions were a loose staircase (Shimmy-Treppe) with a fan at the end that hoisted the skirts of the ladies, as well as a mountain train or a hippodrome. Following the example of Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, an amusement park was established, offering sensations, adventures, and dangers, as well as the illusion of the big wide world and the experience of the seemingly limitless possibilities of technology. Luna Park offered anthropological human shows (\\"Völkerschauen\\"); an early escalator; a large, nightly fireworks display; theater, revues, jazz, and cabaret; dance tournaments, and boxing matches. In 1926 the young Max Schmeling won his first title fight here. The restaurants had a capacity of 16,000 seats. There was a Bavarian-themed village where beer flowed in streams and the Luna Palace for more the lofty clientele. In its early years, the park counted 50,000 visitors a day and on weekends substantially more. As early as 1910, the millionth visitor was received. =Decline= Berlin-Halensee, Lunapark, 1935, after the park had closed. During the first World War and in the following period of hyperinflation in Weimar Germany, visitor numbers declined and the physical plant was in desolate condition. On May 9, 1929, the amusement park reopened after a major renovation. It succeeded; however, it did not attain its former grandeur. =The End= In October 1933 the amusement park had to permanently close, and in 1934 the entire complex was demolished. The puppeteer Alfredo Bannenberg, being chased by Nazis, used the closed facility as a hideout for a short time. The Nazis considered the park to be an eyesore. Soon it was found to be in the path of the required Halenseestraße, which was opened for the 1936 Summer Olympics to create a fast link between the Olympic Stadium, the Deutschlandhalle, the Berliner Funkturm, and southern venues.

He authored Conchologia indica with William Theobald which was a treatise on the shells of British India. The plates were drawn and lithographed by George Brettingham Sowerby the younger, who was well known for writing and illustrating excellent works of natural history, especially conchological works. Sowerby became the best illustrator of conchological works of his time, illustrating such classics as Reeve's monumental twenty-volume Conchologia Iconica. Sylvanus Hanley inherited a fortune, which enabled him to devote a lifetime to conchology. He was especially interested in the bivalves, on which he was a leading authority. He published over 40 books and scientific papers, and described over 200 new species. Hanley collected molluscs extensively; most of his collections are today held at Leeds City Museum in Yorkshire, England. Hanley collected over a period of 60 years, and corresponded frequently with many other naturalists of his time. He acquired several specimens of Unio, now extinct, for Isaac Lea. Several syntypes were collected by him for other leading contemporary biologists, including Arthur Adams, W.H. Dall, Henry B. Guppy, Richard Brinsley Hinds, Jeffries, Leath, Sven Ludvig Lovén, George Montagu, William Harper Pease, Rodolfo Amando Philippi and Tryon Reakirt.

It grows in a rosette and is distinguished from the other species in section Erythrorhiza by its many-flowered cymose inflorescences with up to 50 individual flowers. D. erythrorhiza was first described by John Lindley in his 1839 publication A sketch of the vegetation of the Swan River Colony. In 1992, N. G. Marchant and Allen Lowrie described three new subspecies, thus also creating the autonym D. erythrorhiza subsp. erythrorhiza.Marchant, N. and A. Lowrie. 1992. New names and new combinations in 34 taxa of Western Australian tuberous and pygmy Drosera. Kew Bulletin, 47(2): 315-328. The subspecies were separated from this variable species mostly by leaf morphology and distribution.Rice, Barry. 2008. The tuberous rosetted Drosera. The Carnivorous Plant FAQ v. 11.5. Accessed online: 21 February 2009. D. erythrorhiza subsp. collina is named for its native hilly habitat and typically has more leaves of various shapes within the same rosette. D. erythrorhiza subsp. erythrorhiza has fewer, wider leaves as compared to D. erythrorhiza subsp. magna, which has larger (wider) leaves and frequently has more of them. Finally, D. erythrorhiza subsp. squamosa was originally described by George Bentham in 1864 at the species rank as Drosera squamosa. Marchant and Lowrie reduced it to the subspecies rank under D. erythrorhiza. Subspecies squamosa differs from subsp. erythrorhiza in the appearance of red leaf margins caused by the dense red tentacles. Earlier, in his 1906 taxonomic monograph of the Droseraceae, Ludwig Diels introduced a new variety, D. erythrorhiza var. imbecilla.Diels, L. 1906. Droseraceae In Engler, A. Das Pflanzenreich. IV. 112. A competing taxonomy was developed and introduced by Jindřich Chrtek and Zdeňka Slavíková in 1999 where the authors argue for the reclassification of the tuberous Drosera (encompassing all of Drosera subgenus Ergaleium) into Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's 1844 genus Sondera that had been reduced to a synonym of Drosera. In doing so, Chrtek and Slavíková elevated Marchant and Lowrie's subspecies and established the following species: Sondera collina, S. erythrorhiza, S. magna, and S. squamosa.Chrtek, J. and Z. Slavíková. 1999. Genera and families of the Droserales order. Novit. Bot. Univ. Carol. 13: 39-46. This reclassification, however, is not widely followed.

Although it was originally designed as a Schartenbrecher (\\"bunker buster\\") for use against the French Maginot Line defences,Jentz, p. 32 following the defeat of France it was evaluated for use as a tank destroyer on the Eastern Front.  Development  It was intended to be used against bunkers at ranges beyond which the bunker could return fire. Development by Krupp began in 1939. With the conquest of France complete the design was without a purpose so it was suggested that it be used as a heavy tank destroyer. Two prototypes were ordered, completed in January 1941 and demonstrated in front of Hitler on 31 March 1941. If troop trials were successful it was estimated that series production could begin in early 1942.Jentz, p. 40  Description  The 10.5 cm K (gp. Sfl.) was built on a heavily modified Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. E chassis with the turret removed and an open-topped superstructure added to house the main gun. The forward glacis plate was of face-hardened armour at 15° from the vertical while the sides were thick. The vehicle's most curious feature were armored compartments provided in the rear of the vehicle to protect the loaders against attack from aircraft. Similarly the ammunition bins holding 26 rounds for the main gun had thin armored covers on top. Another oddity was the fake driver's compartment on the right side of the vehicle that matched the real one projecting forward from the front superstructure on the left. Although the main gun was intended to engage enemy armoured fighting vehicles it could only traverse 8° to the left and right, depress 15° and elevate 10°. A muzzle brake was fitted to reduce recoil forces and a travel lock was fitted on the front deck to secure the gun during movement. For self-defense the crew carried three 9 mm machine pistols with 576 rounds of ammunition. A Selbstfahrlafetten-Zielfernrohr (Sfl. Z.F.) 1 sight was used by the gunner, a binocular Turmspähfernrohr (T.S.F.) periscope was fitted for use by the commander, and each loader was provided with a binocular Scherenfernrohr on a pivoting arm. Throughout most of its development it was known as 10 cm K. (Pz. Sfl. IVa), but was redesignated 10.5 cm K (gp. Sfl.) on 13 August 1941, and was also colloquially known as Dicker Max (\\"Thick\\" or \\"Fat\\" Max). In the prototype vehicles the V-12 Maybach HL120 engine of the Panzer IV was replaced by a lighter Inline-6 Maybach HL66P engine. Production vehicles probably would have used the suspension and running gear of the Panzerkampfwagen III as it offered increased maneuverability due to a shorter length of track in contact with the ground, less rolling resistance, softer springs and greater deflection of the suspension.Jentz, pp. 35-6  Combat history  For combat trials the two prototypes were assigned to Panzerjäger Abteilung (\\"Anti-tank Battalion\\") 521 during the invasion of the Soviet Union. One accidentally caught fire and was completely destroyed by the detonation of its ammunition, but the other fought successfully until the end of 1941. It was rebuilt by Krupp during the first half of 1942 and returned to the 521st in time to participate in Case Blue, the 1942 summer offensive in Russia. It was not reported operational in reports made by the battalion in November–December 1942.Jentz, pp. 40-44 A report of 26 July 1941 commented on the vehicle: \\"This Sfl. (self-propelled vehicle) is not sufficiently maneuverable for employment in a Vorausabteilung (lead unit). The limited traverse makes it necessary to turn the entire vehicle to aim at targets. This takes considerable time when done repeatedly, especially off-road because of the heavy vehicle and weak engine. In addition, because of its armor layout - only thick in the front and 50 mm lower in the back - it was built for frontal use. The vehicle can be shot into from the side and rear. Employment in a Vorausabteilung requires the ability to quickly engage targets in every direction. [...] The gun has proven itself capable of supporting an infantry attack from an open firing position by direct fire as in the Szczarar crossing. It is not possible to observe our own shots because of large dust clouds raised in front of the gun. The Sfl. must alternatively observe each other's fire or an observation post must be established off to one side, manned by a Richtkreis-Uffiz. (gunner) familiar with the crew. Because of its size, lack of mobility, and large dust cloud raised when firing, in the future the Sfl. will only shoot Sprenggranaten (HE) by indirect fire. [...] Up to now, the Sfl. has been employed in its specialized tasks - engaging concrete bunkers by direct fire and engaging heavy tanks in coordination with other Panzerabwehrwaffen (anti-tank weapons). Its high penetration ability appears to be suitable for this. [...] No specific problems have occurred with the engine or transmission. The steering brakes are overstressed. Bolts in the steering slide of one steering brake have torn out three times and the brake bands have had to be changed twice because the rivets were over-heated.\\"quoted in Jentz, pp. 42-3 NotesReferences * Chamberlain, Peter, and Hilary L.

Biography Garside was born in Middletown, Connecticut and his studies at Cornell University were interrupted by America's entry into World War I. He served as a Private in the United States Marine Corps. Garside earned a bachelor's degree in history and politics at Princeton University before attending Cornell Law School, from which he graduated in 1923. He was admitted to the New York State bar and practiced law at Choate, Larocque, and Mitchell, making partner in 1927. He was an active Young Republican, serving as vice president of The New York Young Republican Club. In 1934, Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed him to a vacant Municipal Court justiceship, a position to which he was subsequently elected and served for ten years, though he resigned after two years to become a partner in his own law firm. He also became a director of the Harsco Corporation. He served as a colonel in the Army's General Staff Corps in World War II and the Joint Army Navy Board for Training Unit Contracts. After the war, he returned to private practice and ran for office against Charles A. Buckley in 1946. In 1947, Thomas E. Dewey tapped him to head the State Commission against Discrimination. He also headed the committee on medical education centers which eventually drove the creation of the Downstate and Upstate Medical Centers. He also helped mediate a violent strike at Bell Aircraft in Buffalo, New York in 1949. Garside was a member of the State University board of trustees when he was tapped to assume the presidency of the SUNY System upon the resignation of his predecessor. At the time, Garside was serving as President of the Associated Hospital Service of New York, which later became New York Blue Cross/Blue Shield, a position he kept and served in until his retirement in 1959.

At its opening in 1913 it was the largest in Germany; it closed after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and reopened for less than a year in 1923. Park Luna Park occupied more than Harald Beckedorf, \\"Geh'n wir in den Luna-Park-Altona\\", , retrieved 9 September 2020. between Augustenburger Straße, Kieler Straße, Memelandallee and Lunapark in the Altona district of Hamburg, which was an independent town at the time of its opening. It was adjacent to the Kaltenkirchen station and near the Emilienstraße and Holsten stations. At that time the largest amusement park in Germany, it was one of a number opened worldwide in the early 20th century which took their name from Luna Park in Coney Island.Olaf Wunder and Gunnar Reuchsel, \\"Mit Achterbahn und Wellenbad Hamburgs untergegangener Freizeit-Park\\", Hamburger Morgenpost, 9 November 2017, . The park included a 'scenic railway'—a roller coaster with mountain landscaping—a cycle-racing track, a swimming pool, a dance hall, and a exhibition hall, in addition to gardens, a pool with fountain, and refreshment pavilions. The buildings were half-timbered, constructed of concrete over staff with a coloured surface sprayed over the concrete. The entrance building was bright red with a tiled roof; the dance hall was modelled on a North German country house, with heavily decorated walls and a thatched roof; the other buildings had red Dutch tile roofs. History The Lunapark-Gesellschaft, incorporated in November 1912 and headed by Hugo Smidt, took a 15-year lease from Altona on two adjacent land parcels, including a flood retention basin, the Diebsteich; the projected opening date was 1 May 1913. The original plan, by Ernst Schmidt & Liedtke, was Baroque in inspiration and highly symmetrical; after delays in construction and problems with building funds, the Altona town architect engaged the Danish architects Juul Brask and to simplify the park design and design the buildings. The park opened on 28 August 1913. It closed a year later after the First World War broke out in August 1914; by 1921, most of the attractions had been dismantled. In spring 1923 the park was reopened by the amusement park entrepreneur , who moved attractions there from his park in Stellingen, which had closed in 1922. Inflation under the Weimar Republic and the resulting widespread poverty seriously affected business by that August, and Haase closed the park and had the buildings demolished. In the late 1920s the site was redeveloped, mostly for athletic grounds. A concrete unemployment office designed by was built in 1926 on the site of the entrance building and is now a city landmark, and a block of flats on Memelandallee, also designed by Oelsner, is also on the former grounds. A street and a children's playground bearing the name Lunapark (located approximately on the site of the bandstand) are the only remaining indications of the park's existence.

The founding head of Agricultural Botany at Massey Agricultural College, he was also an accomplished breeder of azaleas, rhododendrons and lilies. Early life and education Born into a farming family in Waitara in the Taranaki, Yeates attended Stratford District High School, where he won an Entrance Scholarship (later called the University Entrance Scholarship), and then Victoria College (now Victoria University of Wellington, then part of the University of New Zealand) in Wellington. He completed a BSc and then a MSc in Botany with first class honours. He obtained a Jacob Joseph Scholarship. He then completed the first PhD from the University of New ZealandLetter from The Registar to G.W. Yeates, dated 2 August 1982. He was also an active member of the Victoria College Tramping Club, having Yeates Peak and Yeates track in the Tararua Range named after him. He left for Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied chromosomal counts in plants, starting in 1925. He returned to New Zealand in July 1927 and was awarded his Trinity College PhD in 1931, having completed his research in parallel with his teaching commitments at the newly created Massey College (now Massey University, then also part of the University of New Zealand) outside Palmerston North. Academic work His early research was on New Zealand flax/Phormium tenax (Māori: harakeke),Historical Notes About Two International Rhododendron Conference Speakers, Journal of the American Rhododendron Society. which at the time was used extensively as fibre for ropes and cloths. One of the key centres for production was the delta of the Manawatu River, but Yeates travelled extensively looking for quality cultivars which he grew on the Turitea campus. Flax had long been used for textiles (see Māori traditional textiles) and it was correctly guessed that the best cultivars were to be found adjacent to historical sites of textile-making. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused serious damaged the commercial flax industry in New Zealand and it never recovered. Some of the flax worked involved chromosome counting, which he had previously done in his thesis work. The flax Ngaro was found to have 32 rather than the normal 24 chromosomes. Later research involved \\"farm forestry\\", a movement to introduce trees onto farms for the benefit of livestock, pasture and crops and as a source of income. He was the founding head of Agricultural Botany at Massey and this was his core teaching area. In 1954 he, with E. O. Campbell, published Agricultural Botany, a textbook based on this teaching.  Plant breeding  Yeates was a foundation member of the New Zealand Rhododendron Association in 1944 and also its some-time Secretary-Treasurer. He was also crucial in the founding of the national garden of the association (now \\"Heritage Park\\") at Kimbolton (which is close to his home in Palmerston North, but has better soil and climate for rhododendron). He was also active in the introduction and breeding of azaleas, rhododendrons and Lilium hybrids.Maggy Wassilieff.

Nordquist (born November 10, 1981) is a politician from the state of Nebraska in the Midwestern United States. Nordquist represented an Omaha district in the Nebraska Legislature from 2009 to 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Nordquist was born November 10, 1981, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. In 2000, he graduated from high school in Beresford, South Dakota. He attended Creighton University in Omaha, graduating in 2004 with a B.A. in political science. In 2006, he married Shannon C. Riley; the couple produced one child. From 2004 to 2008, Nordquist worked for the Nebraska Legislature, as research analyst and an aide to senator John Synowiecki. From 2008 to 2013, he was employed as an advisor by Building Bright Futures, an Omaha philanthropy that sought to improve academic performance by low-income Omaha children. Nebraska legislature In 2008, Nordquist ran for the Nebraska Legislature from District 7, representing downtown and southern Omaha. The incumbent, Synowiecki, was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term under Nebraska's term-limits law. Nordquist, a member of the Democratic Party, was opposed by Christopher Moles, a Republican law clerk who was then working on a law degree and a master's degree in business administration at Creighton University. In the nonpartisan primary, Nordquist received 1230 of the 1835 votes cast, or 67%. Moles received 605 votes, or 33%. As the top two vote-getters in the primary, both candidates moved on to the November general election. Nordquist won this election with 4961 of the 6726 votes cast, or 73.8%; Moles received 1765 votes, or 26.2%. In 2012, Nordquist sought re-election to the Legislature. He faced two challengers. Christopher Geary, a Republican business owner, had unsuccessfully run for the Nebraska governorship in 2010; he had placed third in a three-way Republican primary, losing to incumbent governor Dave Heineman with 4.8% of the vote to Heineman's 89.9%. Adrian Petrescu, a professor of public policy at the University of Nebraska Omaha, was making his first bid for elective office. In the primary election, Nordquist received 1406 of the 1934 votes cast, or 72.7%. Geary placed second, with 345 votes, or 17.8%; Petrescu received 183 votes, or 9.5%. As the top two vote-getters, Nordquist and Geary moved on to the general election. Nordquist won re-election with 4211 of the 6003 votes cast, or 70.1%; Geary received 1792 votes, or 29.9%. During his tenure in the Legislature, Nordquist served as chair of the Retirement Systems Committee; he also sat on the Appropriations Committee. In 2014, he co-chaired an initiative petition drive that sought to raise the state's minimum wage to $9 per hour; the measure passed in the general election. In 2015, Nordquist resigned from the Legislature in order to become chief of staff for Brad Ashford, who had been elected to represent Nebraska's 2nd District in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republican governor Pete Ricketts appointed Nicole Fox, a Republican, to serve the remainder of the term.  Policies  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals = Nordquist was the lead co-sponsor of a bill which would allow DACA recipients (also known as \\"Dreamers\\") to receive driver's licenses. (DACA recipients are children who were brought to the United States illegally as children but grew up in the United States, and were granted temporary protection from deportation under a program initially introduced by then-President Barack Obama. The state's governor Pete Ricketts initailaly vetoed this measure but the legislature voted 34-10 to override the veto. This ended Nebraska's status as the only state to deny driver's licenses to DACA recipients.> The bill was Legislative Bill (LB) 623. = State minimum wage = Nordquist led a successful initiative to increase the state minimum wage to $9 per hour by 2016. 135,000 Nebraskans signed a petition to put the initiative on the ballot in 2014, which was voted on in the November 2014 election. He also attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the legislature to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers. = LGBT rights = In 2013 and 2015, Nordquist sponsored multiple bills to protect or expand LGBT rights while serving in the legislature. One bill would prevent discrimination in employment and housing by adding sexual and gender identity to the classes protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodation. Another pair of bills would allow same-sex couples to adopt children or become foster parents, overturning a 20-year old policy which only permitted married heterosexual couples to adopt or serve as foster parents. Each time, the bills were eventually tabled due to stiff opposition from the religious lobby.

Some of the documents in the miniature can be identified with specific items in the cartulary.Kosto, 17. Frontispiece. The Liber feudorum maior (or LFM, medieval Latin for \\"great book of fiefs\\"), originally called the Liber domini regis (\\"book of the lord king\\"), is a late twelfth-century illuminated cartulary of the Crown of Aragon. It was compiled by the royal archivist Ramon de Caldes with the help of Guillem de Bassa for Alfonso II, beginning in 1192. It contained 902 documents dating as far back as the tenth century. It is profusely illustrated in a Romanesque style, a rarity for utilitarian documents. The LFM is an indispensable source for the institutional history of the emerging Principality of Catalonia. It is preserved as a file in the Arxiu de la Corona d'Aragó (ACA), Cancelleria reial, Registres no. 1, in Barcelona.Its formal title is Liber I et II feudorum forme majoris. Its reference code is ES.08019.ACA/1.1.1.1.8. It was written in a protogothic book hand. Manuscript history Only 114 of the original 888 folios of the LFM remain, but only ninety-three of the original 902 documents have been completely lost, and thus a near-complete reconstruction of its contents remains possible. The prologue to the document, written by Ramon de Caldes, describes the work as being in duo volumina (two volumes), but its present division dates only from its re-binding in the nineteenth century. Whether the planned second volume was ever bound or even begun cannot be known. The original volumes sustained damage during the French Revolution and the French invasion of Spain, but their indices (one dating back to 1306) survived, as well as most of the parchment charters that were copied in the Liber. Its modern editor, Francisco Miquel Rosell, has reconstructed the order and rubrics of the documents.Kosto, 3. The folios were trimmed, however, eliminating any evidence of their earlier physical states. Two smaller books of fiefs related to the LFM project are also preserved. The Liber feudorum Ceritaniae concentrates on Cerdany and Roussillon and may represent a failed initiative to create regional cartularies modelled on the LFM. The Liber feudorum formae minoris is a continuation of the LFM including documents from the early thirteenth century. Only two other secular cartularies survive from the same period: the Liber instrumentorum memorialium of the Lords of Montpellier and the Liber instrumentorum vicecomitalium of the Trencavels.Kosto, 2. Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona and his wife, Almodis de la Marche, counting out 2,000 ounces of gold coins as payment to William Raymond and Adelaide, count and countess of Cerdanya, in return for their rights over Carcassonne in 1067.Bishko, 40. CompilationDating= The compilation of the LFM was probably related to Alfonso's renewed drive to control the castellans of his domains. In 1178-80 he launched a series of lawsuits for power of access to various castles.Forès was reclaimed in 1178 and Lluçà and Merlès in 1180, both using early eleventh-century documents de suo archivo producta (produced from his archive), cf. Kosto, 4. The LFM was the product of intense research into the archives of the Crown in support of its claims.Bisson 1985, 26. From 1171 to 1177 a review of the comital archives was found necessary for asserting the Alfonso's rights in the County of Carcassonne, which may have inspired archival reform. In 1178, 144 comital charters that had thitherto been in the hands of Ramon de Gironella, the count's vicar in Girona, were handed over to Guillem de Bassa; many of these later appeared in the LFM.The presence of a Hebrew subscription to the transaction (\\"I, Haninai Halevi, saw that Guillem de Bassa received these writings from the hand of Ramon Dironella\\") seems to indicate that the documents had been pledged by Ramon and had not therefore been in the control of the comital chancery before, cf. Kosto, 4. Accepting the prologue at face value, Francisco Miquel Rosell assumed that the work was presented to Alfonso II and that it was therefore completed before the count's death in 1196. Thomas Bisson has argued that the work was presented to Alfonso complete in August 1194 at the same ceremony where Ponç III de Cabrera came to terms with the king.The war between king and vassal had begun with a royal siege of Castelló de Farfanya in 1192. Since Ramon de Caldes's work on the LFM is last recorded in April that year, it is assumed that he pushed himself to complete the work in the following months.Kosto, 4-5. A third line of argument, pursued by Anscari Mundó, sees the LFM as complete by 1192, when the latest of its charters was issued. Three charters from the final four years of Alfonso's reign are contained in the LFM, but in a hand distinct from that of its two main scribes.One of whom was Ramon de Sitges, cf. Bisson 1984, 150. All of these pertain to Ponç de Cabrera, his capitulation and his oath of fealty to Peter II in April 1196. Since the last document would have been added only after Alfonso's death, it is possible that the others were added simultaneously, that the completion of the cartulary was unrelated to Ponç's settlement, and that the work was in the main finished by 1192. Since documents of an earlier date than November 1192 appear to have been inscribed on blank folios after documents from that year, it is probable that 1192 represents the \\"finish\\" date of the original version (or the date of presentation).Kosto, 7-8. It is also possible that the work that had begun as early as 1178 was renewed sometime around 1190-94\\\\. Bisson connects any renewed effort on the part of Ramon de Caldes before his retirement from court in late 1194 with a series of challenges to the authority of Alfonso II.Bisson 1984, 118. In February 1194 Berenguer, Archbishop of Tarragona, was assassinated by Guillem Ramon II de Montcada, which to Bisson indicates the weakness of the Peace and Truce of God at that time and since 1190, when the baronage had first rejected it.Alfonso succeeded in getting it reimposed, just barely, in 1192. According to Lawrence McCrank, the LFM was unfinished at the king's death in 1196 and at Ramon's in 1199. The prologue was written in anticipation and a second volume was never begun, only planned. Both Bisson and Adam Kosto agree that the work was completed in 1192 and presented in 1194, but that it was never a \\"completed\\", rather the \\"closing of the selection of instruments\\" was the \\"beginning of continuous work\\".Kosto, 10, quoting Bisson. [H]is instrumentis ad memoriam revocatis, unusquisque ius suum sortiatur, tum propter eternam magnarum rerum memoriam, ne inter vos et homines vestros, forte oblivionis occasione, aliqua questio vel discordia posset oriri. [W]ith these instruments recalled to mind, each person should receive his due, and that on account of the undying recollection of great matters, no dispute or conflict should arise between you and your men because of forgetfulness. --Ramon de Caldes explaining the function of the LFM in the prologueKosto, 10 and note 36. =Purpose= The LFM was treated by its modern editor, Rosell, as little more than a written record of the aggrandisement of the domain of the counts of Barcelona. Lawrence McCrank connected the beginnings of the cartulary enterprise with the Treaty of Cazola in 1179, by which Alfonso secured recognition of his rights to Valencia by Alfonso VIII of Castile. On this view, Alfonso \\"slowed the Reconquest\\" in order to concentrate on unifying his various realms into a single crown.McCrank, 281-82. Critiquing this view, Kosto points out that while papal bulls and treaties with the military orders regarding Aragon are found at the start of the cartulary, the relative dearth of charters relating to castleholding and landholding in Aragon suggests that the unification of Aragon and Catalonia juridically (i.e. more than symbolically) was not high on the minds of the compilers or their patron.Kosto, 9. The LFM introduced no \\"new principles of feudal organization\\", but it does represent \\"a more abstract notion of comital and royal power\\".Kosto, 14. It has been compared to the Usatges de Barcelona as a failure in \\"practical or bureaucratic terms\\". It is essentially an expression of power, conceived territorially and principally with regards to Catalonia. The cartulary is not a record of the union of Catalonia with Aragon.Kosto, 15: \\"There was a single chancery, but two distinct diplomatic and palaeographical styles\\". Rather, it is a record of a vast new authority including Aragon, parts of Occitania (Carcassonne, Razès, Béziers, and the County of Provence), and all the Catalan counties, including Ausona, Barcelona, Besalú, Cerdanya, Girona, Roussillon, and Pallars Jussà, which were all possessed by Alfonso II, as well as the Empúries and Urgell, which were not. Bisson writes that in the LFM \\"feudal principles, applied to serve administrative [...] needs, remained subordinated to a conception of territorial sovereignty,\\"Quoted in Kosto, 15, who adds that \\"The count-king was no longer first among equals; he was now claiming 'pan-comital' authority.\\" yet he also says that the LFM was \\"exclusively a land book concerned with proprietary or reversionary right [and not] concerned with any systematic effort to strengthen suzerain rights or vassalic obligations.\\"Bisson 1978, 468. Kosto, to an extent, disagrees, arguing that the work is a combination of land book and case book, in which some charters are presented to explain the proper working of the feudal system. The rubrics and section headings are evidence of the ambiguity of Alfonso's position and that of the various regions. While Aragon is termed a regnum (kingdom, realm), Cerdanya and Roussillon are comitati (counties), Tarragona is listed as a civitas (city), and Provence and the County of Melgueil are not described. In other cases charters are named for the lord that issued them or confirmed them. . Bernard Ato IV of Nîmes, is being betrothed to Gausfred III of Roussillon. ContentsText= The documents in the LFM are organised by county, viscounty, or lineage (usually associated with a given castle or estate). Sometimes sections are indicated by rubrics. Sections and subsections were separated by blank folios, which Rosell thought were intended for earlier documents that were yet to be retrieved, but which others suggested were intended for expansion. In fact both new documents and earlier ones were added to blank folios. Within a given subsection the documents are usually ordered chronologically, and sometimes grouped (by blank folios) into periods.Kosto, 6. A comital archive for the counts of Barcelona is only mentioned for the first time in 1180. Ramon de Caldes refers to omnia instrumenta propria et inter vos vestrosque antecessores ac homines vestros confecta (\\"all of your own documents and those drawn up between you and your ancestors and your men\\"), but the location of these documents is uncertain.Kosto, 5 and note 14. The archive may have been centralised yet itinerant, or perhaps there were subsidiary archives at the various comital centres. The archive sent by Ramon de Gironella to Guillem de Bassa contained mostly documents pertaining to the County of Girona, for instance. The copyists of the LFM may have made use of an itinerant commission which collected or copied charters throughout Alfonso's domains, where needed.Such a commission performed an inventory of the comital domain in 1151, cf. Kosto, 5. At least two charters in the LFM were definitely from outside sources: a grant by Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona to Santa Maria de l'Estany in 1152 and a privilege of Charlemagne held at the monastery of Sant Llorenç del Munt. Further, 109 documents from the archives of the County of Pallars Jussà, acquired by Alfonso on 27 May 1192, were incorporated into the LFM almost immediately. =Illustration= Alfonso II and Sancha (sometimes said to be Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona and Petronila of Aragon) surrounded by the ladies of their court. Though it is rare as an example of an illuminated cartulary, the LFM is not the only example from the twelfth century, nor even from Spain. In fact, there exist four Spanish exemplars from the first half of the century: the Libro de los testamentos of the cathedral of Oviedo, Tumbo A from Santiago de Compostela, the Libro de las estampas of León, and the Becerro antiguo of the monastery of Leire.Kosto, 16. Later Spanish examples (pre-1300) are the Tumbo menor de Castilla from Uclés, those of Valdeiglesias, Toxos Outos, and Coimbra, and the third cartulary in the Cámara de Cómptos of the Kingdom of Navarre. French examples exist from the same time period as the LFM: from Vierzon (c.1150), Mont-Saint-Michel (c.1160), and Marchiennes (c.1195).Maxwell, 576ff. Kosto has identified two styles and thus two hands at work in the miniatures of the LFM, one conservative and local, the other expert and international. Joan Ainaud dated the painting to the first quarter of the thirteenth century (after the completion of the text), but it was probably planned from the start.Kosto, 17, citing M. Eugenia Ibarburu (1991-93), \\"Los cartularios reales del Archivo de la Corona de Aragón\\", Lambard: Estudis d'art medieval, 6, 211. The LFM preserves 79 images, though there were once more.Kosto, 17. Many of the images are connected with specific charters in the cartulary and depict various specific actions of feudal politics. They are among the earliest depictions of the act of homage (hominium), of the placing of a vassals hands between those of his lord.Kosto, 18 n67, cites a carving on nave capital #30 at Vézelay as earlier: it shows a scene from the Book of Genesis (27:16-23), where Isaac feels his son Jacob's goatskin-covered arms, as an act of homage. There is another image of homage, predating the LFM by about twenty years, first noticed by Bisson (Kosot, 19 n73). It is in the cartulary of Tivoli and shows the townsmen, standing, swearing an oath of fealty to the bishop, seated, with a front juror holding his hands between the bishops'. Oaths and pledges are depicted by raised right hands and agreements by hand-holding. The Treaty of Zaragoza (1170) is depicted by Alfonso II and his Castilian counterpart, Alfonso VIII, as sitting on two thrones, holding hands. All these images reinforced the royal conception of power and the subordination of vassals. The first two images of the cartulary, however, are counter the hierarchical spirit of the rest. In the first, Alfonso and Ramon, seated at equal levels, with a scribe at work in the background, gesture towards a pile of charters. The charters are the centre of attention. The king is depicted as working (administering his realm).Kosto, 20. In the second, the king and the queen, Sancha of Castile, are surrounded by a circular array of seven pairs of noblewomen engaged in conversation. The king and queen, too, appear engaged in conversation. The image is probably a depiction of the court and its culture, which was a home to many troubadours.

The piece is 39 measures long and takes approximately two and a half minutes to play. It is in the key of G major. The piece, named after the poem by Leconte de Lisle, is known for its musical simplicity, a divergence from Debussy's style at the time. Completed in January 1910, it was published three months later and premiered in June of that same year. The prelude is one of Debussy's most recorded pieces, both in its original version and in subsequent various arrangements. Background and influence The title La fille aux cheveux de lin was inspired by Leconte de Lisle's poem by the same name, one of his Chansons écossaises (Scottish songs) from his 1852 collection Poèmes antiques (Ancient Poems). The image of a girl with flaxen-coloured hair has been utilized in fine art as a symbol of innocence and naivety. Musical writers have suggested that Debussy's successful portrayal of these emotions was tied in with the musical simplicity of the prelude—specifically, the technical and harmonic elements. His choice of simplicity for this piece was highly unusual, since it deviated from his style at the time and brought back the simple harmonies that he had utilized in his earlier musical compositions, which were more traditional. Debussy had previously utilized the title for a mélodie he wrote from 1882 to 1884. ' However, it does not feature any similarities to the 1910 prelude, and merely has a \\"distant familial relationship\\" with the prelude at most according to James R. Briscoe in the music journal 19th- Century Music. The song, which is one of his earlier works, was dedicated to Marie-Blanche Vasnier. She had an affair with Debussy at the time, and he dedicated most of the compositions he wrote from 1880 to 1884 to her. =Poem= Leconte de Lisle's original poem was written in French. In English, it is translated as: History The prelude was completed on 15–16 January 1910, and was first published in April of that same year, along with the rest of his preludes from Book I. Its first performance was given by Franz Liebich at the Bechstein Hall in London two months later, on 2 June. This was followed by an American premiere at the Stockbridge Casino in Stockbridge, Massachusetts on 26 July 1910, performed by Walter Morse Rummel. ' Subsequently, the French premiere took place the following year on 14 January at the Société Nationale de Musique in Paris, with Ricardo Viñes performing the work. A transcription of the prelude for violin and piano was created by Arthur Hartmann—a close friend of Debussy—and released in May 1910. La fille remains one of the most recorded musical compositions of Debussy's. Despite its performance on a recurring basis, the prelude remains popular among audiences, partly because of its \\"memorable tune\\" which is juxtaposed with a \\"mellow accompaniment\\". It has received acclaim for its expansiveness of emotion, with the Richmond Times-Dispatch's Clarke Bustard describing the piece as \\"perhaps the most delicately characterful\\" out of all his twenty-four preludes. ' Musical analysis theme from La fille aux cheveux de lin =Placement within Preludes, Book I= Debussy was known for his meticulousness in the arrangement of his preludes. Pianist and musical writer Paul Roberts asserts that this prelude, along with the two that immediately precede it, forms \\"the central arch\\" of Book I's structure, since the three pieces provide the most \\"dramatic contrast\\" out of all the preludes in the first book. The sixth prelude, Des pas sur la neige (Footprints in the Snow), evokes a feeling of sadness and isolation, while Ce qu'a vu le vent d'ouest (What the West wind saw)—the seventh—exudes a violent and tumultuous nature. In stark contrast to these two, La fille brings about a sense of gentle \\"lyricism\\" and \\"warmth\\", which is uncharacteristic of Debussy's music of this kind. By placing these three preludes in this particular order, Debussy ensured that arguably the most technically challenging prelude of the collection (Vent d'ouest) was situated in-between the two that are the simplest to play out of the twenty-four. =Composition= The prelude's central idea takes after its title – a girl with golden hair in a pastoral setting in Scotland. Thus, it is one of many examples of Debussy's Impressionist music, since it conjures up images of a foreign place. His utilization of pentatonic scales throughout the piece achieves this, and by blending this in with harmonizing diatonic chords and modal cadences, he creates a folk-like tune. This prelude uses more plagal leading tones than any other piece composed by Debussy, and the prelude's melody alternates between conjunct and disjunct movement throughout. ' The piece begins with its well- known opening theme consisting of three-note phrases, grouped together as one eighth note and two sixteenth notes. It finishes with chords that form a plagal cadence between bars 2 and 3, an element that is not featured in his previous preludes. The second part of the melody enters in bars 3–4, evoking a Scottish ballad or resembling a tune in the style of Edvard Grieg. The melody from the opening returns in bar 8 with added harmony in the left hand. At bar 19, the melody begins its ascent to the climax of the piece, gradually building up through the use of crescendo to propel it to peak at the end of bar 21. Near the end of bar 22, the melody diminuendos to the subsequent measure, where the theme of the climax is repeated an octave lower. A pianissimo drone-like part that moves in parallel motion—featuring consecutive fifths in some places—comes in at bars 24 to 27. In the next measure, the prelude's coda sees the return of the opening theme one last time—albeit at an octave higher—followed by the droning motif. Finally, the melody ascends in parallel movement and makes use of a final plagal leading cadence to get to the home key chord in root position. This cadence neither \\"melodically anticipates the arrival pitch\\" nor does it include the tonic in the left hand. Thus, it has been described as \\"the ideal harmonization of the plagal leading tone.\\" The melody ends with two arpeggiated octave chords (D in the left hand followed by G in the right), bringing the prelude to a close. Uses in media With Windows 7 came three pieces of sample music in File Explorer under Music, one of them being an arrangement of \\"The Maid With Flaxen Hair\\" for clarinet and string orchestra, which was performed by the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra and Richard Stoltzman.

According to the Teutonic chronicler Wigand of Marburg and the Livonian chronicle of Hermann de Wartberge, the Lithuanians suffered a great defeat. Background The Teutonic Knights had waged a crusade against the pagan Lithuanians since the 1290s in order to Christianize the country. Each side would organize military expeditions against each other and then retaliate. In August 1369 the Knights burned a Lithuanian fort in the mouth of the Nevėžis River; 109 people perished in the fire. During truce negotiations Kęstutis, brother and right-hand man of the Grand Duke Algirdas, warned the Prussian Marshal Henning Schindekop that he would organize a retaliation. This gave time for the Knights to prepare for an attack and they organized their army in Königsberg. Battle Kęstutis and Algirdas led their army, composed of Lithuanians, Samogitians, Ruthenians, and Tatars, to Prussia earlier than anticipated by the Knights. The Lithuanians took and burned Rudau Castle. Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode decided to take his army from Königsberg to meet the Lithuanians near Rudau. Contemporary Teutonic sources do not give details about the course of the battle, which is somewhat unusual. Details and battle plans were later provided by Jan Długosz (1415–1480), but his sources are unknown. The Lithuanians suffered a defeat. Algirdas took his men to a forest and hastily erected wooden barriers while Kęstutis withdrew into Lithuania. Marshal Schindekopf pursued the retreating Lithuanians, but was injured by a spear and died before he reached Königsberg. The Lithuanian noble Vaišvilas is presumed to have died in the battle. Losses and aftermath Teutonic sources exaggerate the Lithuanian losses, claiming that 1,000 to 5,500 men perished due to wounds, freezing weather, and starvation. That such numbers were exaggerated is shown by several robust Lithuanian military campaigns in the same year: a raid to Ortelsburg (Szczytno), large advances in the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, and the second raid to Moscow. The Teutonic Knights also suffered heavy losses: they lost several of their officers, including the marshal and two komturs. That the victory was not so one-sided as claimed by official Teutonic sources is also supported by a local legend that at a critical moment, when the Knights were about to give in to Lithuanian pressure, apprentice shoemaker Hans von Sagan replaced the fallen standard- bearer of Marshal Schindekop and led the Knights to victory. The victory was attributed to the Virgin Mary and in her honor Kniprode established the Augustinian convent at Heiligenbeil (Mamonovo). The battle marked the last serious threat from the Lithuanians in Prussia in the 14th century.

Vidar Lillelid (aged 34), Delfina Lillelid (aged 28), and their daughter Tabitha (aged 6), and son Peter (aged 2) were shot on a deserted rural road near Greeneville during a carjacking committed by a group of youths. Vidar and Delfina were found dead at the scene, while Tabitha died after being transported to the hospital. Peter survived, but as a result of the shooting was left with disabilities. Six young people from Kentucky, including two minors, were convicted of felony murder for the deaths of Vidar, Delfina, and Tabitha Lillelid, with all six perpetrators receiving three life sentences, and an additional sentence of 25 years each for the attempted murder of Peter Lillelid. Background Vidar Lillelid grew up in Bergen, Norway, and in 1985 moved to United States. In 1989, Lillelid married Delfina Zelaya, a first-generation Honduran-American from New York City, whom he had met through their common involvement in the Jehovah's Witnesses religion.. By 1997, the Lillelids had two children: 6-year-old daughter Tabitha and 2-year- old son Peter. Murders On April 6, 1997, six young people, ages 14 to 20, from Pikeville, Kentucky—Jason Bryant, Natasha Cornett, Dean Mullins, Joseph Risner, Crystal Sturgill, and Karen Howell—were travelling to New Orleans, Louisiana. Shortly after leaving Pikeville, they realized that Risner's car would not likely last the distance to New Orleans, and they discussed the possibility of stealing a car from a parking lot or a dealership. The group was armed with two guns: a 9mm and a .25 caliber pistol. Eyewitnesses observed six youths at a rest stop picnic spot along Interstate 81 outside Baileyton, in rural Greene County, Tennessee, in conversation with the Lillelid family, who were returning from a religious convention. Vidar Lillelid, carrying his son Peter, had approached Cornett and Howell to discuss his religious views, before Risner and Bryant joined the conversation. At some point, Risner displayed one of the guns and said, \\"I hate to do you this way, but we are going to have to take you with us for your van.\\" As he then directed the Lillelid family into their van, Vidar pleaded with the group, offering his keys and wallet in exchange for permission to remain at the rest stop, but Risner refused. Vidar Lillelid drove the van while Risner, holding the gun on him, sat in the passenger seat. Risner, Bryant, Howell, and Cornett were in the van with the Lillelids, while Mullins and Sturgill followed in Risner's car. In an attempt to calm her children, Delfina Lillelid began to sing; Bryant purportedly ordered her to stop. Risner directed the Lillelids first to the interstate and then to a secluded road at the next exit, Payne Hollow Lane, near Greeneville. The Lillelids were then lined up against a ditch along the road, where they were shot. Checking the bodies, Bryant stated, \\"They're still fucking alive,\\" and shot them again. Arrest The group left the family for dead and continued their journey towards New Orleans in the Lillelids’ van, abandoning Risner's car at the crime scene with its registration plates removed.Women's Entertainment Television Network (WETV) Women Behind Bars Series, Original Airdate June 16, 2009 They stopped at a Waffle House while traveling through Georgia, but left the restaurant when a group of police officers arrived. Deciding to abandon their plan to travel to New Orleans, they instead drove toward Mexico. When they reached the border, they were initially denied admittance because they did not have the proper forms of identification, but eventually found a way into the country. While in Mexico, Bryant was shot in the hand and leg, and the group was stopped by the Mexican police. When they claimed they were lost, the officers ordered the group out of the van and conducted a search, finding a knife, as well as a photo album belonging to the Lillelid family. They ordered the group to re- enter the United States, where American border patrol officers searched them and subsequently took them to an Arizona jail. At the time of their arrest, two days after the murders, several of them had personal items belonging to the Lillelids in their possession. InvestigationAutopsy= Dr. Cleland Blake, a forensic pathologist, testified that Vidar Lillelid received a total of six gunshot wounds, one to the right side of his head and five to his chest. The first shot entered his right eye, traveled through his temple, and exited in front of his right ear. While he could not be certain, it was Dr. Blake's opinion that this shot was fired from a 9mm handgun and would have caused a loss of consciousness. The victim then fell to the ground and was shot three times in the upper right side of his chest. The wounds were described as consistent with those from a 9mm, and that the three gunshot wounds to the chest were deliberately fired to form the shape of an equilateral triangle, with the victim lying on his back at the time. A gunshot wound just below Mr. Lillelid's nipple was consistent with a .25 caliber weapon, and a final 9mm gunshot wound was located just beneath it. There was a \\"graze laceration\\" on the victim's right forearm where a bullet skimmed across the surface. There were postmortem superficial abrasions to the back of the victim's legs. Vidar Lillelid most likely died within a few minutes of the initial gunshot to his right eye. Delfina Lillelid was shot eight times, and all eight bullets were recovered; six were from a 9mm and two were from a .25 caliber weapon. The first of the 9mm shots shattered a bone in her left arm; the second shot, also from a 9mm, shattered the femur in her left thigh. Dr. Blake testified that these shots would not have killed her, but would have caused severe pain, leaving the victim unable to stand. Mrs. Lillelid was shot an additional six times while on her back, with the first three shots striking the left side of her abdomen. It was Dr. Blake's opinion that these shots were fired to form a triangular pattern, similar to the injuries inflicted on Mr. Lillelid. The three shots pierced her stomach, leaving a four- to five-inch tear, and traveled through her pancreas, spleen, left kidney, and left adrenal gland. A final 9mm entry wound was located at the mid-section of Mrs. Lillelid's abdomen just above her navel and was recovered from her spine. There was a .25 caliber gunshot wound under her left armpit where the bullet entered, coming to a stop in the skin on the back of her left shoulder. Another shot caused a wound to Mrs. Lillelid's left side, and the bullet was recovered from the center of her liver. She also suffered abrasions on her right calf. Mrs. Lillelid's wounds were not immediately fatal, and she could have been conscious for as long as 25 minutes, including while her body was driven over by the van. Six-year-old Tabitha Lillelid was shot once in the head with a small caliber weapon, with the bullet entering the left side of her skull, traveling downward, and exiting behind her right ear. The wound caused immediate brain death. Her organs continued to function through the use of life support until her uncle, who had been named her custodian, gave permission for the donation of several of her internal organs. Physicians harvested her heart, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands. Tabitha Lillelid was pronounced dead one day after the shooting. =Peter Lillelid= Two-year-old Peter Lillelid was shot twice with a small caliber weapon. One shot entered behind his right ear and exited near his right eye. A second gunshot penetrated his back and exited through his chest. He was transported to the pediatric intensive care unit at the University of Tennessee Memorial Hospital in Knoxville by a Lifestar helicopter, where he was listed in critical condition. Peter required vigorous resuscitation, having sustained a contusion to his right lung with some residual bleeding in his right chest cavity. Eleven days after the shootings, doctors removed his damaged eye. He remained in the hospital for 17 days before being transferred to a rehabilitation center in Knoxville. =Perpetrators= All six of the perpetrators were from Kentucky, were known to have had troubled backgrounds, struggled academically or with substance abuse, and—with the exception of Bryant—had attended Betsy Layne High School. Natasha Cornett Natasha Wallen Cornett, 18, was born in Betsy Layne, Kentucky. She was the product of an affair and grew up in poverty. Cornett had been a polite and good student until sixth grade, when her academic performance declined. She left school before completing ninth grade, and had no history of employment except babysitting. Cornett started using alcohol and illegal drugs, including heroin, ecstasy, and cocaine. At the age of 14, she was arrested for forgery due to the theft of a box of checks, and sentenced by the juvenile court to one year of probation. Cornett was arrested a second time for assaulting her mother, Madonna Wallen, and threatening to kill her with a knife, but her mother dismissed the charges. On her 17th birthday, she married Steve Cornett, but the marriage ended after only ten months. Dean Mullins Edward Dean Mullins, 19, was born in 1978 in Harold, Kentucky. He had left school in 1996 during his twelfth grade year, but was working on his GED. Mullins had no criminal record, and had been employed at a grocery store in Pikeville, Kentucky, in 1993 and 1994. Mullins' family and friends stated that his behavior worsened after becoming involved with Natasha Cornett, whom he had planned to marry. Joseph Risner Joseph Lance Risner, 20, was born on October 13, 1976 in Hazard, Kentucky. He never met his biological father, and adopted his stepfather's last name. His family lived in Columbia, Kentucky, but moved to Georgia where he started fourth grade. Risner was described as a good student with a good work ethic until the separation of his mother and stepfather, which affected him emotionally. He and his mother moved back to Kentucky, where he had history of marijuana, alcohol, and LSD usage, and he claimed he had sexual relationships with two of his babysitters when he was 12 years old. Risner declined academically, failing seventh grade and eighth grade, before his grades improved in tenth grade, which he completed at Betsy Layne High School, where he met the other perpetrators, including his girlfriend Karen Howell. Risner joined the US Army in June 1995 but received an administrative discharge after testing positive for marijuana. He earned a GED on May 29, 1996, and was accepted at Mayo Regional Technology Center in September 1996. Risner was the eldest of the group. Crystal Sturgill Crystal Rena Sturgill, 18, was born on March 13, 1979 in Harold, Kentucky. Her mother, Teen Blackburn, refused to divulge the name of her father, and his name does not appear on her birth certificate. She was in her senior year at Betsy Layne High School and also attended Floyd County Technical School in Drift, where records indicate she had been a slightly above-average student. Sturgill's academic performance declined in high school, which she blamed on drugs and alcohol. However, she performed well on standardized tests, including a total score of 28 on her ACT, and had applied for admission to several colleges. She worked in the Betsy Layne Elementary School daycare as part of a co-op program, where her supervisors believed Sturgill was a capable child caregiver, and she received very high marks. Sturgill had no prior criminal history as either a juvenile or an adult, but had been suspended from school several times. Observers commented on the amount of emotional neglect Sturgill suffered in her home, and in December 1996, she accused her stepfather of repeated sexual abuse. After the accusations, Sturgill moved in with her aunt in Prestonsburg and began attending Prestonsburg High School in January 1997, but soon had to move out. She lived in approximately thirteen different places from the time she made the allegations in December until the shootings occurred in April. Sturgill was good friends with Edward Mullins, and was critical of his relationship with Natasha Cornett. She had no history of violence nor a criminal record before April 1997. Jason Bryant Jason Blake Bryant, 14, was born July 18, 1982 in Hellier, Kentucky, had an IQ of 85, and the emotional and social skills of an eleven-year-old. He had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, beginning as early as age three, and was in eighth grade at Millard High School in Pike County, Kentucky. He had met Natasha Cornett at random in Pikeville, Kentucky, a month before the murders. Bryant was the youngest of the group, and was a legal minor at the time. Karen Howell Karen R. Howell, 17, was born on September 25, 1979 in Delaware, Ohio. Her family moved to Kentucky when she was three years old, and her early childhood was characterized by severely violent fights between her parents, until they divorced when she was nine years old. She was recorded as having a borderline retarded IQ of 78. Howell claimed that she had been sexually abused between the ages of five and ten by her paternal uncle and a cousin, and described herself as fearful of relationships. By the age of 13, she began the practice of self-mutilation. Howell lived with her mother until she was 14, and the relationship was stormy, as the two often fought. Howell had a history of resistance to rules and regulations, dysfunction in school, illegal drug usage, runaway behavior, and an interest in witchcraft. The latter pursuit began with her use of a Ouija Board and \\"automatic writing\\", evidence of which her mother found, thereafter bringing in ministers who attempted to \\"cast out demons” from her daughter. Howell claimed that she had created \\"love spells\\" to get two boys to date her, and that she hears voices. She moved in with her father briefly after her first semester of high school, although her father had rarely communicated with her. After Howell dropped out of school, she moved back in with her father and continued to earn her GED. By her early teens, she began abusing various drugs, particularly LSD. She claimed to have had a bad trip where she \\"half-heartedly\\" tried to chew her friend's arm off, but otherwise had no history of violence nor a criminal record prior to the murders. Howell reported that she had attempted suicide four times in the past, twice by cutting her wrists and twice by overdosing on drugs. She had met Natasha Cornett and her boyfriend Joseph Risner at school. Howell was a minor at the time of the crime, and was saving up to buy a car by babysitting full-time.Case of State of Tennessee v. Howell, et al., opinion filed February 29, 2000. Howell was assigned David Leonard as her public defender. Leonard had never before worked a murder case. Plea Bargain/Sentencing Hearing During the sentencing hearing, Natasha Cornett said her first attorney coached her to say she was the \\"Daughter of Satan\\". District Attorney Berkeley Bell considered the Satanic angle a distraction (although he utilized occult experts during his investigation and constantly refers to the occult angle in interviews) and was relieved when Cornett's first attorney was replaced by the presiding judge.Six, a documentary film about the Lilleid murders and Natasha Cornett by forensic psychologist Helen Smith. References were made by witnesses and prosecutors at trial to rumors that the six were involved with occultism and Satanism; however, no evidence of such involvement was presented. This omission was cited in Ms. Cornett's unsuccessful 2002 appeal of her conviction.Cornett vs State of Tennessee, Original Filed August 20, 2002 D.A. Bell has said in interviews that Bryant was the only one he could prove was a shooter, but he felt it wouldn't be just unless he convicted all six of murder. So before jury selection was completed, a plea bargain was drawn up in which the death penalty was taken off the table if the six pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. However, the D.A. stipulated that all six defendants had to accept the deal and do so within a very short time period, or the death penalty would be pursued. Karen Howell has stated for the record that she \\"wanted to fight it in court, even though I was not subject to the death penalty. But they were threatening to kill everyone if I didn't sign it. So I just caved in to the pressure.\\" All six defendants signed, and in March 1998, they were convicted of felony murder as participants in a felony kidnapping and carjacking that resulted in three murders (three life sentences each) and an attempted murder (25 years each). The six youths were each sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.Lillelid Sentencing, March 13, 1998. The judge applied the same aggravated circumstances for all. However, it was not determined which of them had the main blame for the killings. Court testimony by the other defendants was that the youngest, Jason Bryant, had fired the shots, but the judge opined that another undetermined member of the group might also have done so. Jason Bryant admitted to Officer Deb Mackey in Arizona that he had shot Vidar Lillelid. But Officer Mackey's testimony was not allowed, as Bryant had not been read his rights before he made the admission (A.P. 7/18/1997). He later changed his story, saying Mullins and Risner did the shooting. Aftermath Soon after Peter Lillelid's medical condition stabilized at the end of April 1997, a custody battle began between his maternal grandmother, Lydia Selaya, in Miami, Florida, and his paternal aunt, Randi Heier, in Sweden. Citing Randi's pledge to raise Peter in the faith and teachings of the Jehovah's Witnesses as the deciding factor, local Judge Fred McDonald awarded her custody of Peter on July 1, 1997.Town of Greenville TN Website, Lillelid Murder Archive Peter has since been raised in Sweden in the Stockholm area by his Aunt Randi Heier and her family. As of 2007 at the age of about twelve years, he still had trouble walking because of the injuries. By 2017, Peter had finished his IT education and was looking for work. On August 24, 2001, Natasha Cornett and death row inmate Christa Pike allegedly attacked fellow prisoner Patricia Jones, nearly strangling Jones to death with a shoelace after Pike and Jones were placed in a holding cell with Cornett during a fire alarm. Although the Department of Corrections believed that Cornett was involved, investigators found insufficient evidence to charge her with helping Pike, who was subsequently found guilty of attempted murder. District Attorney Berkeley Bell has stated in several interviews that the six youths had planned a \\"killing spree\\" inspired by the popular film, \\"Natural Born Killers.\\" Considering that the killing began and ended with the Lillelid family at Payne Hollow Road, this theory is highly unlikely. Bell also insists that the bodies were \\"arranged in the shape of a cross,\\" a statement refuted by Sheriff David Davenport, who investigated the scene. In his opinion, the teens \\"were just trying to get the hell out of there\\", and did not try to arrange the bodies in any manner (see \\"The Scarred Heart\\" by Dr. Helen Smith, page 120).

The University's President, currently Joseph Harroz, Jr., lives in Boyd House as a primary residence free of charge. In 1976, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"President's House, University of Oklahoma\\". History The house that came to be known as Boyd House was built in 1906 by OU's first president, David Ross Boyd, for approximately $7,000. In 1908, Boyd was forced out as university president. He leased the property to the university until 1914, when OU acquired it from Boyd in a property swap. Seven subsequent university presidents lived in the house. Stratton D. Brooks, the university's third president, remodeled the house over a period of seven years between 1915 and 1922 into its current Neoclassical Revival style, paying for its four Ionic columns out of his own pocket. The house had no formal name; it was known as \\"The President's House\\", \\"The White House\\", or by the name of the occupant, i.e. \\"The Bizzell House\\". It hosted numerous significant historical figures, including Sir Alexander Fleming, John Philip Sousa, William Howard Taft, Harry S. Truman, and Niels Bohr. In 1969 J. Herbert Hollomon, the university's eighth president, moved into a newer residence off campus that was purchased by the university for his use, and his successors continued to live in the same house. The old building sat vacant until 1971, when it became office space. It was used as the university's visitor center from 1979 to 1994. It was officially named Boyd House in 1982. As a condition of his employment by the university, then-incoming OU president David L. Boren insisted on living in Boyd House. Boyd House reopened as the official presidential residence in November 1996 following a $2 million privately funded renovation and expansion.

The Shanxi mine blast () was a pre-dawn explosion that occurred in a mine in Gujiao city near Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province of China on 21 February 2009. Four hundred and thirty six were in the mine at the time of the explosion. According to the state-run Xinhua News Agency, rescue efforts concluded at 6 p.m. (CST), February 22 with all trapped miners located; the death toll was 74, with 114 in the hospital and five in critical condition. Many of the injured are being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning. The death toll indicates that this is the most lethal accident reported in China's mining industry since December 2007, when 105 people died in a mine explosion—that accident also took place in Shanxi. Accident details The pre-dawn explosion occurred at 2:17 a.m. (CST) as 436 workers were in the Tunlan Coal Mine in Gujiao city. Xinhua News Agency reported that over four hundred men were working when the explosion occurred but that most escaped unhindered and unhurt. One hundred rescuers worked at the scene in Gujiao city as dozens of miners remained trapped. China Central TV (CCTV) broadcast footage of rescuers in orange suits and red helmets with headlamps entering an elevator where they were lowered into the mine shaft as injured miners were taken into ambulances. A fire in the shaft was said to be blocking the progress of the rescuers. There were also reports of trapped miners using mobile phones to call relatives to discuss their plight. A two-minute silence is planned in recognition of the dead on the 25th of February. Shanxi Coking The involved mine is owned by Xishan Coal Electricity Group of Shanxi Coking Coal Group, one of China's largest producers of coking coal, a material used in the production of steel. The company operates twenty-eight mines. No accidents were reported at the Tunlan mine in the previous decade before this incident, and it consequently was considered a safe mine at which to work. The mine produces five million tons of coking coal per year. Mining in China China has the world's deadliest mining industry, with the deaths of 3,200 people reported in 2008.

Their Majesties Chappell, St. Peter's Church, in St. George's, Bermuda, is the oldest surviving Anglican church in continuous use outside the British Isles. It is also reportedly the oldest continuously used Protestant church in the New World.Official site History page A UNESCO World Heritage Site (together with related fortifications), St. George's Town is the oldest surviving English settlement in the New World,UNESCO Entry on World Heritage Site of St. George's & Related Fortifications having been settled by the Virginia Company in 1612 (in the aftermath of the wrecking of its flagship, the Sea Venture, in Bermuda in 1609). History John Smith's 1624 map of Bermuda, showing St. Peter's at centre, left. The church was established immediately after the founding of the settlement, although the original building, fashioned from wood with a thatched roof, was quickly destroyed. Bermuda is famously stormy, and it was necessary to rebuild the church more than once over the following century, the final structure being of limestone walls, with a limestone slate roof lain on a framework of Bermuda cedar. The oldest parts of the current structure date to 1620, though the building has been much expanded and improved since. 2012 marks the 400th year since the founding of St. Peter's Church. It is also the Diamond Jubilee year of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II. On 18 March, 2012, the Queen granted St. Peter's the title Their Majesties' Chappell. The interior Interior of St. Peter's. The church's interior is simple, but beautiful, with exposed cedar beams (prior to the blight which virtually annihilated Bermuda's cedars in the 1940s and '50s, the wood was considered inexpensive and those who could afford to favoured more expensive, imported woods. Today, the endemic wood is scarce, priceless, and proudly displayed in those homes which have it). The font of the church is 500 years old, older than the settlement of Bermuda. The walls of the church have commemorative plaques on the inside, and there are gravestones set in the outsides, those of the notables who were considered worthy enough to be buried under the church floor, such as the printer of Bermuda's first newspaper (The Bermuda Gazette), Joseph Stockdale, and Governor George James Bruere, who died in office in 1780. The exterior The western side of the church. The graveyard which surrounds the church has been filled for decades, all new burials taking place in the municipal graveyard on the far shore to the north of the town. Notable exceptions were Governor Sir Richard Sharples and his aide-de-camp, Captain Hugh Sayers, who were buried side by side in the east of the churchyard after their 1973 murders. An area of the yard to the west of the church was reserved for burying slaves, prior to the 1834 emancipation of slaves throughout the British Empire. The Bermuda cedar used as a belfry when St. Peter's Church was first built was toppled by a storm in 2003. As originally constructed, the church had no belfry, the bell being hung from an old-growth cedar directly behind the church. Although to all appearances dead, this tree was still standing until felled by Hurricane Fabian in 2003. The south-facing church and its yard sit well back, and somewhat higher than Duke of York Street, the main road that passes through St. George's in front of it. A high, wide flight of steps descend from the church to a small yard, or square, on the north side of the road. At this east side of this yard is the church hall, a small building which was increased in size by the addition of a second floor in the 1980s. Parish The church was established as the parish (for the town and the surrounding area) of the state church, the Church of England. A system of parishes was established throughout Bermuda, the parishes being both religious divisions, each centred on a parish church, and political ones. The January, 1620, reconstruction of St. Peter's was overseen by Governor Nathaniel Butler. When the Parliament of Bermuda was created in 1620, it first met in St. Peter's, on 1 August, pending completion of its own dedicated home, the State House.Bermuda Online Bermuda's Town of St. George: St. Peter's Church The Church of England in Bermuda became grouped with that of Newfoundland, in the 19th Century, as a common bishopric. With the building of the Hamilton Cathedral in 1894 (the year it was consecrated as such – it would not be completed 'til 1905), Bermuda attained its own bishopric. Had the capital not relocated to Hamilton from St. George's (which it did in 1815), St. Peter's might have become the cathedral. There had been an attempt to replace St. Peter's in the 19th. Century with a larger building at a new location. Begun in 1874, this building was for various reasons never completed. Today, the magnificent ruin of the Unfinished Church, on Church Folly Lane, is a popular visitor attraction in St. George's.Bermuda Online Bermuda's Town of St. George: The Unfinished Church In 1976, the Church of England in Bermuda became the Anglican Church of Bermuda, an extra-provincial diocese under the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Film  Chainsaws have appeared in countless films being used for their intended purpose, but this rarely if ever is given a prominent role in the plot. More prominent however is portrayals of chainsaws as weapons or torture devices. Despite chainsaws having been around since the 1930s, they were not seen being used as a weapon in film until the 1960s, possibly due to Hays Code censorship restrictions on portrayals of graphic violence. Among the earliest films to portray chainsaws as weapons are Dark of the Sun (1968) and The Wizard of Gore (1970).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opqBKpxVUfQ Wes Craven's 1972 film The Last House on the Left, would be referred to as “The original Chainsaw Massacre” in advertising campaigns during later re- releases.Last House on the Left DVD In 1974, arguably the most famous and influential chainsaw use in a film was seen when Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released. The film, loosely based on famous murderer Ed Gein (though unlike the killers in the film Gein did not use chainsaws), would etch the chainsaw into the public mind as an object of gruesome terror, even though actual chainsaw to flesh contact was only seen once in the whole movie. It would be followed by a direct sequel, two standalone sequels and in 2003 a remake which would receive its own prequel. Following its release, many horror films, especially lower budget ones, began to incorporate chainsaw gore scenes, a trend which continues to the present day. 1987 would bring the next most famous horror film use of the chainsaw with Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II, where instead of being used by villains, this time is the hero the one who uses the power tool to fight the evil and set right what is wrong (The previous film also contained a chainsaw, but it was ultimately not used for violence). In the film's greatest sequence, protagonist Ash Williams attaches a chainsaw to his stump to replace a severed hand (which he had removed with said chainsaw), marking a point where the protagonist quit running from the spirits and chooses to fight. The chainsaw hand would have appearances in the film's sequel, various spin offs and would be parodied often, symbolizing the will to fight things that (until the moment when the hero gets the mighty tool of power) were utterly undefeatable. Due to the high level of gore associated with the chainsaws use as a weapon, appearances as such outside of the horror genre were uncommon. One notable one was in Brian De Palma's 1983 gangster film Scarface. The scene in question depicted a Colombian gangster dismembering another gangster to extract information. In the 1996 film Forest Warrior, a scene was included depicting immortal spirit John McKenna (played by Chuck Norris) stopping a logger's chainsaw with his bare hand. The scene became memetic after being posted on the Internet, with a clip of the scene gaining over 5 million views on YouTube.YouTube.com: Chuck Norris stops a chainsaw bare handed original YouTube post  Television  Due to television's higher level censorship chainsaw violence is rare and usually only described with both the attack and the damaged body left unseen. An example of this is an episode (\\"Born Again\\") of The X-Files revolving around the ghost of a police officer dismembered with a chainsaw by corrupt colleagues, all flashbacks skip over the actual murder. One notable exception is the series Dexter in which chainsaw attacks are occasionally seen, most notably in dreams and flashbacks regarding the protagonist's mother's death. This is due to the larger amount of content freedom given to programs created for pay-television, of which the series is one. Dexter Morgan, also uses a chainsaw at some points. Chainsaws have made appearances in cartoon series, usually as a source of comedy. These have ranged from more young adult audience fare (The Simpsons, Family Guy) to even children's series, for instance the series The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy contains a chainsaw wielding character based on Evil Dead's protagonist Ash. In the anime and manga adaptation of Kuroshitsuji, a chainsaw was prominently featured as Grell Sutcliff's personalized Deathscythe. CSI:Crime Scene Investigation has used chainsaws in one storyline, highlighting their potential for serious accidents. What was apparently the massacre of two victims by a third perpetrator was then revealed to be an inexperienced operator who had caused a kickback accident that killed both him and a bystander. In the early days of the R/C combat shows Battlebots and Robot Wars, many robots were armed with chainsaws, because it was a simple task to convert the tool into a remote- controlled weapon. Their usage steadily declined as builders began developing custom-made kinetic energy weapons that could do far more damage. Video games The first chainsaw appearance in a video game was the 1983 Texas Chainsaw Massacre Atari game. However this game, with antagonist Leatherface chasing down victims on a highway for points, would see low sales and limited exposure due to many stores refusing to sell it. Chainsaws were used as weapons in the 1970s/1980s horror film inspired cult Splatterhousehttp://splatterhouse.kontek.net/sh_characters.html game series, and used by enemies in some beat-em ups (such as the Robocop arcade game). In 1993, pioneering first person shooter Doom included a chainsaw as a weapon for the player. Some horror games in which chainsaws are used as weapons include the Resident Evil series, Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2, the Silent Hill series, Manhunt, Dead Space, Left 4 Dead 2, MadWorld, No More Room in Hell, and the Evil Dead spin off games. Chainsaws also appear in organized crime themed video games. These include the Grand Theft Auto series (starting with the Scarface inspired GTA: Vice City), 50 Cent: Bulletproof, Saints Row 2, and the Scarface game.http://www.gamechronicles.com/features/gtascarface/body.htm Chainsaw-inspired weapons have also made appearances in sci-fi war games. Some examples are the chainsaw bayonets in the Gears of War series, the \\"Ripper\\" chainsaw-knife of the Fallout series, and the \\"chainswords\\" seen in games based on the Warhammer 40,000 franchise. Chainsaw-based weaponry can be seen in the popular Facebook game Battle Stations where it exists as a large-scale ship-mounted melee weapon. Some real-time strategy games, for instance Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos have units which use chainsaws to fell trees, though few video games portray chainsaws in any context other than a weapon. Lollipop Chainsaw utilizes a chainsaw as a primary weapon of the game. The character Dorothy in Stella Glow utilizes a chainsaw as one of her primary weapons . In Shadow Warrior 2 the Player Character (Lo Wang) can use multiple types of chainsaws, including ones resembling swords. In Um Jammer Lammy, a rhythm game, stage 5 involves Paul Chuck, a Lumberjack, helping the player character Lammy play a chainsaw like a guitar to carve a tree to create a replacement guitar.  Object of comedy  Although the original portrayals of chainsaw violence worked on its capacity to inflict gory damage upon a human body or sadistically produce pain, its prominence in low budget B-movies has since produced a separate image of the chainsaw as a comedic, often campy expression of over the top terror. This image is often drawn upon in cartoons, comedy series and comedy films. It has appeared occasionally as part of the post-Scream wave of self-referential horror, for instance David Arquette's The Tripper. One of the most famous stereotypes of comedic chainsaw portrayal is that of the chainsaw wielding lunatic in a hockey mask (seen for example in the Simpsons episode \\"Cape Feare\\"). Ironically, horror cinema's archetypal hockey mask killer Jason Voorhees has never actually been portrayed wielding a chainsaw in a film, though chainsaws have been used against him in some films. The band Arrogant Worms have a song called \\"Malcolm\\", in which the title character \\"solves his problems with a chainsaw and he never has the same problem twice\\".  Sports  The Portland Timbers soccer team's mascot, Timber Joey, cuts off a slab of wood from the team's victory log using a chainsaw after each Timbers home goal. The players who scored the goal get to keep the slice of wood.http://www.portlandtimbers.com/  Relation to reality  Despite their substantial ability to inflict damage on living creatures, real life chainsaw attacks and murders are uncommon. This likely is due to their heavy unwieldy weight, loud noise, risk of user injury and high price compared to other potential close quarters weapons, although those very same drawbacks make them weapons with a formidable value of intimidation. One real chainsaw murder is referred to in interviews with Brian De Palma as having been the inspiration for the chainsaw scene in Scarface. The real case, which De Palma apparently saw crime scene photos of while researching the film, involved multiple victims and bodies stuffed into metal drums. DePalma described the murder as part of his appeal that Scarface should be passed with a R certificate on the basis that graphic content was based in reality as screenwriter Oliver Stone had gleaned from months of research with both police officers (some of whom testified in the films defense) and actual drug traffickers.

The phase qubit is closely related, yet distinct from, the flux qubit and the charge qubit, which are also quantum bits implemented by superconducting devices. The major distinction among the three is the ratio of Josephson energy vs charging energy (the necessary energy for one Cooper pair to charge the total capacitance in the circuit): * For phase qubit, this ratio is on the order of 106, which allows for macroscopic bias current through the junction; * For flux qubit it's on the order of 10, which allows for mesoscopic supercurrents (typically ~300 nAUniversity of Delft - Flux Qubit Website ); * For charge qubit it's less than 1, and therefore only a few Cooper pairs can tunnel through and charge the Cooper-pair box. However, transmon can have a very low charging energy due to the huge shunt capacitance, and therefore have this ratio on the order of 10~100.  Introduction  A phase qubit is a current-biased Josephson junction, operated in the zero voltage state with a non-zero current bias. A Josephson junction is a tunnel junction, made of two pieces of superconducting metal separated by a very thin insulating barrier, about 1 nm in thickness. The barrier is thin enough that electrons, or in the superconducting state, Cooper-paired electrons, can tunnel through the barrier at an appreciable rate. Each of the superconductors that make up the Josephson junction is described by a macroscopic wavefunction, as described by the Ginzburg–Landau theory for superconductors. The difference in the complex phases of the two superconducting wavefunctions is the most important dynamic variable for the Josephson junction, and is called the phase difference \\\\delta, or simply \\"phase\\". Main equations describing the SIS junction The Josephson equation relates the superconducting current (usually called the supercurrent) I through the tunnel junction to the phase difference \\\\delta, :I = I_0 \\\\sin \\\\delta (Josephson current-phase relationship) Here I_0 is the critical current of the tunnel junction, determined by the area and thickness of the tunnel barrier in the junction, and by the properties of the superconductors on either side of the barrier. For a junction with identical superconductors on either side of the barrier, the critical current is related to the superconducting gap \\\\Delta and the normal state resistance R_n of the tunnel junction by the Ambegaokar–Baratoff formula :I_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\Delta}{2 e R_n} (Ambegaokar–Baratoff formula) The Gor'kov phase evolution equation gives the rate of change of the phase (the \\"velocity\\" of the phase) as a linear function of the voltage V as :V = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\frac{d \\\\delta}{d t} (Gor'kov- Josephson phase evolution equation) This equation is a generalization of the Schrödinger equation for the phase of the BCS wavefunction. The generalization was carried out by Gor'kov in 1958.  The McCumber–Stewart model  The alternative and direct current Josephson relations control the behavior of the Josephson junction itself. The geometry of the Josephson junction—two plates of superconducting metal separated by a thin tunnel barrier—is that of a parallel plate capacitor, so in addition to the Josephson element the device includes a parallel capacitance C. The external circuit is usually simply modeled as a resistor R in parallel with the Josephson element. The set of three parallel circuit elements is biased by an external current source I, thus the current-biased Josephson junction. Solving the circuit equations yields a single dynamic equation for the phase, : \\\\frac{\\\\hbar C}{2 e} \\\\, \\\\frac{d^2 \\\\delta}{dt^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e R} \\\\frac{d \\\\delta}{dt} = I - I_0 \\\\sin \\\\delta. The terms on the left side are identical to those of a particle with coordinate (location) \\\\delta, with mass proportional to the capacitance C, and with friction inversely proportional to the resistance R. The particle moves in a conservative force field given by the term on the right, which corresponds to the particle interacting with a potential energy U(\\\\delta) given by :WashBoard potential : :U(\\\\delta) = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\left ( -I_0 \\\\cos \\\\delta - I \\\\, \\\\delta \\\\right ). This is the \\"washboard potential\\", so- called because it has an overall linear dependence -I \\\\, \\\\delta, modulated by the washboard modulation -I_0 \\\\, \\\\cos \\\\delta. The zero voltage state describes one of the two distinct dynamic behaviors displayed by the phase particle, and corresponds to when the particle is trapped in one of the local minima in the washboard potential. These minima exist for bias currents \\\\left I \\\\right < I_0, i.e. for currents below the critical current. With the phase particle trapped in a minimum, it has zero average velocity and therefore zero average voltage. A Josephson junction will allow currents up to I_0 to pass through without any voltage; this corresponds to the superconducting branch of the Josephson junction's current–voltage characteristic. The voltage state is the other dynamic behavior displayed by a Josephson junction, and corresponds to the phase particle free-running down the slope of the potential, with a non- zero average velocity and therefore non-zero voltage. This behavior always occurs for currents I above the critical current, i.e. for \\\\left I \\\\right > I_0, and for large resistances R also occurs for currents somewhat below the critical current. This state corresponds to the voltage branch of the Josephson junction current–voltage characteristic. For large resistance junctions the zero-voltage and voltage branches overlap for some range of currents below the critical current, so the device behavior is hysteretic.  Nonlinear inductor  Another way to understand the behavior of a Josephson junction in the zero-voltage state is to consider the SIS tunnel junction as a nonlinear inductor. When the phase is trapped in one of the minima, the phase value is limited to a small range about the phase value at the potential minimum, which we will call \\\\delta_0. The current through the junction is related to this phase value by :I = I_0 \\\\sin \\\\delta_0. If we consider small variations \\\\Delta \\\\delta in the phase about the minimum \\\\delta_0 (small enough to maintain the junction in the zero voltage state), then the current will vary by :\\\\Delta I = \\\\left (I_0 \\\\cos \\\\delta_0\\\\right) \\\\Delta \\\\delta. These variations in the phase give rise to a voltage through the ac Josephson relation, : \\\\Delta V = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\frac{d \\\\Delta \\\\delta}{dt} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\frac{1}{I_0 \\\\cos \\\\delta_0} \\\\frac{d \\\\Delta I}{dt} = L \\\\frac{d \\\\Delta I}{dt} This last relation is the defining equation for an inductor with inductance :L = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\frac{1}{I_0 \\\\cos \\\\delta_0}. This inductance depends on the value of phase \\\\delta_0 at the minimum in the washboard potential, so the inductance value can be controlled by changing the bias current I. For zero bias current, the inductance reaches its minimum value, : L_{\\\\rm min} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2 e} \\\\frac{1}{I_0} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar R_n}{\\\\pi \\\\Delta}. As the bias current increases, the inductance increases. When the bias current is very close (but less than) the critical current I_0, the value of the phase \\\\delta_0 is very close to \\\\pi/2, as seen by the dc Josephson relation, above. This means that the inductance value L becomes very large, diverging as I reaches the critical current I_0. The nonlinear inductor represents the response of the Josephson junction to changes in bias current. When the parallel capacitance from the device geometry is included, in parallel with the inductor, this forms a nonlinear LC resonator, with resonance frequency :\\\\omega_p = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{L C}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 e I_0 \\\\cos \\\\delta_0}{\\\\hbar C}}, which is known as the plasma frequency of the junction. This corresponds to the oscillation frequency of the phase particle in the bottom of one of the minima of the washboard potential. For bias currents very near the critical current, the phase value in the washboard minimum is :\\\\cos\\\\delta_0 = \\\\sqrt{1-(I/I_0)^2}, and the plasma frequency is then :\\\\omega_p \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 e I_0}{\\\\hbar C}} \\\\left [ 1 - (I/I_0)^2 \\\\right ]^{1/4}, clearly showing that the plasma frequency approaches zero as the bias current approaches the critical current. The simple tunability of the current-biased Josephson junction in its zero voltage state is one of the key advantages the phase qubit has over some other qubit implementations, although it also limits the performance of this device, as fluctuations in current generate fluctuations in the plasma frequency, which causes dephasing of the quantum states.  Quantized energy levels  The phase qubit is operated in the zero-voltage state, with \\\\left I \\\\right < I_0. At very low temperatures, much less than 1 K (achievable using a cryogenic system known as a dilution refrigerator), with a sufficiently high resistance and small capacitance Josephson junction, quantum energy levels become detectable in the local minima of the washboard potential. These were first detected using microwave spectroscopy, where a weak microwave signal is added to the current I biasing the junction. Transitions from the zero voltage state to the voltage state were measured by monitoring the voltage across the junction. Clear resonances at certain frequencies were observed, which corresponded well with the quantum transition energies obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation for the local minimum in the washboard potential. Classically only a single resonance is expected, centered at the plasma frequency \\\\omega_p. Quantum mechanically, the potential minimum in the washboard potential can accommodate several quantized energy levels, with the lowest (ground to first excited state) transition at an energy E_{01} \\\\approx \\\\hbar \\\\omega_p, but the higher energy transitions (first to second excited state, second to third excited state) shifted somewhat below this due to the non-harmonic nature of the trapping potential minimum, whose resonance frequency falls as the energy increases in the minimum. Observing multiple, discrete levels in this fashion is extremely strong evidence that the superconducting device is behaving quantum mechanically, rather than classically. The phase qubit uses the lowest two energy levels in the local minimum; the ground state  g \\\\rangle is the \\"zero state\\" of the qubit, and the first excited state  e \\\\rangle is the \\"one state\\". The slope in the washboard potential is set by the bias current I, and changes in this current change the washboard potential, changing the shape of the local minimum (equivalently, changing the value of the nonlinear inductance, as discussed above). This changes the energy difference between the ground and first excited states. Hence the phase qubit has a tunable energy splitting.

Synopsis The young Catholic Gerald Bull is fascinated with large- bore guns, inspired by Jules Verne's novel From The Earth To The Moon. The adult Dr. Gerald Bull's career as a successful large-bore gun designer takes a turn as he is defunded by the U.S. Army; he then produces weapons for China, Israel, and ultimately South Africa which results in his arrest and conviction for illegal arms dealing. After his release, Bull promotes his supergun idea to Saddam Hussein, and, with funding through BCCI, begins design work on the top secret project, \\"Babylon\\". Bull solves several manufacturing challenges by forging and assembling it in sections which are bolted together by flanges, and lining the relatively soft barrel material with an alloy sleeve to reduce wear on the barrel. British and U.S. government agencies are shown to be aware of Bull's activities, but do nothing to stop him. The Israeli Mossad tries to dissuade Bull, and goes so far as to threaten his life, with no effect. As the \\"Baby Babylon\\" version of the gun is assembled and tested successfully horizontally in Iraq, Bull's second in command, Cowley, quits after a roadside run-in with Mossad agent Dov, who also shadowed Bull. The Iraqis demand an additional, 45-degree, test of the prototype gun, using threats to coerce Bull into compliance. That completed test firing results in a direct hit on a target 100 miles away, and Bull brags that the full size \\"Babylon\\" gun can fire \\"ten times as far.\\" As production of the full-size sections of the gun continues in England and elsewhere, falsely documented as oil pipeline parts in order to evade export restrictions, the film depicts increasing threats to Bull's life from Saddam, and the Mossad agent/handler Col Yossi tells Dov that assassination of Bull will happen one way or another as he has too many enemies and not many friends. A threat to Iran, the Iraqis due to his knowing too much, Syrians, some African nations, and the Saudis. An embarrassment and liability to the UK and there is also the US who consider him a possible liability too. As the gun nears completion, Bull, while returning home, is gunned down at his apartment, where his body is discovered by his wife. The end text crawl states that Dr. Bull's murder remains unsolved, and that the U.S. contributed over $3 billion to Iraq in the years preceding the first Gulf War.

It premiered Saturday, July 23, 1994 on HBO. Reception Reviews were mixed, noting good performances, with several faulting the script and direction. Variety reviewer Ray Loynd described the film as \\"politically biting\\", Langella's performance as \\"absorbing\\", and \\"fascinating, buoyant, ebullient\\", but described the story as appealing to \\"your brain, not your heart or your gut\\" and lacking major empathetic characters. TV Guide noted that though the film's direction was \\"competent without being eye-openingly fresh, it cannot override flaws in the script which make the film a dull experience\\", and gave the film two out of four stars. Its ratings notice indicates \\"extreme profanity, violence, adult situations.\\" The New York Times review found the film's conceit of a \\"daunting but lovable\\" protagonist as a weapons designer to be \\"loopy\\", contrasting Bull in real-life as \\"a difficult man, prickly and quick to take offense\\" with Langella's portrayal as \\"endlessly charming.\\" The film's writing was criticized for \\"quips and zingers that aren't worth the effort\\" and for \\"thoroughly defusing what might have been a tense drama with genuinely high stakes.\\" The Los Angeles Times review noted no flaws with the film, describing it as an \\"intricately woven thriller that demands the viewer's undivided attention\\" and praising Langella's portrayal of Bull.

The experimental area consisted of a site with an extent of 3½ versts (3.73 km), which passed along the sand of beach for a large part of its length, with rail cars travelling distances of over one kilometre. The system used the rails as conductors for electricity transmission; one rail carried the direct current, and the second rail functioned as a return wire. After establishing the necessary connections on the joints between the rails, the transmission of electricity was successfully carried out. Pirotsky stated that current leakage to the earth was not appreciable, and the transfer efficiency was calculated to be acceptable. Expenses for the adaptation of existing railways to electricity transmission were determined to be insignificant – from 50 to 100 roubles per verst.  Closure  In 1877 the line operated four pairs of trains. They primarily served residents during the summer period, while in the winter they were only used by officials. The recorded volume of patronage was very insignificant because of a disputed tariff policy of Finnish railways, and ultimately the Miller's pier station was left idle. As a result, the operators appeared to be in a disastrous financial position, and the majority of the proposed plans were left incomplete. By the mid-1880s the Society of the Sestroretsk railway was definitively ruined, and on January 1, 1886, the railway was closed.

Conservation- reliant species are animal or plant species that require continuing species- specific wildlife management intervention such as predator control, habitat management and parasite control to survive, even when a self-sustainable recovery in population is achieved.  History  The term \\"conservation- reliant species\\" grew out of the conservation biology undertaken by The Endangered Species Act at Thirty Project (launched 2001) and its popularization by project leader J. Michael Scott. Its first use in a formal publication was in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment in 2005. Worldwide use of the term has not yet developed and it has not yet appeared in a publication compiled outside North America. Passages of the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) carried with it the assumption that endangered species would be delisted as their populations recovered. It assumed they would then thrive under existing regulations and the protections afforded under the ESA would no longer be needed. However, eighty percent of species currently listed under the ESA fail to meet that assumption. To survive, they require species- specific conservation interventions (e.g. control of predators, competitors, nest parasites, prescribed burns, altered hydrological processes, etc.) and thus they are conservation-reliant.Conservation Reliant Species: Our New Relationship with Nature  Criteria  The criteria for assessing whether a species is conservation-reliant are: # Threats to the species’ continued existence are known and treatable. # The threats are pervasive and recurrent, for example: nest parasites, non-native predators, human disturbance. # The threats render the species at risk of extinction, absent ongoing conservation management. # Management actions sufficient to counter threats have been identified and can be implemented, for example: prescribed fires, restrictions on grazing or public access, predator or parasite control. # National, state or local governments, often in cooperation with private or tribal interests, are capable of carrying out the necessary management actions as long as necessary.  Management actions  There are five major areas of management action for conservation of vulnerable species: # Control of other species may include: control of exotic fauna, exotic flora, other native species and parasites and disease. # Control of direct human impacts may include control of grazing, human access, on and off-road vehicles, low impact recreation and illegal collecting and poaching. # Pollution control may include control of chemical run-off, siltation, water quality and use of pesticides and herbicides. # Active habitat management may include fire management and control, control of soil erosion and waterbodies, habitat restoration and mechanical vegetation control. # Artificial population recruitment may include captive propagation (forced immigration) or captive breeding.  Case study  Bengal tiger at Bannerghatta National Park, Bangalore, India. A prominent example is in India, where tigers, an apex predator and the national animal, are considered a conservation-reliant species. This keystone species can maintain self-sustaining wild populations; however, they require ongoing management actions because threats are pervasive, recurrent and put them at risk of extinction. The origin of these threats are rooted in the changing socio-economic, political and spatial organization of society in India. Tigers have become extinct in some areas because of extrinsic factors such as habitat destruction, poaching, disease, floods, fires and drought, decline of prey species for the same reasons, as well as intrinsic factors such as demographic stochasticity and genetic deterioration. Recognizing the conservation reliance of tigers, Project Tiger is establishing a national science-based framework for monitoring tiger population trends in order to manage the species more effectively. India now has 28 tiger reserves, located in 17 states. These reserves cover including 1.14% of the total land area of the country. These reserves are kept free of biotic disturbances, forestry operations, collection of minor forest products, grazing and human disturbance. The populations of tigers in these reserves now constitute some of the most important tiger source populations in the country.  Future  The magnitude and pace of human impacts on the environment make it unlikely that substantial progress will be made in delisting many species unless the definition of \\"recovery\\" includes some form of active management. Preventing delisted species from again being at risk of extinction may require continuing, species-specific management actions. Viewing \\"recovery\\" of \\"conservation-reliant species\\" as a continuum of phases rather a simple \\"recovered/not recovered\\" status may enhance the ability to manage such species within the framework of the Endangered Species Act. With ongoing loss of habitat, disruption of natural cycles, increasing impacts of non-native invasive species, it is probable that the number of conservation-reliant species will increase. It has been proposed that development of \\"recovery management agreements\\", with legally and biologically defensible contracts would provide for continuing conservation management following delisting. The use of such formalized agreements will facilitate shared management responsibilities between federal wildlife agencies and other federal agencies, and with state, local, and tribal governments, as well as with private entities that have demonstrated the capability to meet the needs of conservation-reliant species.

He was critical of problems at the local and federal governmental level in providing services related to child development and family support, arguing that a comprehensive system of social welfare provision should be made available to all Americans comparable to similar systems offered in Western Europe. Birth and education Born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn Kahn to a Jewish family and was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. After moving with his family to the Bronx, he attended DeWitt Clinton High School. He attended City College of New York, graduating in 1939, and then attended the Seminary College of Jewish Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary where he earned a degree in Hebrew letters.Grimes, William. \\"Alfred J.

Service in the USAF Serving in the United States Army Air Forces (now the USAF) during World War II, Kahn served at Drew Field near Tampa, Florida where he participated in that branch's first mental-hygiene unit, studying the connections between childhood experiences of soldiers and their propensity to experience battlefield stress or go AWOL. After military service After leaving military service, his experiences in the Air Force led him to pursue a master's degree in social work and Kahn was hired by Columbia University School of Social Work as an instructor in 1947. In 1952, he was awarded the school's first doctorate granted in the field of social welfare, writing a dissertation on New York's Children's Court; He was appointed as Associate Professor of Social Work and Social Research at the school.Staff. \\"Doctorate at Columbia First of Its Kind in State\\", The New York Times, June 5, 1952. Accessed February 21, 2009. Kahn's report on the Children's Court in New York, was based on a three-year study he performed under the auspices of the Citizens' Committee on Children and with the cooperation of Presiding Justice John Warren Hill. An editorial in The New York Times about the report cited the work as an unprecedented look behind the scenes of Children's Court, which is normally closed to the public and the press. Kahn was able to examine records, interview staff and to observe cases as they were being decided. While complimentary of some aspects of the court's operation, Kahn called the system \\"a dream still unrealized\\" that needed to focus more on rehabilitation than punishment.Editorial. \\"CHILDREN'S COURT\\", The New York Times, October 17, 1953. Accessed February 2, 2009. He began with work on childhood development and delinquency, later branching out to include research on the underlying causes of poverty. He argued that social services provide by local, state and federal governments should be treated as a \\"social utility\\", similar to fire departments and post offices, rather than being derogated as \\"welfare\\" and that these services should be offered to all, not just the poor. Starting in the 1970s, he developed numerous studies comparing how social welfare services are provided in the U.S. and Europe. During his 57 years teaching at the Columbia University School of Social Work, he provided oversight of social services provided New York, writing numerous reports for the Citizens' Committee for Children on subjects such as child-guidance programs, juvenile courts and truancy. In a 1965 interview with the New York Post he stated that \\"I represent a concern for what is being accomplished, rather than what is being done\\", noting that \\"'Services rendered' are not enough. I want to know what's going on.\\" A 109-page report titled \\"For Children in Trouble\\" written by Kahn and released in 1957 by the Citizens' Committee for Children argued that the city's efforts for children \\"does not deal adequately with children in trouble\\". Kahn's recommendations included a new City Children's Bureau, or a strengthened existing one, that would oversee programs on a more systematic basis to address the issue that \\"inadequate measures are often taken because of community self-deception\\" that the institutions and resources available are capable of meeting a child's need. The report cited lengthy waiting lists and overcrowding at institutions intended to serve children and a 50-60% recidivism rate by age 21 for children released from State Training Schools.Staff. \\"'CHILD IN TROUBLE' FOUND NEGLECTED; Social Work Report Urges New or Reorganized City Unit to Give Better Aid RISE IN ARRESTS NOTED Among Reforms Suggested Are a Bed-Space Register and More Residences\\", The New York Times, June 3, 1957.

A 1960 report prepared by Kahn for the Citizens' Committee for Children showed that most juvenile delinquents sent to state facilities come out with their antisocial tendencies reinforced and these training schools focus too much stress on punishment than rehabilitation. In the face of public pressure to do something about the growing delinquency problem, judges were deemed to ready to send youths to institutions despite knowing that these facilities have \\"so many negative features as to render [them] little more than a place to hold a child in custody\\". Kahn recommended follow-up care following release among a list of other recommendations that included segregating children under 12 from older children, special facilities for disturbed delinquents and halfway houses for those released from facilities.Staff. \\"INSTITUTIONS SEEN HARMING YOUTHS; Committee for Children Say Most Delinquents Return With Antisocial Views\\", The New York Times, June 5, 1960.

None of these survive. Bao Thien Tower State historical documents record construction of a 13 level tower in 1057 with 12,000kg of bronze being used to create a bell mounted at the top of tower where doors were also made from bronze. The tower was 80 meters high, considerably higher than other structures, but inherently weak: in 1225 the peak of the tower fell during a storm, and the top partly collapsed again in 1322. In 1426 during an invasion by Ming troops, Ming General Wong Tong ordered the bronze to be taken to make weapons but is unlikely that he ordered the tower itself to be destroyed. The tower apparently still exist in 1490 and is depicted on a contemporary map. The tower collapsed again in 1542 and was never repaired or replaced. In 1791 some of the remaining structure of the tower was recycled to repair the nearby citadel. Finally, the tower was declared unsafe and torn down in 1864 to be replaced by a Christian church - now known as the Great Church or St. Joseph's Cathedral. Quy Dien Bell Around 1049, the One Pillar Pagoda was built in the centre of a pond and during renovations to the building in 1105, a huge bell, named Giac The Chung - the bell that awakens people in the world - was constructed from 12,000kg of bronze. However, the bell was too heavy to be hung and since it could not be rung on the ground, it was dropped into a deep rice field nearby. The bell was later found to be surround by tortoises and hence it was renamed Quy Dien Chung - tortoise-field bell. During the Ming invasion, in 1426, the bell was also requisitioned by Ming General Wong Tong to be used to make weapons. The one-pillar pagoda was renovated several times between 1840 & 1850 and also 1922. Buddha Statues of Quynh Lam Temple The Quynh Lam Pagoda was original constructed at the start of the 6th century and restored & improved on numerous occasions. During the 11th century Quynh was an important centre for Buddhism becoming the primary centre for the entire country in the 17th & 18th centuries. In the early 14th century, 1328, a statue of Maitreya was cast standing almost 5m tall and visible from miles around. It is recorded that 900kg of gold was contributed to the statue. The statue was the largest at the site but it is recorded that the monk Pháp Loa had more than 1,300 big and small bronze statues cast plus another 100 earth statues. During the Ming invasion of the early 15th century the pagoda was reduced to ruins and the statues destroyed. Pho Minh Cauldron The Phổ Minh Pagaoda was built during the Lý Dynasty and expanded in 1262. The entrance was guarded by a 7 tonne bronze cauldron which was big enough to contain two adults. While the pagoda survives, the cauldron suffered the same fate as other bronzes during the early 15th century Ming invasion.

It operated in the Rouergue to protect and care for pilgrims on the Way of Saint James and the Via Francigena.Goyau 1912. The headquarters of the order was the monastery and hospital called the Dômerie d'Aubrac in the town of Aubrac in the Diocese of Rodez. According to later tradition, it was founded in 1031 by Adalard, viscount of Flanders, who was beset by brigands while passing through the County of Rouergue on his way to the shrine of Saint James in Compostela. If this later story is accurate, then the Order of Aubrac is a unique example in the eleventh century of a military order in the style of the later Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller.Crawford 2016, p. 178, who cautions that \\"institutional mythology\\" often created \\"pasts of greater antiquity than the facts justified\\" in the Middle Ages.

The Order's statutes from that year survive.Le Grand 1901, pp. 16–21. They were revised several times in the later Middle Ages. The Order included priests, knights, lay brothers, noblewomen and lay sisters. Satellite hospitals, called \\"commanderies\\", were established at Bozouls, Milhau, Najac, and Rodez. Though never large, the Knights Hospitaller failed in several attempts to annex it and it remained independent and operational until the French Revolution, when it disappeared.Walsh 2003, p. 193. Paul Crawford in his 1993 study of military orders, classifies Aubrac as one of the \\"hospitaller orders which may have had military functions\\" alongside Order of Saint James of Altopascio and the Order of Saint Anthony of Vienne, while noting that it is the only one of the three that seems definitely to have had a military status.

Azoth adopts different identities such as Kylar Stern and Kagé. Other key characters are Azoth's tutor Durzo Blint (Acaelus Thorne), the gentle Elene Cromwyll (Doll Girl), and the rapist Rat (Roth Ursuul). ProtagonistsAzoth= The enigmatic anti-hero (and main protagonist) of the series, Azoth is the jaded product of a childhood spent on the streets scrounging to survive. Originally he is part of the Black Dragon Guild, a poorly established group of adolescent thieves, divided into 'Bigs' and 'Littles' (adolescents and young children). During the part of the novels spent in Azoth's youth, he is considered a 'Little'. There is quite a measure of foreshadowing in the strongly antithetical relationship between Azoth and Rat, the Fist (or second-in-command) of the Black Dragon who is out for revenge against Azoth for slights against him. Even though they have both seen the cruelest side of the world's face, Azoth chose to temper himself with a sense of justice, rightful vengeance, and mercy, whereas Rat fell to corruption and sadism. Early on Azoth displays the characteristics of a just young man born to the wrong circumstances. It has been discussed that the theme of the Night Angel is introduced during the initial book in the first three characters: Azoth, who represents vengeance, Jarl, who represents justice, and Elene/Doll Girl, who represents Mercy. These two influential characters shape Azoth to be who he is. Eventually the perceived weakness of inaction is left behind Azoth as he adopts his new persona of Kylar Stern. Azoth refers to a mythical substance found in Alchemy, capable of performing miraculous healing effects, but the novel refers to it as an old word for quicksilver and often comments that it is an unusual name for an orphan of the slum. Kylar Stern The identity Azoth assumes after apprenticing under Durzo Blint. As Durzo's apprentice, he learns the ways of a wetboy. Sent to the Drakes' to learn how to be a noble, he makes new friends and enemies. Kylar means \\"one who kills and who is killed\\" or \\"Undying Dier\\". The pun being that Kylar Stern means \\"The stern undying dier.\\" For the most part, Kylar learns that he is what is called broken—meaning that he is unable to tap into his Talent even though his body holds an enormous amount of that magic. However, Kylar later learns that he is what is known as a ka'karifer—meaning that he was one of the few people who could bond with a ka'kari. The black ka'kari chooses him to be its new master and it grants him amazing powers, not the least of which is allowing him to tap into his long-hidden Talent by bridging the hole in his Talent. The black ka'kari makes him immortal but not invincible, meaning that every time he dies, he will come back from the dead; the price of this (that he only learns much later in the story) is high, as each time he dies and returns, one of his loved ones will die in his place. His other powers are that of other wetboys, such as altered strength and speed, invisible hands he uses to push or grab things from a distance, and to turn invisible—which is considered the epitome of a wetboy. The ka'kari not only gives Kylar immortality it also allows him a certain degree of control over blue flame, which he uses to scare people. In the third book it is shown that the ka'kari can talk to Kylar and has the power to grow Kylar a black ka'kari hand after he lost it in the second book, but it likes to devour Kylar's clothes and weapons without his permission at the same time. Kagé Kagé is the name Kylar uses when he competes in the tournament hosted by the Sa'Kage early in the series. This name is later used in Kylar's trial for the death of Terah Graesin, as an alias. The Night Angel The Night Angel is introduced in the series as a deity governing the forces of Vengeance, Justice, and Mercy culminating as the Avatar of Retribution. As the story unfolds, however, the Night Angel is revealed to be the identity of the bearer of the black ka'kari. The Night Angel is immortal and can \\"devour\\" both inanimate objects (except for the magic artifacts Curoch and Iures) and magic with a touch of the black ka'kari. It can suppress the magic of anything it covers, including Curoch and Iures. Being the owner of the black ka'kari, Kylar Stern has donned this persona to drive fear to anyone that sees him, or when he loses to his emotions. =Durzo Blint= Azoth's master during his time as a wetboy apprentice. His name was originally meant to be spoken as Durzo Flint, however, during a bout of drunkenness, repeated it as Blint, and has never bothered correcting it. Durzo is over seven centuries old, and has been known by an array of names during this time, most famously (and originally) as the Prince Acaelus Thorne during the time of Jorsin Alkestes. He was the bearer of the black Ka'Kari, and is one of the best, if not the best swordsman ever to walk the earth. Possesses the ability to change his appearance at will. He has a daughter named Ulyssandra by Gwinvere. The reason he lost the black Ka'Kari, which takes its strength from love, was because he finally found the antithesis to it: indifference. Durzo was killed by Kylar shortly after the Khalidoran coup, when the black Ka'Kari left Durzo for Kylar. After being killed, Durzo returns in Beyond The Shadows as he was given life again by the Wolf, \\"for old time's sake,\\" as the Wolf puts it. With his new life, Durzo says he has to leave to go be with Gwinvere, but ends up joining the battle of Black Barrow against Khali and the Krul. After the battle, he leaves to find Gwinvere and his daughter Ulyssandra. Gaelan Starfire One of the names used by Acaelus Thorne who is also Durzo Blint during a lifetime. Gaelan is famous for his great deeds in history. It is said that he threw the blue ka'kari into the sea, creating the Tlaxini Maelstrom. Ferric Fireheart One of the names used by Acaelus Thorne during a lifetime. It is said that he threw the red ka'kari into the heart of Mount Tenji, making it an active volcano. Master Tulii The name Durzo uses when he is with the Drake family. Acaelus Thorne The best friend of Emperor Jorsin Alkestes, Acaelus was highly regarded and trusted by all who knew him and was known as a supreme warrior with an even stronger sense of justice. When the time for war came in the land, it was thought that Jorsin slighted Acaelus when he gave his Ka'Kari to the generals in army. After this apparent act of betrayal by Jorsin, all records of Acaelus ceased to exist in the land. The true events of that day though, are much different. What was done in reality was that Jorsin had given Acaelus the most difficult task of all, that being the bearer of the Black Ka'Kari, and the name Night Angel. As the Night Angel, it became his job to watch those who bore the other Ka'Kari for signs of corruption and take their Ka'Kari if necessary. Over the years, Acaelus has been known by many names and has participated in every major war in the history of Midcyru. His most recent incarnation is Durzo Blint, Wetboy of Cenaria. In Beyond the Shadows, it is revealed that he was to marry Trace the day he became the Night Angel, leaving her alone at the altar. He has been known by several names throughout history, including: Gaelan Starfire, Ferric Fireheart, Garric Shadowbane, Hrothran Steelbender, Vin Craysin, Tal Drakkan, Yric the Black, Zak Eurthkin, Rebus Nimble, Qos Delanoesh, X!rutic Ur, Mir Graggor, Pips McClawski, Dav Slinker, Oturo Kenji, Dehvirahaman ko Bruhmaeziwakazari, and Durzo Blint. =Doll Girl= Elene as a young girl. She grew up with Azoth and Jarl and was known as a mute until she cried out at Azoth to not leave her as he left to apprentice with Durzo. Her face is mutilated by Rat, as a warning to Azoth when he began to gain followers in the Black Dragon to join his sub-guild the lizards. She is later named Elene by the Cromwylls when she comes to live with them. Elene Cromwyll Doll Girl when she grows up. She is given this name by the family Kylar sends her to live with. Although her face is scarred, she possesses an inner beauty which is reflected through her gentleness and kindness. She leaves Cenaria with Kylar to start a new life and become herbalists. After Kylar leaves to save Logan, she is kidnapped and is able to understand Kylar after she does not regret killing an evil Khalidoran to save an innocent boy. Early on in the third book Kylar and Elene learn that Elene is intended to be the latest sacrifice for Kylar to maintain his immortality. Although Kylar is guilty, as he allowed himself to be executed to protect Logan's reputation without knowing the cost of coming back to life, Elene views it as a noble sacrifice to allow Kylar to live. As a favor to Kylar, Wolf promises to wait 6 months before Elene will die. At the end of the 6 months and upon learning she is pregnant with Kylar's child Elene flees and submits herself to the Goddess Khali, becoming her new host body. Kylar and the others present are forced to pool their Talent together and kill Khali while in Elene's body. =Jarl= Azoth's best friend from the Warrens. He stashed money in a sash on his tunic in hopes of one day leaving the Warrens. In response to Azoth gaining followers in the Black Dragon in an attempt to challenge Rat for leadership, he was raped by Rat and forced to become one of his \\"girls\\". Jarl was later picked by Momma K to become her successor to the Sa'Kage. After the Khalidoran coup, Jarl opened the Sa'Kage to go legitimate in Cenaria, and orchestrated the events leading to the Nocta Hemata, also known as the Night of Blood. Before he could see his plans come to fruition however, he was killed by Vi while attempting to bring Kylar back in the Sa'Kage to help assassinate the Godking. His death is the second death for Kylar's immortality, after he allowed himself to be killed for money to help support Elene and Uly. =Logan Gyre= Logan is the son of Duke Gyre and Catrinna Gyre. The Duke names Logan as the head of the family after he is sent to the Screaming Winds, an outpost in one of the few passes on the Cenarian/Khalidoran border, by Niner. Solonariwan Tofusin becomes his adviser, and during this time he also becomes friends with Kylar. Logan is betrothed to Count Drake's daughter Serah, leading the disapproval of many nobles that he is marrying below his station, as the marriage would set back the Gyre family from the throne for many generations. To save the kingdom from civil war after the king will likely be assassinated, Lord General Agon convinces Logan to marry the king's daughter, Jenine, at the banquet just before the Khalidoran's attack. In order to save the lives of Logan and Jenine, Lord General Agon beheads the King so that royal guards will protect Logan as the Prince Heir. It is an unsuccessful bid however, as the Khalidoran's capture Logan and \\"kill\\" Jenine. While being led into the Maw, Logan escapes with the help of a Sa'Kage member disguised as a guard, but is forced to jump into the Hole. Killing the guard guarding the entrance to the Hole, Logan takes his key, and jumps in. Logan spends at least three months in the hole. He manages to make friends with an unintelligent mute with filed teeth named Gnasher. Gnasher became loyal to Logan when he noticed a malformation in Gnasher's jaw, and rubbed the joints, relieving him of the pain. He also gains the friendship of Lilly, the Hole prostitute. Before his freedom from the Hole, he pardoned Lilly of the crimes that brought her to it. In an attempt to leave the Hole, he manages to get all of the occupants of The Hole to co-operate in an escape attempt. The attempt ultimately failed, with the key to the Hole falling into the hole where the Holers kicked their waste into. After being attacked by Fin, the leader of the Holer's, and killing him by pushing into the waste hole, the Holers attempt to use Fin's rope to climb down into the hole to find the key with Logan and Gnasher leading the group. Distractions from Khalidoran soldiers from above distract the Holer's and they eventually let go of the rope, trapping the men. While there, they find the key, but also find Fin who was still alive. Gnasher kills Fin by ripping his leg off. They are discovered by Kylar in the pit, who had heard a rumor that Logan was still alive and in the Hole. After escaping he rides to Terah Graesin's encampment of rebels and Pledges his service to her but eventually becomes the king of Ceneria and then onto becoming the High King. =Jenine Gyre= The daughter of King Aleine, she was given to Logan in marriage during the banquet leading up to the Khalidoran coup. She was supposedly killed by Roth in the coup, but was saved by Neph Dada. She is taken to Khalidor to become a concubine for the Godking, but is rescued by Dorian and becomes his queen when Dorian takes the Godking's throne. She is later rescued by Cenarian troops as Dorian slips into madness during the battle of Black Barrow and taken back to Logan to be his queen, and is pregnant with both Dorian's son, and Kylar and Elene's son (who was transferred into her womb via Dorian's spellweaving). =Count Rimbold Drake= A once rich noble and former member of the Sa'Kage Nine. He employed Durzo as his personal assassin during his early years with the Sa'Kage. He later abandoned his life as one of the Nine and began to follow the one God. Durzo and he are still good friends and it's with his aid that he helps turn Azoth into Kylar Stern. Drake also took in Blue so she could be raised as a lady to escape the Warrens. =Viridiana Sovari= Vi was the former apprentice of the wetboy Hu Gibbet, often considered second only to Durzo. Vi is detached from her body, and uses it as a tool to gain an advantage on missions, due to her sexually abused past. She attempts to kill Kylar this way, but fails. She kidnaps Uly and steals Kylar's wedding rings. The rings are ancient earrings, with a powerful compulsion spell. The spell creates a bond between the wearers; and once bonded, they can never be removed. Later, she helps Kylar assassinate the Godking, and binds herself to Kylar with the rings to overwrite the compulsion spell that the Godking had placed on her. This caused extreme rage on Kylar's part. Later it is discovered that the effects of the rings can be partially suppressed with immense focus and Vi uses this so that Kylar could be married to and love Elene, despite it making her suffer. By the end of the third book, Vi loves Kylar and remains at his side to support him. She is immensely Talented and later becomes a sister of the Chantry. She is offered the position of Speaker but turns it down. =Solonariwan Tofusin= More commonly known as Solon Tofusin. Solon is a prince of the Island Empire of Seth and an exceptionally strong red mage. Solon left Seth and his beloved to follow a prophecy made by his friend Dorian. Leaving his brother as king, who abused his power and squandered the countries wealth. During the coup in Cenaria, Solon uses Curoch to kill dozens of meisters and Vürdmeisters present at the castle. After using Curoch, his hair starts to grow in white. In the end, Solon returns to his homeland of Seth to find Kaede, his beloved, is engaged to marry another man. After being locked in jail and later killing the liaison, Solon asks a way to prove himself to Kaede. She orders him to kill the rest of her now dead fiance's family. He sets out immediately, even through the winter storms, he conquers them all with the help of a crazy crew and gains the nickname \\"Stormrider\\". After his success, he marries Kaede, becoming king of the Sethi. As he says, \\"I would say Emperor, but as of 10 years ago, we have no more colonies, so 'Emperor' is a tad pretentious\\" =Feir Cousat= Feir is friends with Dorian and Solon. Out of the three he is the least skilled at magic, but he is a Maker and a Blademaster of the second Echelon. After Kylar throws Curoch into Ezra's Woods, he goes in to retrieve it. When he wakes up, he cannot remember what happened to him, but during his time in the Wood he received instructions to forge a new sword which turns out to be the Ceurans' sacred blade Ceur'caelestus. Feir is the first known man to have left Ezra's Wood alive. =Dorian Ursuul= Dorian is one of the few people who are trained as both a mage and a meister. He is a Sa'seuran (Lord of Fire) and a Hoth'salar (Brother of Healing) and once a Vurdmeister of the 12th shu'ra. He has the gift of prophecy, but damages his gift before the siege at Screaming Winds, lest it falls into the hands of Khali. He expected it to take years for his power to return, though it heals much faster than he expected: after just a few months, his power begins to return. He is the son of Godking Garoth Ursuul. After the Godking's death, he takes his place as Godking Wanhope, so that Southron mages will not know of his reign. Although he tries to change the ways of Khalidor, he ultimately gives in to many temptations. Wanhope means despair. He loses his title and appears to go insane after wielding Curoch and Iures in order to stop the Krull army. Prior to his heroics, Dorian transfers the embryo of Kylar and Elene's child into the womb of his wife Jenine, hereby fulfilling his vision that Jenine gave birth to twins. During Elene's funeral, Vi realizes this truth and catches the eye of Dorian who simply smiles back at her. It has been theorized that Dorian did not go insane after wielding both Iures and Curoch but for the good of the kingdom allowed people to believe that he did. His demeanor during the funeral suggests that he had more wits about him than people believed and that he may in the future become an Ezra- type of character. =Lord General Brant Agon= An experienced Cenarian general. During the Khalidorian coup, he beheaded a poisoned and crazed King Aleine Gunder IX to save Logan. After rounding up a small group of men, he inadvertently fell into a trap set by Roth Ursuul who killed the men and crippled Agon. After the coup, Agon approached the Cenarion Sa'Kagé and offered his help in training troops to resist the Khalidorans and take back the city. He later became a trusted general under Logan Gyre, and the men he trained take up the banner as Agon's Dogs. =Duke Regnus Gyre= Husband of Catrinna Gyre and father to Logan Gyre. He was forced to marry Catrinna after his betrothed, Nalia, was given in marriage the King Aleine Gunder. Regnus refused Agon's proposal to take the throne by force after King Davin died. After the coronation of King Aleine, Aleine sent him off to the Screaming Winds to defend against the Khalidorans. During this time, Solon leaves Logan and goes to his father, only to be dismissed by Regnus the day before his family is killed by Hu Gibbet in the attack on the Gyre family. He later dies with the queen. =Gwinvere Kirena= Known as Momma K to the Warrens, she is known as the Mistress of Pleasures for the Sa'Kage and is its true Shinga. The fact she is the Shinga is known by only few people, as she elects to have puppet Shinga's in her place, the latest being the Pon Dradin. She later trains Jarl to be her replacement as she seeks to retire from the Sa'Kage. After Jarl is assassinated, she takes the role of Shinga again and leads the Nocta Hemata against the Khalidoran occupation of Cenaria. It is later revealed that she is in love with Durzo Blint. Her sister is Vonda Kirena, once Durzo's lover, who was killed when he chose personal gain over love. Before Logan and the Cenarian army go off the Black Barrow, she is granted an official title as Duchess Kirena, establishing herself an official House in Cenaria. =Ulyssandra= The daughter of Durzo Blint and Gwinvere Kirena, but she is adopted by Kylar Stern and Elene Cromwyll after the events of The Way of Shadows. She is immensely Talented and later becomes a sister of the Chantry. She is hypothesized to be the new Speaker. =Ariel Wyant= A Sister from the Chantry who possesses both high intelligence and high Talent, making her a formidable scholar and maja. While she appears to be uninterested in politics and always eager to promote the Chantry's position, she sometimes follows her own agenda. Ariel's sister is the Speaker Istariel Wyant. =Lantano Garuwashi= Hailed as one of the best warriors in Midcyru, it seemed fate played a cruel joke on Lantano. Born of peasant blood and known only as an \\"iron sword\\", due to his birth, he is unable to move up the ranks in Ceura, who base their rank upon the status of birth. He comes upon Feir, who has Curoch disguised as Ceur'caelestos, who is pretending to be a messenger of the gods. Lantano challenges Feir and during the exchange, Lantano's iron sword breaks and Curoch leaves Feir to reside upon the hilt of his old blade. Lantano and his men take this as a sign that he is the prophesied king of Ceura. Kylar later attempts to take the blade by a duel with Lantano, but after failing, tricks Lantano and throws the blade into Ezra's Woods. Feir ventures into the Woods to obtain the sword, but instead returns with the sword's hilt only (he was given instructions, supposedly by the Dark Hunter, upon how to make Ceur'caelestos). Feir returns to Lantano just before the battle of Black Barrow with the newly forged Ceur'caelestos. However, due to a lack of a ruby to produce the fire necessary to make Ceur'caelestos legitimate, all seems lost and the sword will fail inspection by the Regent of Ceura. Solon appears just before the Regent inspects the blade with a ruby allowing it to bond with Ceur'caelestos and passing the test by the Regent, making Lantano the new King of Ceura. AntagonistsRat= Azoth's former Guild Fist. He collected the Black Dragons' guild dues every week, and beat anyone who came up short. When Azoth first defied him, he raped Jarl, and when Azoth started gaining followers, he beat Doll Girl and cut scars into her face. When he tried to rape Azoth, Azoth drowned him as his initiation for Durzo. Roth Ursuul Revealed to be Rat as an adult, he escaped death thanks to Neph Dada, but lost an ear as punishment for almost being killed by Kylar as a child. He is revealed to be one of the bastard sons of God King Garoth Ursuul and was planted in the city in order to take over the Sa'kage and overthrow the government. A cruel sadist and implied cannibal who enjoys shooting arrows into starving mobs for sport, Roth threatens Momma K with the life of her daughter (though believing she is her niece) and forces her to help him seize control of Cenaria and murders several of the nobles as part of the takeover by Khalidor, while attempting to murder Kylar and steal his Ka'kari from him as a gift to his father. Roth is killed by Kylar using the Ka'kari, but slays Kylar as well. This is Kylar's first death as an immortal. =Neph Dada= One of Godking Garoth Ursuul's most powerful Vürdmesiters. Neph Dada was the tutor of Roth Ursuul. While he remains yet loyal to the Godking, he had hoped to bring Khali back to the realm of the living and with her help, become the next Godking. He was able to have Iures, disguised as Retribution, successfully stolen from Kylar while he was at the Chantry. Once in his possession, he was able to unravel the weaves created by Jorsin that kept the Krul army in stasis. While he was successful in bringing Khali back into the living realm, he was split in half by Kylar using Curoch. =King Aleine \\"Niner\\" Gunder IX= King Aleine comes to power after his predecessor, King Davin, passes on. Known to the citizens as \\"Niner\\", he is very paranoid and weak minded, with the amusing ability to know only variations of the word shit when cursing. During the celebration before the Khalidoran coup, Durzo poisons his drink with a potion that makes him laugh continuously, leading the rest of the nobles to discover they have been poisoned as well. Due to the death of Prince Aleine by Trudana Jadwin, he makes Logan the Crown Prince and gives him his daughter Jenine in marriage. In the ensuing confusion as the Khalidoran's attack, Niner forbids the royal guard from protecting Logan and Jenine, leading General Agon to behead him so Logan can be protected. =Godking Garoth Ursuul= Khalidoran Godking during the invasion of Cenaria. Had plans for the conquest of all Midcyru. He had many sons through various concubines and killed those who he saw were not considered worthy. A manipulative, psychopathic, misogynistic sadist, but also an extremely intelligent warlord with greater and more subtle, plans, powers and resources than any of his servants realise, and usually more aware of schemes against him than he tends to let on as a result. Wanted to get a ka'kari for himself so that he could survive a supposed brain tumor without realizing its true power which he witnessed was true immortality when he saw Kylar rise after being killed by Vi. Killed by Vi and Kylar. =Terah Graesin= Duchess of House Graesin. With the Khalidoran coup, and Logan being presumed dead, she assumes the title of Queen of Cenaria. Power hungry and mad, she makes Logan swear his allegiance to her when he is freed from the Hole. She is later discovered have an incestuous affair with her brother Luc and is responsible for the death of their sister Natassa, who discovered the affair. She is killed by Kylar because of her sins, making Logan, King of Cenaria. Logan sentences Kylar to death by the Wheel, one which Kylar refuses to escape due to the damage it would have on Logan's reputation. This death becomes the fifth one Kylar experiences, and Kylar learns the price for his immortality from the Wolf. =Hu Gibbet= Regarded as the second best Wetboy in Cenaria after Durzo, and the master of Viridiana Sovari. Hu is described as butcher, taking pleasure in spilling as much blood as possible, innocent or not, as an offering to his god Nysos. A violent and arrogant drug addict and murderer, he sleeps with several women and usually beats and murders them, but he claims to be in love with Vi despite frequently raping and beating her since she was a child. He was responsible for the slaughter of Logan's family, and everyone in Gyre estate. After the Khalidoran coup, he broke his oaths to the Sa'Kage, and worked for the Godking. After the events of Nocta Hemata, Hu attempts to kill a group of prostitutes at a safe house, but is killed by Kylar, who jams his head into a systems of gears. =Trudana Jadwin= Duchess of House Jadwin. She killed Prince Aleine after a long running affair with him, not to mention also having an affair with his father, King Aleine. She is known to be very unattractive, but very good in bed. She murdered Prince Aleine after her attempt to seduce him. During the Godking's rule, she signed the statues of all the Noble women and girls that he violated and killed, like they were a piece of her art. =Khali= The Goddess of Khalidor and gatekeeper (though not source) of the addictive and corrupting Vir magic that empowers their Vürdmesiters and Godkings, Khali is a powerful creature whose mere presence is extremely suffocating and oppressive even to the bearer of the black Ka'kari, and even at a distance. Use of the Vir binds the Vürdmesiter to Khali and prayers to Khali strengthen this further, but she is unable to sever a Vürdmesiter from the Vir. Khali draws powers from strong emotions and, finding suffering the easiest to generate, encouraged the Khalidorans to practice torture, rape and murder on a nationwide scale, and to make war with other nations. Non-Khalidors doubt she exist, while Vürdmesiters believe she is a senior member of the Strangers; in reality, she is merely their ally, Her real name is Trace Avagulania, the ex-fiance of Acaelus Thorne and the bearer of the White Ka'kari, which grants immortality and supernatural glamour, causing everyone who sees her to worship her beauty. At some point she lost her body and could only communicate through corpses, but she attempted to convince the Vürdmesiters to give her a living body, which Neph Dada finally did when he granted her Elene, giving her enough power to resurrect and control the entire Khalidoran army of krul as well as the Titan and numerous other monsters. However, Elene tricked her and helped Kylar and Durzo destroy the White Ka'kari and kill her. =The Strangers= The Strangers are a race of supernatural creatures from another plane of existence that allied with the original Godking of Khalidor Roygaris Ursuul, giving him access to the Vir magic and serving, reluctantly, as the armies of his successors in the event they were summoned, assuming the Godking in question could control them. They are believed to be the Nephilim, fallen angels or the spirits of their offspring. Like Khali, they manifest by inhabiting the corpses of human sacrifices, though unlike her they have an intense, murderous hatred for the living, to the point where they would always kill prisoners even if told beforehand that their lives would be forfeit if they did, regardless of age or gender- though they killed children faster. They also eat human flesh and gain strength from that. Their number system is based on 13; this is where the suspicions about the number are thought to have come from. They are rigidly bound to those numbers. For example a meister can lead 12 krul himself, but if he wishes to lead 13 or more he must master a 13th (a Daemon), which is different and more difficult, though also more powerful. This ranking system continues through multiples of 13- and thus, multiple human sacrifices, also of 13, to give them corpses to inhabit- with the most powerful and high-ranked Stranger ever summoned, a Titan, requiring and leading 4,826,809 sacrifices / krul. In order, the hierarchy of the Strangers is Krul, Daemons (White Krul), Bone Lords, Fiends, Archanghuls and Night Lords, with Titans possibly more than a single rank about them. It is unknown if there is a rank above Titan, though the Khalidorans mistakenly believed that Khali was. Destroying an army of Strangers requires very powerful magic, and only sends them back to the plane whence they came. Minor charactersJa'laliel= Leader of the Black Dragon's when Kylar was a kid still going by the name Azoth. He was the only person who Rat would obey. His death from a severe lung disease allowed Rat to gain control of the Black Dragons. But after Rats supposed, \\"death\\" the guild of Black Dragon quickly vanished. =Pon Dradin= Puppet Shinga for the Sa'Kage, died of assassination. =Corbin Fishill= One of the Nine of the Sa'Kage. He was in charge of the street guilds that operated in the Warrens. He is killed by Durzo Blint upon allegations he is a Khalidoran spy. =Catrinna Gyre= Matriarch of the Gyre family. After her husband, Regnus, is banished to the Screaming Winds by Niner, she attempts to gain control of the family from Logan, who was left in charge of the estate by Regnus. Logan subjugates her into obeying him and keeps her confined to her room under guard. She is later killed by Hu Gibbet during the attack on the Gyre family. =Vonda Kirena= Gwinvere's sister and Durzo's latest and most recently dead lover. The two shared a dysfunctional relationship with each other, with Durzo seeing her almost as often as he saw her sister. Vonda was kidnapped by Godking Garoth Ursuul as blackmail to make Durzo search for the Silver Ka'kari. Durzo makes a choice between Vonda's life and the Silver Ka'kari and goes after the Silver Ka'kari, known as the Globe of Edges, which turns out to be a fake. This act of condemning Vonda to death, for his own personal gain breaks the bond between the Black Ka'Kari and Durzo, with the Black Ka'Kari being bonded to Kylar. =Fergund Sa'fasti= Court mage of King Aleine IX, but does not possess much Talent and pretends to be a wise advisor and powerful mage. He was last seen before the Khalidoran's attacked during the banquet. He is presumed to be dead. =Devon Corgi= Devon is an ex-member of the Sa'Kage who took money from them when he left. He becomes Kylar's first kill as an apprentice Wetboy. =Serah Drake= The oldest of Count Drake's three daughters. She killed herself after she was taken as a \\"comfort girl\\" for the Khalidoran army. Her death is the first death for Kylar's immortality, when he was killed fighting Roth Ursuul. Her statue would be found in the Godkings bedchamber by Kylar and be put together on the bed with her sister Mags. She was betrothed to Logan Gyre. =Ilena Drake= Count Drake's youngest daughter. Was infatuated with Kyler for a long time. =Mags Drake= A daughter of Count Drake. She grew up with Elene and Kylar. She attempts to kill Garoth Ursuul by willingly giving herself to him, but is killed when she attempts to kill Garoth Ursuul and herself by throwing them off the balcony of the Cenarian Castle. She is later discovered by Kylar as one of many statues in the castle. Her death came as the price for Kylar being brought back to life after being shot by a wetboy. =Ulana Drake= Count Drake's wife, and the one who inspired him to retire from the Sa'kage. Her death was the price for when Kylar was killed by the Godking. =Sister Drissa Nile= A skilled Healer of the Chantry living in Cenaria City with her husband, who is also a mage. She was present at the tournament Kylar participated in as Kage and told him of his lack of a conduit for his Talent to go through, and explained to him that the only way to restore his conduit was through a Ka'kari. She heals Logan after he escape from the Hole, and is able to help partially lift the compulsion spell from Vi that the Godking placed on her. =Aristarchos ban Ebron= Ladeshian bard, member of the Society of the Second Dawn. =Blue= A second generation Black Dragon guild rat, she and her fellow guild members grew up hearing stories about Kylar from Momma K. Kylar first encounters her when she attempts to steal money from him for guild dues. The Black Dragons later ask Kylar to apprentice Blue as she deserves to be freed from the Warrens. When Kylar asks why she should be apprenticed to him, she says she wants to kill the man who killed her friend Piggy reminding him at this age when Rat subdued Jarl and attacked Elene. Later Blue sees Kylar escape from the Gyre tomb after being killed on the wheel. In order to protect his sacrifice of getting Logan to be the king Kylar sends her off to Count Drake to be raised as a lady. =Antoninus Wervel= A powerful mage of Modaini descent, he travels with Feir to Black Barrow to create Ceur'caelestos. =Scarred Wrable= A respected Cenarian wetboy and one of Durzo's few friends. He is contracted by Terah Graesin to kill Durzo, not knowing it is Kylar disguised, and kills him with an arrow through the chest (to his own dismay), causing Kylar's third death as an immortal. He is later contracted by Logan to rescue Kylar from his death at the Wheel, but Kylar refuses. He was given his name due to the numerous scars on his body. Rumors say that either the scars are from battles in the pits, or that they were self-inflicted. =Holers= Holers are the name for the criminals placed in the lowest cell of the Maw, called The Hole. During his time of self imprisonment in the Hole, Logan makes friends and enemies there, who refer to him as \\"King\\", due to his claim he is King of Cenaria. His only friends are Gnasher, a man with filed teeth who joined Logan after he massaged his jaws, relieving his pain, and Lilly, the Holer prostitute who survived by letting the Holer's use her body for pleasure, and kept Logan sane by talking with him. Gnasher later escapes the Hole with Logan and remains by his side all the way to Black Barrow. Lilly however, is turned into a Ferali by the Godking and attacks the Cenarians at Pavvil's Grove. She is sent into the mountains to die peacefully by Logan after Kylar assassinates the Godking, allowing her to assume control and beg Logan to help her. Logan's main enemy in the Hole is Fin, a man carried a long rope made of sinew from Holer's he killed. He mocks Logan constantly and bullies the other Holers. He falls into the waste hole in the middle of the Hole after being kicked in the nuts by the Hole prostitute, but survives because he holds his sinew rope and barely cushions his fall, and is later killed after Gnasher rips his leg off and he dies of blood loss. Other holers include Nine-Fingered Nick, Jake, Scab, Long Tom, Natassa Graesin and Tatts. =Lilly, Lilene Rauzana= Lilly is one of the holers before Logan's arrival. Quickly befriending Logan, she tells him to “hold onto something good” so he does not lose himself to madness as others have. Lilly lets the men have sex with her as a way to survive in the hole. She is known to look worn and unattractive, but be in her twenties. After the first escape attempt, Lilly uses sex to lure Logan's enemy Fin near the Hole and kicks him in the nuts and causes him to fall into the waste hole. Lilly then convinces the other holers to hold the rope as Logan and Gnasher climb down into the hole to retrieve the key. Before Logan steps into the hole he absolves Lilly of all her crimes. Lilly is later turned into a ferali with the other holers. Logan sees this when they are fighting in the battlefield and orders her to eat his enemies the Khalidorans instead of him and his army and then run into the mountains and she does this last thing for her king. =The Dark Hunter= The dark hunter resides in Ezra's wood. There it fights with Ezra 'the wolf'. He tells Kylar that it is his 'hubris'. At the start of 'Beyond the Shadows' Kylar lures a group of 5000 Lae'knaught into the woods and uses the hunter to kill them all. Ezra uses it to protect the artifacts of power that Kylar and Durzo threw into the woods. It imprints a mark on the items which allows it to track them for miles. The only thing able to conceal them is the Black Ka'kari. The dark hunter is a near invincible killing machine. In the last part of 'Beyond the Shadows' Kylar summons it to Black barrow by removing the Black Kakari from Curoch, thus allowing the Dark Hunter to sense its mark again, and using the dark hunter as one last being touching Curoch to complete a spell to kill all the krul. It seems to be incredibly fast. It then retreats to the woods and has not been seen since Historical charactersJorsin Alkestes= The first High King of Midcryu. One of the most, if not the most, powerful mage in history, he is responsible for the spell that created Black Barrow, which was used to keep Khali and the Krul army trapped inside of it. =Ezra the Mad= Jorsin Alkestes' friend and a mage almost as powerful as (and probably more skilled than) Jorsin. Ezra vanished in the Iaosian Forest which was later called Ezra's Wood, battling the Dark Hunter. He became immortal and resides in the Antechamber of Mystery where the bearers of the black ka'kari come after being killed. His battle against the Dark Hunter continues. The only time that Ezra is free of the Dark Hunter's influence is when it is asleep. Ezra appears to have a limited time that he is able to spend in the Antechamber of Mystery as he tells Kylar that restoring the arm that he lost will cost him time. He also refers to it when telling Kylar how he can appear to him outside of the Antechamber of Mystery. It also seems that Ezra can trade some of his remaining time in order to give extra time to those who pay the Ka'kari's price for bringing Kylar back to life (the fact that one of Kylar's loved ones die each time he perishes as the Night Angel). Also known as The Wolf. =Roygaris Ursuul= A skilled Healer and contemporary of Jorsin and Ezra, Roygaris Ursuul allied himself with the Strangers to gain control over the vir and become Khalidor's first Godking. He raised the largest army of undead krul ever created. This army is later defeated by Jorsin Alkestes but not before Roygaris Ursuul transforms his body with magic. It is said by Durzo that Roygaris turns himself into a monstrous killing machine named the Reaver. The Reaver is said to be faster than thought. Durzo was the first and possibly only one to wound it; the pockmarks on his face are proof of this as they were caused by the Reaver's acidic blood. It is believed that the Reaver is the infamous dark hunter, because it was led into Ezra's woods by Ezra himself and never heard from since.

Five of the country's Prime Ministers have been affiliated with this party, namely Liaquat Ali Khan, Khwaja Nazimuddin, M. A. Bogra, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, and I. I. Chundrigar. The Muslim League was defeated in the 1955 elections to the Constituent Assembly by a political alliance known as the United Front. However Prime Minister C. M. Ali and Prime Minister Chundrigar were appointed to lead a minority government. The party was dissolved in 1958 after the declaration of Martial Law by General Muhammad Ayub Khan, the Commander-in- Chief of Pakistan Army. History Jinnah and Muslim League founders On the foundation of Pakistan, the President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, became the new nation's Governor-General, and the secretary general of the Muslim League, Liaquat Ali Khan became Prime Minister. The All-India Muslim League was disbanded in December 1947 and succeeded by two organisations, the Muslim League and the Indian Union Muslim League, the first being its original successor in Pakistan. Jinnah resigned as the president of the Muslim League on 17 December and the two Muslim Leagues respectively elected Ch. Khaliquzzaman as President of the Muslim League (Pakistan) and Muhammad Ismail as the president for Indian Union Muslim League. =Ideology= The party remained the chief governing party for the early years after the partition. Under the premiership of Liaquat Ali Khan, the ML government successfully drafted the Objectives Resolution. Although Khan was a progressive, he introduced constitutional reforms in line with religious values and principles. The party however adopted a conservative platform under Khwaja Nazimuddin. Nazimuddin opposed equal minority rights and thus, the party lost the support of much of the progressive elite. However, much of his policies were repealed by his successors like Bogra and Ali, who promoted all sorts of liberties and equalities. The party's economic policies were pro-Capitalist. Prime Ministers like Khan and Bogra were keen supporters of a Western style economy, and promoted Economic liberalism and Fiscal conservatism. In 1950s, Pakistan signed the pro-Capitalist pacts like CENTO and SEATO, quenching any possible chance of communist influence in the country. Despite Muslim League's support for Islam, the party did not take any action against the Usury payments, attracting criticism from religious parties. End of party Jinnah died in September 1948 and Liaquat was assassinated in October 1951. Robbed of its two senior leaders, the League began to disintegrate. By 1953, dissensions within the League had led to the formation of several different political parties. Liaquat was succeeded by Khawaja Nazimuddin, a Bengali, who was forced out of office in April 1953. Pakistan was racked by riots and famine, and in the first national elections in May 1955 (held by a system of indirect voting) the League was heavily defeated. In October 1958, the Army seized power and the martial law regime of Muhammad Ayub Khan banned all political parties. This was the end of the old Muslim League. Other parties by the same name The name still held great prestige, however, and Ayub Khan later formed a new party, the Convention Muslim League. The opposition faction became known as the Council Muslim League. This latter group joined a united front with other political parties in 1967 in opposition to the regime. But when the military regime of Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan fell in December 1971, and Pakistan's first genuine free elections were held but the military did not allow the majority winner to take office. Bhutto's PPP was swept out of power: West Pakistan dominated by the Pakistan Peoples Party of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto lost massively and the Awami League of East Pakistan heavily won the ballot under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. However, a larger conspiracy did not allow Awami League to be sworn into power. War ensued and East Pakistan became Peoples Republic of Bangladesh on March 26th 1971. After 1971 in Pakistan(West) the PPP led by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took power. 1977 Bhutto was removed by General Ziaul Haq through a coup. 1988, after the death of Pakistan's military ruler and later civilian President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a new Muslim League was formed under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, but it had no connection with the original Muslim League. Sharif was Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993 and again from 1997 to 1999, when he was ousted in Pakistan's third military coup. At the controversial elections held by the military regime of Pervez Musharraf in October, five different parties using the name Muslim League contested seats. The largest of these, the Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam), won 69 seats out of 272, and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), loyal to Nawaz Sharif, won 19 seats. After the elections in 2008, Quaid-e-Azam league was in the ruling coalition and the Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League sat in opposition. In the recent 2013 elections Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) emerged as the largest party in the country; the party formed its government at the center and Nawaz Sharif was re elected for third term as Prime Minister of Pakistan. =Current factions of re founded party= * Pakistan Muslim League (N) (Nawaz) * Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (Quaid-e-Azam Group) * Pakistan Muslim League (F) (Functional) * Pakistan Muslim League (Z) (Zia-ul-Haq Shaheed) * Awami Muslim League * All Pakistan Muslim League References *Main *Main2 Category:Defunct political parties in Pakistan Category:Political parties established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Pakistan Category:Political parties disestablished in 1958 Category:1958 disestablishments in Pakistan ","title":"Muslim League (Pakistan)"},{"id":"21650722","text":"Abdulla Saeed (; born 25 September 1964) was the Chief Justice of the Maldives from September 18, 2008 to August 10, 2008 and December 15, 2014 to June 20, 2018.

Canadian consular and passport services are provided through other Canadian diplomatic missions in other countries in the Middle East while Iran maintains an interests section at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. The government headed by PM Justin Trudeau which took office in 2015, has reportedly been reviewing relations with Iran and, like most countries, lifted most of its economic sanctions following the Iran nuclear agreement in July 2015. History Americans display their gratitude for Canadian efforts during the Canadian Caper, a rescue mission of American diplomats during the November 1979–January 1981 Iran hostage crisis. Prior to 1955, Canadian Consular and Commercial Affairs in Iran were handled by the British Embassy. Foreign relations and diplomatic ties between Canada and Iran began with the founding of an Iranian mission in Ottawa in 1956, and a Canadian mission in Tehran in 1959. The Canadian mission was granted embassy status in 1961. The most significant event took place during the Iranian revolution of 1979, when the Canadian embassy hid six American diplomats after the violent takeover of the U.S. embassy. The Canadian government played a key role in arranging the departure of these diplomats undetected by officials. In January 1980, the Americans were secretly smuggled out of Iran using Canadian passports. In parallel, all Canadian diplomats left to avoid retaliation from the Iranian regime. =Rupture of relations under the Khomeini regime= Formal relations between the two nations continued uninterrupted from 1955 until 1980. When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iranian Revolution drove the Shah from the country in 1979, the Canadian Embassy scrambled to evacuate the 850 Canadian workers in Iran while the embassy staff remained. Six American diplomats took refuge in the Canadian embassy after Iranian student protesters stormed the U.S. embassy, and the Canadian government, in coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency, safely evacuated them from the country using Canadian passports with forged Iranian visas. This covert rescue became known as the \\"Canadian Caper\\", and while it improved Canada's relations with the United States, Canada–Iran relations became more volatile. The embassy staff were quickly evacuated for fear of retribution against Canadians, and the embassy was closed in 1980. =Resumption of diplomatic relations under Khamenei= From 1980 to 1988, Canada and Iran did not have normal diplomatic ties, though relations were not formally severed. The Canadian government was reluctant to reopen an embassy, both because of the history, and given the Iranian government's history of kidnapping and torturing diplomats. In 1988, the two governments agreed to resume diplomatic relations at a low level, and the Canadian embassy in Tehran was re-opened. Due to rocky relations after the Iranian Revolution, Iran did not establish an embassy in Canada until 1991. Its staff, which had been living in a building on Roosevelt Avenue in Ottawa's west end, moved into 245 Metcalfe Street in the Centretown neighbourhood of Ottawa, and the mission was upgraded to embassy status. In Tehran, the Canadian Embassy had been located at 57 Shahid Sarafaz Street and Ostad Motahari Avenue. The mission was staffed by a chargé rather than a full ambassador. The nations formally exchanged ambassadors in 1996. Canadian concerns over human rights abuses in Iran, its record on nuclear non- proliferation, Holocaust denial and threats to destroy Israel, and its active opposition to the Middle East peace process led to a policy of \\"controlled engagement\\" by Canadian diplomats. Bilateral ties were restricted, such as preventing direct air links between the two countries or the opening of Iranian consulates and cultural centres in Canada (other than the embassy in Ottawa). Canada has also continued to express its concern about human rights in Iran, and in particular, issues such as the independence of the judiciary, arbitrary detention, freedom of expression, treatment of women and treatment of persons belonging to religious and ethnic minorities, including Iran's small remaining Jewish community, and members of the Bahá'í Faith. =2003: Zahra Kazemi= Relations between Canada and Iran drastically deteriorated in June 2003 when Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian freelance photographer from Montreal, was arrested while taking pictures outside a prison in Tehran during a student protest. Three weeks later, she was killed while in custody. Iranian authorities insisted that her death was accidental, claiming that she died of a stroke while being interrogated. However, Shahram Azam, a former military staff physician, stated that he examined Kazemi's body and observed obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, broken nose, signs of rape and severe abdominal bruising. This information was revealed within Azam's case for seeking asylum in Canada in 2004 Kazemi's death in Iranian custody attracted widespread international attention.Ebadi, Shirin with Azadeh Moaveni (2006). Iran Awakening. New York: Random House, p. 199 Because of her joint citizenship and the circumstances of her death, the tragedy generated considerable protest. In November 2003, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression honoured Kazemi with the Tara Singh Hayer Memorial Award in recognition of her courage in defending the right to free expression. Canada drafted a United Nations resolution to condemn human rights abuses in Iran, expressing concern for Iran's use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, particularly the practice of amputation and flogging. In response and to shift the focus, Gholamhossein Elham, the Iranian judiciary spokesman, responded by claiming, \\"The Canadian government has the worst, most backward and racist judiciary system.\\" Iran further accused a Canadian police officer of gunning down 18-year-old Iranian Kayvan Tabesh on July 14 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The police officer claimed self- defence after the teenager allegedly charged at him with a machete. Iran also presented a 70-page report before the adoption of the resolution, detailing alleged human rights abuses in Canada in an attempt to discredit the main backer of the resolution. In another incident, a prominent Canadian-Iranian blogger, Hossein Derakhshan, was detained by police in Tehran in 2008 over remarks he made about the Shiite faith, according to the Iranian Judiciary. =2005: \\"Controlled engagement\\" and United Nations Resolution 1737= On May 17, 2005, Canada tightened its controlled engagement policy by limiting talks with Iran to four subjects: # Human rights situation in Iran; # Iran's nuclear programme and its compliance with non-proliferation obligations; # The case of Zahra Kazemi; # Iran's role in the region. Paul Martin, Canadian Prime Minister 2003–2006 In October 2005, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a speech at a conference entitled \\"The World Without Zionism\\". During the speech he made comments that were widely interpreted as anti-semitic by the Jewish community and the Western world in general. Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin summoned the Iranian ambassador in Canada and gave a formal reprimand. On December 26, 2006, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1737, demanding that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment program or face economic sanctions. On February 22, the Governor- in-Council made new regulations under the United Nations Act: Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolution on Iran. Together with existing relevant provisions of the Canada Shipping Act, the Export and Import Permits Act, and the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, these provisions allowed Canada to bring economic sanctions against Iran as requested in resolution 1737. The sanctions include a ban on any trade that could contribute to Iran's activities in enrichment, reprocessing heavy water, or the development of nuclear weapons delivery systems. The regulations also deal with freezing assets and notification of travel by Iranian officials in Canada. Manouchehr Mottaki in April 2010 In June, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told the Islamic Republic News Agency that Canada was \\"hiding some spies at their embassy in Tehran and allowing them to escape\\". Mottaki told the IRNA that he warned his Canadian counterpart at the UN General Assembly in 2005 that \\"Canada should be aware of its limits and realize what country it was dealing with.\\" On November 30, 2006, the conservative-dominated parliament in Iran accused the Canadian embassy of being a \\"den of spies\\" for the United States and launched a query to investigate. Iranian MPs met with the Iranian Intelligence Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie to discuss the charges. In 2007, moves to warm relations between the two countries occurred with the Supreme Court in Iran calling for another review of the death of Zahra Kazemi, and an attempt to again exchange ambassadors. Canada rejected two Iranian candidates after Canadian intelligence suggested they may have been involved with the radical student uprising that stormed the U.S. embassy in 1979. Iran then refused to review the credentials of the Canadian candidate John Mundy, an act which Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier claimed was \\"retaliation for Ottawa's rejection of Iran's top choices\\". Mundy was later expelled from Tehran. =2010: Economic sanctions= In 2010, amendments to the Special Economic Measures Act of 2004 restricted financial transactions and economic activities between Canada and Iran that are considered beneficial to the Iranian government. In response to the Act, Toronto-Dominion Bank closed a number of accounts of Iranian-Canadian customers to comply with the sanctions. Having already imposed a series of trade sanctions in 2012, Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird imposed additional bans and froze all remaining trade with Iran. This came at a time when bilateral trade was worth around C$135 million ($130 million USD). This was enacted in protest the Tehran's nuclear ambitions and human rights record. Baird was quoted as saying, \\"The absence of progress ... leads Canada to ban effectively immediately all imports and exports from Iran\\". Statistics Canada's data for 2012 reveals exports to Iran were worth around C$95 million, mostly consisting of cereals, oil seeds, and fruit, as well as chemical products, and machinery. Iranian exports totaled C$40 million, with fruits, nuts, and textiles being most prevalent. Baird delivered his message to an approving audience in Washington at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Baird won an extended standing ovation for reiterating the government's view that Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon is the most dangerous threat to global security. While Baird's premise is to increase pressure on it until its government either surrenders or collapses, the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany have taken a different approach. They are committed to negotiation with Iran's current government, and are willing to accommodate legitimate Iranian interests. Their aim is to settle the nuclear issue, reintegrate Iran into the international economy, and support Iranian reform. Their approach is fully consistent with support for Iranian human rights. In 2003, after years of patient negotiation between Iran and the European Union, Iran agreed to all of this and also made a direct overture to the United States. The agreement lasted until 2005, when Ayatollah Khamenei became convinced that Europe was negotiating in bad faith and only acting for the United States, who remained unambiguously hostile. =2012: Baird severs diplomatic ties= On September 7, 2012 (during APEC Russia 2012 summit), Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird announced that Canada was breaking diplomatic relations with Iran. Canada severed diplomatic ties with Iran and closed its embassy in Tehran, citing Iran's material support to the Assad regime during the Syrian Civil War, non-compliance with United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear program, continuing threats to Israel, and fears for the safety of Canadian diplomats following attacks on the British embassy in Iran in violation of the Vienna Convention. In addition, Canada formally listed the Iranian regime as a state sponsor of terrorism under the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade advised all Canadians against travelling to Iran. Consular services would be assured by the Embassy of Canada in Ankara, Turkey and the department's Emergency Watch and Response Centre. Ten Canadian diplomats had already left Iran when Canada announced the closure of its embassy. This move was another step by Canada to isolate Iran in addition to economic sanctions. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was quoted as saying that the Iranian government is \\"unambiguously, a clear and present danger,\\" and that \\"the appeal of our conscience requires us to speak out against what the Iranian regime stands for.\\" Canada's foreign affairs ministry offered the following explanation: After Canada's announcement of closure, a note written in Persian was posted on the door of Iran's embassy in Ottawa that noted: \\"Because of the hostile decision by the government of Canada, the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Ottawa is closed and has no choice but to stop providing any consular services for its dear citizens.\\"  Reactions  In the Calgary Herald, Baird clarified that he 'views the government of Iran as the most significant threat to global peace and security in the world today.'\\", The Canadian embassy in Tehran remains closed, and Iranian diplomats were declared personae non gratae, ordering them to leave Canada within five days. James George, who served as Canada's ambassador to Iran between 1972 and 1977, criticized Baird, saying \\"It's stupid to close an embassy in these circumstances.\\" Ramin Mehmanparast, spokesman of the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described this development as \\"the hostile\\" action of the \\"racist government in Canada\\", which is following \\"the pursuit of Zionist and British dictated policies.\\" In addition, the ministry described the Canadian decision as \\"an abuse of international law\\" and alleged that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government is known for \\"extremist and failed policies.\\" The ministry also said that Canada is a \\"threat to international security and stability.\\" A senior Iranian lawmaker, Chairman of the Majlis (parliament) Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy Alaeddin Boroujerdi, alleged that \\"Canada is under the control of Britain, the 'governor' appointed by the British queen,\\" and that Canada was \\"blindly\\" following Britain. On September 26, 2012, Iranian Foreign Ministry advised all Iranian citizens against travelling to Canada due to increasing Islamophobia and Iranophobia. Furthermore, the ministry said that they have been cases of arrests and expulsions of Iranian expatriates under various pretexts and Iranians are deprived of their basic rights to continue with their ordinary activities, including the right to access their banking accounts and do ordinary transactions and that Iranians are murdered but not investigated in any significant way by Canadian police. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Canada for the decision, calling it a \\"moral, courageous step\\" which sends a message to the international community that it can not allow \\"the dark regime in Iran to get nuclear weapons.\\" Netanyahu called on other members of the international community to follow Canada's lead and \\"set moral and practical red lines\\" to Iran. As of June 13, 2019, Canadian interests in Iran are represented by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/good-offices_switzerland-to-represent- iranian-interests-in-canada/45029422 Originally, Italy represented Canada's interests until 2019. On October 22, 2013, Oman agreed to serve Iranian interests in Canada at its embassy in Ottawa after providing services (July 2012 – October 2013) for the UK.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-10/23/c_132824344.htm = 2015: Justin Trudeau era= Justin Trudeau said within the first month of the October 2015 election which brought him to power that he had plans to restore relations between the two nations, in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal, which the outgoing Harper government had strongly opposed.  JCPOA  Following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement on 16 January 2016 by Iran and P5+1, the Canadian trade minister Chrystia Freeland announced on 5 February 2016 that they will lift economic sanctions against Iran, which will allow Canadian companies to do business with Iran but will maintain restrictions on exports relating to nuclear goods and technologies and anything that could help Iran in developing ballistic missiles. This also includes a list of individuals and companies that have associations with the Iranian government. In 2013 alone, the Canadian government (under Stephen Harper) has imposed a complete trade embargo on Iran and economic sanctions and travel restrictions against 78 individuals and 508 companies and organizations. Canadian foreign minister Stéphane Dion has also supported the lifting of Canadian economic sanctions but voiced concerns about Iran's role in the Middle East, its standoff with Israel, its ballistic missile program and its worsening human rights record. In his March 2016 speech at the University of Ottawa, Dion said that breaking off diplomatic ties with Iran \\"had no positive consequences for anyone\\"—not for Canadians, not for Iranians, not for Israelis and not for global security. He has also made calls to start re-engaging with Iran in order \\"to play a useful role in that region of the world.\\" See also * Iranian Canadian * Protecting power * Iran–United States relations * Iran–United Kingdom relations * Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 ReferencesExternal links * Canada- Iran Relations - Government of Canada Iran Category:Bilateral relations of Iran ","title":"Canada–Iran relations"},{"id":"21650844","text":"The Bridge (Concept of a Culture) is the seventh studio album by American hip hop recording artist Grandmaster Flash, his first studio album since 1998's Flash is Back.

History The station was built by the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad (later the Union Pacific Railroad) in 1923 to serve the railroad's division point on the mainline between Los Angeles, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah. The depot is a two-story wood frame stucco building. The first floor held the passenger waiting room, station agent's office and other railroad offices. The second floor was used as a hotel. The division point at Caliente served as a maintenance facility and was a base for helper locomotives. In the 1950s, as diesel locomotives replaced steam, the railroad no longer needed to use the Caliente site. Maintenance of the locomotives was moved to Las Vegas in 1948. Until 1993, the station saw service on Amtrak's Desert Wind. Present day In 1970, the building was turned over to the city of Caliente. In order to preserve the depot structure, the city moved its municipal services into the building. The station is now the Caliente city hall, library, and art gallery. See also *William A.

Alt URL The SWAT was to be ready for deployments on 1 March of that year in Dhaka and even outside if required. The SWAT was to be more powerful than the Bangladesh Police Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and could be deployed to deal with terrorist groups and any criminals. The SWAT completed a 45 day training program conducted by nine United States experts from the Army, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Police which was financed by the United States. The United States also provided equipment including M4 carbines, SR-25 sniper rifles and Glock 17 pistols. In 2016, the SWAT was placed under the command of the newly formed Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime. In the same year, the SWAT had 50 members, with 20 new recruits to receive training in the United States with the SWAT aiming to expand to the unit to 100 members.

It is speculated that the attacks were intended to be similar to the September 11 attacks, where aircraft were used as flying bombs and crashed directly into their targets. However the attacks failed as the Sri Lanka Air Force detected the two explosive packed aircraft and shot them down before they reached their presumed targets, although one crashed into a government building in Colombo. On the ground, two people died and over 50 were injured as a result of the attacks. Background The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers, was a separatist militant organization that was fighting to create an independent Tamil state in the north and east of Sri Lanka. Between 1983 and 2009, they engaged in violent conflict with the military of Sri Lanka, which resulted in the deaths of an estimated 70,000 people. During their campaign, the Tamil Tigers used a variety of controversial tactics, including the extensive use of suicide bombers and suicide jackets. The Tamil Tigers are designated as a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States, Canada, and the member nations of the European Union.For a full list of states that have proscribed the LTTE, see Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam#Proscription as a terrorist group By 2002, the Tamil Tigers controlled an area of approximately 15,000 km2 in north and east Sri Lanka. At the time, facing increasing losses on the battlefield and international pressure to stop the fighting, both sides were persuaded to engage in internationally mediated peace talks. The much- hyped peace process carried on until July 2006, when the Tamil Tigers blocked a canal supplying water to an area under the control of the Sri Lankan government. The Sri Lanka Army initially launched an offensive to reopen the canal, and captured the waterway two weeks later. After the success of the operation, the Sri Lankan military expanded their offensive, gaining control of the entire Eastern Province in mid-2007, and confining the LTTE to an area of approximately 100 km2 by February 2009. A civilian Zlin Z-143 similar to the ones believed to have been used in the attack The first reports of aircraft being in the possession of the LTTE came in 1998, when the pro-LTTE website TamilNet reported that a Tiger aircraft sprinkled flowers over a cemetery in Mullaithivu. However the LTTE did not use aircraft as offensive weapons until March 2007, when they launched a surprise attack against Colombo using light aircraft to drop a bomb on the main base of the Sri Lanka Air Force. The LTTE are believed to have smuggled a number of light aircraft into Sri Lanka during the 2002–06 ceasefire period, and were first detected by UAVs of the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2005. Up to February 2009, the LTTE carried out seven other air attacks against government targets, with the Air Force claiming to have shot down a Tamil Tiger aircraft on one occasion. The LTTE are believed to have used Zlín Z 143 light aircraft for their attacks. The Z-143 is a single engine, low-winged monoplane manufactured in Czechoslovakia, mainly used for training purposes. It is normally a four-seater, but was modified by the LTTE to carry four bombs fitted to its undercarriage. The Tamil Tigers are the only group known to use Z-143s for military purposes. Attacks With the Sri Lankan military on the verge of winning the war, the Tamil Tigers launched their first suicide air attack on the night of February 20, 2009. Two aircraft took off from a narrow road in Puthukkudiyirippu in the Mullaithivu District, and were sighted by Sri Lanka Army personnel operating along the front lines around 8:30 pm. The aircraft were soon detected by a Sri Lanka Air Force radar installation at Vavuniya. The aircraft, which had switched off their lights to avoid detection, proceeded towards Mannar and then southwards towards Colombo. Twenty minutes after the detection of the aircraft, an F-7 interceptor of the Sri Lanka Air Force was scrambled to intercept the planes, but was unable to do so due to the low altitude of the Tamil Tiger aircraft. The two Tamil Tiger aircraft then flew past the Bandaranaike International Airport, and three international flights were subsequently canceled. At 9:47 pm the aircraft entered airspace above Colombo, and air defense systems were activated. As a precaution, the power supply to the city of Colombo was cut, plunging the city into darkness. As one of the aircraft circled over Colombo Harbor and took a turn over Galle Face Green, it was hit by anti-aircraft gunfire. At 9:51 pm it crashed into the 12th floor of the 15-story Inland Revenue Department (IRD) building, which is located on Sir Chittampalam Gardiner Mawatha. The impact triggered the explosives packed into the plane, setting part of the building on fire. Two people were killed and over 50 injured in the crash, and a military statement said \\"parts of strewn pieces of flesh said to be that of the Tiger pilot\\" were found inside the building. The engine of the plane was found on the 12th floor of the building. Unable to proceed due to heavy anti-aircraft gunfire, the second aircraft headed back towards the Air Force base located next to Bandaranaike International Airport. However the aircraft was shot down before it reached the base, crashing at 9:59 pm. Six civilians were injured in the crash. The wreckage of the aircraft, along with the body of the pilot, was found by the military. The pilot had two cyanide capsules and a powerful bomb attached to him. Investigations conducted at the crash sites indicated that for the first time, the Tamil Tiger aircraft were packed with explosives, rather than carrying bombs as they had previously done. It was estimated that there were 215 kg of C-4 plastic explosives inside each plane. Reaction The Ministry of Defence released footage taken from an infrared Sri Lanka Navy surveillance camera of the aircraft crashing into the IRD building. Meanwhile, the LTTE released pictures of who they claimed were the two cadres who flew the two aircraft, posing with the leader of the LTTE Velupillai Prabhakaran. They also released a letter allegedly written by one of the cadres urging other Tamils to join the LTTE and fight Sri Lanka. There was concern among Sri Lankan media as to why the aircraft weren't intercepted before reaching the capital. An Air Force spokesman said since the Tamil Tiger craft were flying at extremely low height of around , it was impossible for the fighter aircraft of the Air Force to engage them. He said that instead the Air Force was ready to shoot down the planes using anti-aircraft guns when they reached Colombo. The military believes that the target of the first plane was either the Sri Lanka Air Force Headquarters, which was adjacent to the Inland Revenue Department building, or the President's House or Army Headquarters, which were also in the area. However, after the aircraft was hit, the pilot lost control and crashed into the IRD building. The second aircraft is believed to have targeted aircraft hangars at the Air Force base at Katunayake. Given the amount of explosives packed inside the aircraft, there could have been severe devastation if they had hit their targets. Although the Tamil Tigers claimed in a statement that they had launched successful air raids against Sri Lanka Air Force installations, the attacks are largely seen as failures. However they did send out a message that the Tamil Tigers were still capable of launching attacks against Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government called the attacks a \\"desperate attempt by the LTTE to bring it into the limelight at a time when it was facing a disgraceful defeat\\" on the battlefield, and a spokesman said terrorist organizations typically would not waste such valuable resources in this manner unless there was no hope in winning.

It is perhaps the most common theme in Bhutanese folk art, featuring on many temple murals, stupas, and as a decorative pattern on many daily utensils. It is the best-known national folktale of Bhutan and is popular in Tibet and Mongolia: it is widely referred to in these cultures.  Outline of story  25 tam banknote, dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented. A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a hornbill) on top of each other. The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co- dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life. The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple Śāriputra. Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the five precepts and teaching them to others. One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the Pāli version, called the Tittira Jataka.  Themes  Wall painting, upright=0.5 Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a pecking-order according to strength, size and power: it is which is most respected, not the elephant. Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, \\"the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience\\". However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the as a monk ('; ') is measured, rather than . Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: \\"A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: one's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth. Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others.\\" The four animals represent the different habitats of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground. The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding of language. The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence. The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.  Origins  A bronze statue by upright=0.6 The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the Vinayavastu (), which forms the first section of the Kangyur, the canon of Tibetan Buddhism. In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the Pāli Canon of Theravāda Buddhism, and in the texts of the Mahāsāṃghika, Mūla-Sarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda orders, almost the same Jātaka tale is found in the Vinaya and Jātaka collections. The Dharmaguptaka and Mahīśāsaka orders did not consider the story part of the Jātaka, however, and only included it in their Vinayas. Bhikkhu Analayo believes that the story originally was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but a didactic parable taught by the Buddha.  Similar motifs worldwide  Old Irish scholar Eleanor Hull has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Most versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the Jātaka do. As for the fourth animal not present in the Pāli version, the hare—it was included in later versions. A similar story was made famous when the Brothers Grimm included it in their collection of folk tales, as the \\"Town Musicians of Bremen\\".

World War II She spent the early part of 1940 plying between Norway and the United Kingdom. She joined Convoy HN 25, which left Bergen on 7 April 1940, thus managing to get out of Norway just before the German invasion which was initiated on 9 April. She spent the rest of 1940 in the coastal waters around the UK, with occasional passages across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada. In 1941 she made one voyage to West Africa visiting Lagos and Port Harcourt as well as crossing the Atlantic twice, visiting Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York City. During these voyages she carried various general cargoes, as well as palm kernels from Nigeria and lumber from North America. During 1942 and early 1943 she sailed in the areas around the British Isles, before a voyage to Gibraltar and North Africa as part of Convoy KMS16 commencing in June. She remained in the Mediterranean until her return to Liverpool in February 1944. After spending four months undergoing repairs, she returned to service around the British Isles in July, continuing until her final voyage. =Final voyage= On 23 February 1945, Corvus departed Garston near Liverpool bound for Plymouth with a cargo of 1,800 tons of coal, with Alexander Wallace as captain, carrying a crew of 22 plus a DEMS gun crew of three British Royal Navy gunners. She changed convoy at Mumbles, and left Mumbles Head on the morning of 26 February to join Convoy BTC 81 near Scarwater Lightship. At 10:15 BST on 27 February, the convoy was attacked by two German U-boats, and about seven miles from Lizard Point, Cornwall (at ). She was hit by a torpedo launched by U-1018 which ripped her starboard side open, causing her to develop a heavy list and sink within minutes, resulting in the death of four of the freighter's Norwegian crew, the Latvian stoker, a 16-year-old British cabin boy, Thomas Boniface, and two of the Royal Navy gunners, Dennis Baker and former professional footballer Charlie Sillett. Some of the crew had been able to launch a raft, while others had to jump overboard. Most of the survivors were picked up by the British steam merchant ship Baronscourt, one survivor by the Swedish steam ship Wallonia and landed in Falmouth for medical treatment of four injured survivors. The convoy escort ships immediately launched heavy counter-attacks. Less than two hours later, both U-1018 and U-327 were sunk by depth charges dropped by HMS Loch Fada under the command of Cdr.

On 24 December 2000, news programs on Česká televize (ČT) were interrupted by Jana Bobošíková, a veteran presenter at the channel and the newly appointed head of the news department, sitting next to Jiří Hodač, a former BBC employee who had been appointed general manager of ČT on 20 December. The image reproduced here on a rare T-shirt appeared for a couple days on ČT as its only programming during the height of the crisis. It reads: General Manager of ČT Jiří Hodač has turned to the Council of the Czech Republic for Radio and Television Broadcasting with a request that it decide which programming of ČT is legal and authorized programming in accordance with the Act on Czech Television and which is not. Until the Council's decision, ČT will broadcast this statement as its programming. Description During the Czech TV crisis, ČT reporters organized an industrial dispute by staging a sit-in and occupying the news studio, and rejected attempts by Bobošíková to fire them. They were supported in their protest by politicians such as the then President Václav Havel and by Czech celebrities, but every time they tried to air their news broadcasts, Jana Bobošíková and Jiří Hodač would interrupt the transmission either with a \\"technical fault\\" screen reading: \\"An unauthorized signal has entered this transmitter. Broadcasting will resume in a few minutes,\\" or with their own news broadcasts featuring Jana Bobošíková and a team she had hired to \\"replace\\" the staff members she had sought to terminate; news content from Bratislava was also rebroadcast.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmXZQJVLwEc These broadcasts began being referred to as \\"Bobovize\\" by the disputing TV reporters and their supporters who opposed the new management. On the other hand, throughout the crisis, Bobošíková's supporters, such as Václav Klaus and the then Czech Prime Minister Miloš Zeman, accused the protesting ČT reporters of law infringement and claimed that those reporters who rejected the changes were not so independent after all. Vladimír Železný also criticized the ČT reporters during his show on TV Nova, \\"Call the Director\\". Following the \\"technical fault\\" screens and prevention of the news broadcasts by Bobošíková tens of thousands of people to marched in the streets of Prague and other Czech cities and towns, calling for restoration of freedom of the press, demanding an end to what they perceived as censorship at ČT. The demonstrations even drew support from the International Federation of Journalists and made world headlines. The demonstrators also demanded Bobošíková's resignation and the dismissal of the allegedly biased general manager Jiří Hodač. Hodač was even briefly hospitalized during the events. Hodač resigned shortly after the demonstrations, citing health reasons, but the protesters vowed to continue their demonstrations in order to push for more resignations and a change in the law. The lower house of the Czech Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, subsequently sacked the supervisory board of Česká televize, but a number of executives including Bobošíková refused to resign. The Chamber of Deputies then took control of Česká televize on a temporary basis until a General Director could be appointed. The Czech TV crisis eventually ended in February 2001, following the departure of the remaining executives. Many of the reporters who rebelled against Bobošíková are still at Česká televize today; Jiří Janeček, one of the news anchors who occupied the studio in protest, was later elected Director General, a role he held until 2011. Jana Bobošíková was later hired to moderate the political discussion program Sedmička on private TV Nova. She was elected a member of the European Parliament in 2004 on Železný's ticket but split with him soon.

Lifestyle urawaza were popularized in the Japanese television series Ito-ke no Shokutaku (The Ito Family Dinner Table), incorporating many viewer-submitted tips.

Plot summary Sir Wilfred Robarts, a famed barrister, has just been released from the hospital in which he stayed for two months following a heart attack. Returning to his practise of law, he takes the case of Leonard Vole, an unemployed man who is accused of murdering his elderly friend, Mrs. Emily French. Vole claims he's innocent, although all evidence points to him as the killer, but his alibi witness, his cold German wife Christine, instead of entering the court as a witness for the defense, becomes the witness for the prosecution and defiantly testifies that her husband is guilty of the murder. Sir Wilfred believes there's something suspicious going on with the case, particularly with Mrs. Vole. Cast * Ralph Richardson as Sir Wilfred Robarts * Deborah Kerr as Miss Plimsoll, the nurse * Diana Rigg as Christine Vole * Beau Bridges as Leonard Vole * Donald Pleasence as Mr. Myers, the prosecutor * Wendy Hiller as Janet Mackenzie, the housekeeper * David Langton as Mayhew, Vole's solicitor * Richard Vernon as Brogan-Moore, Sir Wilfred's colleague * Peter Sallis as the butler, Carter * Michael Gough as the Judge * Frank Mills as Chief Inspector Hearne * Primi Townsend as Diana * Patricia Leslie as Mrs. French Production The film was directed by Alan Gibson, based on a teleplay by John Gay and the adaptation of Larry Marcus. The musical score was composed by John Cameron. The cast includes many veteran and well-known actors such as Sir Ralph Richardson, Deborah Kerr, Diana Rigg, Donald Pleasence, Dame Wendy Hiller, Peter Sallis and Beau Bridges. Unlike the original Billy Wilder film, the TV version stays more faithful to the original Agatha Christie short story, including the scene where Sir Wilfred meets the scarred woman in an apartment at bad-fame streets of London, instead of meeting a cockney woman at the railway station as in the Wilder version. This version, also, instead of opening with Sir Wilfrid (renamed \\"Sir Wilfred\\") returning home, features an opening prologue where Janet Mackenzie returns to her employer's house, where she sees her laughing and drinking with someone, goes upstairs and takes a pattern from her room, and hears noise from downstairs, and discovers in shock her murdered employer, and the murderer escaped. This was Ralph Richardson's last appearance in films made for television. Kerr made her American TV production debut with this film. Alan Gibson, the director of this film, also directed The Satanic Rites of Dracula, where Richard Vernon, who plays the part of Brogan-Moore in Witness for the Prosecution, had a small role. John Gay, the writer of the teleplay, also wrote teleplays for the Lux Video Theatre, a television anthology series. Lux Video Theatre also produced an adaptation of Witness for the Prosecution, in 1953 (four years before the Wilder version).

Bardy-Świelubie differs from other emporia: The location is rather far from the coastline, and Bardy was built before 800, making it one of the earliest Slavic burghs in the coastal area. Archaeological findings indicate participation in Carolingian trade, but evidence of non-Slavic presence is missing for this early stage. In the 9th century, Scandinavians (men and women) settled the site, as is evident from the adjacent Hügelgrab grave field in Świelubie. The Scandinavian colony is estimated to have held between 50 and 70 inhabitants.Christian Lübke, Das östliche Europa, Siedler, 2004, p.58 The exact site of the settlement, whether inside or close to the burgh, is not yet determined, A Slavic burgh as a predecessor for a Scandinavian settlement is not observed elsewhere, with the possible, but not yet evident exception of Wollin.

The early Slavs were a diverse group of tribal societies who lived during the Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages (approximately the 5th to the 10th centuries) in Central and Eastern Europe and established the foundations for the Slavic nations through the Slavic states of the High Middle Ages. The first written use of the name \\"Slavs\\" dates to the 6th century, when the Slavic tribes inhabited a large portion of Central and Eastern Europe. By then, the nomadic Iranian ethnic groups living on the Eurasian Steppe (the Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans etc.) had been absorbed by the region's Slavic population. Over the next two centuries, the Slavs expanded southwest toward the Balkans and the Alps and northeast towards the Volga River. The Slavs' original habitation is still a matter of controversy, but scholars believe that it was somewhere in Eastern Europe. Beginning in the 9th century, the Slavs gradually converted to Christianity (both Byzantine Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism). By the 12th century, they were the core population of a number of medieval Christian states: East Slavs in the Kievan Rus', South Slavs in the Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Croatia, Banate of Bosnia and the Grand Principality of Serbia, and West Slavs in the Great Moravia, the Kingdom of Poland, Duchy of Bohemia and Principality of Nitra. In the history the oldest known Slavic principality was Carantania, established in the 7th century by the Eastern Alpine Slavs, the ancestors of the present- day Slovenes. Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps comprised modern-day Slovenia, Eastern Friul and large parts of modern Austria. Origins Venedi (Slavic), Sarmatian (Iranian) and Germanic tribes on the frontier of the Roman empire in 125 AD. Byzantine sources describe the Veneti as the ancestors of the Sclaveni (Slavs). Ancient Roman and Greek historical sources refer to the early Slavic peoples as Veneti and Spori (allegedly from Greek σπείρω \\"I scatter grain\\") in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and later in the 5th and 6th centuries also as Antes and Sclaveni. The 6th-century Byzantine historian Jordanes referred to the Slavs in his 551 work Getica, reporting that \\"although they derive from one nation, now they are known under three names, the Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni\\" (ab unastirpe exorti, tria nomina ediderunt, id est Veneti, Antes, Sclaveni). Procopius wrote in 545 that \\"the Sclaveni and the Antae actually had a single name in the remote past; for they were both called Sporoi in olden times\\".\\"Procopius, History of the Wars, VII. 14. 22–30\\". Later, in the 8th century during the Early Middle Ages, early Slavs living on the borders of the Carolingian Empire were referred to as Wends. Early Slavic archaeological findings are most often associated with the Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures, with evidence ranging from hill forts, ceramic pots, weapons, jewelry and abodes. However, in many areas archaeologists face difficulties in distinguishing Slavic and non-Slavic findings since the early Slavic culture over the subsequent centuries was heavily influenced by the Sarmatian culture from the east and by the various Germanic cultures from the west. Homeland Map of the Slavic homeland. Early Slavic artifacts are most often linked to the Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures. The Proto-Slavic homeland is the area of Slavic settlement in Central and Eastern Europe during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians. Most scholars consider Polesia the homeland of the Slavs. Theories attempting to place Slavic origin in the Near East have been discarded. None of the proposed homelands reaches the Volga River in the east, over the Dinaric Alps in the southwest or the Balkan Mountains in the south, or past Bohemia in the west. Frederik Kortlandt has suggested that the number of candidates for Slavic homeland may rise from a tendency among historians to date \\"proto-languages farther back in time than is warranted by the linguistic evidence\\". Although all spoken languages change gradually over time, the absence of written records allows change to be identified by historians only after a population has expanded and separated long enough to develop daughter languages.F. Kortlandt, The spread of the Indo-Europeans, pp. 2–3. The existence of an \\"original home\\" is sometimes rejected as arbitrary because the earliest origin sources \\"always speak of origins and beginnings in a manner which presupposes earlier origins and beginnings\\". According to historical records, the Slavic homeland would have been somewhere in Central Europe, possibly along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. The Prague-Penkova-Kolochin complex of cultures of the 6th and the 7th centuries AD is generally accepted to reflect the expansion of Slavic-speakers at the time. Core candidates are cultures within the territories of modern Belarus, Poland and Ukraine. According to the Polish historian Gerard Labuda, the ethnogenesis of Slavic people is the Trzciniec cultureWstęp. W: Gerard Labuda: Słowiańszczyna starożytna i wczesnośredniowieczna. Poznań: WPTPN, 2003, s. 16. from about 1700 to 1200 BC. The Milograd culture hypothesis posits that the pre-Proto-Slavs (or Balto- Slavs) originated in the 7th century BC–1st century AD culture of northern Ukraine and southern Belarus. According to the Chernoles culture theory, the pre-Proto-Slavs originated in the 1025–700 BC culture of northern Ukraine and the 3rd century BC–1st century AD Zarubintsy culture. According to the Lusatian culture hypothesis, they were present in northeastern Central Europe in the 1300–500 BC culture and the 2nd century BC–4th century AD Przeworsk culture. The Danube basin hypothesis, postulated by Oleg TrubachyovTrubačev, O. N. 1985. Linguistics and Ethnogenesis of the Slavs: The Ancient Slavs as Evidenced by Etymology and Onomastics. Journal of Indo-European Studies (JIES), 13: 203–256. and supported by Florin Curta and Nestor's Chronicle, theorises that the Slavs originated in central and southeastern Europe. The latest attempt of locating the place of Slavic origin used genetics and studied the paternal lineages of all existing modern Slavic populations. It placed the earliest known homeland of Slavs within the area of the middle Dnieper basin, in present-day Ukraine.Rebała K, Mikulich A, Tsybovsky I, Siváková D, Dzupinková Z, Szczerkowska-Dobosz A, Szczerkowska Z. \\"Y-STR variation among Slavs: evidence for the Slavic homeland in the Middle Dnieper Basin\\". Journal of Human Genetics 52(5):406-14 · February 2007 Linguistics Slavic language distribution, with the Prague-Penkov-Kolochin complex in pink, and the area of Slavic river names in red. Proto-Slavic began to evolve from Proto-Indo-European, the reconstructed language from which originated a number of languages spoken in Eurasia. The Slavic languages share a number of features with the Baltic languages (including the use of genitive case for the objects of negative sentences, Proto-Indo-European kʷ and other labialized velars), which may indicate a common Proto-Balto-Slavic phase in the development of those two linguistic branches of Indo-European. Frederik Kortlandt places the territory of the common language near the Indo-European homeland: \\"The Indo-Europeans who remained after the migrations became speakers of Balto-Slavic\\".F. Kortlandt, The spread of the Indo-Europeans, p. 4. However, \\"geographical contiguity, parallel development and interaction\\" may explain the existence of the characteristics of both language groups. Proto-Slavic developed into a separate language during the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. The Proto-Slavic vocabulary, which was inherited by its daughter languages, described its speakers' physical and social environment, feelings and needs. Proto-Slavic had words for family connections, including svekry (\\"husband's mother\\"), and zъly (\\"sister-in-law\\"). The inherited Common Slavic vocabulary lacks detailed terminology for physical surface features that are peculiar to mountains or the steppe, the sea, coastal features, littoral flora or fauna or saltwater fish.cf. Novotná & Blažek:2007 with references. \\"Classical glottochronology\\" conducted by Czech Slavist M. Čejka in 1974 dates the Balto-Slavic split to 910±340 BC, Sergei Starostin in 1994 dates it to the 1210s BC and \\"recalibrated glottochronology\\" conducted by Novotná & Blažek dates it to 1400–1340 BC. That agrees well with Trziniec- Komarov culture, localised from Silesia to Central Ukraine, which is dated to 1500–1200 BC. Proto-Slavic hydronyms have been preserved between the source of the Vistula and the middle basin of the Dnieper. Its northern regions adjoin territory in which river names of Baltic origin (Daugava, Neman and others) abound. On the south and east, it borders the area of Iranian river names (including the Dniester, the Dnieper and the Don). A connection between Proto- Slavic and Iranian languages is also demonstrated by the earliest layer of loanwords in the former; the Proto-Slavic words for god (*bogъ), demon (*divъ), house (*xata), axe (*toporъ) and dog (*sobaka) are of Scythian origin. The Iranian dialects of the Scythians and the Sarmatians influenced Slavic vocabulary during the millennium of contact between them and early Proto-Slavic.The Journal of Indo-European Studies, Number 1-2 (original from the University of California) Vol. 21 Journal of Indo-European Studies, 1993, digitalized in 2007. p 180 A longer, more intensive connection between Proto- Slavic and the Germanic languages can be assumed from the number of Germanic loanwords, such as *duma (\\"thought\\"), *kupiti (\\"to buy\\"), *mĕčь (\\"sword\\"), *šelmъ (\\"helmet\\") and *xъlmъ (\\"hill\\"). The Common Slavic words for beech, larch and yew were also borrowed from Germanic, which led Polish botanist Józef Rostafiński to place the Slavic homeland in the Pripet Marshes, which lacks those plants. Germanic languages were a mediator between Common Slavic and other languages; the Proto-Slavic word for emperor (*cĕsar'ь) was transmitted from Latin through a Germanic language, and the Common Slavic word for church (*crъky) came from Greek. Common Slavic dialects before the 4th century AD cannot be detected since all of the daughter languages emerged from later variants. Tonal word stress (a 9th-century AD change) is present in all Slavic languages, and Proto-Slavic reflects the language that was probably spoken at the end of the 1st millennium AD. Historiography The origin and migration of Slavs in Europe in the 5th to the 10th centuries AD. Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic Kingdom with Migration Period peoples along their borders. Jordanes, Procopius and other Late Roman authors provide the probable earliest references to the southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century AD. Jordanes completed his Gothic History, an abridgement of Cassiodorus's longer work, in Constantinople in 550 or 551. He also used additional sources: books, maps or oral tradition. Jordanes wrote that the Venethi, Sclavenes and Antes were ethnonyms that referred to the same group. His claim was accepted more than a millennium later by Wawrzyniec Surowiecki, Pavel Jozef Šafárik and other historians, who searched the Slavic Urheimat in the lands that the Venethi (a people named in Tacitus's Germania) lived during the last decades of the 1st century AD. Pliny the Elder wrote that the territory extending from the Vistula to Aeningia (probably Feningia, or Finland), was inhabited by the Sarmati, Wends, Scirii and Hirri.\\"Nec minor opinione Eningia. Quidam haec habitari ad Vistulam a Sarmatis, Venedis, Sciris, Hirris, tradunt\\". Plinius, IV. 27. Procopius completed his three works on Emperor Justinian I's reign (Buildings, History of the Wars, and Secret History) during the 550s. Each book contains detailed information on raids by Sclavenes and Antes on the Eastern Roman Empire, and the History of the Wars has a comprehensive description of their beliefs, customs and dwellings. Although not an eyewitness, Procopius had contacts among the Sclavene mercenaries who were fighting on the Roman side in Italy. Agreeing with Jordanes's report, Procopius wrote that the Sclavenes and Antes spoke the same languages but traced their common origin not to the Venethi but to a people he called \\"Sporoi\\". Sporoi (\\"seeds\\" in Greek; compare \\"spores\\") is equivalent to the Latin semnones and germani (\\"germs\\" or \\"seedlings\\"), and the German linguist Jacob Grimm believed that Suebi meant \\"Slav\\". Jordanes and Procopius called the Suebi \\"Suavi\\". The end of the Bavarian Geographer's list of Slavic tribes contains a note: \\"Suevi are not born, they are sown (seminati)\\". The language spoken by Tacitus's Suevi is unknown. In his description of the emigration (c. 512) of the Heruli to Scandinavia, Procopius places the Slavs in Central Europe. A similar description of the Sclavenes and Antes is found in the Strategikon of Maurice, a military handbook written between 592 and 602 and attributed to Emperor Maurice. Its author, an experienced officer, participated in the Eastern Roman campaigns against the Sclavenes on the lower Danube at the end of the century. A military staff member was also the source of Theophylact Simocatta's narrative of the same campaigns. Although Martin of Braga was the first western author to refer to a people known as \\"Sclavus\\" before 580, Jonas of Bobbio included the earliest lengthy record of the nearby Slavs in his Life of Saint Columbanus (written between 639 and 643). Jonas referred to the Slavs as \\"Veneti\\" and noted that they were also known as \\"Sclavi\\". Western authors, including Fredegar and Boniface, preserved the term \\"Venethi\\". The Franks (in the Life of Saint Martinus, the Chronicle of Fredegar and Gregory of Tours), Lombards (Paul the Deacon) and Anglo-Saxons (Widsith) referred to Slavs in the Elbe-Saale region and Pomerania as \\"Wenden\\" or \\"Winden\\" (see Wends). The Franks and the Bavarians of Styria and Carinthia called their Slavic neighbours \\"Windische\\". The unknown author of the Chronicle of Fredegar used the word \\"Venedi\\" (and variants) to refer to a group of Slavs who were subjugated by the Avars. In the chronicle, \\"Venedi\\" formed a state that emerged from a revolt led by the Frankish merchant Samo against the Avars around 623. A change in terminology, the replacement of Slavic tribal names for the collective \\"Sclavenes\\" and \\"Antes\\", occurred at the end of the century; the first tribal names were recorded in the second book of the Miracles of Saint Demetrius, around 690. According to Florin Curta, the change indicates pre-existing differences among Slavic groups. Although \\"Sclavene\\" may have originally been the ethnonym of a particular ethnic group, it became \\"a purely Byzantine construct ... an umbrella term for various groups living north of the Danube frontier, which were neither 'Antes', nor 'Huns' or 'Avars'.\\" The unknown \\"Bavarian Geographer\\" listed Slavic tribes in the Frankish Empire around 840, and a detailed description of 10th-century tribes in the Balkan Peninsula was compiled under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in Constantinople around 950. Archaeology 7th-century Slavic cultures (the Prague-Penkov-Kolochin complex). The Prague and the Mogilla cultures reflect the separation of the early Western Slavs (the Sukow-Dziedzice group in the northwest may be the earliest Slavic expansion to the Baltic Sea); the Kolochin culture represents the early East Slavs; the Penkovka culture and its southwestward extension, the Ipoteşti-Cândeşti culture, demonstrate early Slavic expansion into the Balkans, which would later result in the separation of the South Slavs, associated with the Antes people of Byzantine historiography. In the Carpathian basin, the Eurasian Avars began to be Slavicized during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps. Slavic ceramic pottery vessels, c. 8th century AD Slavic stirrup buckle, c. 7th century AD In the archaeological literature, attempts have been made to assign an early Slavic character to several cultures in a number of time periods and regions. The Prague-Korchak cultural horizon encompasses postulated early Slavic cultures from the Elbe to the Dniester, in contrast with the Dniester-to-Dnieper Penkovka culture. \\"Prague culture\\" refers to western Slavic material grouped around Bohemia, Moravia and western Slovakia, distinct from the Mogilla (southern Poland) and Korchak (central Ukraine and southern Belarus) groups further east. The Prague and Mogilla groups are seen as the archaeological reflection of the 6th-century Western Slavs. The 2nd-to-5th-century Chernyakhov culture encompassed modern Ukraine, Moldova and Wallachia. Chernyakov finds include polished black- pottery vessels, fine metal ornaments and iron tools. Soviet scholars, such as Boris Rybakov, saw it as the archaeological reflection of the proto-Slavs. The Chernyakov zone is now seen as representing the cultural interaction of several peoples, one of which was rooted in Scytho-Sarmatian traditions, which were modified by Germanic elements that were introduced by the Goths. The semi-subterranean dwelling with a corner hearth later became typical of early Slavic sites, with Volodymir Baran calling it a Slavic \\"ethnic badge\\". In the Carpathian foothills of Podolia, at the northwestern fringes of the Chernyakov zone, the Slavs gradually became a culturally-unified people; the multiethnic environment of the Chernyakhov zone presented a \\"need for self-identification in order to manifest their differentiation from other groups\\". The Przeworsk culture, northwest of the Chernyakov zone, extended from the Dniester to the Tisza valley and north to the Vistula and Oder. It was an amalgam of local cultures, most with roots in earlier traditions modified by influences from the (Celtic) La Tène culture, (Germanic) Jastorf culture beyond the Oder and the Bell-Grave culture of the Polish plain. The Venethi may have played a part; other groups included the Vandals, Burgundians and Sarmatians. East of the Przeworsk zone was the Zarubinets culture, which is sometimes considered part of the Przeworsk complex. Early Slavic hydronyms are found in the area occupied by the Zarubinets culture, and Irena Rusinova proposed that the most prototypical examples of Prague-type pottery later originated there. The Zarubinets culture is identified as proto-SlavicNew Cambridge Medieval History, pg. 529 or an ethnically-mixed community that became Slavicized. With increasing age, the confidence with which archaeological connections can be made to known historic groups lessens. The Chernoles culture has been seen as a stage in the evolution of the Slavs, and Marija Gimbutas identified it as the proto-Slavic homeland. According to many pre-historians, ethnic labels are inappropriate for European Iron Age peoples. The Globular Amphora culture stretched from the middle Dnieper to the Elbe during the late 4th and early 3rd millennia BC. It has been suggested as the locus of a Germano-Balto-Slavic continuum (the Germanic substrate hypothesis), but the identification of its bearers as Indo-Europeans is uncertain. The area of the culture contains a number of tumuli, which are typical of Indo-Europeans. The 8th-to-3rd-century BC Chernoles culture, sometimes associated with Herodotus' \\"Scythian farmers\\", is \\"sometimes portrayed as either a state in the development of the Slavic languages or at least some form of late Indo-European ancestral to the evolution of the Slavic stock\\". The Milograd culture (700 BC–100 AD), centred roughly in today's Belarus and north of the Chernoles culture, has also been proposed as ancestral for the Slavs or the Balts. The ethnic composition of the Przeworsk culture (2nd century BC to 4th century AD), associated with the Lugii) of central and southern Poland, northern Slovakia and Ukraine, including the Zarubintsy culture (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD and connected with the Bastarnae tribe) and the Oksywie culture are other candidates. Southern Ukraine is known to have been inhabited by Scythian and Sarmatian tribes before the Goths. Early Slavic stone stelae that are found in the middle Dniester region are markedly different from the Scythian and Sarmatian stelae of the Crimea. The Wielbark culture displaced the eastern Oksywie culture during the 1st century AD. Although the 2nd-to-5th-century Chernyakhov culture triggered the decline of the late Sarmatian culture from the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the western part of the Przeworsk culture remained intact until the 4th century and the Kiev culture flourished from the 2nd to the 5th centuries and is recognised as the predecessor of the 6th- and 7th-century Prague-Korchak and Pen'kovo cultures, the first archaeological cultures that are identified as Slavic. Although Proto-Slavic probably reached its final stage in the Kiev area, the scientific community disagrees on the Kiev culture's predecessors. Some scholars trace them from the Ruthenian Milograd culture, others from the Ukrainian Chernoles and Zarubintsy cultures and still others from the Polish Przeworsk culture. Ethnogenesis Rod. The Slavic population of eastern Europe expanded during the sixth century, bringing their customs and language. Although there is no consensus about their homeland, scholars generally looked north of the Carpathians. Russian archaeologist Valentin Sedov, using the Herderian concept of nationhood, proposed that the Venethi were the proto-Slavic bearers of the Przeworsk culture. Their expansion began during the second century AD, and they occupied a large area of eastern Europe between the Vistula and the middle Dnieper. The Venethi slowly expanded south and east by the fourth century, assimilating the neighbouring Zarubinec culture (which Sedov considered partly Baltic) and continuing southeast to become part of the Chernyakhov culture. The Antes separated themselves from the Venethi by 300 (followed by the Sclaveni by 500) in the areas of the Penkovka and Prague-Korchak cultures, respectively. During the seventh century BC, the Chernoles culture was loosely governed by the Scythians via trade. There was limited interaction between the Slavs, who were tribute-paying ploughmen under the Scythians, and the nomads. Their homeland in the forest steppe enabled them to preserve their language, except for phonetic and some lexical constituents and their patrilineal, agricultural customs. After a millennium, when the Hunnic Empire collapsed, an eastern- Slavic culture re-emerged and spread rapidly in the south and central-eastern Europe. According to Marija Gimbutas, \\"Neither Bulgars nor Avars colonized the Balkan Peninsula; after storming Thrace, Illyria and Greece they went back to their territory north of the Danube. It was the Slavs who did the colonizing ... entire families or even whole tribes infiltrated lands. As an agricultural people, they constantly sought an outlet for the population surplus. Suppressed for over a millennium by foreign rule of Scythians, Sarmatians and Goths, they had been restricted to a small territory; now the barriers were down and they poured out\\". In addition to their growth, the depopulation of eastern Europe (due, in part, to Germanic migration) and the lack of imperial defences encouraged Slavic expansion. With processual archaeology during the 1960s, scholars began to believe that \\"there was no need to explain culture change exclusively in terms of migration and population replacement\\".From Roman Provinces to Medieval Kingdoms: Archaeologists and Migrations, p. 264 According to historical linguist Johanna Nichols, \\"Ethnic spreads can involve either the spread of a language to speakers of other languages or the spread of a population. Massive population spread or demographic replacement has probably been a rarity in human history... There is no reason to assume that the Slavic expansion was a primarily demographic event. Some migration took place, but the parsimonious assumption is the Slavic expansion was primarily a linguistic spread\\".Russian Identities. A Historical Survey. N. V. Riasonovsky. Pg 10. Oxford University Press, quoting Johanna Nichols. Colin Renfrew proposed elite-dominance and system-collapse theories to explain language replacement. Pavel Dolukhanov suggested that their experience with nomads enabled the Slavs political and military experience, becoming a \\"dominant force and establishing a new socio-political network in the entire area of central and southeastern Europe\\". According to Paul Barford, \\"The Spartan and egalitarian (Slavic) culture ... clearly had something attractive for great numbers of the populations living over considerable areas of central Europe\\", resulting in their assimilation. \\"The analysis of Slav material culture (especially South Slavs) and results of anthropological investigations, as well as the loan-words in philological studies, clearly demonstrate the contribution of the previous populations of these territories in the make-up of some of the Slav populations\\". Byzantine chroniclers noted that Roman prisoners captured by the Sclavenes could soon become free members of Slavic society if they wished. Horace Lunt attributed Slavic spread to the \\"success and mobility of the Slavic 'special border guards' of the Avar khanate\\", (military elites), who used it as a lingua franca in the Avar Khanate. According to Lunt, only as a lingua franca could Slavic supplant other languages and dialects whilst remaining relatively uniform. Although it explains the formation of regional Slavic groups in the Balkans, eastern Alps and the Morava-Danube basin, Lunt's theory does not account for Slavic spread to the Baltic region and the territory of the Eastern Slavs (areas with no historical links to the Avar Khanate): Three kaptorgs from a necklace; jewellery from the tomb of the Kouřim Princess, c. 900 AD A concept related to elite dominance is system collapse, where a power vacuum created by the fall of the Hun and Roman Empires allows a minority group to impose their customs and language. Paul Barford suggested that Slavic groups might have existed in a wide area of central-eastern Europe (in the Chernyakov and Zarubintsy- Przeworsk cultural zones) before the documented Slavic migrations from the sixth to the ninth centuries. Serving as auxiliaries in the Sarmatian, Goth and Hun armies, small numbers of Slavic speakers might have reached the Balkans before the sixth century: These scattered groups were centers for the creation of a Slavic cultural identity under favorable conditions, assimilating or conveying their culture and language. A similar idea has been proposed by Florin Curta. Seeing no clear evidence for a migration from Polesia or elsewhere north, Curta suggests that southeastern Europe saw the development of a \\"broad area of common economic and cultural traditions ... Whether living within the same region or widely scattered, adherence to this style helped to integrate isolated individuals within a group whose social boundaries crisscrossed those of local communities\\". \\"During the early 600s, however, at the time of the general collapse of the Byzantine administration in the Balkans, access to and manipulation of such (Slavic) artifacts may have been strategies for creating a new sense of identity for local elites\\". Curta suggests that the chief impetus for this identity originated in the Danubian frontier. Scholars acknowledge that an attempt to define a localized Slavic homeland may be simplistic. Although proto-Slavic may have developed in a localized area, Slavic ethnogenesis occurred in a large area, from the Oder in the west to the Dnieper in the east and south to the Danube. It was a complex process, fueled by changes in the Barbaricum and the Roman Empire. Despite cultural uniformity, Slavic development seems to have been less politically consolidated than that of the Germanic peoples. According to Patrick Geary, Slavic expansion was a decentralized-but-forceful process which assimilated a large population with small groups of \\"soldier-farmers\\" who had common traditions and language: \\"Without kings or large–scale chieftains to bribe or defeat, the Byzantine Empire had little hope of either destroying them or co- opting them into the imperial system\\". Walter Pohl agrees: \\"Avars and Bulgars conformed to the rules of the game established by the Romans. They built up a concentration of military power that was paid, in the last resort, from Roman tax revenues. Therefore they paradoxically depended on the functioning of the Byzantine state. The Slavs managed to keep up their agriculture (and a rather efficient kind of agriculture, by the standards of the time), even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces. The booty they won apparently did not (at least initially) create a new military class with the greed for more and contempt for peasant's work, as it did with the Germans. Thus the Slavic model proved an attractive alternative ... which proved practically indestructible. Slav traditions, language, and culture shaped, or at least influenced, innumerable local and regional communities: a surprising similarity that developed without any central institution to promote it. These regional ethnogeneses inspired by Slavic tradition incorporated considerable remnants of the Roman or Germanic population ready enough to give up ethnic identities that had lost their cohesion\\". Appearance Procopius described that the Slavs \\"are all exceptionally tall and stalwart men, while their bodies and hair are neither very fair or very blonde, nor indeed do they incline entirely to the dark type, but they are slightly ruddy in color... they are neither dishonorable nor spiteful, but simple in their ways, like the Huns [Avars]... some of them do not have either a tunic or cloak, but only wear a kind of breeches pulled up to the groin\\". Jordanes wrote \\"all of them are tall and very strong... their skin and hair are neither very dark nor light, but are ruddy of face\\". Abraham ben Jacob, in the 10th century, wrote that \\"what is peculiar, most of Bohemian [Czech] people are of swarthy complexion and dark hair, while fair colors are rare among them\\". Society Early Slavic society was a typical decentralised tribal society of Iron Age Europe and was organised into local chiefdoms. A slow consolidation occurred between the 7th and the 9th, when the previously-uniform Slavic cultural area evolved into discrete zones. Slavic groups were influenced by neighbouring cultures like Byzantium, the Khazars, the Vikings and the Carolingians and influenced their neighbours in return. Differences in status gradually developed in the chiefdoms, which led to the development of centralized socio- political organisations. The first centralized organisations may have been temporary pantribal warrior associations, the greatest evidence being in the Danubian area, where barbarian groups organised around military chiefs to raid Byzantine territory and to defend themselves against the Pannonian Avars. Social stratification gradually developed in the form of fortified, hereditary chiefdoms, which were first seen in the West Slavs areas. The chief was supported by a retinue of warriors, who owed their position to him. As chiefdoms became powerful and expanded, centres of subsidiary power ruled by lesser chiefs were created, and the line between powerful chiefdoms and centralised medieval states is blurred. By the mid-9th century, the Slavic elite had become sophisticated; it wore luxurious clothing, rode horses, hunted with falcons and travelled with retinues of soldiers.Goldberg, Eric J. (2006). Struggle for Empire: Kingship and Conflict Under Louis the German, 817–876. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. pp. 83–85. . =Settlements= Grod in Birów, Poland Reconstruction of a Slavic settlement in Torgelow, Germany Early Slavic settlements were no larger than . Settlements were often temporary, perhaps reflected their itinerant form of agriculture, and were often along rivers. They were characterised by sunken buildings, known as Grubenhäuser in German or poluzemlianki in Russian. Built over a rectangular pit, they varied from in area and could accommodate a typical nuclear family. Each house had a stone or clay oven in a corner (a defining feature of Eastern European dwellings), and a settlement had a population of fifty to seventy. Settlements had a central, open area in which communal activities and ceremonies were conducted, and they were divided into production and settlement zones. Strongholds appeared during the 9th century, especially the Western Slavic territories, and were often found in the centre of a group of settlements. The South Slavs did not form enclosed strongholds but lived in open, rural settlements that were adopted from the social models of the indigenous populations they encountered. =Tribal and territorial organisation= There is no indication of Slavic chiefs in any of the Slavic raids before AD 560, when Pseudo-Caesarius's writings mentioned their chiefs but described the Slavs as living by their own law and without the rule of anyone. The Sclaveni and the Antes were reported to have lived under a democracy for a long time. The 6th-century historian Procopius, who was in contact with Slavic mercenaries, reported, \\"For these nations, the Sclaveni and the Antes, are not governed by one man, but from ancient times have lived in democracy, and consequently everything which involves their welfare, whether for good or for ill, is referred to the people\\". The 6th-century Strategikon of Maurice is considered an eyewitness of the Slavs and recommended the Roman generals to use any possible means to prevent the Sclaveni from uniting \\"under one ruler\\" and added that \\"the Sclaveni and Antes were both independent, absolutely refused to be enslaved or governed, least of all in their own land\\". Settlements were not uniformly distributed but were in clusters separated by areas of lower settlement density. The clusters resulted from the expansion of single settlements, and the \\"settlement cells\\" were linked by familial or clan relationships. Settlement cells were the basis of the simplest form of territorial organization, known as a župa in South Slavic and opole in Polish. According to the Primary Chronicle, \\"The men of the Polanie lived each with his own clan in his own place\\". Several župas, encompassing individual clan territories, formed the known tribes: \\"The complex processes initiated by the Slav expansion and subsequent demographic and ethnic consolidation culminated in the formation of tribal groups, which later coalesced to create state which form the framework of the ethnic make-up of modern eastern Europe\\". The root of many tribal names denotes the territory in which they inhabited, such as the Milczanie (who lived in areas with měl – loess), Moravians (along the Morava), Diokletians (near the former Roman city of Doclea) and Severiani (northerners). Other names have more general meanings, such as the Polanes (pola; field) and Drevlyans (drevo; tree). Others appear to have a non-Slavic (possibly Iranian) root, such as the Antes, Serbs and Croats. Some geographically-distant tribes appear to share names. The Dregoviti appear north of the Pripyat River and in the Vardar valley, the Croats in Galicia and northern Dalmatia and the Obodrites near Lübeck and their further south in Pannonia. The root Slav was retained in the modern names of the Slovenes, Slovaks and Slavonians. There is little evidence of migratory links between tribes sharing the same name. The common names may reflect names given the tribes by historians or a common tongue as a distinction between Slavs (slovo; word, letter) and others, Nemci (mutes) being a Slavic name for \\"Germans\\". The first historical Slavic state, founded by Samo in the first half of the 7th century, a short-lived tribal union that included parts of Central Europe, followed by the Bulgarian Empire in 681. By the 9th century, the states of Obotrites, Great Moravia, Carantania, Pannonia, Croatia, Serbia had emerged. =Marriage= Capturing wives and exogamy were traditions among the tribes and continued until the early medieval era. However, on some occasions in Bohemia and the Ukraine, it was women who chose the spouse. Fornication had a sentence in Pagan Slavs that was described as capital punishment by travelers, Ibn-Fadlan: \\"Men and women go to the river and bathe together naked... but they do not fornicate and if anyone would be guilty of it, no matter who is he and she... he and she would be pinked by pole-axe... then they hang out each part both of them on a tree\\", Gardizi: \\"If someone makes fornication, he or she would be killed, without accepting any apologies\\". =Warfare= An example of early Slavic armor Early barbarian warrior bands, typically numbering 200 or less, were intended for fast penetration into enemy territory and an equally-quick withdrawal. In Wars VII.14, 25, Procopius wrote that the Slavs \\"fight on foot, advancing on the enemy; in their hands they carry small shields and spears, but they never wear body armour\\". According to the Strategikon, the Slavs favoured ambush and guerrilla tactics and often attacked their enemy's flank: \\"They are armed with short spears; each man carries two, one of them with a large shield\\". Sources also mentioned the use of cavalry. Theophylact Simocatta wrote that the Slavs \\"dismounted from their horses in order to cool themselves\\" during a raid,Histories. VII. 4, II and Procopius wrote that Slav and \\"Hun\\" horsemen were Byzantine mercenaries.Procopius. Wars V.27, 1–3 In their dealings with the Sarmatians and Huns, the Slavs may have become skilled horsemen, an explanation for their expansion. According to the Strategikon (XI.4.I-45), the Slavs were a hospitable people and did not keep prisoners indefinitely \\"but lay down a certain period after which they can decide for themselves if they want to return to their former homelands after paying a ransom, or to stay amongst the Slavs as free men and friends\\". =Religion= Svetovid, a Slavic deity of war, fertility and abundance Little is known about Slavic religion before the Christianization of Bulgaria and of Kievan Rus. After Christianization, Slavic authorities destroyed many records of the old religion. Some evidence remains in apocryphal and devotional texts, the etymology of Slavic religious terms and the Primary Chronicle. Early Slavic religion was relatively uniform: animistic, anthropomorphic and inspired by nature. The Slavs developed cults around natural objects, such as springs, trees or stones, out of respect for the spirit (or demon) within. Slavic pre- Christian religion was originally polytheistic, with no organised pantheon. Although the earliest Slavs seemed to have a weak concept of God, the concept evolved into a form of monotheism in which a \\"supreme god [ruled] in heaven over the others\\". There is no evidence of a belief in fate or predestination. Pre-Christian Slavic spirits and demons could be entities in their own right or spirits of the dead and were associated with home or nature. Forest spirits, entities in their own right, were venerated as the counterparts of home spirits, which were usually related to ancestors. Demons and spirits were good or evil, which suggests that the Slavs had a dualistic cosmology and are known to have revered them with sacrifices and gifts. Slavic paganism was syncretistic and combined and shared with other religions, including Germanic paganism. Linguistic evidence indicates that part of Slavic paganism developed when the Balts and Slavs shared a common language since pre-Christian Slavic beliefs contained elements also found in Baltic religions. After the Slavic and the Baltic languages diverged, the early Slavs interacted with Iranian peoples and incorporated elements of Iranian spirituality. Early Iranian and Slavic supreme gods were considered givers of wealth, unlike the supreme thunder gods of other European religions. Both Slavs and Iranians had demons, with names from similar linguistic roots (Iranian Daêva and Slavic Divŭ) and a concept of dualism: good and evil. Although evidence of pre-Christian Slavic worship is scarce (suggesting that it was aniconic), religious sites and idols are most plentiful in Ukraine and Poland. Slavic temples and indoor places of worship are rare since outdoor places of worship are more common, especially in Kievan Rus'. The outdoor cultic sites were often on hills and included ringed ditches. Indoor shrines existed: \\"Early Russian sources... refer to pagan shrines or altars known as kapishcha\\" and were small, enclosed structures with an altar inside. One was found in Kiev, surrounded by the bones of sacrificed animals. Pagan temples were documented as destroyed during Christianization. Baška tablet found in Croatia and inscribed in Church Slavonic, records King Zvonimir's donation of land to a Benedictine abbey, c. 1100 Records of pre-Christian Slavic priests, like the pagan temples, appeared later. Although no early evidence of Slavic pre-Christian priests has been found, the prevalence of sorcerers and magicians after Christianization suggests that the pre-Christian Slavs had religious leaders. Slavic pagan priests were believed to commune with the gods, to predict the future and to prepare for religious rituals. The pagan priests, or magicians (known as volkhvy by the Rus' people), resisted Christianity after Christianization. The Primary Chronicle describes a campaign against Christianity in 1071 during a famine. The volkhvy were well-received nearly 100 years after Christianization, which suggested that pagan priests had an esteemed position in 1071 and in pre-Christian times. Although the Slavic funeral pyre was seen as a means of freeing the soul from the body rapidly, visibly and publicly, archaeological evidence suggests that the South Slavs quickly adopted the burial practices of their post-Roman Balkan neighbours. Later historyChristianization= Fresco of Saints Cyril and Methodius, both Byzantine Christian missionaries to the Southern Slavs. Page of the Gospel of Mark from Codex Zographensis, an Old Church Slavonic manuscript written in Glagolitic script. Christianization began in the 9th century and was not complete until the second half of the 12 century. The Christianization of Bulgaria was made official in 864, during the reign of Emperor Boris I during shifting political alliances both with the Byzantine Empire and the kingdom of the East Franks and the communication with the Pope. Because of the Bulgarian Empire's strategic position, the Greek East and the Latin West wanted their people to adhere to their liturgies and to ally with them politically. After overtures from each side, Boris aligned with Constantinople and secured an autocephalous Bulgarian national church in 870, the first for the Slavs. In 918/919, the Bulgarian Patriarchate became the fifth autocephalous Eastern Orthodox patriarchate, after the patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. That status was officially recognised by the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 927. The Bulgarian Empire developed into the cultural and literary centre of Slavic Europe. The development of the Cyrillic script at the Preslav Literary School, which was declared official in Bulgaria in 893, was also declared the official liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian. Although there is some evidence of early Christianization of the East Slavs, Kievan Rus' either remained largely pagan or relapsed into paganism before the baptism of Vladimir the Great in the 980s. The Christianization of Poland began with the Catholic baptism of King Mieszko I in 966. Slavic paganism persisted into the 12th century in Pomerania, which began to be Christianized after the creation of the Duchy of Pomerania as part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1121. The process was mostly completed by the Wendish Crusade in 1147. The final stronghold of Slavic paganism was the Rani, with a temple to their god Svetovid on Cape Arkona, which was taken in a campaign by Valdemar I of Denmark in 1168. =Mediaeval states= After Christianisation, the Slavs established a number of kingdoms, or feudal principalities, which persisted throughout the High Middle Ages. The First Bulgarian Empire was founded in 681 as an alliance between the ruling Bulgars and the numerous Slavs in Lower Moesia. Not long after the Slavic incursion, Scythia Minor was once again invaded, this time by the Bulgars, under Khan Asparukh. Their horde was a remnant of Old Great Bulgaria, an extinct tribal confederacy that was north of the Black Sea in what is now Ukraine. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Eastern Moesia and conquered its Slavic tribes in 680. A peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire was signed in 681 and marked the foundation of the First Bulgarian Empire. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste. The South Slavs consolidated also the Grand Principality of Serbia. The Kingdom of Croatia was established between the Kupa, the Una and Adriatic Seas, without Istria and major Dalmatian coastal centers. Banate of Bosnia emerged from the 10th century by merging localities called župas, which were remnants of Early Christianity ecclesiastical divisions. Duklja similarly started emerging in the south. The West Slavs were distributed in Samo's Empire, which was the first Slavic state to form in the west, followed by the Great Moravia and, after its decline, the Kingdom of Poland, the Obotritic confederation (now eastern Germany) the Principality of Nitra (modern Slovakia) a vassal of the Kingdom of Hungary, and the Duchy of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). After the 1054 death of Yaroslav the Wise and the breakup of Kievan Rus', the East Slavs fragmented into a number of principalities from which Muscovy would emerge after 1300 as the most powerful one. The western principalities of the former Kievan Rus' were absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Slavic studies The debate between proponents of autochthonism and allochthonism began in 1745, when Johann Christoph de Jordan published De Originibus Slavicis. The 19th-century Slovak philologist and poet Pavel Jozef Šafárik, whose theory was founded on Jordanes' Getica, has influenced generations of scholars. Jordanes equated the Sclavenes, the Antes and the Venethi (or Venedi) based on earlier sources such as Pliny the Elder, Tacitus and Ptolemy. Šafárik's legacy was his vision of a Slavic history and the use of linguistics for its study. The Polish scholar Tadeusz Wojciechowski (1839–1919) was the first to use place names to study Slavic history and was followed by A. L. Pogodin and the botanist J. Rostafinski. The first scholar to introduce archaeological data into the discourse on the early Slavs, Lubor Niederle (1865–1944), endorsed Rostafinski's theory in his multi-volume Antiquities of the Slavs. Vykentyi V. Khvoika (1850–1914), a Ukrainian archaeologist of Czech origin, linked the Slavs with the Neolithic Cucuteni culture. A. A. Spicyn (1858–1931) attributed finds of silver and bronze in central and southern Ukraine to the Antes. Czech archaeologist Ivan Borkovsky (1897–1976) postulated the existence of a Slavic \\"Prague type\\" of pottery. Boris Rybakov has linked Spicyn's \\"Antian antiquities\\" with Chernyakhov culture remains excavated by Khvoika and theorised that the former should be attributed to the Slavs. The debate became politically charged during the 19th century, particularly in connection with the partitions of Poland and the German Drang nach Osten, and the question of whether Germanic or Slavic peoples were indigenous east of the Oder was used to pursue both German and Polish claims to the region. Some modern scholars debate the meaning and the usage of the term \\"Slav\\" depending on the context in which it is used. The word can refer to a culture (or cultures) living north of the River Danube, east of the River Elbe, and west of the River Vistula during the 530s CE. \\"Slav\\" is also an identifier for the ethnic group shared by the cultures and denotes any language with linguistic ties to the modern Slavic language family, which may have no connection to either a common culture or a shared ethnicity.Paul M. Barford, 2004. Identity And Material Culture Did The Early Slavs Follow The Rules Or Did They Make Up Their Own? East Central Europe 31, no. 1:102–103 Despite the concepts of \\"Slav\\", such scholars argue that it is unclear whether any of the descriptions add to an accurate representation of the group's history. Historians such as George Vernadsky, Florin Curta and Michael Karpovich have questioned how, why and to what degree, the Slavs were a cohesive society between the 6th and the 9th centuries.Pots, Slavs and 'Imagined Communities': Slavic Archaeologies And The History of The Early Slavs. European Journal of Archaeology 4, no. 3:367–384; George Verdansky and Michael Karpovich, Ancient Russia, vol. 1 of History of Russia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1943 The Austrian historian Walter Pohl wrote, \\"Apparently ethnicity operated on at least two levels: the 'common Slavic' identity, and the identity of single Slavic groups, tribes, or peoples of different sizes that gradually developed, very often taking their name from the territory they lived in. These regional ethnogeneses inspired by Slavic tradition incorporated considerable remnants of Roman and Germanic population ready enough to give up ethnic identities that had lost their cohesion\\".

He was also a revolutionary, Soviet statesman and historian of the revolutionary movement. Teodorovich, the son of a land surveyor from Smolensk, was born into a family of ethnic Polish origin.Budaev, I.D. \\"Теодорович Иван Адольфович\\" (\\"Teodorovich Ivan Adolfovich\\").

Teodorovich was educated at Moscow State University, where he joined an early Marxist group in 1895. From 1902 to 1903, he was a member of the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. After a series of arrests, in 1903 the czarist authorities sent Teodorovich to an exile in Yakutia. Escaping in 1905, he fled to Switzerland, where he made personal contacts with Vladimir Lenin. In October 1905 Teodorovich returned to Russia and operated in Saint Petersburg, promoted to a member of the Central Committee in 1907. In May 1909 he was arrested again and remained in custody until the February Revolution of 1917. In Summer 1917 Teodorovich co-chaired Saint Petersburg City Hall, at the same time working towards the Bolshevik revolt against the Provisional Government. After the February Revolution of 1917, he left the place of exile, arrived in Petrograd in mid-March . He was a delegate to the 7th (April) All-Russian Conference, where he was elected a candidate member of the Central Committee [3] , and the VIth Congress of the RSDLP (B). From August 1917, deputy chairman of the Petrograd City Council, then a member of the council and special presence in food. After the October Revolution in the first composition, SNK took the post of People's Commissar for Food. Immediately after the October Revolution, Teodorovich became the first Commissar for Agriculture in the first Bolshevik Government. In November he resigned due to political disagreement with Lenin's majority over a coalition with the Mensheviks and other factions (Teodorovich supported a broad coalition, against Lenin's will). In 1920 he returned to the board of the Commissariat for Agriculture and rose to Deputy Commissar in May 1922; in 1928-1930 he chaired the Peasants branch of Comintern. As the Bolsheviks' expert on agriculture, Teodorovich delivered speeches to various councils and international forums, and authored brochures, journal and newspaper articles dealing with agriculture and agrarian policy. Teodorovich was a proponent of Lenin’s New Economic Policy, he further endorsed liberal land reforms (delegating authority from state to peasant on land) Contrary to the Bolshevik’s platform on agrarian policy, Teodorovich vehemently opposed the policy of food requisition and War Communism. He was a supporter of the creation of a homogeneous socialist government with the participation of the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries . After The Central Committee of the RSDLP (B) rejected the agreement with these parties, Teodorovich on November 4 (17), 1917 signed a statement of withdrawal from the SNK, but continued to fulfill his duties until December. \\"(T)he disagreement concerned the question of whether our party had to start with \\"war communism\\" or whether it was possible to proceed from what was called the \\"new economic policy\\" in 1921. I held in 1917 of the last opinion ..\\" - Ivan Teodorovich Autobiography In the articles of the 1920s, Teodorovich interpreted the NEP as a means of accumulating funds in the capitalist agrarian sector through the development of “strong” peasant farms, which was to serve as a source of funds for industrialization, including its transition to socialism. In the People's Commissariat Teodorovich supervised the work of economist N. D. Kondratiev who led the department of agricultural economics and statistics of the Department of Agriculture, provided him with certain protection and patronage (in particular, contributed in 1920 to his release from arrest). At the beginning of 1918 he left for Siberia after parting ways with Lenin's first government. In the years 1919-1920, he was in the red partisan units in Siberia. In the years 1920-1928 Teodorovich served as a member of the College of the People's Commissariat of Agriculture of the RSFSR. From May 1922 to 1928 deputy of the People's Commissar of Agriculture of the RSFSR, 1926-1930 Director of the International Agrarian Institute, from March 1928 to 1930 secretary general of the Peasant International ( Krestintern ), 1929-1935 editor of the Publishers of the Association of Former Political Excuers and Deportee, 1929- 1935 editor of the magazine \\"Katorga i ssyłka\\".

Over 125 people were infected and up to 49 people died. Several doctors were investigated and arrested after the outbreaks. Hepatitis B The hepatitis B virus infects the liver and causes an inflammation called hepatitis. It is a DNA virus and one of many unrelated viruses that cause viral hepatitis. The disease, originally known as \\"serum hepatitis\\", has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. About a third of the world's population, more than 2 billion people, have been infected with the hepatitis B virus.WHO  Hepatitis B This includes 350 million chronic carriers of the virus.FAQ about Hepatitis B , Stanford University School of Medicine The acute illness causes liver inflammation, vomiting and jaundice. The infection is preventable by vaccination. Transmission of hepatitis B results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. Possible forms of transmission include (but are not limited to) unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusions, re-use of contaminated needles & syringes, and vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth. HBV can be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact of nonintact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing HBV. However, at least 30% of reported cases of hepatitis B among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor. Arrests The doctors were accused of re- using syringes, which had been contaminated with hepatitis B virus, to treat other patients. Eight medical practitioners, including doctors Govind and Chintal Patel, were arrested under the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after allegedly re-using infected syringes. One of them was also charged with attempted murder. Most of the people affected had received medical treatment from Dr. Patel in the last six months. Medical officials conducted a raid on Patel's clinic and found several used syringes and other medical waste. Reaction The Government of Gujarat started a mass immunization drive under strict medical supervision in Modasa, which set up 60 booths in Modasa and nearby cities. 224 medical teams, including some from All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences and National Institute of Virology have set up camps in Modasa, and will remain there for at least a month. According to the officials 25,000 vaccines were sent to the most affected area and 600,000 more vaccines are being arranged from Hyderabad. In addition, the government distributed 30,000 pamphlets and mounted a campaign to inform residents about the disease. The Health Department of the Gujarat government have sent 600,000 doses of vaccine to the area.

History When the Chipping Norton Railway from Kingham on the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway to Chipping Norton opened in June 1855 a goods siding was provided at Churchill Mill. The inspector's report prior to the opening of the line refers to a siding at Churchill, on the 1899 Ordnance Survey map it is named as \\"Sarsden Siding\\". The name is interesting since the location is more than a mile from the hamlet of Sarsden and much closer to the village of Churchill. The reason for the name is unknown, but the following factors may have had a bearing. Firstly, James Haughton Langston MP of Sarsden House was one of the promoters of the railway and owned much of the land on which it was built. Much of the traffic to the siding would be destined for his estate, which included the village of Churchill. In 1852 James Haughton Langston had earlier tried to obtain a railway siding on the OW&W; Railway, as recorded in that company's Traffic Committee minutes for 20 November: > A letter was read from Mr. Varden relative to a siding near Sarsden. > Resolved that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Busby with the Superintendent call upon Mr. > Langston and ascertain the amount of traffic likely to be put upon the line > to and from the point where the siding is required. The proposed siding on the main line was not built. Secondly the OW&WR; already had a station at Churchill near Kidderminster (later Churchill & Blakedown, now Blakedown). The need to avoid wagons and passengers being routed to the wrong destination would suggest the use of a name other than the obvious geographic name Churchill. The siding was a loop and about 480 feet long. The loop's points were unlocked by a key on the train staff. A level crossing carried the road from Churchill to Churchill Mill. Initially this was not regarded as a public crossing as it served only the mill yard. Later hand- operated gates were provided. In 1883 work began on the building of the Kingham Hill Homes (now Kingham Hill School), one mile to the North-West. Kingham Station was not equipped for the handling of goods traffic so supplies for the school, including coal and provisions, were consigned to Sarsden Siding. Horse-drawn vehicles from the school accessed the siding via the mill yard. Access was liable to be prevented, for example when the miller was operating a threshing machine in the yard. Because of these problems Churchill Mill was purchased by the school and road traffic between the school and Churchill now passed over the level crossing. The price paid by the school to purchase the mill was considerably in excess of the market value and can only be explained by the importance placed on gaining unrestricted road access to Sarsden Siding. In 1893 a signal box was built but in March 1899 it was reduced to the status of a ground frame. The box continued to carry the nameboard \\"Sarsden Signal Box\\" until closure. It contained six levers controlling two distant signals, the gate locks and the points at the Kingham end of the siding. The Great Western Railway, which had taken over the Chipping Norton Railway, opened the passenger halt on 2 July 1906. It was a standard Great Western design with one timber platform and \\"pagoda\\" shelter. The designation \\"Halt\\" means it was unstaffed and tickets were purchased on the train. A cart weighbridge was built in 1913 and a crossing-keeper's house in 1930. On 1 December 1962 British Rail ran the last train on the Chipping Norton Railway and closed Sarsden Halt. The final train was hauled by BR standard class 2 number 78001. The line was closed for all purposes on 7 September 1964. Goods traffic Sarsden Siding had a curious status. It was not a private siding yet neither was it public in the sense that small consignments of goods could be sent and received there. Traffic seems to have been handled in full wagonloads only. Despite this, the siding was well used handling mainly agricultural traffic including milk. Coal was also delivered. Exact traffic figures are not available as the totals were counted in with Chipping Norton. Passenger traffic Again detailed figures are not available. Most trains on the line called at the Halt, which was used by passengers from the village of Churchill and from Kingham Hill School. One train that did not usually stop was the daily Ports to Ports Express between Newcastle and South Wales, but even this would call at the Halt to set down passengers from beyond Leicester if 24 hours' notice was given.Hemmings Vol.2,p.360. Present-day remains. The crossing-keepers house is the only building now remaining. The small group of houses at Churchill Mill is nowadays known as \\"Sarsden Halt\\". The wooden timetable board has been preserved and can be seen at Winchcombe Railway Museum. One of the platform oil lamps, a signal lamp and a wheel off the sack truck have been privately preserved. The Sarsden Halt nameboard and signal box nameplate are not thought to have survived.

Three were produced and used for flying demonstrations and training including seaplane pilotage. Development The first Type IFlight 27 December 1913 was built to the order of Dr. M.G. Christie as a two-seat version of the Type D. Dr. Christie was a student at the Blackburn SchoolFlight 12 October 1912 at Hendon but failed to obtain his Royal Aero Club pilot's brevet. He nonetheless remained deeply committed to aviation and the result was the brief for the Type I. The Type I was of identical construction to its predecessor but it naturally was made longer to accommodate the extra seat, of greater span and with a modified fin and undercarriage. Both the passenger and pilot sat in a common extended cockpit, the former in front and over the centre of gravity so the aircraft could be flown by the pilot alone. For the first time, a Blackburn aircraft had the standard modern control combination of rudder bar and a column that moved fore and aft for pitch control. This column carried a wheel to control wing warping. The wings, braced from the undercarriage and from an inverted-V kingpost had the slightly rounded form of the modified Type D. The fin was shorter and less swept, not reaching the forward edge of the tailplane. The forward struts of the undercarriage were now forward-sloping. The extra weight required more power, so an 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome rotary was fitted, with an aluminium cowling surrounding all but the lower 135° of the engine. The first Blackburn Type I with inverted-V kingpost. This shows the original full cowling. The 100 hp Anzani powered Improved Type I The Type I was first flown on or shortly after 14 August 1913 from the Yorkshire Aerodrome, Lofthouse Park, by Harold Blackburn.Harold Blackburn was no relation to the constructor, but was the instructor at the Blackburn School of Flying after it moved from Filey to Hendon in September 1912. He became M.G.Christie's personal pilot after the school closed in early 1913. After the \\"Roses Race\\" described below, the cowling was modified with holes for carburettor air, and in December 1913 the double cockpit was converted into two by sheet-metal decking. A second Type I was built as a single-seater with a freight compartment in place of the passenger's seat. It was externally distinguished by a single streamlined kingpost and by the absence of cowling in front of the engine. Surprisingly, this aircraft reverted to the \\"triple steering wheel\\" control of the Blackburn Second Monoplane. It was first flown by Harold Blackburn on 14 December 1913.M.H. Goodall & A.E. Tagg (2001). British Aircraft Before the Great War, p.48. Schiffer Military History. Since these two Type I machines had flown well, Blackburn produced the Improved Type I first seenFlight 28 March 1914 at the Olympia Aero show in March 1914. Its forward fuselage was deeper, the engine almost fully cowled and the leading edge of the tailplane cut back to meet the fin. It flew sometime before 9 July 1914. This machine was modified in 1915 as a seaplane trainer, just 1 ft (31 cm) longer than the landplane. It now had a 100 hp (75 kW) uncowled Anzani radial engine and dual controls. Twin main floats were supplemented by a small tail float. It was known as the Land/Sea monoplane, and could have exchanged its floats for wheels in a few minutes but was never required to do so. It first flew in this guise on 26 October 1915. Operational history thumb thumb The Type I was initially used in a mixed programme of demonstration flights and cross-country training flights, visiting Yorkshire towns, with him and the owner together. Typical of these flights were joyrides offered at Bridlington in August and September 1913. On one of these flights Harold Blackburn took nine-year-old Miss Isla Tudor up to a height of 6,000 feet.Bridlington Free Press 29 August 1913 On another occasion the noise of the engine caused a horse pulling one of Messrs. Ouston's rullies [carts] to bolt, running over the cart driver.Bridlington Free Press 5 September 1913 The Blackburn firm had its only air racing success with the Yorkshire-built Type I in a 100 mi (160 km) circuit via York, Doncaster, Sheffield, Barnsley and home to Leeds against the Lancastrian Avro 504 prototype for the Wars of the Roses trophyFlight 11 October 1913 sponsored by the Yorkshire Evening News on 2 October 1913. The Type I was piloted by Harold Blackburn with Dr. Christie as passenger; the Avro 504 by F. P. Raynham with A.V. Roe as passenger. 29 March to 4 April 1914 was Sheffield Aviation Week,Flight 11 April 1914 sponsored by the Sheffield Independent. Harold Blackburn offered joyrides on the first Type IAccording to Jackson both Type Is were used at this meeting. However, a commemorative photograph album given to Harold Blackburn by the Sheffield Independent only shows the first Type I. The photograph in Blackburn Aircraft since 1909, purportedly of Blackburn delivering newspapers to Chesterfield in the single-kingpost Type I, was more likely taken during the Yorkshire Show in July 1914. and, accompanied by a young lady known as \\"Little Miss Independent\\", on 4 April he delivered the early edition of that paper to Chesterfield, some 16 mi (26 km) south. In June 1914 the aircraft was flying at Blackpool and on 22 July Harold Blackburn inaugurated the first scheduled service in Britain with flights every ½ hour between Leeds and Bradford. This machine and an early Avro 504 bought to form a circus were commandeered by the Government on the outbreak of war and only narrowly escaped destruction by fire in Harrogate, supposedly at the hands of German saboteurs. The second Type I was flown by Harold Blackburn through the winter of 1913–4. A trip from York to Leeds in fog, rain and gales brought out a crowd estimated at 10,000. This aircraft also featured at the Yorkshire Show that year, but was later written off in York. The Improved Type I was also commandeered by the Government at the start of the war, but having no military potential was sold to the Northern Aircraft Co. at Windermere, successors to the Lakes Flying Company as the Land/Sea monoplane. Large numbers of RNAS pilots experienced their initial seaplane training on this aircraft before it capsized on 1 April 1916. Variants *Type I: original two-seat development of Type D.

Before the Meiji Restoration, his courtesy title was Kii-no-Kami and junior 5th, lower grade court rank (ju go i no ge 従五位下).  Biography  Naotora was born as the 7th son of Nabeshima Naomasa, the daimyō of Saga Domain. As the 10th daimyō of Ogi, Nabeshima Naosuke had no son, he adopted Naotora, who married his only daughter Haruko. Naotora became daimyō on the death of his father-in-law in 1864. The Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration began only four years later, and he was called upon to lead Ogi’s forces against the Tokugawa remnants at Akita in northern Japan. For his loyalty to the new government and efforts in the war, the revenues of Ogi domain were raised by 5,000 koku in August 1869. However, this reward was only nominal, as with the abolition of the han system, the title of daimyo had been abolished and Naotora became \\"domain governor\\". This title was abolished as well in 1871, when Ogi domain became part of the new Saga Prefecture. Naotora departed Japan with his elder brother Nabeshima Naohiro in 1873 for studies in Great Britain, returning to Japan only in 1882. During his stay in England, many of his former retainers perished in the Saga Rebellion and he found himself in disfavor with the new Meiji government. However, through the efforts of his brother Naohiro after his return to Japan, he was awarded the peerage title of viscount (shishaku) under the kazoku system. He later served as an advisor to the Foreign Ministry and as a member of the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan.

From 1974 onwards, Hartmann held senior posts in the Language Centre and the School of English at the University of Exeter, where he also organised a number of influential conferences, such as LEXeter ’83 which led to the creation of the European Association of Lexicography (EURALEX), the International Journal of Lexicography and the book series Lexicographica Series Maior (of which he was one of the co-editors from 1984 to 2008, during which period 134 volumes were published). He attended 12 of the 13 biennial congresses that have been held since 1983, contributing papers at half of them and acting as first secretary and fourth president.He has been given honorary life membership for his services to EURALEX. Hartmann has also been involved in the founding of AFRILEX (Johannesburg 1995) and ASIALEX (Hong Kong 1997). Other conferences he hosted at Exeter include one on the history of lexicography (Hartmann 1986), which demonstrated that lexicographic traditions differ considerably by dictionary types and languages, and one on lexicography in Africa (Hartmann 1990). He has acted as a consultant to a number of bodies,E.g. research councils such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the British Council, publishers such as Oxford U.P. and Benjamins, and selection panels for conferences such as EURALEX congresses. received a number of grants and fellowships to spend time abroadVisiting fellowships held at the Humanities Research Centre of the ANU in Canberra (1977), the State University of New York at Binghamton (1985), the University of Waterloo (Ontario) Centre for the New OED (1985), the European Translation Centre at Straelen and the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache in Mannheim (1986), the School of English and Linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney (1994), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (1997), and the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing (2002). and to participate in various initiatives to promote the discipline.ERASMUS grant 1990/1991 to start M.A. programmes in lexicography at various universities in Europe; Thematic Network Project in the Area of Languages with a Sub-project on Dictionaries in Language Learning in Europe (Hartmann 1999). He also welcomed several visiting scholars for periods at Exeter University.The list includes Alan Kirkness (New Zealand), Colin Yallop (Australia), Rufus Gouws (South Africa), Olga Karpova (Russia), Alan Turney, Isamu Hayakawa and Masaaki Ohsugi (Japan), Xiaojun Heng and Jianping Wu (China). His achievements have been recorded in several international directories,The Linguisten-Handbuch (1994), the Kenkyusha Biographical Dictionary of English Linguistics and Philology (1995), the International Who's Who in Translation and Terminology (1995), the Who's Who in Lexicography (1996), and the Dictionary of International Biography (34th edition 2007). and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Chartered Institute of Linguists. While at Exeter, Hartmann established the Dictionary Research Centre in 1984, supervising over 45 M.A. and 30 Ph.D. dissertations,Some of these Exeter postgraduates have moved on to make an impact on their respective specialisms and countries, notably Fred Weeks, Jon Mills, Mersedeh Proctor and Martin Stark (UK), Peter Sharpe (UK and Japan), Gregory James, Philip Benson, Li Lan, Tan Zaixi and Jacqueline Lam (UK and Hong Kong), Barbara Kipfer (USA), Evanthia Tsiouris and Agapios Oikonomidis (Greece), Ibrahim Al-Besbasi (Libya), Turki Diab (UAE), Nazih Kassis (Israel), Takashi Kanazashi, Kusujiro Miyoshi and Yuri Komuro (Japan), and Young-kuk Jeong (Korea). specialising on such aspects as dictionary criticism (evaluating their many different features), dictionary history (tracing their varying traditions), dictionary typology (classifying their different genres), dictionary use (observing the reference skills needed to access information), contrastive linguistics, translation, and bilingual lexicography. Upon his retirement from Exeter in 2001, the Dictionary Research Centre was transferred to the University of Birmingham, where Hartmann was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of Lexicography in the School of English. Since 2007, Hartmann has been consolidating his various lists of conferences, institutions, dictionary projects, dissertations, and periodicals into an International Directory of Lexicography Institutions.

The theater is built into the slope below the city Ancient Thera () is an antique city on a ridge of the steep, 360 m high Messavouno mountain on the Greek island of Santorini. It was named after the mythical ruler of the island, Theras, and was inhabited from the 9th century BC until 726 AD. Starting in 1895, Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen systematically investigated the city until 1904. Later excavations by N. Zapheiropoulos between 1961 and 1982, under the auspices of the Archaeological Society of Athens, unearthed the city's necropolis in Sellada. Findings from these excavations are on exhibit at the archaeological museum in Fira. Excavation work was again taken up between 1990 and 1994 under the leadership of Wolfram Hoepfner of the Free University of Berlin and resulted in a more precise understanding of the history of the southern Aegean. Ancient Thera is today open to the public and can be reached on a winding road that starts at Kamari or several footpaths from both sides of the mountain.  Geography  Housing ruins in Ancient Thera The ancient city consisted of a street almost 800 m long and especially wide for its time (between two and four meters) extending in a southeastern direction and containing several imposing buildings. A small cul-de-sac branches off at right angles and at its termination, high up on the mountainside, were the headquarters of a garrison stationed in the city. After about 200 meters of street the city expands to cover an area of about 100 x 100 meters on an exposed plateau high above the rocky coast. Residential areas are grouped around an Agora which is across from a theater built into the lower slope. Separated off and facing the sea at the eastern tip of the plateau is a small sacred area with temple grounds and public facilities. All buildings are constructed of the local limestone of the mountain itself. Wood was rare on the island and seldom used for building. At the base of the mountain at the edge of today's city (Kamari) was a necropolis which was used almost as long as the ancient city existed. The city also had a harbor, not yet precisely localized, which supposedly had shipyards and lodgings for sailors and soldiers. Ancient Thera had two seaports, namely Oia (Greek: Οία, not to be confused with modern Oia) and Elefsina (Greek: Ελευσίνα), located respectively at present-day Kamari and Perissa.  History  In archaic times the city was an unimportant settlement at the southern periphery of the Cyclades. It was founded by Doric colonists from Sparta, who recognized the strategic value of its location on a rocky ridge. Herodotus and Pausanias give accounts of the mythical ruler, Theras, a descendant of the Phoenician ruler Cadmus and son of the king of Thebes, Autesion, who ruled over Sparta and Laconia on behalf of his underage nephews Eurysthenes and Procles. After they came of age he founded a new settlement on the island of Kalliste (old Greek: Καλλίστῃ), which was subsequently named Thera after him (modern Greek: Thira, Θήρα). This name was also given to the city, of which there is archaeological evidence dating from the 9th century BCE. Herodotus goes on to write of a seven-year drought around the year 630 BCE which forced the inhabitants of Thera to send colonists to Cyrenaica in today's Libya. This settlement was so successful that Thera long enjoyed a good reputation as the mother city of Cyrene despite its own relative unimportance. A collection of 760 coins were found dating from the 6th century BCE, which give evidence of a modest amount of trade links to Athens and Corinth to the west and Ionia and Rhodes to the east. The Cyclades The role of the city changed in the second half of the 3rd century BCE when the Ptolemaic wartime fleet for the entire Aegean Sea was stationed in the city's harbor in Hellenistic times. The city was completely rebuilt for the officers; the former layout was replaced by a regular street grid, and imposing buildings in the form of peristyle houses were erected. The fleet was withdrawn around 145 BCE, and historic records from the city are completely lacking until about the year 1. In Roman times starting in the middle of the 1st century BCE the island and city were part of the Roman province of Asia, and although no high officials resided on the island Thera was relatively prosperous and significant, thanks to elaborate construction projects and the fact that Therans managed to attain high positions, including twice the office of provincial high priest. In the first third of the 3rd century the dissolution of the Roman Empire was also reflected by the absence of reports about the island. During Byzantine times, Thera as a diocesan town was again more frequently mentioned; up into the 5th century it was the only urban settlement on the island of Santorini. As was the case with the entire region, it subsequently lost importance. In the year 726 it was covered by a layer of pumice after a relatively small eruption of the volcano of Santorini and shortly thereafter the city was given up. Information about the destruction comes from the reports of Theophanes, a Byzantine chronicler. As there are only slight traces of the earlier settlement, descriptions of the city primarily relate to its Hellenistic golden age and later developments.  Ptolemaic garrison  Some information about the role of the Ptolemaic soldiers in the city is known from inscriptions. There were originally only three officers and about 300 soldiers stationed in Thera, but later further office holders and pensioned officers settled there and clearly changed the character of the city. It is not known whether the entire population was placed under military administration or whether it could retain its political independence. On the one hand the soldiers were Greeks from the mainland, but on the other hand the proportion of Egyptian mercenaries rapidly increased, who with their gods strongly influenced the city's religious cults.  Buildings  Ruins of a peristyle in Ancient Thera Particularly noteworthy are: * The Agora: The main square of the city follows the contours of the mountain ridge and is about 110 m long and between 17 and 30 m wide. On the western side toward the slope are the public buildings; the view eastwards toward the ocean is completely free since the private dwellings on this side were built below the level of the agora. * The Basilike Stoa marked the center of public life; it is a huge portico 46 x 10 m in area which extends along the agora. The roof is supported by a row of ten Doric pillars along the middle axis. It was completely rebuilt in the 1st century and on the north end statues of the imperial family were positioned in a separate room * The theater was constructed in the 2nd century in the slope below the main street, and with seating for about 1,500 exceeded the city's own requirements. Performances were held there which attracted people from all the island's settlements and perhaps from neighboring islands as well. * The sacred area on the spur of the mountain ridge enclosed a grotto dedicated to Hermes and Heracles. In addition to the most important temple of Apollo Karneios, a joint rock sanctuary erected for the ancient Egyptian gods was added in the 3rd century BC, and from the 2nd century BC also a gymnasium of the epheboi, to which baths were added during Roman times in the 1st century AD. * At the highest point of the city at the end of a cul-de-sac there was an impressive building which was presumably the headquarters of the fleet commander. The next-door courtyard, which was built up on two sides, is thought to have been the gymnasium of the garrison. There is evidence of two types of private dwellings. The officers of the fleet resided in peristyle houses with colonnades, most of which were built on terraces on the eastern slope below the main street. From there the inhabitants enjoyed a spectacular view of the sea more than 300 m below. Most of the city's inhabitants lived up on the mountain plateau. They built their houses around a small central courtyard under which a cistern was located to provide an essential source of water. Some of the houses had two levels, and in a few cases the terrain permitted small basements as well.  Art and culture  Kouros from Ancient Thera, now in the National Archaeological Museum, Athens Archaeological remains are sparse; before the city was abandoned it had lost importance and only a few relics of its golden age survived. Inscriptions from the city's beginnings found at the sanctuary on the spur of the mountain ridge are noteworthy. They date from the transition from the 9th to the 8th century BC and are thus among the oldest known examples of the use of the Greek alphabet, which evolved from the Phoenician alphabet. In some cases a precursor form of Greek letters was still in use. The inscriptions include dedications of altar stones to a wide variety of gods from Greek mythology. These include Zeus in four cases, Koures in two cases (which may be another kind of invocation for Zeus), and one each for Apollo, Lochaia, Damia, Castor and Pollux, Chiron, Deuteros, and the North wind (Boreas). Then, at a slight distance, there are inscriptions relating to the Erinyes, Athanaia, Biris, the Charites, Hermes and Persephone (Core). Both the wide variety as well as the references to many gods who are not otherwise prominent are conspicuous features. Also noteworthy is the frequency of lesser gods connected with the family, birth, children and the rearing of children. The second common type of inscription was also found on the spur of the ridge, but in this case on the rock walls around the forecourt of the gymnasium, where, according to the texts, competitions and sacred acts took place already before the construction of the sports ground. These inscriptions survived thanks to the underlying limestone, which is coated with a dark, grayish blue crust which can be easily knocked off to expose the white stone underneath. Inscriptions could thus be produced by anybody, not only specialized stonemasons. Some of the texts relate directly to competitions. On one heavy stone the name of the contestant who could throw it the farthest was engraved. In other cases the inscriptions refer to sexual acts which probably describe pederastic relationships of elder erastes with young sportsmen and dancers. The texts are in a very early form of Greek and thus sometimes difficult to interpret. It is uncertain whether they are a form of boasting or whether the sexual acts had a cultic background. Ceramic relics were found which followed both the 8th century geometric style and the 7th century orientalizing style. They resemble models from the island of Naxos, but the design was late in arriving on Santorini. Several, mostly heavily damaged figures called \\"Daedalic idols\\" date from the second half of the 7th century and were grave goods. Only one of these idols survived relatively intact. It represents a woman with raised arms, her gestures being interpreted as a lamentation for the dead. The most famous relics from Ancient Thera are several larger-than- life statues of youths, known as kouroi, also sculpted in the second half of the 7th century BC. Since the island had no marble quarries, no unique stylistic tradition emerged. Both the marble as well as the artistic style came from the island of Naxos. The finest statue of this type dates from the beginning of the 6th century BC and is known as the Apollo of Thera. All statues were found in the burial grounds below the city. There are two caves in the vicinity of Ancient Thera, one of which appears to be an additional antique sanctuary and the other either a place of cult worship or simply a garbage pit, depending on how the many remains of bones and traces of food preparation are interpreted.

The social class defined by this condition has been termed the precariat. Catholic origins Léonce Crenier, a Catholic monk who had previously been active as an anarcho-communist, may have established the English usage. In 1952 the term was documented by Dorothy Day, writing for the Catholic Worker Movement: In Europe It is a term of everyday usage as Precariedad, Precariedade, Précarité, or Precarietà in a number of European countries, where it refers to the widespread condition of temporary, flexible, contingent, casual, intermittent work in postindustrial societies. While contingent labor has been a constant of capitalist societies since the industrial revolution, Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have arguedMichael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire, New York: Penguin Press, 2004. that the flexible labor force has now moved from the peripheral position it had under Fordism to a core position in the process of capitalist accumulation under Post-Fordism, which is thought to be increasingly based on the casualized efforts of affective, creative, immaterial labor. =Global justice movement= Around 2000, the word started being used in its English usage by some global justice movement (sometimes identified with antiglobalization) activists (Marches Européennes contre le chômage la précarité et les exclusions - European Marches against unemployment, precarity and social exclusion), and also in EU official reports on social welfare. But it was in the strikes of young part-timers at McDonald's and Pizza Hut in winter 2000, that the first political union network emerged in Europe explicitly devoted to fighting precarity: Stop Précarité, with links to AC!, CGT, SUD, CNT, Trotskyists and other elements of the French radical left.Abdel Mabrouki, Génération précaire, Le Cherche Midi, 2004. =\\"San Precario\\"= February 29 is the feast day of San Precario, the patron saint of precarious workers, who – together with his feast day – was created by the Chainworkers at the Milanese space Reload where the 2004 EuroMayDay was organised with others, including the Critical Mass group. The Milan Critical Mass already had its own patron saint, \\"Santa Graziella\\" (Graziella is the brand name of a popular Italian folding bicycle). San Precario was originally conceived as a male saint (Romano, 2004). The saint's first public appearance was at a Sunday supermarket opening on February 29, 2004: > A statue was carried in the streets, preceded by assorted clergy including a > cardinal reciting prayers over a loudspeaker, and followed by pious > people.Marcello Tarì and Ilaria Vanni. \\"On the Life and Deeds of San > Precario, Patron Saint of Precarious Workers and Lives\\".

ChainWorkers then performed a hoax during the 2005 Milan Fashion Week, creating a fictive stylist, Serpica Naro,Serpica Naro whose name was an anagram of \\"San Precario\\". The groups claim that the name functions like a multiple user name or myth such as Luther Blissett and quote the Wu Ming collective in giving theoretical coherence, although it is mostly seen as a détournement of the Catholic concept of patron saints.  Precariat  In sociology, precariat refers to the social class formed by people with no job security, or no prospect of regular employment, distinct from the lumpenproletariat.

The PakSat-1R was developed and built as a geostationary telecommunications satellite and was launched from Xichang, China, at 16:15 UTC on 11 August 2011. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38° East. History In December 2001, the Suparco negotiated to lease the Palapa-C1 satellite and designated it as PakSat-1E in an attempt to avert the orbital slot crises. It was acquired after an anomaly in the electrical system of the satellite on 24 November 1998. A module for controlling the hydro accumulators had failed and an American contractor, Hughes Global Services (HGS), managed to develop a strategy that allowed the continued use of the satellite in geostationary orbit. The satellite was eventually leased by Pakistan as PakSat-1E at 38°East in geostationary orbit and had been active since April 2004. During this time, the Suparco began developing the geosynchronous satellite to replacing the aging PakSat-1E as part of the new space policy announced by the Government of Pakistan in 2008. =Prototype= In 2008, a prototype of PAKSAT-IR was developed by Suparco at its Satellite Research and Development Centre (SRDC) in Lahore. The project was aimed to enhance the knowledge and technical expertise of young scientists and engineers about communications satellite engineering. The PakSat-1R prototype has three C-band Transponders as the communication payload. All the subsystems have been designed and developed locally in Pakistan. System integration and testing have also been performed. SUPARCO reported that the project was completed in three years. =Manufacture and launch= The PakSat-1R was developed by the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and financial funding came from the Chinese government. Before launching the satellite spent around 18 days undergoing laboratory tests in China. The PakSat-1R was launched on 11 August 2011 from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province, China, by a Long March 3B/E (Chang Zheng-3B/E) launch vehicle. In 2010, China provided loans for setting up communication facilities at the SUPARCO Satellite Ground Station. Specifications The Paksat-1R satellite is based on the DFH-4 platform, with a launch mass around 5,200 kg. The satellite will be positioned at 38.0 degrees East, replacing the Paksat-1 (23779 1996-006A), which was launched as Palapa-C on 31 January 1996, by an Atlas-IIAS (AC-126) from Cape Canaveral's LC-36B launch complex. Paksat-1R was manufactured by the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), after being ordered in 15 October 2008 – with a contract signed with the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). The PakSat-1R contract was the third communications satellite contract signed by China's space industry with international customers. It is also China's first satellite in-orbit delivery contract signed with an Asian customer. The satellite will support all conventional and modern Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) applications, with a total of up to 30 transponders: 18 in Ku-band and 12 in C-band. To ensure high degree of reliability/availability of the system, two fully redundant Satellite Ground Control Stations (SGCS) were established in Karachi and Lahore, one to act as the Main and the other as Backup respectively. The DFH-4 (DongFangHong-4) platform is a large telecommunications satellite platform – a new generation of hardware based on high output power and communication capacity, ranking alongside international advanced satellite platforms. The applications for the DFH-4 platform aren’t limited to high capacity broadcast communication satellites and can be used to tracking and data relay satellites, regional mobile communication satellites, etc. The platform comprises propulsion module, service module and solar array. It has a payload capacity of 588 kg and an output power of 10.5 kW by the end of its lifetime. Its design lifetime is 15 years and its reliability by the end of its lifetime is more than 0.78. Based on versatility, inheritance, expandability and promptness principles and mature technology, the platform will meet the needs of international and domestic large communication satellite markets. The satellite is equipped with three receiver antennas and two transmission antennas. It can support the transmission of 150-200 TV programs simultaneously to ground users using a 0.45m antenna device. Launch PAKSAT-1R was launched at 2117 hours on 11 August 2011 aboard China's Long March 3B (CZ-3B) Satellite Launch Vehicle from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China's Sichuan Province. The launch was witnessed by, among others, Pakistan's Secretary Defence, Lt. Gen. Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division, Lt. Gen. Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and the Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Reception The reception perceived in the Pakistan science community and the country at large was generally positive. However, leading scientists in Pakistan criticised Suparco for not being able to launch the satellite from Pakistan's Flight Space Center and questions were raised whether the space programme is on the right track. In a press release, Suparco dismissed the concerns and maintained that the program is being directed on its right direction. Commenting on the launch of the satellite, The Tribune wrote that what Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) achieved could have been done 30 years earlier.

The letter was published in the official gazette of the Holy See, the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, in 2001. Contents It covers \\"the more serious offences reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\\" that the apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus of 28 June 1988 attributes to the competence of that office: :Art. 52 — The Congregation examines offences against the faith and more serious ones both in behaviour or in the celebration of the sacraments which have been reported to it and, if need be, proceeds to the declaration or imposition of canonical sanctions in accordance with the norms of common or proper law.Pastor Bonus, article 52 The Code of Canon Law also speaks of offences reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and likewise does not specify them.Code of Canon Law, canon 1362 §1 1° =Graviora delicta= Of the eight more grave delicts (graviora delicta) in behaviour or in the celebration of the sacraments that De delictis gravioribus specified, four concern the Eucharist: # Throwing away the consecrated species or, for a sacrilegious purpose, taking them away or keeping them;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 1367 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1442 # Attempting, if not a priest, to celebrate Mass or pretending to do so;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canons 1378 §2 1°, and 1379 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1443 # Concelebrating the Eucharist with ministers of ecclesial communities that lack apostolic succession and do not recognize the sacramental dignity of priestly ordination;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canons 908 and 1365 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canons 702 and 1440 # Consecrating either bread or wine without the other, of even consecrating both but outside of celebration of Mass.Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 927 Three concern the sacrament of Confession: # Absolving an accomplice in sexual sin;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 1378 §1 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1457 # Making a sexual advance in Confession or on the occasion of or on the pretext of Confession;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 1387 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1458 # Direct violation of the secrecy of Confession.Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 1388 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1456 §1 In addition, the document lists one offence of a moral character, not directly connected with administration of the sacraments, as reserved in the same way as these to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, namely, the offence of a cleric (a bishop, priest or deacon) who commits a sexual sin with someone under 18 years of age. Procedure Reservation of these offences to the Congregation does not mean that the Congregation itself tries those accused of committing them. It requires instead that, if a preliminary investigation shows that it is at least probable that the offence was committed, the ordinary (in the Eastern Catholic Churches called the hierarch) is to consult the Congregation on the manner in which his own tribunal is to proceed. In addition, any appeals from the verdict of that tribunal are to be made to the Congregation, instead of the usual appeals tribunal. Prescription In the case of criminal actions brought before an ecclesiastical tribunal against someone accused of offences reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, prescription normally limits to ten years from the date of commission of an offence the time within which the prosecution may be initiated;Cf. Code of Canon Law, canon 1362 §1 1° and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1152 §2 1° but the document De delictis gravioribus lays down that, in the case of a sexual offence against a minor, the period of ten years begins to run only when the minor reaches 18 years of age.

Biography Arpinati was born at Civitella di Romagna. Before World War I, he was originally an individualist-anarchist and, together with his friend Benito Mussolini, collaborated on the socialist newspaper La lotta di classe. He was a fervid interventionist as early as August 1914. In those years he moved to Bologna, where he worked on the Italian railroad. In early 1920 he founded the second Fascio di combattimento in the city. On 21 November 1920 he was amongst the leaders of the squads which took part in the fighting between Fascists and Socialists in Piazza Nettuno and Piazza Maggiore in Bologna (the so-called strage of Palazzo d'Accursio). The following year he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and, after the March on Rome, he was made national vice-secretary of the Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF). In 1926 he became podestà of Bologna, a position which he left in 1929 to become Undersecretary of the Ministry of Interior. Arpinati held several positions in the Italian sports world, such as the President of the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) and of the Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (Italian football federation): he led the reformation of the Serie A championship on national level, and organized the 1934 FIFA World Cup. In 1926 he intervened to strip FC Torino of the national football title after a corruption scandal; as the Bologna team had arrived second behind Torino, Arpinati, being a Bolognese, decided to leave the title unassigned (a feat unparalleled until the 2006 Calciopoli) to avoid accusations of personal interest. In 1930 the PNF secretary Achille Starace accused Arpinati of being behind the attempt against Mussolini in the Bologna Stadium (31 October 1926). He was therefore charged as enemy of the regime, and confined first in Lipari (1934-1937) and then to home detention near Bologna. In 1943 Arpinati refused a personal invitation by Mussolini to join the Repubblica di Salò, the German puppet-state created in northern Italy after the Allied conquest of the southern peninsula. He also helped various member of the CLNAI. He was assassinated on 22 April 1945 at Argelato, one day after the Allied liberation of Bologna, by a group of communist partisans.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 28 January 2009 as the sister of already established character Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley). Hayley is notably the first prominent disabled character in Hollyoaks, and like Stewart, has Guillain–Barré syndrome. In December 2009, it was announced that Stewart's real-life pregnancy would be written into the show and that Hayley would become pregnant. Making her final on-screen appearance on 22 February 2010, the character did not return after Stewart's maternity leave ended. Character creationBackground= The character of Hayley was in development for over 18 months prior to filming. The casting was made public in December 2008 along with details of the character, revealing she was to be the sister of already established character Zak Ramsey. The character's back history with Zak is that of a close brother and sister relationship, but at the time of Hayley's condition developing, he could not deal with it and thought she would need constant care. =Casting= Auditions were held for the part of a new disabled character in 2007. Initially there was males and females that auditioned for the role. After a long audition process actress Kelly-Marie Stewart and two other actresses, all of whom where wheelchair users were in the running for the part. Stewart was offered the role in August 2008. The casting process had taken nearly 18 months and producers created the Character of Hayley for Stewart, they also had to write all the scripts before she began filming in November 2008. The actress suffers from Guillain–Barré syndrome like her character and stated she hopes to walk again one day. She spoke of how the it is her dream role and hopes to break down the barriers for disabled people: \\"Some people find it hard speaking to disabled people but hopefully I am showing I am just a normal girl like all the others on the show.\\"https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/a169682/hollyoaks-stewart- hopes-to-walk-again/ Character developmentPersonality and identity= Hayley's character has been described as a \\"bubbly, fun-loving practical joker\\". Actress Kelly-Marie Stewart also said of her character: \\"Hayley's very feisty and has the right attitude that if anyone is not cool enough to see her for who she actually is, it's their problem, not hers.\\" Speaking on how her character's personality would be received Stewart said: \\"I think I'm quite lucky because she is, although she's feisty and although she stands up for herself, she is quite a nice character, so hopefully the things should be quite positive.\\" The official Hollyoaks website described the fact that she has proven she can look out for herself despite her disability. =Disability= Some of the character's on-screen storylines have seen her disability come under fire and receiving unfair treatment, as the character progressed it was evident she could stand up for herself and does not take kindly to people judging her. Stewart was keen to portray the character as real as possible and made sure that scripts included her out of her wheelchair in scenes including sitting on couches and chairs. Set designers also made the sets accessible for Stewart so Hayley could be seen moving around independently while on-screen, with all of one set being converted. On-screen the character has had storylines involving verbal abuse of her condition when Rhys Ashworth didn't realise that she was in a wheelchair, Stewart said that it was a positive message the character was giving out as it meant that people can get to know a person without just thinking they are indifferent because of a wheelchair. Although Rhys then avoided her and said it was because she was disabled, Stewart spoke about the reaction and abuse, stating it was unfair treatment. Speaking about how her condition fitted in with her character she said: \\"Hayley is going to fall into things quite normally, she'll become part of the furniture. She actually ends up with a love interest. It just had to be addressed initially in the same was as any other new character's background would be.\\" Storylines Hayley first appears when she clashes with Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes), who assumes she is sleeping with Zak. However, Hayley soon reveals that she is Zak's sister. She then sleeps with Archie Carpenter (Stephen Beard). She later wants to find a date when Zak, believing that she cannot get one by herself, pays Elliot Bevan (Garnon Davies) money to make her feel special. However, she later finds out. An angry Hayley runs over Zak's foot and keeps the money for herself. Later in the month, she secures a date with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who is initially unaware she is a wheelchair user. On discovering this, Rhys does not appear. Hayley joins a band called 'The Somethings'. After arguing with Rhys, Josh Ashworth (Sonny Flood) tells them to either sort it out or they are both out of the band. After leaving them alone for a short while, Josh and Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) find Hayley and Rhys kissing and undressing each other. Soon after, Hayley and the band are approached by a manager. Josh fires Hayley, thinking the manager dislikes her due to her disability. However, Josh is in fact wrong. After Hayley and Rhys finally get together, she begins to have feelings for Josh. Hayley eventually dumps Rhys after he begins talking about their future, her excuse being he was moving too fast for her. Hayley remains living in the student halls, and in September is joined by new students Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge), India Longford (Beth Kingston), Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) and Josh himself. Hayley takes an instant dislike to India, feeling she is judging her. Hayley tries to cheer India up after she sleeps with Archie, but ends up making the situation worse and embarrassing India even more. Hayley accuses India of stealing her food from the refrigerator, and in an attempt to catch her out, laces her food with laxatives. After India and Dave eat the food to wind Hayley up, the five students compete in a competition to win a car by touching it for the most amount of time. The students are all in the car when India soils herself, causing the other four to get out, and India to subsequently win despite massive embarrassment. After returning from a Christmas break, Hayley reveals that she is five months pregnant, and denies either Rhys or Josh being the father. Hayley then leaves to live with her family. She later gives birth off-screen to a baby boy, who she named Caleb, after her older brother Caleb (Michael Ryan) who died in Afghanistan. Reception Disability Now, a magazine aimed at disabled people praised Hollyoaks for writing in Stewart's real life pregnancy into her storylines, also adding it was positive they treat her like any other member of the cast. They also criticised her character along with fellow disabled characters from other UK soap operas including, Adam Best (David Proud), Lizzie Lakely (Kitty McGeever) and Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston) for all being portrayed as vengeful and personality-driven, stating that the soap opera's need to portray some disabled character's as 'normal' good people. However they praised Hayley as being the least troubled character of Adam and Lizzie, despite the amount of onscreen enemies she made. Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture praised Hayley's storylines and personality stating: \\"Amidst all the dross, it’s worth pointing out there are some things Hollyoaks is doing well. Clumsy storylining aside, it’s good to see a disabled actress and disabled character in a mainstream show, and due to the fact she can actually act and seems to have a personality (the opposite to Spencer) she’s even achieved the near-impossible feat of making brother Zak seem somewhat likeable.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Character profile on the E4 website Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional characters with disability ","title":"Hayley Ramsey"},{"id":"21652342","text":"Paul-Étienne Grandbois (1846 - September 18, 1907) was a physician and political figure in Quebec.

It employs mockumentary-style storytelling with found footage and docufiction elements, using actors in place of interviewees to present the narrative of a family trying to come to terms with the drowning death of their daughter, and the potentially supernatural events they experience after her death. Lake Mungo premiered at the Sydney Film Festival on 18 June 2008. It later screened at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas, US, in March 2009. It has received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Sixteen-year- old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming with her family at a dam in Ararat, Australia. Following the tragedy, her teenaged brother Mathew sets up video cameras around the house to record what seem to be images of Alice's ghost appearing in the family home. They consult psychic Ray Kemeny for insight on the apparent haunting, but he is unable to provide explanation. It is discovered that Mathew was actually setting up the \\"sightings\\" of his dead sister to give the family reason to exhume her body and give his mother closure. However, upon closer review, one of the hoax videos captures Alice's bedroom being searched by Brett, a neighbor for whom she had worked as a babysitter. After her own search of the bedroom, Alice's mother June finds a hidden videotape showing Alice in a sexual encounter with Brett and his wife. Ray admits that Alice had met with him several months before her death and had told him she was having dreams about drowning, being dead and her mother not being able to see or help her. Alice's boyfriend comes forward with mobile phone footage showing Alice during a school trip to Lake Mungo, in which she frantically digs into the sand at the base of a tree with her bare hands. The Palmers travel to Lake Mungo and find the tree, where they dig up her mobile phone. The footage on the phone shows her walking down the shoreline of the lake and encountering a ghostly, corpse-like doppelgänger of herself, with a bloated and disfigured face, appearing just as her body had been found in the lake. The Palmers move out of their house, feeling that Alice had simply wanted them to know who she really was and what she had seen. The family now believes that the haunting has ended and Alice's ghost has moved on. The film ends with a family photo of the Palmers on the front lawn of their house as the figure of Alice watches from the window. The credits are inter-cut with prior footage, revealing several sightings of Alice's ghost throughout the film that had gone unnoticed. After the credits have rolled, a figure that may be Alice or her doppelgänger stands at Lake Mungo in the darkness while lightning strikes. CastProduction The bulk of the film was written in 2005. Anderson was finding it difficult to acquire funding for another script he had written which required a much larger budget. After discussions with what would be future collaborators on Lake Mungo, Anderson decided to write a fictional documentary-style story that could be filmed on a low budget. When asked what inspired to create the script, Anderson has said, \\"I don't think it's a supernatural thriller. I think it's meant to be an exploration of grief.\\" He also cited a curiosity as to how \\"technology is used to record people's lives and sort of tracks memories, and how technology mediates a lot of our experiences\\". Initial funding was attained through private investors, after which the production team approached the Australian government film funding body Screen Australia and received further funding. During casting, low profile actors were sought in an effort to maintain an authentic documentary feel. The film was shot over a period of approximately five weeks using multiple film and video formats. There was no written dialogue in the script, only the outline of the story, so the actors were tasked with improvising their scenes. Anderson also served as the offscreen interviewer in the many documentary style interview scenes that compose the film,Andrew L Urban, \\"ANDERSON, JOEL – LAKE MUNGO\\", Urban Cinefile, 30 July 2009 accessed 11 November 2012 although his role was left uncredited. Release Lake Mungo premiered at the Sydney Film Festival on 18 June 2008. In March 2009, the film screened at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas, US. On 13 March 2009, the film was shown at the Travelling Film Festival in Wagga Wagga, Australia. On 17 March, the film screened in the United Kingdom at the Barbican London Australian Film Festival. On 21 January 2010, the film was shown at the After Dark Horrorfest in the US, distributed by Lionsgate and After Dark Films. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 7.67/10. Prior to the film's wide release, Varietys Russell Edwards called it an \\"ambitious, restrained and well-mounted mockumentary\\", and praised its musical score, but critiqued the film's lighting and apparent lack of scripted dialogue. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile wrote that \\"this superbly constructed and executed film gets everything right, to the smallest detail, as it draws us into the imagined scenario.\\" Simon Miraudo of Quickflix called the film \\"a mournful, dreamlike examination of the hole left in the heart of a family after a death\\", and awarded it a score of five stars out of five. Simon Foster of the Special Broadcasting Service declared Lake Mungo to be \\"one of the most impressive debut films from this country in many years\\" and further commented that \\"the young director has created a nerve-rattler unlike any film the Australian industry has produced.\\" In her review of the film for The Hollywood Reporter, Megan Lehmann echoed these sentiments, noting the film's \\"compelling slow build\\", \\"surreal atmospherics\\", and \\"restrained soundtrack that works on a primal level\\", that \\"cleaves close to reality\\". She heralded its fusion of supernatural elements with substantive themes on family and loss, concluding that \\"this ambitious exploration of death and its aftershocks will reward more discerning genre fans\\". Conversely, a review published by Bloody Disgusting concluded that \\"the ultimate problem with Lake Mungo is that the filmmakers had too many good ideas crammed into one film and not enough time to tell all their tales.\\" In 2019, YouTuber and film critic Chris Stuckmann called the film \\"an underappreciated, underseen gem\\".

A twin-engine, twin-tailed, mid-wing, propeller-driven design with tricycle landing gear, it lost to the Grumman S2F Tracker in the United States Navy competition, and the two prototypes were not completed. Design and development Chance Vought Aircraft began work on 25 January 1950 on a U.S. Navy proposal for an all-weather anti-submarine warfare design. The company constructed a full-scale mock-up of the XS2U-1 and received a contract-of-intent for two XS2U-1 prototypes, BuNos 133780 and 133781, which were not completed before development was abandoned.http://www.joebaugher.com/navy_serials/thirdseries15.html Three- blade propellers similar to those used on the S2F were installed on the mock- up, which had a two-wheel nosegear, and single-tire main gear that would retract into the engine nacelles. The twin-tail fins were canted inward, 90 degrees from the tailplane dihedral. Construction was begun on the fuselages and wings, but technical difficulties arose over how to fold the wings for carrier stowage. A complicated double-fold of each wing outboard of the radial engine was required. The contract was canceled and neither airframe was completed, the Navy electing to acquire the S2F Tracker instead. The S2U was also proposed for the carrier-borne AEW role as the S2U-1W, later changed to WU-1.Moran 1978, p.108 A bulged radome was astride the center fuselage, and the forward fuselage/cockpit design bore a passing resemblance to the later Grumman Mohawk.

The idea originated from monastic living, when monks would dip their bread into hot beer. Formerly, Øllebrød would be served unsweetened, sometimes accompanying all three meals throughout the day. Nowadays, it is mostly sweetened with sugar and eaten for breakfast. In modern times, instant powder mixes for making Øllebrød have become commercially available.

The film stars Prithviraj Sukumaran, Narain, Bhavana, Jayasurya, Biju Menon, and Samvrutha Sunil. It was released on 24 September 2009. Plot Venki (Prithviraj) is an entrance coaching professor by day and robs automated teller machines (ATMs) using fake debit cards by night. He has been operating out of Kochi for the past three months and the Imperial Bank of India (IBI) is the target of all these robberies. ACP Harris (Jayasurya) is in charge of the investigation. But the managing director of the bank, Nandakumar Menon (Biju Menon), is not happy with the way the investigations are proceeding as the cops have been harassing the bank's customers. The bank authorities have ruled out a problem in their systems as the same system is used by other banks. The other banks are not yet a target. All the transactions done by the robber have been using a debit card. Nandakumar Menon decides to conduct an investigation in parallel with the cops. He summons a private Detective Alexander Felix (Narain). Felix is an unkempt young man who opted out of IPS. On the first day, he oversleeps on the train and does not disembark at Kochi. But appearances are deceptive. Beneath the surface, Felix is a sharp investigator. In order to assist him, the bank also appoints a senior systems manager, Roopa (Bhavana). Felix and Roopa move into the IBI guesthouse, which is right across from Venki's apartment. Slowly, the trio begins a friendship. The rest of the story focuses on what happens to the three friends, how Felix succeeds in finding the ATM thief and what is the story behind Venki's hatred towards IBI. Abhirami (Samvrutha Sunil) adds to the star cast as one of Venkatesh's students who has a crush on him.

The church and its courtyard are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Christ Church (Episcopal) and Churchyard. It is the oldest organized religious body and the oldest church building remaining in Greenville. History In March, 1820, Reverend Rodolphus Dickerson founded St. James Mission in the village of Greenville Court House. In 1825, Vardry McBee, who was an early industrialist in Greenville, gave for the church. The cornerstone was laid on September 15, 1825. The brick church was long and wide. The first service was held on June 18, 1826. The church was accepted into the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina as Christ Church Parish. In 1845, the parish proposed the building of a new church. Joel Poinsett, who was a vestryman of the church, drew up plans. Since these were felt to too elaborate and unaffordable, construction was delayed and Poinsett died. Rev. John D. McCollough, who had designed and built over a dozen churches in upstate South Carolina, drew the final plans and built the church. The cornerstone was laid on May 29, 1852. It contained religious books, church and diocesan publications in a sealed copper box. The nave of the brick Gothic church was originally long and wide. There were five lancet windows on each side. The west end had five narrow stained glass windows, which has been described as a \\"pentaphlet,\\" and an art glass circular window depicting the Holy Trinity. The chancel had a triplet window in the chancel depicting Christ, St. John, and St. Peter. The peaked ceiling was tall. Although several sources, quoting an 1856 article in the Southern Episcopalian, say that the brick bell tower is tall, the 1934 architectural drawings indicate that is tall from the top of the foundation to the base of its cross. The church was consecrated on September 29, 1854. A balcony was added in 1875. The south transept was constructed in 1880. In 1914, the triplex window in the chancel was replaced with a stained glass window of the Last Supper from Franz Mayer & Co. in Munich This window was dedicated to Ellison Capers, who was a Confederate general, rector in 1866 to 1888, and Bishop of the Diocese of South Carolina. In 1968, the north transept was built to complete the Gothic cruciform design, and an undercroft was added. In 2000, the balcony was enlarged and a 68-rank Goulding and Wood organ was installed. The Historic American Buildings Survey documented the church with photographs and measured drawings in 1934. The drawings include a site plan and drawings of various details of the church. Christ Church is now in the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina. It sponsors Christ Church Episcopal School in Greenville. Churchyard The churchyard has a cemetery. In addition to Vardry McBee, clergy, church members, and former mayors, three politicians are interred: the post-Civil War provisional Governor Benjamin Franklin Perry, his son, U.S. Congressman William H. Perry, and U.S. Senator Joseph H. Earle.

Ostrogski castle was rebuilt in stone in the early 16th century under the Lithuanian rule when the city was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It had a church, a two- story palace, and an impressive array of 73 cannons. It was there that the treasury of the Ostrogski family was kept. These fabulous treasures brought the predatory Crimean Tatars to the castle on several occasions (at least two in 1577 alone). Prince Janusz Ostrogski, the last of his family, undertook major renovations of the castle in the early 17th century. He made use of the trace itallienne, or \\"Italian style\\" of fortification, to transform Dubno into the most advanced fort in the region. It is the only Volhynian castle featuring a hornwork. Prince Janusz's palace still stands in Dubno. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the vicinity of Dubno Castle was the scene of heavy fighting between the Poles and the Cossacks, some of it described by Nikolai Gogol in the novella Taras Bulba (1835). The castle passed to Polish Prince Władysław Dominik Zasławski as part of the Ostroh inheritance and survived a Russian siege in 1660. In the 18th century Dubno lost much of its military relevance. Some of the fortifications gave way to a plain rectangular palace of two stories, commissioned in the 1780s by Prince Stanisław Lubomirski from architects Henryk Ittar and Domenico Merlini. The palace's interior layout and design did not survive the First World War. After the Lubomirskis sold their Dubno residence to Princess Boryatinsky in 1871, the castle was subjected to a new campaign of remodeling. It held a notable military garrison of the Border Defence Corps. The old barbican was transformed in the 1920s into a prison where about 550 political prisoners were executed by the NKVD in 1941.

As of 2014, there were more than eight million bars, mostly created by fans, which covered a variety of topics, such as celebrities, films, comics and books. More than one billion posts have been published in these bars. According to Alexa Internet, traffic to Baidu Tieba makes up more than 10% of the total traffic to Baidu properties. Functions Every bar can have up to three masters, thirty vice-masters, and ten video- masters to manage uploaded videos. Prior to 2010, Baidu Tieba allowed anonymous posting, displaying only the IP address of the poster. Since then, users are required to have a registered account in order to post on bars. Users can post at most ten pictures and one video quoted from certain broadcast websites. Users cannot edit any published posts. However, users can delete their own published posts and comments from other users on their posts. Beyond regular text posts, Baidu Tieba allows for the use of polls. Every bar has its own 2GB space for members to upload videos. If a bar is ranked within the top 500 of the official rankings, it has its own album. History On November 25, 2003, Baidu Tieba began internal testing. It was released to the public on December 3, 2003. It is a completely user-driven network service. The idea of the paste bar came from Yu Jun, Baidu's Chief Product Designer. Around the same time, the paste bar was combined with the Baidu search engine to build an online communication platform, letting people communicate to those with similar interests. On February 25, 2005, Barzhu Bar became an official platform of Baidu Tieba, and was used for communication between the owners of different bars. On April 15, 2009, Tieba Cloud was integrated into Baidu Tieba. In 2012, Baidu Tieba updated its interface, switching from a simple reply-by-sequence user interface into a more complicated reply-in-same-floor one. Along with the new interface, new functionalities such as rankings, more expressive pictures, and allowing administrators to change the background images of Tieba, were also implemented. On May 13, 2019, topics posted in Baidu Tieba before January 1, 2017 were hidden. A Baidu official said that the topics are hidden temporarily due to “system maintenance”. The maintenance duration is about 1 month. Baidu Tieba has become a popular comprehensive forum in China, with a large number of users actively posting, replying to each other, and interacting with each other. Overseas development Postbar is the international version of Baidu Tieba. In order to expand its commercial domain, Baidu Postbar has been introduced to several countries listed below: * Baidu Tieba Brazil * Baidu Tieba Thailand * Baidu Tieba Vietnam * Baidu Tieba Japan In late 2011, the Japanese version of Baidu Postbar was shut down. Since May 2015, all logins are disabled on the Vietnamese version of Baidu Postbar.

Life He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1573, and graduated B.A. in 1578; he was elected to a fellowship in the same year, and graduated M.A. in 1581. His Cambridge licence to practice as a physician was from 1585. He was approached to lecture in mathematics in 1582, by the merchant Thomas Smythe. The lectures in fact began in 1588. W. W. Rouse Ball, A History of the Study of Mathematics at Cambridge (1889), pp. 23-4.Concise Dictionary of National Biography He lectured from 1588 to 1592. The applications in view were military (intended for Captains of train bands, in other words for militia commanders at the time of the Spanish Armada), and subsequently aimed at naval needs and navigation. The first lectures were in the Staples Inn Chapel, but the regular venue became Smythe's London house, Leadenhall in Gracechurch Street. Other supporters of the lectures were Sir John Wolstenholme and John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley; Hood was a subscriber in 1589 to the Virginia Company, with which his merchant backers were associated. Hood's original publications were probably derived from notes of the talks. He collaborated with the engraver Augustine Ryther on both celestial and terrestrial charts.Eric H.

Olyka Castle was the principal seat of the Radziwill princely family in Volhynia from 1564 until the late 18th century. The founder of the castle was Prince Mikołaj \\"the Black\\" Radziwiłł (1515–1565) who gave Olyka to his youngest son Stanisław. Two senior branches of the Radziwill family were based in Nesvizh and Kletsk. Radziwill Fortress in Olyka by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski The Olyka Castle was immensely influential as the first square fort with corner bastions in the Kresy and the prototype of many similar structures found in Eastern Europe. It was almost continuously under construction for eight decades and sustained numerous sieges between 1591 and 1648. It is one of the biggest castles in Ukraine, with 365 rooms. During Napoleon's invasion of Russia a Russian military hospital moved in and continued in use until 1837. An 1840 document refers to the castle as untenanted. In 1883, a campaign of restoration was launched but it was not taken to its conclusion until after the First World War. The Olyka Castle comprises four residential buildings of unequal height, forming a court in the middle and encircled by a moat. The towers of the original castle have crumbled to the ground, but the network of bastions is still in place. The main palace of three storeys, although originally built in the 16th century, is essentially the upshot of renovations carried out in the 17th and 18th centuries. Other buildings of the castle complex include a 17th-century gateway, a two-storey clock tower, and the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity (1635–1640), an elaborate replica of Il Gesu. During World War II, the Radziwill Fortress was the site of Nazi persecution of Olyka Jews in the Holocaust. As part of the Einsatzgruppen action of August 1941, 720 Jews were killed at the Olyka Castle and nearby. In July 1942, several hundred Jews perished in the castle. Monuments outside Olyka commemorate the place of execution of more than 4,000 Jews in Summer 1942 – in and around the Olyka ghetto, Radziwill Fortress, Olyka Castle, and surrounding areas. Israel's Holon Cemetery also has a monument in memory of the Jews of Olyka and its surroundings, who perished in the Holocaust. A psychiatric hospital, Volyn’s Hospital No. 2, is now located at the site of the Olyka Castle. The only part of the castle currently closed for visitors is a chamber for the Princes and their servants. References * Памятники градостроительства и архитектуры Украинской ССР. В 4-х томах.

They are classified as a Jardin Remarquable, and open daily in the warmer months; an admission fee is charged. The gardens' origins date to 1981 when gardener Jean-Louis Cousin began to look for a site for his collection of 3000 plant varieties from north Asia and North America. In 1985 the region of Picardy, department of the Somme, and the Syndicat Mixte pour l’Aménagement de la Côte Picarde (Joint Committee for the Management of the Coast of Picardy) agreed to build a new garden beside the Abbey of Valloires. Starting in 1987, the gardens were designed by Gilles Clément, who also designed the Parc André Citroën and the Jardin botanique du domaine du Rayol, and first opened to the public in 1989, with additional gardens created in subsequent years. Today the gardens contain over 5,000 plant taxa, representing 75 botanical families, 698 genera, and 2,030 species, with an emphasis on plants native to China, Japan, and Central Asia. They are organized into three major sections: * French gardens, to harmonize with the abbey's west facade * English gardens (jardins des îles), containing botanical collections organized into \\"islands\\" * a wilder, naturalistic garden. Points of interest include a rose garden containing 200 varieties of modern and ancient roses, medicinal garden, vegetable garden, garden of evolution (6000 m², opened in 2003) in honor of local scientist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and garden of five senses. The gardens contain a national collection of Rubus recognized by the Conservatoire des Collections Végétales Spécialisées (CCVS), as well as a collection of 98 Viburnum varieties. In addition, the rose garden contains three special varieties related to the site: the Jardins de Valloires created by André Eve and formally named in 1992 by Catherine Deneuve, the Rose des Cisterciens created by Delbard in 1998 in honor of the 900th anniversary of the Cistercian Order, and the Rose of Picardy created in 2004 by David Austin.

With a parallel-twin (two-cylinder) engine the T120 was based on the Triumph Tiger T110 and was fitted with the Tiger's optional twin 1 3/16 in Amal monobloc carburettors as standard, along with that model's high-performance inlet camshaft. Launched in 1959 by Triumph as \\"The Best Motorcycle in the World\\", the Bonneville T120 was aimed mainly at the lucrative US market where enthusiasts were demanding extra performance. Initially produced with a pre- unit construction engine which enabled the bike to achieve without further modification, the power tended to induce high speed wobbles from the single downtube frame, so in 1963 a stiffer and more compact unit construction model was introduced, with additional bracing at the steering head and swinging arm. The steering angle was altered and improved forks were fitted a couple of years later, which, together with the increased stiffness enabled overall performance to match that of the Bonneville's rivals.The History of British Motoring, 2007. pp.166–167. In 1967 Triumph posted its most successful year in the United States with an estimated 28,000 T120s sold. In 1968 the T120 gained a new and more reliable ignition system. From 1971, T120 models used a new frame which contained the engine oil instead of using a separate tank (this became known as the oil in frame/'OIF' version). A five-speed gearbox finally was fully available by 1972, but competition from larger-capacity motorcycles led to the T120 being superseded by the 750 cc Bonneville T140. Production of the 650 continued until 1973, when the workers at Triumph's Meriden headquarters staged a sit-in until 1975. In 1974 fewer than 1000 of the 650cc assembled machines were released by the workers, with another 38 in 1975. Production of the T120 was not resumed following the sit-in, the Meriden Motorcycle Co-Operative created after the dispute concentrating upon the 750cc twins instead.The Rarest Bonneville Of Them All ? (Classic Bike 1/12) T120 export models *T120R :Export model intended for the US market with in varying years, varying differences. *T120V :5-speed model available 1972. *T120C :Competition model with high-level exhaust pipes. *T120TT :1964 model of the T120C for the US East Coast. In 1968 Evel Knievel jumped the Caesar's Palace Casino fountains on a Bonneville T120TT, and was seriously injured breaking many bones after losing control on landing. 1967 Triumph T120TT *T120RT :A special 750 cc model which had Routt 750cc cylinder kits installed in America by Triumph to permit them to be used in American Motorcycle Association production-based racing events. The kits were installed on new T120R models while still crated. To qualify, motorcycles had to be made and sold to the public in the same form as they would be raced. Triumph had to produce and sell at least 200 of them before they qualified, and although the exact number sold is not recorded they did meet the requirement. The T was stamped separately on the engine cases in America after the stock T120R when the modifications were made, the frames were not stamped. *T120RV :The 5-speed is generally considered to have been available—and was advertised as such—starting in 1972 with the T120V. However, a small pre-production run of 5-speeds were made in June 1971 only, and sold as '71 models. They were externally identical to their '71 T120R 4-speed counterparts, and did not carry any \\"V\\" decals such as the 1972 5-speeds displayed on their side panels. They were factory (not dealer) modified T120R models, so their engines/frames/and titles are designated T120RV, with the V being stamped separately when the transmissions were installed. :These early factory Triumph 5-speeds are not to be confused with the Quaife 5-speeds that were listed as stocked for sale by Triumph dealers in 1970 to qualify for AMA purposes (the parts \\"had to be available from Triumph\\"). The first and final T120RV ratios in 1971 were the same as the 4-speed model, making it a matter of closer ratios, unlike later 5-speeds. These 5-Speeds were not advertised, were not available as an option, and could not be ordered—as the few manufactured were simply distributed individually to selected Triumph dealers and sold by word of mouth. Racing success The first race the Triumph Bonneville participated in was the 1959 Thruxton 500. Entered by Triumph dealers including Alec Bennet and Kings Motors (run by owner Stan Hailwood, Mike Hailwood's father) with bikes supplied from the factory, in this first race they finished 2nd, with riders Tony Godfrey/John Holder (behind a BMW) and 4th, riders Arthur Burton/Charles Erskine; the beginning of a successful era of Triumph motorcycle racing. In 1962 Tony Godfrey and John Holder rode T120 Bonnevilles to victory in the Thruxton 500 mile endurance race, and an article in The Motor Cycle entitled \\"Thruxton Triumph by Bonneville\\" led to the development of the Triumph T120R 'Thruxton', which was hand-built by a team of Triumph technicians using specially picked components and precision-machined cylinder heads and crankcases. Peak power was increased and each 'Thruxton' engine was bench tested to deliver around at 6,800 rpm with a safe rev ceiling of 7,200 rpm. Only 52 of the Thruxton T120Rs were built in 1964/5 to meet homologation requirements for production racing, and surviving examples are rare. About 100 more machines were subsequently manufactured and supplied to selected dealers and riders. Further examples were also built by dealers, with the factory's approval, from factory supplied parts. The T120 won the Production Isle of Man TT in 1967 and 1969 in the 501–750 cc classification. The re-introduction of the Production TT was in 1967 when John Hartle took first place. Two years later in 1969, Triumph set a new landmark in TT history when Malcolm Uphill averaged around the Mountain Course on a Bonneville. Uphill’s achievement was the first time that a production motorcycle had ever passed the three-figure mark from a standing start. Following Uphill's record, the Dunlop K81 tyres he was using were renamed TT100s. In 1969, Bonneville T120 bikes achieved the first three places in the Thruxton 500. Percy Tait and co-rider Malcolm Uphill finished first, ahead of two other Triumph T120Rs. In 2012, Marc LaNoue set a Vintage class record at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.2012 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb results topspeed.com Retrieved 25 December 2019 The Bonneville name 'Devil's Arrow' Triumph streamliner ridden by Johnny Allen to record speeds at Bonneville salt flats in 1955. The Bonneville name came from the achievements of Texas racer Johnny Allen on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. In September 1955, Allen had achieved a two-way average speed of 193.3 mph (311 km/h) on his special motorcycle the \\"Devil's Arrow\\", a 650 cc twin-cylinder Triumph engine fuelled by methanol in a unique 'streamliner' fairing. Allen's speed was ratified as a record by the American Motorcycle Association but not by the world authority, the FIM, as no official observers were present. German motorcycle firm NSU took the record the following year, so Allen and his team returned to Bonneville in September 1956 and won it back with an average speed of 214.17 mph (344 km/h). The FIM also refused to accept this as a world record but Triumph gained much needed publicity from the legal dispute that followed. After the Bonneville T120 had been named in recognition of Allen's records, other Triumph-engined motorcycles went faster still on the Salt Flats. In 1962 Bill Johnson set a two-way average of 230.269 mph (370.5 km/h) over a measured mile, riding a 667 cc 'streamliner' whose design was based on the American X-15 rocket plane. In 1966 Detroit Triumph dealer Bob Leppan raised the record to 245.66 mph (395.3 km/h) with his Gyronaut X-1, powered by two 650 cc Triumph engines. For the next few years, Triumph fitted Bonneville roadsters with \\"World's Fastest Motorcycle\\" stickers.

Morgan moved to Perth in the late 1900s, where he began playing for the Cottesloe Football Club in the second-rate West Australian Football Association (WAFA), a precursor to the present Claremont Football Club. In 1910, he transferred to the Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), and spent most of his time at either half back or as a centreman. A dual Western Australian interstate representative, Morgan was a member of Subiaco's 1912 premiership teams.Premiership players 1904–1930 – West Australian Football League. Retrieved 16 July 2012. When he became a VFL footballer with South Melbourne in 1914, Morgan began playing as a forward was the top goal-kicker at his club twice, on both sides of their war enforced recess in 1916. He had kicked 27 in his debut season and his most impressive tally came in 1915 when he managed 48 goals, to finish third in the league behind Dick Lee and Jimmy Freake. While at South Melbourne he also participated in their 1914 VFL Grand Final loss, playing in the forward pocket. Despite making eight appearances in 1918, Morgan was not selected in that year's premiership team. Footscray acquired his services for the 1919 VFA season and he was a member of their premiership side that year. The following season he returned to Subiaco for another stint, before making his way back to the VFL and joining Carlton. Morgan had a good start at Carlton, kicking five goals from full-forward in his first game for the club and another five in his third. He then added another state to his resume by playing at South Australian club West Adelaide in 1922, where he made five appearances for 12 goals. References *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

Later, he established the Kingdom of Dazhou with reigning name Tianyou (). Life Zhang Shicheng was born in what is today the city of Dafeng (大丰), Taizhou prefecture, Jiangsu Province. He came from a family of salt shippers, and he himself started out in this trade in Northern Jiangsu, transporting both \\"legal\\" and \\"contraband\\" salt, as did his brothers Zhang Shiyi (), Zhang Shide (), and Zhang Shixin (). By his generosity he earned the respect of other salt workers who made him their leader when they rebelled against the oppressive government in 1353.Tora Yoshida, Hans Ulrich Vogel, Salt Production Techniques in Ancient China. On Google Books, p. 48Edward L. Farmer, Zhu Yuanzhang and Early Ming Legislation: The Reordering of Chinese Society Following the Era of Mongol Rule. BRILL, 1995. , . On Google Books. P. 23. Zhang Sicheng with his brother soon conquered Taizhou, Xinghua and Gaoyou in 1353. In 1354 Zhang established Kingdom of Dazhou and declared himself as king with era name Tianyou (). Soon afterward, on the same year Zhang controlled Yangzhou, an important center of salt trade on the Grand Canal of China, just north of the Yangtze. In 1356 Zhang seized Suzhou,https://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/people/faculty/hay_PDFs/historical/MING- QINGEnglish.pdf the main hub of transportation and commerce of Jiangnan (the \\"South of the Lower Yangtze\\" region), and made the city his capital. The lands he now controlled not only were one of the country's main granaries, but also produced over half of all salt in China. Zhang's regime was mostly patterned on the Yuan Dynasty model, but made use of some of the earlier traditional Chinese terminology as well. Around that time his main rival for domination in central China became Zhu Yuanzhang, who had just installed himself in Nanjing. It is reported that after several defeats from troops loyal to Zhu in 1356-57, Zhang offered to pay tribute to Zhu in exchange for the recognition of his autonomy. Zhu, however, refused Zhang's offer, and in 1357 Zhang accepted a title from the Yuan government, and agreed to start shipping grain to the Yuan capital (Beijing) region by sea. Rebels and warlords at the end of Yuan Dynasty, including territories controlled by Zhang Shicheng in 1363. Zhang had significantly expanded his domain by 1363, when he declared himself the King of Wu (吴王, Wu Wang), possibly following the example of his main rival, the Nanjing-based Zhu Yuanzhang, who had earlier (1361) made himself the Duke of Wu (吴公, Wu Gong). Not to be outdone, in 1364 Zhu promoted himself to a King (Wang) of Wu as well.Linda Cooke Johnson, Cities of Jiangnan in Late Imperial China. SUNY Press, 1993. , 9780791414231 On Google Books, pp. 26-27. It is speculated by modern historians that if Zhang had been more decisive and cooperated with another rival (and the western neighbor) of Zhu, Chen Youliang, Zhang and Chen could have crushed Zhu's incipient Ming state. However, \\"indolent\\" Zhang was apparently content to merely control the lower Yangtze region; his two attempts to attack Zhu's territories were both defeated decisively. After Zhu Yuanzhang's victory over Chen Youliang and his son Chen Li and taking full control of their former territories (by around 1365), Zhu was able to turn more of his fighting power against Zhang. Zhu's started with cutting off Zhang from any possible aid from the Yuan rulers in the north. This was accomplished by his taking Gaoyou on the Grand Canal of China on April 24, 1366. In the same year (1366), Zhang lost his younger brother Zhang Shide, who was also an important general in his army, feared by Zhu's troops, when the younger Zhang fell from his horse and died.History of Ming (明代史)，ed: Fu Lecheng (:zh:傅樂成)，Changqiao (長橋) Publishers, 1980 By late December 1366, Zhang's capital Suzhou was surrounded by Zhu's army. The struggle between the two \\"Kings of Wu\\" came to the end on October 1, 1367, when Suzhou fell to Zhu Yuanzhang's troops after a 10-month siege. Zhang tried to hang himself. but was discovered in the act, captured, and taken to Zhu's capital, Nanjing. What happened to Zhang there is not known for sure: according to various sources, he was either beaten to death or finally managed to hang himself successfully.Zhang Shicheng Meanwhile, Zhu incorporated a quarter million of Zhang's troops into his army, proclaimed himself the first emperor of the new Ming Dynasty on the (Chinese) New Year Day of 1368 (January 20 or 23, 1368) and punished Zhang's surviving supporters in Suzhou by extortionate taxes. Zhang Shicheng's tomb in Xietang, Suzhou is still standing today. After his death, his memory still made an impression in the hearts of the peoples of Suzhou. On every 30 July (Zhang's birthday), the locals of Suzhou celebrated with straw dragon toys hanging at the doors of their houses. At the same time, they set fire to 94 straw stems, the significance being \\"9\\" and \\"4\\" forming Zhang's birth name; at the same time, it was a homonym for \\"continued remembrance\\" (). According to tradition, as emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang became suspicious of these local practises, and asked local officials to investigate; the locals claimed that they were worshipping Kṣitigarbha (地藏王, Dizangwang in Mandarin). This was again another word play as the locals were actually worshipping Zhang as a local prince (地张王, Dizhangwang). This celebration continued under Communist rule, and lasted until the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Luo Guanzhong and Zhang Shicheng Although very little reliable information exists about the life of the famous novelist Luo Guanzhong, some scholars surmise that Luo may have been a member of Zhang Shicheng's staff during the early days of Zhang's kingdom. It is believed Luo became disillusioned with Zhang after he made accommodations with the Mongol rulers. After the disillusionment, Luo turned to a literary career, writing his Romance of the Three Kingdoms. However, the scant historical evidence has been interpreted in various ways, with arguments in favor of Luo having been on the side of other participants in the conflict.

Founded in 1933 as a bureau under the Ministry of Commerce's Department of Transport, it was elevated to department status under the new Ministry of Transport in 1963, and was originally called the Department of Commercial Aviation. It was renamed the Department of Air Transport in 2002, before becoming the Department of Civil Aviation in 2009. The department's responsibilities included prescribing, regulating, and auditing Thai civil aviation, as well as the management of Thailand's government-owned civil airports (not including the main international airports operated by the state enterprise Airports of Thailand PCL). In October 2015, as part of restructuring in response to the ICAO's downgrading of Thailand's aviation safety rating, the DCA was split into two separate entities, the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), which will conduct aviation regulatory oversight, and the Department of Airports, which will operate airports previously operated by the DCA. 2015 ICAO safety downgrade In March 2015 the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) rejected a safety plan put forward by the DCA, which was submitted to ward off an imminent aviation safety downgrade. In January 2015 ICAO had carried out an audit and found serious gaps in safety standards at some Thai budget airlines. \\"The audit found that the Department of Civil Aviation had overlooked many regulations for the low-cost airlines,\\" said one source. \\"Simple things like having airline manuals at ground offices, making sure you have two planes ready to relieve mechanical errors were all lacking\\". The ICAO said it would formally downgrade Thailand's safety ranking in early-June 2015 if the DCA were unable to fix the deficiencies by then. If safety is downgraded, all airlines registered in Thailand, including major carriers like Thai Airways would face possible bans on new routes. Existing routes would continue as normal. Japan and South Korea have already responded to the possible downgrade by banning requests for future flight plans and banning all charter flights from Thailand-registered companies. A source within Thai Airways criticized the Department of Civil Aviation, \\"Their lack of attention to detail is costing us all,...\\" On 2 April 2015 a Thai civil aviation delegation journeyed to Seoul to attempt to deflect Korean sanctions. They failed to convince the Koreans. Three Thai charter carriers will not be permitted to fly to Korea in April. About 10,000 passengers will be affected. Japan had earlier granted Thailand a reprieve on sanctions, in effect allowing Thai charter carriers to continue to fly to Japan over the heavy 11 April–31 May travel season. The ICAO assesses, among other things, personnel licensing and training, airworthiness assessment and certification, accident investigation, and airline operations oversight. The DCA is responsible for granting operating licenses to airlines operating in Thailand. Among the ICAO's concerns is that the DCA has issued operating licences to 22 airlines in just nine months. To date (March 2015), the DCA has issued operating licences to 70 scheduled and charter airlines. Sixty-one are still operational. Of these, 41 of are charter flight operators. The prime minister, Gen Prayut, blamed the issue on understaffing, noting that the DCA has only 13 aviation safety inspectors. The DCA employs 1,514. On 20 April 2015, Transport Minister Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong announced that Thailand would be unable to meet the ICAO's June deadline. \\"It is taking longer than we expected,\\" ACM Prajin told reporters. \\"Our effort may be completed as late as mid-July 2015.\\" Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha had said earlier that he would invoke emergency powers to \\"swiftly solve\\" Thai safety shortcomings. ICAO requirements, at minimum, will necessitate the writing and publication of an aviation safety manual by mid- year and, once that is done, the recertification of 41 airlines—28 foreign and 13 Thai—operating in Thailand. In May 2015 the DCA announced that it will ask the US Federation Aviation Administration (FAA) to postpone its July 2015 inspection of Thai civil aviation operations until Thailand has tackled all the major safety concerns raised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

The Geology of Azerbaijan forms a constituent geological part of the Alpine fold belt. Sedimentary deposits embracing the southwestern parts of the Major and Minor Caucasus, including the intermountain Kur River trough, as well as the Mid- and South Caspian basins consist of diversity fold systems. The Earth's crust thickness in Azerbaijan varies in the range from 38 to 55 km. Its maximum thickness is observed in the Minor Caucasus area, while its minimum thickness is typical for the Talysh foothills. Geological setting of the area consists of sedimentary, volcanic-sedimentary, volcanic and terrestrial deposits embracing almost entire stratigraphic range beginning from Pre-Cambrian through Holocene time. Minerals Azerbaijan is rich of fuel ore and non-ore minerals. Ore and non-ore minerals are spread mostly in mountainous territories (Small and Great Caucasus), fossil fuels in plain territories and South Caspian basin. In its turn, it caused development of ore industry in west and oil-gas industry in east. =Fossil-fuel resources= The Nobel Brothers oil wells in Balakhani, a suburb of Baku. Fossil-fuel resources in Azerbaijan are presented by oil, gas, oil shale, peat etc. The petroleum industry is the most important sector of the local economy. Oil is produced from both onshore and Caspian offshore oilfields. Azerbaijan (particularly Absheron Peninsula) is referred to as the world's most ancient oil-producing region. Even during 7th–6th centuries BC oil had been extracted within the Absheron Peninsula and exported to many different countries. As of 1985 about 1.2 billion tons of crude oil has been produced in Azerbaijan (25% of which from offshore oilfields). =Metalliferous ore resources= Metalliferous ores (magnetite and hematite) in Azerbaijan fall into four generic classes: magmatic segregation, skarn- magnetite (contact-metasomatic), hydrothermal- metasomatic and sedimentary ones. Non-metallic mineral resources Non-metallic mineral resources play a significant role in Azerbaijan's total balance of raw material resources. That group of raw materials includes rock salt, gypsum, anhydrite, alum, bentonite clay, construction materials, pyrite, borate, gemstones (precious and semi- precious stone), dolomite, Iceland spar, etc.The Geology Institute of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences Underground water Underground water is considered to be one of the most important natural resources in Azerbaijan. Due to the differences in chemical composition, they fall into several types, such as service water, drinkable, medical waters, and waters used in various industrial sectors. Mud volcanoes It is estimated that 300 of the planet's estimated 700 mud volcanoes sit in Eastern Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea.11.2 Mud Volcanoes – Mysterious Phenomena Fascinate Scientists and Tourists by Ronnie Gallagher Mud volcanoes are pervasive within Azerbaijan. In local language, mud volcanoes are also known as \\"pilpila\\", \\"yanardag\\", \\"bozdagh\\", \\"ahtarma\\", \\"gaynarja\\" etc. There are over 220 mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan (Absheron Peninsula, Gobustan, southeast Shirvan plain, Samur-Davachi plain terrane, both Absheron and Baku Archipelago. The biggest are Galmas, Toragay, Big Kanizadag etc. Most of them have a cone shape. Their height varies in the range from 20 to 400m, whereas base diameter may vary from 100 to 4500m. In 2001, one mud volcano 15 kilometers from Baku made world headlines when it suddenly started spewing flames 15 meters high.BBC News  SCI/TECH  Azeri mud volcano flares Seismicity The first seismic station in Azerbaijan was established soon after 1902 in Baku by E. Nobel. Afterwards seismic stations were set in different areas in Azerbaijan (Balakhany, Zurnabd, Shamakhi, Ganja, Nakhchivan, Lankaran, Chilov Island, and Mingechevir). Azerbaijan saw devastating earthquakes since the ancient times. The first reports on \\"an overall devastating event that destroyed all towns and villages\\" is dated back to 427 AD. In 1139 AD, a devastating earthquake with the magnitude of IX took place in Azerbaijan. The town of Ganja was destroyed completely and gross casualties were reported. Goygol Lake was generated as a result of that same earthquake. In the AD 19th century, Shamahy town suffered several devastating earthquakes. Several of them that occurred in 1856, 1861, and 1872 and 1902 that are considered to be the strongest and most devastating were estimated to have an intensity of VII–X.

An officer ahead of his time, he took part in the three Wars of Independence and distinguished himself as Minister of War in the government of Giovanni Lanza. FamilyFirst Italian War of Independence Battle of Pastrengo (1848) As a junior staff officer, First Lieutenant Giuseppe Govone took part in the battles of Pastrengo, Peschiera, and Cerlungo. Promoted to captain, he joined the staff of General Alfonso La Marmora's 6th Division. In 1849, the 6th Division suppressed the republican Rebellion of Genoa, which broke out as a consequence of the Armistice of Vignale with Austria after the Battle of Novara. In this action, Govone was able without fighting to take control of three forts on the outskirts of Genoa. For his actions in the First Italian War of Independence, Govone was awarded two Silver medals. Crimean War During the Russo-Turkish War of 1853–56 (Crimean War), Captain Govone played a decisive role in the defense of Silistria (May–June 1854). He drafted the plan for the inner redoubt of the city. The construction of this new redoubt prevented the Russians from taking Silistria immediately. Promoted to major, Govone took part in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade on October 25, 1854. Second Italian War of Independence On the eve of the conflict, Govone was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assigned to the General Headquarters of the King and appointed Chief of the military intelligence unit (Ufficio I). In this position, he infiltrated Austrian lines on several occasions. He also fought in the Battle of Palestro, Battle of Magenta, and Battle of San Martino. Map of the Second Italian War of Independence War Against the Brigandage in the Two Sicilies « Questa è Africa! Altro che Italia! I beduini, a riscontro di questi cafoni, sono latte e miele.» / \\"This is Africa, not Italy! Compared to these rubes, the Bedouins are milk and honey.\\" (Luigi Carlo Farini, Lieutenant-Royal of Vittorio Emanuele II at Naples) At the end of the Second War of Independence, Govone was promoted colonel at the age of 33 and, after a short marriage licence, sent to fight the brigandage in the Meridione of Italy. He operated in the Roveto and Liri valleys against the famous brigand Chiavone, the one amongst the many southern bandits who more resembled like a real bourbon legitimist partisan. It was a hard and merciless battle, but devoid of the brutality that marked the conflict in other areas. Under Govone’s command was captured and then immediately executed by firing squad the carlist reactionary Spanish general José Borjes who had been chosen by Francis II of the Two Sicilies as one of the bourbon guerrilla general commanders while Chiavone was eventually sentenced to death by a court of his own traitorous lieutenants. In Sicily Promoted to brigadier general in 1861, Govone was transferred in 1862 to Sicily, where he used draconian measures to suppress widespread draft dodging, particularly in western Sicily. Under the provisions of the Pica Act (Legge Pica) of 1863, he imposed martial law, deploying 20 battalions of the elite corps of Italian Bersaglieri. He considered the mafiosi reactionary rebels against the government of the new united and liberal Kingdom of Italy and treated them accordingly. Towns and villages were surrounded and occupied by troops, water supplies were cut, and relatives of suspected draft dodgers were seized as hostages.Salvatore Lupo, The History of the Mafia, trans. by Anthony Shugaar (New York: Columbia University, 2009), pp. 31-32. It was an extremely critical phase: Facing the hostility of the population, Govone had made himself an enemy of the traditional Sicilian nobility and the rising mafia-linked middle class, who accused him of war crimes. In defending himself against these charges, Govone commented about the \\"barbarity\\" of Sicily and its inhabitants, sparking an uproar in the Italian parliament that led to a parliamentary investigation, resignations from the government, and challenges to duels among the deputies.Christopher Duggan, The Force of Destiny: A History of Italy since 1796 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2007), p. 247. Cleared by the investigation, he was promoted to major general. Nonetheless, he was transferred to the mainland, returning to Sicily only to fight some duels.

He worked at Kasetsart University in Bangkok, Thailand until his retirement, where his last positions were associate professor in the Department of Computer Engineering and Vice President for Information Technology. Among his noted contributions are the development of natural language processing for the Thai language, and the advancement of information technology services in Thailand, particularly the implementation of networking infrastructure at Kasetsart. Early life and education Yuen Poovarawan was born on 5 November 1950 in Bangkok, Thailand. The third out of six children, he is the elder twin brother of Yong Poovorawan, medical professor at the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. As a child, his family moved to Nakhon Pathom, where he attended Phrapathom Witthayalai School. He graduated Bachelor of Engineering in electrical engineering from Chulalongkorn University in 1972, and completed two engineering master's degrees, also in electrical engineering at Chulalongkorn University, and in industrial engineering at the Asian Institute of Technology, in 1974... Work Yuen began his career in 1973 as an instructor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Kasetsart University, where he has since continued working. He began working on software development for microcomputers in 1978, and worked on natural language processing algorithms from 1980. He and his team demonstrated the first interactive text editor for the Thai language in 1981, and released Thai Easy Writer, the first Thai word processing application, the following year... Yuen was among the proponents for the creation of a standard Thai language system for computers (over twenty had become available by 1984), and vice-chaired the committee for the development of the TIS 620-2529 character set and its subsequent version, TIS 620-2533.. The Microcomputer Research Laboratory, which Yuen was head of, also developed the Thai Kernel System, a hardware- independent system designed to promote system-intercompatibility for Thai- language application development, in 1990, but this failed to gain a user base as it lost ground to the expanding Microsoft Windows systems.. In his research, Yuen pioneered the utilization of dictionary databases for Thai word splitting and machine translation, created the first Thai language thesaurus. and developed word and sentence reconstruction methods for use in spell checking applications, among other things. Much of his work was presented at various national and international conferences.. He also played a pivotal role in the development of Kasetsart University's computer network infrastructure, beginning in 1990 and leading to the implementation of Thailand's first fiber- optic university network, and by 2003, wireless LAN coverage throughout the university's campus, the largest such network in Southeast Asia..

It was the winner of the 1935 Oscar for Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). It was followed in 1936 by a sequel, More Kittens. Plot The film tells the story of three kittens (one black, one orange and one grey) and their adventures in a house. It begins with the kittens left out in the snow. They then notice the house nearby and enter it for shelter. They arrive at its kitchen, and begin to play there after the house's African-American housekeeper has finished preparing a meal. After more playing in various areas of the house, the film switches its focus to one particular kitten, the black one, who is chasing a feather and eventually ends up on a pianola keyboard. The kitten starts to play with the feather walking down the piano keyboard and the feather lands on the 'on' switch with the kitten presses and the then-revealed pianola begins to play; ironically it is playing a variation of \\"Kitten on the Keys\\", a song composed by Zez Confrey in 1921. The other two kittens rejoin the first and play around the pianola. When the pianola finishes its song, the kittens leave it and are caught by the housekeeper. As she prepares to throw them out, she is stopped by a little girl (possibly version of Nancy), who decides to adopt the kittens. Production The film was produced as an entry in Disney's Silly Symphonies series. At the time, the Symphonies were being used as a vehicle to test the techniques which would be used in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and to provide an informal on-the-job training program to prepare artists for the elaborate scenes that would be included in the studio's feature-length productions. As such, the films were intended to focus on the characters, which were intended to be cute, rather than a particularly developed narrative. It was directed by David Hand, who would later direct Snow White, and animated by Ken Anderson. Like all Silly Symphonies made after 1932, it was produced in three-strip Technicolor. The film was copyrighted on November 20, 1935, nearly a month after its release. Releases The film was originally released theatrically in the United States on October 26, 1935. In 1937, it was re-released as part of the Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons, along with four other Academy Award-winning Disney shorts. Home media In 1993, it appeared in a compilation videocassette of Award-winning Disney shorts entitled How the Best Was Won. It has also been found on VHS tapes of Dumbo, along with Father Noah's Ark and The Practical Pig. Most recently, it was released to DVD in 2006 as part of the Walt Disney Treasures compilation, More Silly Symphonies. Censorship The original version of Three Orphan Kittens contains a scene in which the black kitten encounters a doll that, when flipped by the kitten, becomes a stereotypical African- American girl, which shouts \\"Mammy!\\" (a recycled voice clip from Santa's Workshop). In the 1950s and 1960s, when Disney began editing their cartoons before they were broadcast on television, the scene was removed from the film. The film appeared uncensored, first on the VHS release of Dumbo, then on 2006 DVD More Silly Symphonies, where it was placed in a section entitled \\"From the Vault\\" along with other cartoons featuring stereotypes, which was prefaced with an introduction by Leonard Maltin. Reception The Film Daily (Oct 31, 1935): \\"Looks as if Walt Disney has hit on something as entrancing as his three little pigs in these three kittens... The three cute kittens will prove a wow — especially in that sequence where they go to bat with the automatic playing piano and come off second best. That piece of business is a laugh riot.\\" National Exhibitor (Nov 20, 1935): \\"The three kittens come in out of the snow storm, upset household, exploring in the kitchen and parlor, spilling pies, smashing furniture. Excellent color and appealing characterizations of kittens mark this. Excellent.\\" Boxoffice (Dec 7, 1935): \\"Walt Disney's latest Silly Symphony promises to attract the popularity of his Three Little Pigs, certainly one of finest cartoon subjects ever produced. The kittens of the title role are just as cute as the little porkies of the previous short, while their adventures are so delightfully amusing that the patrons will exit from the theatre singing its praises... [The player-piano] proves to be the picture's high spot and will keep audiences in a riot of laughter. Color work is again excellent, short is ideal for youngsters, perfect for adults, and will fit into any bill, any time, any where.\\" Comic adaptation The Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip ran a three-month-long adaptation of Three Orphan Kittens called \\"Three Little Kittens\\" from July 28 to October 20, 1935.

Myzus persicae, known as the green peach aphid, greenfly, or the peach-potato aphid, is a small green aphid. It is the most significant aphid pest of peach trees, causing decreased growth, shrivelling of the leaves and the death of various tissues. It is also acts as a vector for the transport of plant viruses such as cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), potato virus Y (PVY) and tobacco etch virus (TEV). Potato virus Y and potato leafroll virus can be passed to members of the nightshade/potato family (Solanaceae), and various mosaic viruses to many other food crops. Originally described by Swiss entomologist Johann Heinrich Sulzer in 1776, its specific name is derived from the Latin genitive persicae \\"of the peach\\". Life cycle The life cycle of green peach aphid varies considerably, and largely depends on winter temperatures. The green peach aphid can complete a generation with 10 to 12 days. More than 10 generations can occur in a year and even can be as much as 30-40 generation in a favourable climate. In the early spring, overwintering eggs hatch, and nymphs cause damage by feeding on buds, flowers, young foliage as well as stems. The worst damage is in the early summer time for the aphid breeding peak, because winged dispersants from Prunus spp where the egg of overwintering aphid stage deposit nymphs on summer hosts migrating to tobacco, potatoes and cruciferous vegetables to be harmful continuously after a few generations.Van Emden HF, Eastop VF, Hughes RD, Way MJ. 1969. The ecology of Myzus persicae. Annual Review of Entomology 14: 197-270. Distribution The green peach aphid is found worldwide, but is less tolerant of colder climates. It overwinters as an eggs, laid in trees of the genus Prunus. The aphid can benefit from the presence of greenhouses in these areas. Description Adult green peach aphids appear in the summer, and are 1.8 to 2.1 mm long; the head and thorax are black, and the abdomen yellow-green with a dark patch on the back. The nymphs are at first greenish, then yellowish in colour; those that become winged females may be pinkish. Wingless adults resemble nymphs and are 1.7 to 2.0 mm long. The green peach aphid can be yellowish-green, red, or brown in colour because of morphological difference influenced primarily by the host plants, nutrition and temperature.Wang, Maotao et al. 1991 Study on the calorific biotypes of green peach aphid Acta Phytophylacica Sinica 18(4) : 351-353 In the warmer months, and throughout the year in warmer climates, the green peach aphid reproduces asexually; adults produce nymphs on a wide variety of herbaceous plant material, including many vegetable crops such as cabbage and its Brassica relatives, potato and other crops of the family Solanaceae, celery, mustard, pepper, pumpkin, okra, corn, and sunflower and other flower crops. Herbaceous weeds, such as white goosefoot (Chenopodium album) and common tumble weed (Amaranthus retroflexus) in the United States, also act as hosts. An individual can reproduce 12 days after being born and up to 20 generations may occur over the course of a year in warmer areas. As the weather cools, aphids mate and lay their tiny (0.6 mm x 0.3 mm) oval eggs in crevices of the bark of Prunus trees. The green peach aphid is an agricultural pest across the United States and worldwide, including Australia. Although insecticides are used to control it, it develops resistance. Many of its natural enemies can be used as biological control agents in certain crops, such as ladybirds (Coccinellidae) in radish crops, and the wasp Diaeretiella rapae in broccoli. Protecting and taking advantages of natural enemies can control and prevent the number of the green peach aphid by creating the favourable environmental condition which is beneficial for the development of natural enemies such as lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), lacewings (Neuroptera: mainly Chrysopidae), parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae).Among the natural enemies of the M. persicae are both predators and parasitoids, including: beetles such as the Coccinellidae, including the two-spotted ladybird (Adalia bipunctata), seven-spotted ladybird (Coccinella septempunctata), and ten-spotted ladybird (Adalia decempunctata), true bugs such as the anthocorids or pirate bugs of the genera Orius and Anthocoris; neuropterans such as green lacewings of the genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla, hoverflies such as Syrphus, Scaeva, Episyrphus, gall midges such as Aphidolestes, aphid parasitoids such as Aphidius,Response of Aphidius matricariae haliday (Hym.: Aphidiidae) from mummified Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hom : Aphididae) to short term cold storage and parasitic wasps of the family Braconidae. They are also colonised and killed by the insect pathogenic fungi of the order Entomophthorales. Pest impact The presence of the green peach aphid can be detrimental to the quality of the crops. In significant numbers it causes water stress, wilt, and reduce the growth rate of the plant. Prolonged aphid infestation can cause appreciable reduction in yield of root crops and foliage crops. The green peach aphid transmits a number of destructive viruses in pepper including pepper potyviruses and cucumber mosaic cucumovirus，which causes plants to turn yellow and the leaves to curl downward and inward from the edges. Green peach aphid can harm more than 400 species of plants in more than 50 families. By sucking plant sap, it can lose the nutrients of crops and inhibit their growth and development. Its excreta (honey dew) accumulates on the leaves of crops, encouraging mould growth and affecting their growth and quality. The economic loss can be significant.. The aphid is also a major vector for the transport of plant viruses. It is known to be capable of transmitting 78 different plant viruses. Control methodsPhysical and mechanical control= We can utilize the preference for yellow the green peach aphids have to coat with oil or other viscous agents to kill them in the crop protection, from the ground height of 30mm evenly set yellow plate. One useful control measure is to take advantage of the negative taxis the green peach aphid has; hanging silver grey film or using silver grey film nets to cover field crops can inhibit their landing and settlement. Adults can be trapped by taking advantage of their preference for sweet or sour materials. Thus, a 20:2:1 solution of water, vinegar and brown sugar can be used to trap and kill them.Dixon A.F.G 1988 Aphid ecology: an optimization approach. Second edition, UK: Chapman &Hall; =Farming practices= Farmers usually fight against the green peach aphid by taking efficacious cultural practice. Adjusting the planting layout; adjusting the sowing time and harvest time; deep ploughing and winter turning over; appropriate use of crop fertilisers, and timely drainage and irrigation can all be used to minimise impact. =Biological control= The application of plant secondary substance is also playing a pivotal role in the population control since people increasingly put a premium on the environmental protection and sustainable agriculture. Insect growth regulators like diflubenzuron, chlorbenzuron, and botanical pesticides like nicotine，azadirachtin also make the difference in the ecological management to reduce the number of the green peach aphid and damage pest caused. Similarly, the application of artificial insect pheromone or pest induction signal compounds in the field to control pests and attract natural enemies has obtained effective results, E-β-farnesene EβF the aphid alarm pheromone can interfere with aphid location and feeding, and also attract a variety of aphid natural enemies to control aphid population.Cui L, Francis F, Heuskin S, Lognay G, Liu Y, Dong J, Chen J, Song X, Liu Y. 2012. The functional significance of E-beta-Farnesene: Does it influence the populations of aphid natural enemies in the fields? Biological Control, 60: 108-110. =Chemical control= It is commonly believed that cypermethrin, abamectin, chlorpyrifos, methylamine and imidacloprid could be the first chemical agents for aphid control in the field. Although imidacloprid is a good insecticide for the control of pests who have piercing-sucking mouthparts, frequent reuse may lead to the severe resistance of pests.Cho J R, Ho ng K J, Yoo J K , et al1997.

Detweiler then went on a hitting rampage of his own, as he hit safely during 40 consecutive games in the Three-I League to lead Evansville with a .341 average, also leading the team in hits (149), home runs (16), runs batted in (106), extra bases (46), total bases (237), slugging (.520) and games played (120).1942 Evansville Bees He was called up to the renamed Boston Braves and made his Major League debut in late September. He appeared in 12 games and batted .318 (14-for-44), including two doubles and one triple, while driving in five runs and scoring three times. After being drafted to military service, he served as a Private First Class in the US Army from 1943 to 1945. Assigned to the 1301st Service Unit, he regularly played for the New Cumberland Reception Center baseball team with teammates Tommy Hughes, Pat Mullin, Fred Caligiuri and Harry Marnie. He later was transferred to Camp Siebert in Alabama, a replacement training center for the Chemical Warfare Service. Then, along with Hughes, Mullin and Steve Sundra, Detweiler helped make the Camp Siebert Gashouse Gang one of the most dominant forces in southern states military baseball between 1944 and 1945. Detweiler returned to the Braves in 1946, but went hitless in one pinch-hitting appearance before being assigned to Indianapolis of the American Association. In the midseason he was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals and finished the year with Rochester of the International League, batting a combined .230 in 99 games. In 1947, Detweiler was released at his own request and returned to Federalsburg of the Eastern Shore League, where he had started his professional career eight years earlier, and posted a .352 average with 29 home runs and 133 RBIs. In 1950, Detweiler served as player/manager of the Red Springs Red Robins of the Tobacco State League, a Philadelphia Athletics farm club.Holaday, Chris (2016). . Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland. .

He is said to have performed miracles. History Luang Pu Thuat is mentioned in the early regional histories of southern Thailand, but his life is mainly preserved in oral traditions. Stories of the famous monk were passed on by word of mouth for centuries. As a result, it is a mixture of Buddhist elements: early signs, alleged magic, travel, study, meditation and eventual “sainthood.” His movements throughout the southern Thai peninsula constitute a path of pilgrimage for many of his followers. Luang Pu Thuat has also been said to have saved countless lives of people be it the battlefield, car accidents, armed robbery or more with his sacred amulets. Amulets Many people in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia believe that amulets depicting Luang Pu Thuat hold great protective powers granting safety in times of distress, especially saving the lives of believers from seemingly fatal automobile accidents. Phra Archan Tim Dharmataro, abbot of Wat Chang Hai is the pioneer creator of Phra Luang Phor Thuad amulets. Older, sacred amulets of Pu Thuat are considered priceless and very powerful. The first batch of Laung Pu Thuat amulets was made in 2497 BE (1954). It consisted entirely of amulets made from herbs (nua wan). This is the most famous batch of Laung Pu Thuat amulets because it was the first batch; it is referred to as the 2497 batch. All amulets were made of herbs and powder. Subsequently, more amulets were made and coin (rian) variations were added (2500, 2504 etc.). The next most famous batch of amulets was produced in 2505 BE. This batch is famous for the new type of Laung Pu Thuat amulet which was cast in the shape of a traditional iron. This type of amulet is called Lang Taolit. It is famous and highly sought after as it is the first time Lang Taolit amulets were made. There are two types of Lang Taolit - (1) with no words behind (lang taolit) (2) with words behind (lang taolit nang suer). *Nang Suer means book in Thai. There are various moulds for producing the lang taolit (e.g. A, B, and C - with C being the lowest quality with features that were blurred). This is because the mould loses its shape and features as more amulets were made out of them.

His honorary title was Hizen-no-Kami, and he was occasionally referred to as “Prince Hizen” in western accounts during the Bakumatsu period. Biography Portrait of Nabeshima Naomasa in his later years. By Kaneyuki Hyakutake, 1884. Naomasa was born the 17th son of Nabeshima Narinao, the 9th daimyō of Saga Domain. His mother was a daughter of Ikeda Harumichi. His wife was the 18th daughter of shōgun Tokugawa Ienari, and one of his concubines was the 19th daughter of Tokugawa Narimasa. On the retirement of his father in 1830, Naomasa was appointed 10th daimyō of Saga at the age of 17. In celebration of his new role and to reinforce the close relations between Saga domain and the shogunate, his father-in-law Shōgun Tokugawa Ienari allowed him the use of one character from his name. Thus, \\"Narimasa\\" was written (斉正) until the end of the Edo period. Naomasa inherited a domain on the verge or bankruptcy, due to high expenses associated with its role in guarding the foreign settlement at nearby Dejima and due to the profligate spending habits of Naomasa’s father. When Naomasa was appointed daimyō in Edo and prepared to make a journey back to his domain, a mob of creditors besieged his Edo residence demanding repayment on outstanding debts before he departed the city. However, Naomasa’s attempts to reform domain finances were continually blocked by his retired father, whose conservative politics and resistance to innovation were at odds with any new policies he attempted to implement. Naomasa was only able to take full control after the 1835 fire at Saga Castle. Using the need to raise funds to reconstruct the castle as a justification, he cut the number of samurai supported by Saga domain to one-fifth of its previous level, and established a number of industries, including production of weapons, charcoal and tea as domain monopolies. At the same time, he made a strong investment in the domain academy, the to train future leaders of Saga Domain in the latest technologies. Through his contacts at nearby Nagasaki, he imported Armstrong cannon, far more powerful than anything deployed by the Tokugawa shogunate to date, and had the weapons reverse engineered with copies made by Saga armories. He built the first reverberatory furnace in Japan and invited competent artisans, including swordsmiths and metal casters, from around Japan to migrate to Saga regardless of their social standing. He also sponsored the development of steam engines and steam-powered warships. In 1853, with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry to end Japan’s national isolation policy, he was initially vocal in his support of the Sonnō jōi faction, and assisted the Tokugawa government in building coastal defense batteries around Edo Bay. However, he also secretly opened direct negotiations with Great Britain, and later emerged as a proponent of opening the country to foreign trade. He officially retired from the position of daimyō in 1861. Even after retirement, he kept an active hand in the development of Saga Domain, strongly supporting rangaku studies, especially in the fields of western medicine, weaponry and military tactics. He introduced smallpox vaccination into Japan, experimenting first on his own son. In the unsettled Bakumatsu period, Saga emerged as one of the militarily strongest of the Japanese domains, and Naomasa attempted to maintain a policy of neutrality between the moderate Kōbu Gattai faction which wished to reconcile the Tokugawa shogunate with the Imperial Court, and the more radical factions supporting either the Emperor or the Shōgun. During the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, he joined his forces with the Satchō Alliance in support of Emperor Meiji. After the Battle of Toba–Fushimi he fought against the Tokugawa remnants at the Battle of Ueno and in the various campaigns in northern Japan against the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei. Naomasa was appointed a councilor to the new Meiji government. With the abolition of the han system, he surrendered his office and was appointed governor until Saga Domain was absorbed into the new Saga Prefecture in July 1871. Together with Shimazu Yoshitake, he was appointed Commissioner of Colonial Affairs, and tasked with the settlement of Ezo and other lands in northern Japan. He died in 1871 at the Saga domain residence in Tokyo. Some of Naomasa's physical legacies include Saga Castle, which is being actively renovated, and a reconstruction of his Kakurin-tei (郭林亭) Japanese tea house located in the grounds of Kōno Park, Saga City, Japan. The new museum at Saga Castle provides excellent information on Naomasa's life and accomplishments.

Plot  Raj (Anubhav Mohanty) is a rich, city boy, born to billionaire parents and brought up in London. On the other hand, Rani (Barsa Priyadarshini)is a traditional, simple desi girl from Odisha who is brought up by her only brother, Bijay (Siddhant Mahapatra). He is heartbroken when their father marries another woman and throws them out of the house, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies and her tomb is built on the small land which they own until the landlord tells them that it is his land, since their mother had taken a loan from the man. Bijay volunteers to work day and night, to pay off the loan as long as they don't tear down his mother's tomb. The landlord agrees and the local station master helps them. Slowly Bijay and Rani grow up. One day, Shibani, Rani's best friend, comes to their house to invite Rani to their house as she is getting married. Shibani's cousin, Raj also arrives on the same day with his mother, Rajashree (Snigdha Mohanty). Slowly Raj and Rani fall in love but Raj's mother does not bear it as Rani is not as rich as them, and is thus not to their standards; Raj is also to be married to Rajashree's brother's business partner's daughter, Rima. Rajashree humiliates Rani as well as Bijay, who arrives a minute before, and both are thrown of the house after Rajashree accuses them of trying to entice and trap Raj. When Raj learns of this, he goes to Rani's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Bijay gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by the landlord when he was little. Raj is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them and grow more crops than Bijay by the end of the season; if he does not, Raj will be thrown out of the village and can never see Rani again. The landlord and his son is not happy as the landlord's son wanted to marry Rani. With them and Rima and her father trying to get Raj to lose the competition, Raj has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice everyday, even though he can't bear it. Through many antics from the landlord's side and Rima's side, Raj eventually proves his love for Rani to Bijay, and succeeds in growing more grains. However, landlord & his son kidnap Rani and then later tries to rape her. A fight takes place in which Raj kills the landlord's son. Bijay, after realizing that Raj and Rani should be together, takes the blame for this and spends five years in prison. The movie ends with Bijay's release from prison which is also when Rani and Raj get married, in everyone's presence. Rajashree then accepts Rani to be her daughter-in-law.

Source: bma.amsterdam.nl Oost- Indisch Huis by Reinier Vinkeles, 1768. Source: bma.amsterdam.nl The restored meeting room of the Heeren XVII (the Lords Seventeen), the regents of the Dutch East India Company Eastern wing along Kloveniersburgwal canal added in 1891 to replace the Bushuis The Oost-Indisch Huis (Dutch for \\"East India House\\") is an early 17th-century building in the centre of Amsterdam. It was the headquarters of the Amsterdam chamber of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC). It is a listed Dutch national heritage site (rijksmonument).  History  In 1603, the Amsterdam chamber of the East India Company began using part of the Bushuis armory on the Kloveniersburgwal canal as a warehouse. Two years later, the East India Company took over the whole building. However, the company still lacked meeting and office space, so a new building was constructed directly adjacent to the Bushuis. This building, completed in 1606, was called the Oost-Indisch Huis (\\"East India House\\") and was the first building especially built for the East India Company. In 1663-64, the western wing was extended. In addition, a northern wing was added, so that the building now also bordered the street Oude Hoogstraat. The last major extension was added between 1658 and 1661. A gate with Tuscan-style pilasters and a small tunnel lead to an inner courtyard with elegant facades in Amsterdam Renaissance style, a style closely identified with the architect Hendrick de Keyser, who was most likely responsible for designing the building. The Oost-Indisch Huis was the first building especially built for the East India Company. It was multifunctional, serving simultaneously as a warehouse, administrative center, office and auction room. The building served as the headquarters of the Amsterdam chamber (Kamer) of the East India Company. The 20 regents of the Amsterdam chamber met here. In addition, the majority of meetings of the Heeren XVII (the Lords Seventeen), the regents of the East India Company, were also held at the Oost- Indisch Huis. Shipcrews were recruited here, and the archives and map collection of the East India Company were also kept here. After the East India Company was dissolved in 1798, the building served until 1808 as the seat of the colonial government of the Batavian Republic. In 1891, the adjacent Bushuis was demolished and a new eastern wing, designed by Cornelis Peters, was added along the inner courtyard. In 1976 the building underwent restoration. During this restoration, the grand meeting room was also reconstructed. The building has been declared a national monument (rijksmonument). The building is now in use by the University of Amsterdam.  Related buildings  The East India Company chambres in Rotterdam, Delft, Enkhuizen and Hoorn also had an Oost-Indisch Huis as their headquarters. The building in Rotterdam was destroyed during the Rotterdam Blitz in 1940; however, the ones in Delft and Hoorn are still in existence. Amsterdam also has a West-Indisch Huis, which served as headquarters of the Dutch West India Company, and which has also been declared a Dutch national monument.

Because McKinney and her accomplice skipped bail and fled to the United States before the case could be tried and were not extradited, they were never tried for these specific crimes. According to Anderson, he had been abducted by McKinney from the steps of a church meetinghouse, chained to a bed and raped by her. Incident A young Mormon missionary, Kirk Anderson, went missing on 14 September 1977, in Ewell, Surrey. He was allegedly abducted from the steps of a meetinghouse of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Keith May, 24, who had posed as an investigator into Mormonism, using a fake handgun and chloroform. Three days later, a freed Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted, driven to Devon, and imprisoned against his will, chained to a bed in a cottage, where Joyce Bernann McKinney (a former 1973 Miss Wyoming World; born August 6, 1949 as Joy McKinney) had attempted to seduce and then raped him. Police set up a sting operation by having Anderson set up a 21 September rendezvous with McKinney and May leading to the two suspects being arrested. Judicial proceedings On 19 September 1977, McKinney and her alleged conspirator Keith May were arrested and charged with kidnap and assault. They vigorously denied the charges. While being taken to Epsom for a court appearance, she held a notice up at the window of the police vehicle saying, \\"Kirk left with me willingly!\\" At the committal hearing, McKinney stated of Anderson: \\"I loved him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to.\\" Press reports and McKinney's solicitor refer to the size differential between McKinney, described as slightly built, and Anderson, described as substantially larger. Under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 then in force in the United Kingdom, because of the victim's gender, there was no crime of rape committed, though indecent assault of a man did apply. McKinney and May jumped bail and absconded from the UK on 12 April 1978. Their trial for kidnap had been due to begin on 2 May. A judge at London's Central Criminal Court in June 1978 sentenced McKinney and May in absentia to a year in prison for skipping bail (if their bail money, £1,000 each, was not paid to the court in forfeit). No extradition proceedings were instituted by Britain. On 18 July 1979, May and McKinney were both arrested in the United States by the FBI on charges of making false statements in order to obtain passports. They both received suspended sentences. Coverage in the media The coverage in British newspapers in the final months of 1977 was extensive. Some newspapers sought to obtain \\"scoops\\" on the story, and to undermine each other as they managed to obtain and publish exclusive information. For example, the Daily Mirror researched McKinney's past and reported over several days that she had been a nude model. The Daily Mail attempted to devalue the Mirrors reports by advertising itself as \\"The paper without Joyce McKinney\\". Brian Whitaker has observed that the case provided \\"light relief\\" for the newspaper-reading public, from more serious stories about politicians. Roger Wilkes states that the coverage of the case \\"cheered Britain up no end\\". A Church of Scotland working party on obscenity in 1979 observed the \\"gusto\\" with which newspapers covered and followed the case observing the coverage was accompanied by \\"the kind of illustration which a decade ago would have been under plain sealed cover\\". The coverage was extensive in part because the case was considered so anomalous, involving as it did the issue of rape of a man by a woman. Backhouse and Cohen reported in 1978 that many men, privately, expressed their disbelief of such a possibility. The case was documented in Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon, a book by Anthony Delano in 1978, who based his work on assembled Daily Mirror coverage.Woestendiek 2010 Later developments In 1984 McKinney was again the subject of police action for allegedly stalking Anderson at his workplace, though he was now married with children. Keith May, her conspirator, died in 2004. In 2008, a story about a woman named \\"Bernann McKinney\\" appeared in the media after the woman had her pet dog cloned in South Korea. Journalists tied the two incidents together in articles identifying facial similarity between \\"Bernann McKinney\\" and Joyce Bernann McKinney. After initial denials the International Herald Tribune and other publications carried an admission by McKinney that she was the person named in the 1977 case. The revival of interest in the story led the documentary filmmaker Errol Morris to produce a 2010 film, Tabloid, based on the media sensation surrounding the story. The film gives extra details, from press reports of the day and from participants in the story, to the use of a (possibly fake) gun during Anderson's abduction, and Anderson being tied up during his alleged rape by McKinney. The film also gave further details regarding McKinney's work as a call girl, earning funds for her team's international adventure by offering bondage and S&M; services around the time she became obsessed with Anderson. In January 2016, McKinney filed suit against Morris, claiming that she had been misrepresented in the film and that Morris and others related to the documentary's production had broken into her home, stolen personal items related to the case, and threatened the life of her service dog if McKinney did not sign release papers allowing them to use her footage for the film. Legal representatives for Morris stated that \\"evidence will show that [McKinney] willingly – in fact, eagerly – participated in the lengthy interview that is featured in the film.\\" Morris stated in an interview later that year that the charges had been dismissed as \\"frivolous\\". Anderson is now a real estate agent and shies away from publicity. McKinney is reported to now use a wheelchair for mobility. At one point she lived in Newland, in the western North Carolina mountains. More recently, she has lived as a homeless person in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles. =Vehicular manslaughter charge= In July 2019, The Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division (VTD) named McKinney as the person involved in a fatal hit and run that took the life of Gennady Bolotsky, a 91-year-old Holocaust survivor. The incident took place in the North Hollywood neighborhood of Valley Village on Monday, June 16, 2019, at around 5:40 A.M. Bolotsky was walking his dog at a crosswalk on Magnolia Boulevard and Wilkinson Avenue when he was struck by a white 2006 GMC pick-up truck. The incident was captured by surveillance video from a nearby business. Stills from this video were released by police, and locals identified the vehicle as that of a then-unidentified homeless woman who had been the subject of frequent police reports. On June 21, 2019, investigators followed a lead that the suspected vehicle was parked in the city of Burbank near the Burbank Airport. Investigators located McKinney, who appeared to be living in the vehicle along with her three dogs. During the investigation, detectives learned that McKinney had outstanding warrants for battery and public nuisance from an unrelated investigation. McKinney was taken into custody for her preexisting warrants and booked into Valley Jail Division in Van Nuys. McKinney's vehicle was impounded by VTD investigators and processed for evidence related to the fatal collision. On July 1, 2019, the VTD presented their case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney and charged McKinney with assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm, hit and run with injury, and vehicular manslaughter. A sentencing enhancement was proposed due to injury to a person over 70 years of age. McKinney remained in custody on the previous warrants, under a combined bail of $137,500. If convicted, she faces up to a maximum of 11 years in state prison. McKinney was ordered to a psychiatric evaluation and, on July 11, 2019, she was sent to the Los Angeles Court division for mentally incompetent defendants. McKinney was taken to the Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. In February 2020, a judge in Van Nuys ruled once again she was not competent. Her next hearing was scheduled for August 2020.

HUT was designed and built by a team based at Johns Hopkins University, led by Arthur Davidsen. The telescope consisted of a 90 cm main mirror used to focus ultraviolet light onto a spectrograph situated at the prime focus. This instrument had a spectroscopic range of 82.5 to 185 nms, and a spectral resolution of about 0.3 nm. It weighed 789 kilograms (1736 pounds). HUT was used to observe a wide range of astrophysical sources, including supernova remnants, active galactic nuclei, cataclysmic variable stars, as well as various planets in the Solar System. During the 1990 flight, HUT was used to make 106 observations of 77 astronomical targets. During the 1995 flight, 385 observations were made of 265 targets. HUT was co-mounted with WUPPE, HIT, and BBXRT on the Astro-1 mission (1990) and with just WUPPE and HIT on Astro-2 (in 1995).Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope HUT is on display at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. in the United States.

Early life He was born in Himara, in modern southern Albania, then part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1810 he went to Naples in Italy, where he remained until 1819, studying military theory and learning Latin and French. In 1819, he returned to his homeland to prepare a geographic survey for his school, but was arrested by Ali Pasha of Ioannina, who employed him at his court as a military adviser. Greek War of Independence In August 1824, after Ali’s death, together with his brothers Nikolaos and Zachos Milios, Spyromilios, he travelled south and joined the ongoing Greek War of Independence. In August 1825 he was fighting in the Third Siege of Missolonghi, at the head of a group of 250 armed Himariotes. Named General in September, he was sent as a member of a commission to Nafplion in January 1826, to ask the government for more effective aid to the besieged city. Little was achieved, and although Spyromilios tried to arrange for a British ship to evacuate the garrison, it was too late. Spyromilios was thus forced to remain a spectator of the garrison's disastrous attempt to sally and break through the Ottoman lines, during which his brother Nikolaos was killed. Afterwards, together with his brother Zachos, he took part in military operations in Central Greece under Georgios Karaiskakis. Under Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias (1828–1829), Spyromilios was placed captain of the personal guard of Dimitrios Ypsilantis. After Independence After the end of the War of Independence, Spyromilios settled in Thebes, but as a known supporter of Kapodistrias, he was imprisoned for 9 months in the Palamidi fortress (September 1833-June 1834). Released and reinstated to the army, he became director of the Evelpidon Military Academy in 1840-1844. The first Greek to hold that post, he also wrote the Academy's first book of regulations. From this position he participated in the 3 September 1843 Revolution that led to the granting of the first Constitution of Greece. This led him to be considered as an enemy of King Otto, but he soon regained the King's trust. He was appointed General Secretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs in 1848 and adjutant to the King, and in 1850 he was appointed Minister of Military Affairs, a post he kept until 1853. Following the outbreak of the Crimean War, he supported Greek revolts in the Ottoman Empire, despite the neutrality forced upon Greece by Britain and France. His involvement in a revolt in Epirus (1854) led to his dismissal from his offices and his suspension from the Army. Retired from the Army, he returned to politics from 1859, and served as Minister of Military Affairs in the several cabinets: *1859 under Athanasios Miaoulis *1862 under Gennaios Kolokotronis *1867 under Aristidis Moraitinis *1869 under Dimitrios Voulgaris In 1864-1865, he was a member of the short-lived Council of State, while in 1872, he was elected speaker of the Greek Parliament. In his memoirs (published in 1926), he gives detailed account of his life. They are an important contemporary document, especially regarding the Siege of Missolonghi.

With Heathfield, its junior school from the ages of 3 to 11, it provides education for pupils aged between 3 and 18 years, with boarding from the age of 11. History The school was founded and endowed by John Wheelwright in 1724 and established in a building which is now the school chapel. When the Wheelwright Building was built in 1826 the old building was converted into a chapel for the people of Rishworth, until St John's Church, Rishworth opened at the end of the 19th century. Other school buildings near the Wheelwright building were built in 1930, 1933 and 1950. Today the school extends over with a range of buildings developed to accommodate pupils. More recently, in 1963, a new Music and Drama building was opened, and by 1984, a new teaching block was opened, consisting of four science laboratories, a large assembly hall, and numerous other classrooms hosting Mathematics, English and Modern Languages. An extension to the teaching block was completed in 1988 which saw the addition of a two- storey Design and Technology department, along with workshops. The school is a founder member of the Society of Headmasters & Headmistresses of Independent Schools, established in 1961 through the then Headmasters' Conference. The sports hall was opened by Joe Royle during his time as manager of Oldham Athletic. The sports club (located at Heathfield) was opened by The Princess Royal in June 2007. The new sports pavilion was opened in May 2011 by rugby player Mark Cueto. Inspection Rishworth School was most recently inspected by the Independent Schools' Inspectorate in November 2017. The school received the highest grading of excellent in all categories and more specifically with reference to pupils' academic and personal development. The report can be found on the Independent Schools' Inspectorate website at https://www.isi.net/reports/ as well as the Schools' website. The report notes the enthusiasm that pupils of all ages have towards their learning cultivated within a creative and supportive educational framework that includes a vibrant Intellectual Curiosity scheme that has expanded to include Space launches, and a Formula One in Schools engineering programme alongside the flagship Manchester and London Research Projects. Boarding There are five boarding houses, Wheelwright (girls), Slitheroe, Goat House Barn, Redmires, Ryburn, and Wolden (male), with total housing for 150. Each house has study bedrooms, TVs and computers, and provides disabled facilities. Routine in the houses is structured, with fixed times for meals, homework and free time. Bedrooms typically hold two to four boarders, but senior students, especially sixth formers, have their own rooms. There are medical and health arrangements, and a nearby sanatorium staffed by matrons. Boarders are able to take out-of-class and extra-curricular activities and, like day pupils, have the use of school facilities. The sixth form The School advises parents on the choice of sixth-form courses. Most pupils seeking entry to higher education take four subjects at AS Level in the Lower Sixth and then specialise in three of these to full A Level in the Upper Sixth. The Sixth Form provides for advice on careers and life skills, and discussion of practical, topical, social and moral issues. Sixth Form A Level students are allocated a personal tutor to monitor their progress academically and pastorally and advise on careers, further education and the completion of U.C.A.S. applications.

Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions. All proposed definitions are controversial in their own ways. Survey of leading definitions Early definitions = Aristotle defined mathematics as: > The science of quantity. In Aristotle's classification of the sciences, discrete quantities were studied by arithmetic, continuous quantities by geometry.James Franklin, \\"Aristotelian Realism\\" in Philosophy of Mathematics\\", ed. A.D. Irvine, p. 104. Elsevier (2009). Auguste Comte's definition tried to explain the role of mathematics in coordinating phenomena in all other fields:Arline Reilein Standley, Auguste Comte, p. 61. Twayne Publishers (1981). > The science of indirect measurement.Florian Cajori et al., A History of > Mathematics, 5th ed., p. 285–6. American Mathematical Society (1991). > Auguste Comte 1851 The \\"indirectness\\" in Comte's definition refers to determining quantities that cannot be measured directly, such as the distance to planets or the size of atoms, by means of their relations to quantities that can be measured directly.Auguste Comte, The Philosophy of Mathematics, tr. W.M. Gillespie, pp. 17–25. Harper & Brothers, New York (1851). = Greater abstraction and competing philosophical schools = The preceding kind of definition, which had prevailed since Aristotle's time, were abandoned in the 19th century as new branches of mathematics — such as group theorySee History of Group Theory for more., analysis, projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry. — were developed and which bore no obvious relation to measurement or the physical world. As mathematicians pursued greater rigor and more-abstract foundations, some proposed new definitions of mathematics which are purely based on logic: > Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions.Foundations and > fundamental concepts of mathematics By Howard Eves page 150 Benjamin Peirce > 1870 > All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic.Bertrand Russell, The Principles of > Mathematics, p. 5. University Press, Cambridge (1903) Bertrand Russell 1903 Peirce did not think that mathematics is the same as logic, since he thought mathematics makes only hypothetical assertions, not categorical ones.Carl Boyer, Uta Merzbach, A History of Mathematics, p. 426. John Wiley & Sons (2011). Russell's definition, on the other hand, expresses the logicist philosophy of mathematics without reservation. Competing philosophies of mathematics hence put forth different definitions of mathematics. Opposing the completely deductive character of logicism, intuitionism is another school of thought which emphasizes mathematics as the construction of ideas in the mind: > Mathematics is mental activity which consists in carrying out, one after the > other, those mental constructions which are inductive and effective. In other words, by combining fundamental ideas together, one reaches a definite result in mathematics. On the other hand, formalism denies both physical and mental meaning to mathematics, and instead makes the symbols and rules themselves the object of study. For a typical formalist: > Mathematics is the manipulation of the meaningless symbols of a first-order > language according to explicit, syntactical rules. Aside from the definitions above, other definitions approach mathematics by emphasizing the element of pattern, order or structure. For example: > Mathematics is the classification and study of all possible patterns. Walter > Warwick Sawyer, 1955 Yet another approach is to make abstraction the defining criterion: > Mathematics is a broad-ranging field of study in which the properties and > interactions of idealized objects are examined. = Definitions in general reference works = Most contemporary reference works define mathematics by summarizing its main topics and methods: > The abstract science which investigates deductively the conclusions implicit > in the elementary conceptions of spatial and numerical relations, and which > includes as its main divisions geometry, arithmetic, and algebra. > mathematicsOxford English Dictionary, 1933 > The study of the measurement, properties, and relationships of quantities > and sets, using numbers and symbols. American Heritage Dictionary, 2000 > The science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from > elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of > objects. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2006  Playful, metaphorical, and poetic definitions  Bertrand Russell wrote this famous tongue-in-cheek definition, describing the way all terms in mathematics are ultimately defined by reference to undefined terms: > The subject in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether > what we are saying is true. Bertrand Russell 1901 Many other attempts to characterize mathematics have led to humor or poetic prose: > A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which > isn't there.\\"Pi in the Sky\\", John Barrow Charles Darwin > A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his > patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with > ideas. G. H. Hardy, 1940 > Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.

Based on a radio program, the show starred Russell Hayden (1912–1981), Eddie Dean (1907–1999), and Riley Hill as Marshal No. 1, Marshal No. 2, and Marshal No. 3, respectively. Hayden, who is not identified by a character name, left the program because he was dissatisfied with the way it was directed. Dean uses his own name in the series, and Hill is known as \\"Riley Roberts\\". Smith Ballew took over the title role in May 1950. Roscoe Ates (1895–1962) played the stuttering, popeyed deputy Roscoe; Andy Parker (1913–1977), Andy, and Bert Wenland (1929–2004), Bud Glover.Jan Sterling (1921–2004), then Jane Adrian, appeared at the age of twenty-nine as Ruth, the deputy's niece. In May 1950, Kay Christopher was the female lead. The Internet Movie Data Base lists only the premiere episode of The Marshal of Gunsight Pass: \\"Shotgun Messenger\\", which aired on March 12, 1950. Other actors appearing in the episode were Hugh Hooker (1919–1987) as David Clay, Marshall Reed (1917–1980) as Larry Thomas, and Steve Conte (1920–1987) as The Road Agent. Three actors made their only career screen appearances on The Marshal of Gunsight Pass: Eddie Coffman as \\"The Gunfighter\\", Greg Rogers as Cal Darby, and Marcia Wren as \\"The Woman\\". The ABC program was broadcast from the former Vitagraph Studios site, near Chatsworth, which the network had bought. The network invested more than $1 million to enable production of this and other live programs. All scenes were shot indoors, with projectors used to create background images — stationary or moving — for outdoor action. Geared toward a children's audience, the program was telecast live to West Coast stations and viewed via kinescope elsewhere. Even in 1950, the production of the program seemed unusually primitive. However, the studio did have a large collection of western props and sets, as well as live horses. The 22-episode series aired live at 7 p.m. on Thursdays on the West Coast. Nancy Goodwin was the program's chief writer. From 1952-1954, CBS also aired a live afternoon western, Action in the Afternoon.

Early in her career she was involved in two fratricidal incidents, one involving a British frigate and then a newsworthy case in which she helped capture a British slave ship. She later captured a small naval vessel and several privateers, and took part in the invasion of Martinique, and during the War of 1812, in the attack on Baltimore. Wolverine was decommissioned in August or September 1815 and was sold on 15 February 1816. Service Wolverine entered service in 1805 under Commander John Smith (or Smyth). In November Wolverine and the frigate encountered each other off the coast of Madeira. After a series of ambiguous and misinterpreted moves by the other, the two captains mistook each other for enemies and opened fire. Both vessels survived and the two captains proceeded to exchange mutually recriminatory letters.Willis (2008), pp.18-20. Commander Francis Augustus Collier replaced Smith on 15 January 1806. Wolverine then deployed to the Caribbean. On 12 March Wolverine, after a chase of 15 hours, captured the French Navy schooner Tremeuse (or Trimeuse, or Tremieuse), which was armed with two 9-pounder carronades and one long 6-pounder; she had a crew of 53 men and was from Guadeloupe.

At 10pm, Dart, under Commander Joseph Spear, and Wolverine came upon a ship that they suspected was a French privateer and that kept up a running fight until morning, only surrendering after her captain and several of her crew had been wounded, of whom six later died. The vessel turned out to be the British 24-gun slaver , out of Liverpool, under Captain Hugh Crow (or Crowe).Clowes (1897-1903), pp.394-5The slave trade was not, in 1806, illegal. Only in the next year did the Slave Trade Act 1807 abolish the slave trade for British subjects.

Commander Spear gave him a letter of praise for his determined resistance and the fight became something of a sensation; on his return home Crow received honour, glory, and a substantial reward for his gallantry.The Archer's Register (1864), p.235-6 Also, \\"many of the wretched negroes were killed or injured.\\"Crow was a slaver who had earlier fought in two other engagements. The French vessel Robuste, of twenty-four 12-pounders and 150 men, had captured him in 1794. Then on 21 February 1800, as captain of , of eighteen 6-pounders and 50 men, he fought off a French privateer with the loss of three crewmen and two slaves killed, and 10 men wounded. He recounted his career and the fights in detail in his autobiography (Crow 1970). On 27 January 1807 Wolverine was in sight when Jason captured the French sloop Favorite. Jason had been detached, together with the brig Wolverine, to the coast of Surinam to search for Favorite, which she discovered in January and captured in a short engagement. Favorite had been a Royal Navy sloop that the French had captured in January 1806; the Royal Navy took her back into service as Goree. Four days later, Wolverine chased and captured the French privateer Petite Confiance, which had been cruising from Guadeloupe for the previous month. During the chase she had thrown two of her three guns overboard. She had a crew of 50 and had been out of Guadeloupe for a month without taking any prizes. On 22 April 1808, the sloop Goree, under Commander Joseph Spear, engaged the French brigs Palinure and Pilade in an inconclusive action. The schooner Superieur came to Gorees assistance, followed a little while later by the frigate Circe and Wolverine, which arrived too late to engage.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.41-2. On 31 October Circe captured Palinure. Command briefly passed to Commander John Simpson in 1809, who commanded Wolverine during the invasion of Martinique in January and February 1809. On 15 January 1809 Wolverine, in company with , and , captured the French brig Josephine. That same day Wolverine captured Napoleon. Simpson transferred to Goree and command of Wolverine passed to Commander Joseph Spear. On the morning of 12 April Spear arrived at the Admiralty office with Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane's dispatches announcing the surrender of Martinique. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Martinique\\" to all still surviving participants in the campaign. Commander Charles J. Kerr took command on 11 December 1809, transferring from . On 27 September 1810 Wolverine had been in pursuit of a French brig when joined the chase and after two and a half hours captured the quarry off the Lizard. The French vessel was the privateer San Joseph, of Saint Malo, under the command of a Joseph Wittevronghel, a Dane. San Joseph was one year old, about 100 tons (bm), and armed with 14 guns though she was pierced for 16. She had only been out one day when the British captured her and had taken nothing. Also, had been in company with Wolverine. Lloyd's List reported on 17 May 1811 that Wolverine had left Gibraltar on 29 April as escort to a convoy of some 16 vessels, including the store ship .Lloyd's List №4563. A court martial tried a seaman from Wolverine on 7 October 1811. The charge was that the seaman had absented himself without leave and had taken one of the ship's boats to do so. He received a sentence of 300 lashes.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 26, p.334. On 17 November, Wolverine recaptured the sloop Minerva. Wolverine was in sight on 15 February 1812 when the hired armed lugger Sandwich recaptured North Star. On 7 November 1813, Wolverine captured the 6-gun Lugger no. 961, off Barfleur. No. 961 belonged to the Cherbourg flotilla. She was armed with six guns, had a crew of 32 men and was under the command of Lieutenant Berard. On 13 December Wolverine intercepted King of Rome, an American letter of marque, laden with colonial produce. On 26 April 1814, Wolverine sailed with a convoy for Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec and New Brunswick. On 4 September Kerr became acting captain of Tonnant, the flagship of Sir Alexander Cochrane, on the coast of North America. Between 12 and 15 September, Wolverine participated in the unsuccessful British attack on Baltimore. On 5 October George Guy Burton was promoted to Commander and removed from Tonnant to Wolverine,Marshall (1833), Vol. 4, Part 1, p.334. Fate Burton sailed Wolverne home.O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.152. Wolverine was paid off either on 27 August 1815, or 8 September 1815, and then put in ordinary at Deptford. The Admiralty listed her for sale on 29 January 1816, and then sold her on 15 February for £810. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References  * Norie, J. W.

He was the younger son of Austrian composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. George's father first went to Hollywood in 1934 to work on the Max Reinhardt production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and travelled to and from Vienna for the next several years. During this time, George remained in Vienna: it was not until 1938 and the family's decisive move from that city that George arrived in the United States with his parents. Reports that George Korngold attended the Vienna Academy of Music are thus mysterious: at the time he left Vienna, he was not yet ten years old. However, since Erich Korngold taught at the Academy throughout the early 1930s, it is thought possible that the young boy was permitted to be present in classes. As a record producer, George Korngold was much involved with film music, in the 1970s co-producing (with Charles Gerhardt) the 14-volume Classic Film Scores Series for RCA Records. He also produced a series of 'landmark' recordings of his father's works, including the operas Die tote Stadt (for RCA) and Violanta (for CBS) and a disc of the First and Third String Quartets (for RCA; played by the Chilingirian Quartet). In 1979, he produced one of the first digital audio recordings, for Chalfont Records; it was the first commercial release of his father's music for Kings Row, Charles Gerhardt conducting. In Hollywood, George Korngold worked as a music editor on a number of high-profile films, including the big-budget The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), Fedora (1978), The Fury (1978) and Outland (1981).

She had a relatively uneventful career before the Navy sold her in 1819. Service Forester entered service in 1806 under Captain John Richards and was sent to act as a convoy escort for ships sailing to the Baltic. During this service Forester also recaptured a British merchant vessel. Off the Netherlands she captured the smuggler Hiram. In 1808 Forester was caught in a gale in which several vessels were wrecked;Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.16-17. Forester was also tasked with burning the frigate , one of the vessels that had been wrecked. Soon afterward Forester escorted a convoy to Gorée and was then refitted at Spithead, subsequently sailing to Corunna. Forester sailed for the West Indies on 29 August 1808. Operating off Barbados, Forester participated in the invasion of Martinique in January 1809. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded all surviving claimants from the campaign the NGSM with clasp \\"Martinique\\". On 31 May 1809 Richards sent boats from his small squadron under the command of Lieutenant Robert Carr of the gun-brig Attentive to capture a French letter of marque and a schooner from under the protection of four long-guns and 300 soldiers at the Port du Molas. Carr captured the vessels and then landed, spiked the guns, and blew up the French magazine. Command passed to John E. Watt later in 1809, and under his command Forester also participated in the capture of Guadeloupe in January and February 1810. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\" to all surviving participants of the campaign. In 1812 Commander Alexander Kennedy replaced Watt. On 23 March 1813 Forester sailed to Jamaica to replace , which had recently returned to Spithead. Foresters orders were to accompany as escort to a convoy and there to place herself under the orders of Admiral Charles Stirling. On 5 May and Forester captured the American privateer Mary Ann off San Domingo. She was armed with a long 9-pounder gun and a 4-pounder. Mary Ann was under the command of Peter Charriol and had a crew of 30, one of whom was found dead. She was 20 days out of Charleston and had made no captures. From the number of small arms on board, Kennedy suspected that Charriol had planned to gather more men. On 15 May and Forrester captured the 5-gun Lovely Lass off Jamaica. The capture followed a chase of 19 hours, during which the Lovely Lass threw four of her guns overboard. Her commander was Mr. John Smith of the American Navy, and she had a crew of 60 men. Smith reported that he had been out 44 days and had made no captures. A later report gave her tonnage as 80 tons and her crew as 73 men. She was from Wilmington and Circe sent her to Kingston. On 5 July, Forrester captured the ship Granger. On 27 November 1813 Forester captured an American schooner of unknown name. In April 1814, the Navy dismissed Kennedy from Forester and suspended him from his rank for two years for disobeying orders from Rear-Admiral William Brown.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 32, Jul-Dec 1814, p.152.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 3, p.385.

His status as a historical figure is a matter of debate. The Platonic dialogues Timaeus and Critias, written around 360 BC, relate (through the voice of Critias) how the Athenian statesman Solon (638–558 BC) traveled to Egypt and in the city of Sais encountered the priests of the goddess Neith. A very aged priest tells him that 9000 years earlier, Athens had been in conflict with the great power of Atlantis, which was then destroyed in a catastrophe.Plato, Timaeus. Plato's dialogue does not mention a name for the priest, but Plutarch (46–120 AD), in his Life of Solon identified the aged priest as Sonchis: Plutarch gives a more detailed description on the Greek philosophers who visited Egypt and received advice by the Egyptian priests in his book On Isis and Osiris. Thus, Thales of Miletus, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Solon, Pythagoras, (some say Lycurgus of Sparta also) and Plato, traveled into Egypt and conversed with the priests. Eudoxus was instructed by Chonupheus of Memphis, Solon by Sonchis of Saïs and Pythagoras by Oenuphis of Heliopolis.Plutarch, On Isis And Osiris, ch. 10.

The first Syrian film was Al Muttaham al Baree (The Innocent Suspect), released in 1928. Since the early 1960s, the film sector has been mainly managed by the National Organization for Cinema, a department of Ministry of Culture. The film industry blossomed in the 1960s, despite a significant shift toward nationalistic documentaries, and has continued to garner attention. Prominent filmmakers include Nazih Shabandar, Rasheed Jalal, and Qays al-Zubeydi. History In 1908, the first film ever screened in Syria was shown at a cafe in Aleppo. Eight years later, the Ottoman administration established the first film theater, in Damascus. The theater was inaugurated by the Ottoman governor, Jamal Pasha; however, it was burned down one month later. The French assumed mandate over Syria at the time, and many theaters were subsequently built in Damascus. The first Syrian film was Al Muttaham al Baree (The Innocent Suspect), a silent black-and-white feature released in 1928. The film was written, directed and produced by Rasheed Jalal, in association with Ahmed Tello. The crew set another precedent by forming the first Syrian production company: Hermon Film. In 1934, the second silent black-and-white film, Tahta Sama' Dimashq (Under the Damascus Sky), was released, coinciding with the Egyptian musical talkie, Unshudat al Fuad (Hymn of the Heart). The Syrian film became a commercial failure, as it was overshadowed by Unshudat al Fuad's success. In 1943 the 1,500 seat Cinema Dimashq, one of the largest movie theaters ever constructed in the Eastern Mediterranean, opened in Damascus. In 1947, Nazih Shabandar established a production studio filled with equipment he created. The following year, he produced the first Syrian talkie, Nur wa Thalam (Light and Darkness), written by Mohamed Shamel and Ali el-Arna'ut. The film was also significant because it featured several rising Syrian stars: Rafiq Shukri, Yevett Feghli, and Anwar el Baba. Film production improved during the 1950s, but was still hindered by lackluster distribution. The 1960s saw significant improvements with Doreid Lahham and Nuhad al-Qala'i, a comedic duo, generating higher profit margins than their predecessors. Their first film was Aqd al-Lulu (Necklace of Pearls), released in 1965. Aqd al-Lulu was the first in a tightly linked series of comedy films from the duo. Thanks to ample profits, they were able to produce films at a rate of two per year. The 1960s also marked a period of transition for Syrian film-making. In 1963, the General Organization for Cinema was established as an arm of the Ministry of Culture to oversee the production and distribution of Syrian films. Due to the deaths of Arabs in the Six-Day War and Syria's loss of the Golan Heights, the government granted the General Organization for Cinema strict monopoly over the production and distribution of films. Consequently, the private film industry all but phased out by the end of the 1960s. The government focused on films promoting Syrian advances in agriculture, health and transportation. Documentary films were produced in large numbers to promote the construction of infrastructure; the impact of agricultural reform; and the provision of public services. In other words, the Syrian cinema shifted from entertainment to propaganda. Iraqi film maker Qays al-Zubeydi produced multiple films documenting the struggles of Palestinian refugees. Films like Bai'dan 'an al- Watan (Far from their Country) and Shahadat al-Filastinyyin fi Zaman al-Harb (Testimonies of Palestinians in the Time of War), released in 1970 and 1972 respectively, circulated around the Arab world to influence the masses. The first fictional movie produced by the General Organization for Cinema was Sa'eq al-Shahinah (The Truck Driver), directed by Yugoslavian film maker Poçko Fockovic and released in 1967.

It may be printed or handwritten. The term is commonly used to identify a single book that is part of a larger collection. Volumes are typically identified sequentially with Roman or Arabic numerals, e.g. \\"volume 3\\" or \\"volume III\\", commonly abbreviated to \\"Vol.\\". Volumes may be published directly, or they may be created out of bound issues. For instance, a library that subscribes to a periodical and wishes to preserve it typically takes a set of the issues and has them bound into a volume. A publisher may also separately publish a volume out of previously published issues; this is common with graphic novels. A volume may also be composed of entries, as in an encyclopedia, or chapters, as in a monograph. The term is also used as an identifier for a sequence of periodicals. This is generally based on a single calendar year, but not always. For instance, a school magazine might start each new volume at the beginning of the academic year or at the beginning of each term/semester. Likewise, a journal may start new volumes for each anniversary after its original inception. Thus, all issues published in the Nth term or year will be classified under the Nth volume. The original function of labelling issues with a volume at publication time was to provide a standard way for libraries to later bind the issues into a physical volume.

Josef Schnitter (, Yosif Shniter; 6 October 1852–26 April 1914) was a Czech–Bulgarian architect, engineer and geodesist credited with shaping the modern appearance of Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second- largest city. Schnitter was born in the small town of Nový Bydžov in Bohemia, Austrian Empire (today in the Czech Republic). He graduated from the University of Technology's Faculty of Construction in the imperial capital Vienna and then moved to the Russian Empire, where he converted to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Schnitter arrived in Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and assisted the Imperial Russian Army as an engineer, designing the pontoon bridges used in the crossing of the Danube and the fortification equipment employed by the Russians in the Siege of Plevna. Schnitter was injured at Pleven and received a sabre from General Eduard Totleben, who commanded the siege, as a recognition of his contribution to the siege's success. Even before the Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 and Bulgaria was liberated from Ottoman rule, Schnitter was dispatched to Plovdiv by the Russians. He settled in the city, which was the capital of autonomous Eastern Rumelia until the Unification of Bulgaria in 1885, and, after a brief private practice, served as Plovdiv's head architect and municipal chief of engineering from 1878 until his death in 1914. Schnitter was married to a fellow Austrian citizen who was staying in Plovdiv's Old Town en route to Istanbul. According to the story, he met his future wife when the crumbs she threw out of her window landed on Schnitter, who was touring the buildings he had constructed. His best man was Slovene scholar Anton Bezenšek who spent two decades teaching in Plovdiv. The architect acquired Bulgarian citizenship in 1906. Josef Schnitter died of bronchopneumonia in 1914; he got sick while overseeing the repair of the city water conduit. He was interred in the Plovdiv Central Cemetery. Maria Schnitter, head of the Plovdiv University's Faculty of Philosophy and History, is his granddaughter. In 2006, Josef Schnitter was posthumously declared an honorary citizen of Plovdiv and in early 2009, plans were announced to erect a monument to the architect in the city; the monument will be sculptured by Tsvyatko Siromashki. A street in Plovdiv is also named after the architect.  Works  Schnitter designed Plovdiv's entire post-Liberation city plan (1888–1891), including its main street, today's Prince Alexander Street, which he intended to be wide. However, he was persuaded by the City Council to narrow it to . His other projects include: * bell tower of Saint Demetrius' Church * bell tower of Saint Petka's Church * bell tower of the Holy Mother of God Church (1880–1881) * Saint George's Church (1881–1883) * Saints Cyril and Methodius' Church (1882–1884) * the new church in Batak * the current Neo-Renaissance City Art Gallery building (former Main Girls' School, 1879–1881) * the current Museum of Natural History building (former Plovdiv municipality building, 1880) * the house where writer Ivan Vazov lived * Yoakim Gruev's house * Dragan Manchov's house (1887) * Sveshtarovi brothers' house (1888) * Ivan Gerdzhikov's house (1890) * Ivan Andonov's house (1891) * Orozdi Bak commercial house building (1896–1897) * Metropol Hotel * Konstantin Naydenovich's house (1905–1906) * Plovdiv municipality engineering department building  Gallery  File:St. Bogoroditza plovdiv.jpgBell tower of the Holy Mother of God Church File:Plovdiv Art Gallery P5030085.JPGCity Art Gallery building File:Cyril and Methodius Church Plovdiv (1).JPGSaints Cyril and Methodius' Church File:BatakChurch.JPGThe new church in Batak File:Saint George's Church Plovdiv.jpgSaint George's Church in Plovdiv File:Saint Petka's church.jpgSaint Petka's church in Plovdiv  References  Category:1852 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Nový Bydžov Category:Czech architects Category:Bulgarian architects Category:Geodesists Category:Converts to Eastern Orthodoxy Category:Bulgarian people of Czech descent Category:History of Plovdiv Category:Bulgarian engineers Category:TU Wien alumni ","title":"Josef Schnitter"},{"id":"21654380","text":"Anders Dahlgren (December 23, 1925 - March 24, 1986) was a Swedish politician.

According to the legend, Ole Pete had a skull one inch thick. For 5 cents, he would permit coconuts to be cracked on his skull. For 50 cents, he would engage a goat in a headbutt contest. One day, Ole Pete took a nap in a rail-car repair shed, using the track rail as a pillow to rest his head. A switch engine pushed two rail cars into the shed where Ole Pete was resting. The first rail-car in the shed ran over Pete's head causing it to derail. When workers rushed to Ole Pete's aid and dragged him out of the wreckage, to their astonishment not only was Pete unharmed, he was still asleep. When the workers informed Pete what had happened, he allegedly said,\\"Dawg-gone, my haid do feel kinda funny.\\" Other powerful feats attached to Ole Pete include the use of a ship's anchor for a pickaxe and lifting a locomotive back on the rails.

Sekai has been involved in a number of human rights issues, from those of the Australian Aborigines, ending the apartheid system in South Africa, the rights of women and democracy in Zimbabwe. Her father, teacher-writer-magazine editor, Masotsha Mike Hove (1914-2012), was elected in 1953 as a special representative to the First Central African Federation parliament. He had the distinction of being the first African allowed to be designated an \\"employee\\" under the regulations pertaining to the Rhodesian Guild of Journalists in Southern Rhodesia.Jet 15 Jul 1954 Education and career Sekai Holland travelled to Australia as a student, married Australian Jim Holland in 1965, and completed a Bachelor of Arts (Communication) at the University of Technology Sydney in 1979. In 1980 Sekai and her husband Jim Holland returned to Zimbabwe to be part of the post- independence nation-building project. In the 1980s and 1990s, Sekai completed a Master of Science (Agricultural Journalism) at the University of Wisconsin (Madison), and worked in a number of volunteer and paid roles including: * Director: Free Zimbabwe Centre Sydney, Australia 1971 – 1980 * Founding member of Southern Africa Liberation Centre, Sydney Australia 1971 – 1980 * Representative of Zimbabwe African National Union: Australasia, South East Asia and the Far East 1974 – 1976 * Treasurer: Association of Women's Clubs 1980 – 1986 * Zimbabwe Institute of Mass Communications (Harare): Founder Research Coordinator 1981 * National Chairperson: Association of Women's Clubs (AWC) 1986 – 1999 * Lecturer in Media Studies: 1982 – 1987 * Consultant with Martinelli and Associates as Sociologist for Water and Sanitation Project in Matebeleland South: 1987 – 1989 * Media Coordinator: European Union Delegation in Zimbabwe: 1990 – 1991 * Sociologist for German Bank in Swaziland Dam Project for the Government of Swaziland 1992 * Consultant: Association of Women's Clubs (AWC) 1999 – ongoing Political career * Movement for Democratic Change Founding Member: 1999 * Secretary for International Affairs (MDC) 1999 – 2003 * Secretary for Policy and Research (MDC) 2006 – 2011 * Candidate for MDC Mberengwa East Constituency 2000 and 2005 Parliamentary Elections * Elected to Senate for Chizhanje Electorate on the edge of Harare, March 2008 national elections * Appointed Co-Minister in Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation and Integration, March 2009. * * Awarded the Sydney Peace Prize 2012 Human rights campaignsAnti-Apartheid Movement= Sekai was a founder of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Australia in the late 1960s, she helped to establish the Murrawina Child Care Centre in Redfern, and she worked actively with the Aboriginal community on the land rights campaign. =Rights of Women= Sekai helped resuscitate the important but moribund Association of Women's Clubs (AWC – 60 000 members), a grassroots rural women's development organisation established in 1938 by an 18-year-old African woman. With Sekai as its National Chairperson AWC became active in speaking for the rights of women against the increasingly repressive Mugabe government. The leadership was gazetted and banned from AWC by the government. Sekai made a Supreme Court challenge against the government's action and won, making history with the human rights case ‘Sekai Holland and Others vs the Ministry of Labour, Social Welfare and Public Service’. =Democratic change= In 1998–99 Sekai became convinced that development through NGO activity was impossible under the Mugabe government, and with Morgan Tsvangirai, she started the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) as a real alternative to one-party rule.’ ‘Founded in 1999, the MDC was the only substantive challenge to President Mugabe, the once admired revolutionary hero-cum-strongman, who had dominated Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. With elections scheduled for the following year, a brutal campaign of terror was underway to intimidate the increasingly popular MDC from participating in the political process.’ Torture and death threats Sekai suffered constant harassment, arrests and attempts on her life. In the 1970s in Zambia, Sekai spoke out against endemic violence against ZANU recruits in the camps and sexual abuse of female recruits. She was labelled a dissident and sentenced to death. Tipped off that her life was at risk, she escaped back to Australia (where the Melbourne Herald had printed her obituary!) and continued her anti- Apartheid and Zimbabwean independence work. The most serious incident was in 2003 when she was pursued to her home in Harare and then she and her family were shot at repeatedly while trying to enter their house. In March 2007 she was arrested and brutally tortured in a Harare police station with 139 leaders of the MDC. She sustained a broken arm, a broken leg, fractured ribs, and over 80 lacerations to her entire body caused by whipping, beating, and being stamped on by the torturers. Sekai spent 15 weeks in hospitals in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Australia including eight months in Australia, to begin to recover. ‘In the police station, the answer to the group's inquiry was swift. They were beaten and spat on by more than a dozen police officers. Three of Holland's ribs were broken when a policewoman jumped on her. Holland's 80 injuries included a broken arm, a fractured knee, cuts and lacerations, and a leg snapped by blows from an iron bar. But she survived.’ \\"It was very bad for Mugabe to beat up a grandmother,\\" says Peter Murphy of the Sydney-based Zimbabwean Information Centre. \\"It was well reported all across Africa.\\" Not for the first time, Holland thought she might die. The beaten body of a photographer, who took the photo of a bloody and swollen Morgan Tsvangirai that sparked global opprobrium, was found a few days later. Tortured for hours, Holland was jailed, and finally released after two court hearings. To the fury of Mugabe, however, she was escorted by an Australian diplomat to the airport, where she was flown to South Africa for treatment.’ Her Australian husband, Jim Holland, told a reporter: \\"The regime tried to beat her into submission and has totally failed, and she knows that she's won.\\" Prime Minister of Australia at the time, John Howard, called Mugabe a \\"disaster\\" and Zimbabwe \\"a total heap of misery\\". Ministry for National Healing, Reconciliation and Integration ‘Despite initial misgivings about working closely with Mugabe, she has said that it was the right thing to do, \\"a very difficult exercise but necessary because it has pushed our country out of full conflict into transition\\".’ In the Transitional Government set up in February 2009, Sekai works with Ministers from two other parties, as Co-Ministers for National Healing, Reconciliation and Integration. She has driven this agency with innovative strategies that seek to incorporate traditional Zimbabwean positive cultural beliefs and practices into the entire healing process infused with the local, regional and international best practices. The new infrastructure for peace as recommended by the Organ encourages survivors of political violence, victims and perpetrators to acknowledge the history and culture of violence and to address the damage caused by violence with mechanisms to prevent future violence. Since 2009 the Organ has initiated ongoing peace activities of partnerships between and among government ministries, civil society in Zimbabwe, the region and internationally e.g. “Shoes for Peace” which involves collecting thousands of pairs of new shoes from around the world, to be distributed to Zimbabwe's shoeless school kids – from all political backgrounds. Sekai is negotiating with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for Midlands state University to partner with two Australian institutions; NSW Service for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors (STARTTS) to establish a similar mental health wellness institution for survivors of political violence and Exodus Foundation which has appropriate rehabilitation programmes for refugees and internally displaced persons to establish similar grassroots based community centres to receive and train returnee refugees, internally displaced persons and stateless persons for their re integrations into communities. Within the political processes in Zimbabwe today, Sekai continues to advocate policies which are not necessarily popular within the political elites of both major parties. She has continued her consistent advocacy for women's and children's issues and she has continually spoken out against retribution and the culture of cyclic political violence in Zimbabwe. Sydney Peace Prize On 30 April 2012, reception hosted by Australian Embassy in Harare, Sekai Holland was announced to be the 15th recipient of the Sydney Peace Prize, Australia's only international award for peace. Professor Stuart Rees, Chair of the Sydney Peace Foundation said, ‘In addition to her work for the education of rural women and her founding of Australia's anti Apartheid movement fifty years ago, Sekai Holland has been a significant leader of non-violent, democracy campaigns, and is a key figure in her country's national dialogue on how to heal the deep wounds of social conflict.’ The Sydney Peace Prize jury's citation reads: ‘Sekai Holland: for a lifetime of outstanding courage in campaigning for human rights and democracy, for challenging violence in all its forms and for giving such astute and brave leadership for the empowerment of women.’ Sometimes perceived as controversial, previous recipients have included Professor Muhammad Yunus, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mary Robinson (former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and former President of Ireland), Dr Hanan Ashrawi, former Governor General Sir William Deane, Australia's 'Father of Reconciliation' Patrick Dodson, the Indian novelist and human rights campaigner Arundhati Roy and the distinguished American academic and activist, Professor Noam Chomsky. Sekai Holland traveledf to Australia in November to give the City of Sydney Peace Prize Lecture in the Sydney Town Hall on Wednesday 7 November 2012, receiving the 2012 Peace Prize in a gala ceremony the next day.

History  The first Down Hall was a Tudor house, once owned by poet Matthew Prior. Prior was acquainted with landscaper Charles Bridgeman, who he commissioned to landscape the estate's gardens. After Prior's death in 1721 (just one year after buying the property), the house was passed to his friend Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, who undertook further rebuilding. Twenty years later, and with the house still unfinished, Harley died. = Selwin family = Henry John Selwin-Ibbetson in 1900 Upon Harley's death in 1741, the house was purchased by William Selwin, a wealthy silk merchant, for £4500. The estate remained in the Selwin familyThe house passed by marriage to the son of Lady Jane Selwin Ibbetson in 1816, who thereupon changed his name from Charles Ibbetson to Charles Selwin. But he owned Down Hall for only nine years when in 1825 he inherited the Ibbetson family title and removed to the family's Yorkshire seat, leaving his youngest brother John Thomas to inherit the Hall. In subsequent years the family styled itself Ibbetson-Selwin. until 1902, where - on the death of Henry Selwin-Ibbetson, 1st Baron Rookwood (who had commissioned its full rebuilding in the late 1860s) - the Selwin and Ibbetson lineage died out. = World War I = During the First World War, the house was used as a sanatorium for wounded soldiers. The estate was affected by the post-World War I recession, and was subsequently sold at auction. = Modern history = Following its sale, the house was used as a school (Downham School, 1932-c.1967) and an antiques business and conference centre (1967-1986). In 1986, the estate was purchased by the Veladail Group, who have operated the site as a four-star hotel, conference centre and wedding venue since.
