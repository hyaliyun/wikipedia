Life  He was born in Amity, Orange County, New York, on May 29, 1839. After acquiring an education, he moved to Dubuque, Iowa, where he taught school for some years and conducted business. In 1860, he moved to Illinois. He enlisted in Company G, 12th Illinois Infantry and served through the American Civil War, rising through the ranks to become a division commissary, serving with Sherman on the March to the Sea and the Carolina campaigns. After peace was restored, he moved to Davenport, Iowa, married and for several years was engaged in compiling and publishing county and State atlases, in partnership with John Milton Lyter, who became mayor in 1870. In 1875, he completed and published his greatest work, which was an \\"Illustrated Historical Atlas of Iowa.\\" It was accurate and became an official authority for real estate dealers, county and State officers. Although many made him substantial profit, others, including his Minnesota and Indiana atlases, were financial failures. Later Andreas moved to Chicago and organized the ‚ÄúWestern Historical Company,‚Äù and took up historical writing, publishing a three-volume History of Chicago. He died at New Rochelle, New York, on February 10, 1900.

It consists of six episodes, released from 29 July 2011 to 19 June 2016 through the artists' website, YouTube, and Vimeo.. The series combines segments in live action, puppetry, traditional animation, and computer animation. Each episode starts like a typical children's series, consisting of anthropomorphic puppets akin to those featured in Sesame Street and other popular children's TV programmes. The series parodies these programmes by juxtaposing this childlike, colourful environment and its inhabitants against disturbing themes; each episode features a surreal plot twist in the climax, including psychedelic content and imagery involving gore and psychological horror. The six episodes explore and discuss the subjects of creativity, time, love, technology, diet, and dreams. On 7 July 2020, it was announced by creator Becky Sloan that DHMIS will be airing on Channel 4 as a television series in the future. Plot Each episode revolves around Yellow Guy (and his father Roy Gribbleston), Red Guy and Duck Guy meeting one or several anthropomorphic characters, who begin a musical number related to a basic concept of day-to-day life with an upbeat melody similar to that of a nursery rhyme. As each song progresses, it becomes apparent that its moral or message is nonsensical or self-contradicting, and that the \\"teacher\\" character has ulterior or sinister motives. The climax of each episode typically involves a shock element with use of graphic violence, and sometimes other coercive or warped themes. Later in the series, the characters begin questioning the nature of their reality and the bizarre messages of the teachers. Production Sloan and Pelling met while studying Fine Art, and Animation respectively at Kingston University where they started THIS IS IT Collective with some friends. They produced the first episode of Don't Hug Me I'm Scared in their free time with no budget. When they started on the project they imagined making it into a series, but initially dropped the idea after finishing the first episode. After the short film gained popularity, they decided to revisit that idea. Channel 4's Random Acts commissioned the second episode. The show soon attracted mainstream commissioners; however, Sloan and Pelling turned these offers down because they \\"wanted to keep it fairly odd\\" and \\"have the freedom to do exactly what we wanted\\". In May 2013, Sloan and Pelling announced that they would start a Kickstarter fundraising campaign to make four or more additional episodes, one every three months, starting in September 2014. They uploaded low-quality camera footage of the characters being taken hostage and held for ransom. A 12-year-old American boy tried to use hacked credit card information to donate ¬£35,000 to the campaign, but he was caught and those funds were thrown out. Their Kickstarter goal of ¬£96,000 was reached on 19 June 2014, and in total ¬£104,935 was raised. Youtuber Thomas \\"TomSka\\" Ridgewell became an executive producer on the series after donating ¬£5,000 to the Kickstarter. In January 2016, Sloan and Pelling collaborated with Lazy Oaf to release a line of clothing based on the characters and themes of the show. Reception The original short film became a viral hit and the series grew to become a cult phenomenon. The six episodes had amassed 143.4 million views on YouTube in July 2017. Scott Beggs listed the original short film as number 8 on his list of the 11 best short films of 2011. Carolina Mardones listed the first episode as number 7 in her top ten short films of 2011. It was also included in as part of a cinema event in Banksy's Dismaland. In April 2016, the main characters of the series were featured on the cover of the magazine Printed Pages, along with an \\"interview\\" of the three main characters written by the magazine's editor. All six episodes of DHMIS were included in the September 2016 festival XOXO. Drew Grant of the Observer wrote that the series episodes are \\" ~~horrifying nightmarish~~ absolutely beautiful\\" and \\"mind-melting\\". Freelance writer Benjamin Hiorns observed that \\"it's not the subject matter that makes these films so strangely alluring, it's the strikingly imaginative set and character design and the underlying Britishness of it all\\". Joe Blevins of The A.V. Club praised the show's \\"sense-to-nonsense ratio\\" and its production values. Samantha Joy of TenEighty praised the sixth episode of the series, writing that it \\"creates a provocative end to a pretty dark narrative about content creation\\". Themes In a faux interview, Becky and Joe jokingly described the plot as \\"three best friends who go on a journey to find a magic pirate ship and save the day\\". A student writer for Nouse compared the appeal of the first episode to themes in Gothic literature, arguing that they are both \\"tapping into the same cultural fear of a violent subconscious hiding beneath the facade of normality\\". In The Wesleyan Argus, another student writer called the series a \\"fine example of the era of esotericism\\" and noted that, \\"There is a building meta-commentary on the relationships between viewer, perception, creator, participant, and art (and perhaps death) that began with the first episode, but what that commentary is trying to say is not yet entirely clear. However, there is an absolute sense that the series is building toward a culmination.\\" Creators Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling are British graphic designers, artists and animators. Their advertising runs through commercial productions. The duo have worked as part of the THIS IS IT Collective. Their content consists of videos, graphic design art, animation, music, and working with real-life materials to resemble things in the real world as art. They have won multiple awards, including the 2012 SXSW Midnight Shorts Award, and the 2016 ADC Young Guns award. They have also co-written and did puppeteer work for Cartoon Network's The Amazing World of Gumball episode \\"The Puppets\\" (season five, episode 36). Rebecca Sloan (who is credited as a writer alongside Joseph Pelling) and Baker Terry provided voices of Grady, Frank, and Howdy (the three puppets featured in the episode, who trap the main characters Gumball and Darwin in their world). This episode features a song where the puppets sing about never ending fun to Darwin with toned down disturbing content similar to the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared series in theme. A series of shorts based on the episode followed, titled Waiting For Gumball, made by the same team as the original TV episode. Future On 19 June 2017, a year after the release of episode 6, Sloan hinted towards additional work into the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared series. On 13 September 2018, a teaser trailer titled \\"Wakey Wakey...\\" was released on the channel, teasing a new television show made in a collaboration between Blink Industries, Conaco, and Super Deluxe. The 30-second video gained over two million views within 24 hours of its release and peaked at No. 1 on YouTube's Trending list. On 3 December 2018, it was announced that the show's pilot episode would be shown at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, and details of the plot were also released. The pilot episode would run at 23 minutes, and would appear in the \\"Indie Episodic Program 1\\" alongside other short films. On 20 December 2019. series director Joseph Pelling would confirm on his Twitter that it was still being worked on, and other co-creator Becky Sloan would announce the same thing on 24 December 2019, alongside a photo teaser featuring Duck Guy reading a newspaper. On 7 July 2020, it was officially announced the series had been picked up by Channel 4.

Each week during the Australian Football League (AFL) season, Sheahan interviewed a figure in the history of Australian football, discussing their involvement in the game, whether on-field or off- field, as well as their lives and contributions away from the game. History The series premiered on Fox Sports Australia in 2009, before moving to Fox Sports' dedicated AFL channel Fox Footy in 2012. The show regularly aired on Monday nights at 9.30pm until moving to Tuesday nights at 8.30pm in 2016. Guests have included former champion players Kevin Bartlett, Leigh Matthews and Bob Skilton; coaching greats Kevin Sheedy, David Parkin and Malcolm Blight, and media personalities Tony Charlton, Eddie McGuire and Sam Newman. Former chief executive officer of the AFL Andrew Demetriou, former Sydney premiership coach Paul Roos, and Kevin Sheedy have also appeared twice in two separate episodes. In October 2020, it was announced by Fox Footy that Sheahan would be retiring after an 11 year stint at the station, thus concluding Open Mike. In a fitting farewell, the 234th and final episode turned the tables on the long-time presenter, with the longtime presenters of fellow Fox Footy program AFL 360, journalists Gerard Whateley and Mark Robinson taking the hosting reigns and interviewing Sheahan.

It was filmed during five years in Chukotka, and it was released in 2012. Background While studying at the University of Copenhagen in the early years of the new millennium, J√§√§skel√§inen spotted an announcement on the bulletin board of the university. What was wanted were people who could speak the Russian language, to participate in an expedition to Chukotka. Since this place was a remote border region with restricted access, she could not resist the temptation. After the expedition was over, she remained there for some time, just hanging around. Later she wrote her MA thesis on the material she had collected during the expedition. The visual material that had accumulated she put to good use, when she later sought financing for this document. The Bering Strait area made a great impression on J√§√§skel√§inen, ‚Äúone had a feeling that one‚Äôs soul really can be at peace here‚Äù. Filming trips J√§√§skel√§inen went on the first filming trip alone, but during the subsequent three trips she had a cameraman as well as a sound man. During the first trip J√§√§skel√§inen found the persons whom she would film, made a deal with them and made sure that they were interested in participating in this project. The filming trips were rather long, a one-way trip might take two or even three weeks, because connections might not function or weather could delay the travel. Thus it was natural that much time was spent on location. J√§√§skel√§inen was the only one in the group who could speak Russian, so she took care of all the practical matters. For a woman to have that role was something new for the most of the locals. The making of the film took five years. Time and again the project was abandoned, and then resurrected again, ‚ÄúI had a feeling that this would never be completed‚Äù. The contents of the documentary Takigaks ‚Äî Once Were Hunters is a film about two brothers, Kolya and Sasha, who are Siberian Yupiks and live in Novoye Chaplino, at the eastern extremity of the Chukchi Peninsula. During the first two trips, J√§√§skel√§inen had made observation on the aboriginal people of the region: ‚ÄúI was touched by the fact that the local whalers live in an incredibly beautiful area, and yet they don‚Äôt seem to be quite well psychologically. How would the young people build their identity, if they don‚Äôt want to become hunters.‚Äù Of the two brothers, Kolya follows in the footsteps of his ancestors as a whaler. Sasha, however, does not want to be a hunter, instead he works for a Canadian company, until the company goes bankrupt. Life in the region is meagre, and one does not have many choices here. The young women have mostly moved into big cities. The lot of the men is to hunt for sea mammals and to fish.

The market has two locations: one at 290 Mulberry Street in Nolita, Manhattan and another at 218 Bedford Avenue in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.\\"The Market NYC at 3 Locations\\" History The Market NYC was founded in 2002, when a small group of designers and artists, including the Alex Pabon and Nicolas Petrou, were looking for a location in New York City to sell their goods, rather than do so on a consignment basis in boutiques, or on open day at Henri Bendel - where lines of designers waited outside for hours to have a chance to sell. They came up with the idea for a market where young and upcoming designers could sell their creations with the least financial risk, could test the market, and learn the business without having to commit to a long-term lease. The ability to get feedback from their clientele was another important consideration. In 2012, The Market NYC moved from its original Nolita location to a new location at 159 Bleecker Street, next to the rock club The Bitter End. The new location, a historic building dating from 1917, once housed the Circle in the Square Theatre.

Johnson Space Center, known within the agency as Mr. Fix It. He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for creating the solar shield that saved Skylab after the original micrometeoroid shield was lost during launch of the station. His other contributions included the flagstaff and plaques used on the Moon for each of the Apollo program Moon landings and the special six iron golf club head with which Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard made his two famous golf drives on the Moon. Early life and NASA career Kinzler was born in Pittsburgh, the son of a photoengraver and inventor who patented several photoengraving devices. As a young man, Kinzler built model planes and flew them in competitions, turning down a scholarship at Pittsburgh's Duquesne University to pursue his interest in aeronautics. He parlayed his model- building skills into a job with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics building models for wind tunnel testing. When the committee became the core of the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, Kinzler stayed on. He established the Technical Services Division at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which included approximately 180 technicians skilled in the various tasks required by the space program, including machining and sheet metal work, welding, electronics, modeling, plastics, and electroplating, along with a field test branch. Kinzler led the Division from 1961 until his retirement in 1977. Apollo program contributions Unassembled LFAAsked by NASA officials for ideas about how to make a commemorative U.S. flag \\"fly\\" on the airless Moon for the planned Apollo landings, it was Kinzler who invented and oversaw the design and implementation of the system ultimately used. As the Moon had no atmosphere that would allow a flag to fly on a traditional flagstaff, NASA had originally planned only to imprint a flag on the lower section of the Apollo Lunar Module, which would be left behind on the Moon as the astronauts returned to the Apollo Command/Service Module to journey back to Earth. Kinzler suggested the Lunar Flag Assembly (LFA), a telescoping pole with a horizontal crossbar that would fit inside a hemmed pocket at the top of the flag, making it visible, as if extended in a strong wind. (He credited the idea to having seen his mother hang curtains in a similar fashion during his childhood.) Commemorative plaque left on the Moon by the Apollo 11 mission Kinzler also designed the commemorative plaque installed on the Lunar Module for each of the Apollo landing missions. The stainless steel plaque included facsimiles of the signatures of all mission astronauts and of the president of the United States along with a depiction of the Eastern and Western Hemisphere of the Earth. The Apollo 11 plaque included the inscription, \\"Here men from the Planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.\\" Kinzler also helped to fabricate the specially modified six-iron golf club head that Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard attached to the handle of a lunar sampling scoop and used to drive two golf balls on the Moon. Kinzler's technical services division was responsible for a variety of other space program tools and innovations, including the Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit used by Ed White during the Gemini IV mission in the first spacewalk by a U.S. astronaut and the flexible rubber boot between a space capsule and its re- entry heat shield that softened ocean landings. Skylab On May 14, 1973, NASA launched Skylab, the United States' first space station. During the launch, a meteorite shield prematurely deployed, which ripped off the shield and one of the station's solar panels, and the debris prevented another solar panel from fully deploying. Without protection from the solar heat and low on electricity due to the lost and damaged solar panels, the temperature inside the station rose dangerously, threatening to ruin on-board film and food and eventually make the station uninhabitable as overheated plastic components would exude toxic gases. Kinzler sought a solution that did not require a dangerous spacewalk by the Skylab crew. His solution was to develop a parasol- like arrangement that could be deployed through an 8-inch (20 cm) square sally port through the hull of the station at the point of the damage. He built a prototype using four telescoping fiberglass fishing rods and parachute silk. Kinzler's design allowed the device to be pushed through the port from the inside of the station and then deployed by activating springs and telescoping tubes. His model convinced the NASA higher-ups, which ordered the plan put into action. On May 26 the Skylab crew entered the station and deployed the aluminized Inconel parasol, which successfully shielded the station from solar heating, enabling it to maintain a temperature of . Kinzler's greatest source of pride was that the parasol was conceived and executed almost entirely by government employees. \\"We stayed awake and worked for six solid days, around the clock,\\" he said. \\"We had a hundred employees working on this thing, and we did everything. We made all the parts. We demonstrated how it's to be done. And we completely pulled that thing off without any outside help.\\" For his contribution that saved Skylab, Kinzler was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973.

The film starred Alice Lake and is based on a Broadway play, The Hole in the Wall by Fred Jackson. Plot As described in a film magazine, Jean Oliver (Lake) is a young woman who has been wronged by a wealthy lady and seeks her revenge. She becomes a seeress, posing as Madam Mysteria, a medium who has been killed in an accident. Through a band of crooks she determines to avenge herself on Mrs. Ramsey (Lester), who was instrumental in sending Jean to prison. Gordon Grant (Forrest), a reporter, comes to the medium's parlor with a woman who is posing as his aunt. He is attempting to solve the kidnapping of Mrs. Ramsey's young grandchild, and while he is there the police raid the place and arrest the crooks. The leader of the gang escape with the baby, however, and demands the release of the gang before he will give the child up. He also asks that Mrs. Ramsey acknowledge that she lied and that Jean is innocent of any wrongdoing, which she does. The film ends with a happy ending as Jean and Gordon are reunited. The film's title is based upon a scene in which the medium, while in a trance, tells the reporter's lady friend some amazing truths and these truths are graphically presented by having the walls of the parlor crumble and figures crying for recognition appear in the distance.

The village is believed to be the largest village of the Pannu Jatt Sikh clan. Naushehra holds a prominent position in Punjabi state politics with a number of state politicians vying for candidacy in the Naushehra Constituency each year. The village experienced violence during the military conflict between the Indian Government and separatist groups in the 1980s. Demographics As of the 2011 Census, the population of the village was 7,785, with 4,096 males and 3,689 females. The census also reported that the village has 4,943 literate and 2,842 illiterate persons.  History  = Origin = According to a local legend, the Pannu Jatt clan which established Naushehra Pannuan had originally lived near the village of Lachmann Maari in Batala. One morning, a woman belonging to this clan was harassed by a Muslim Chaudhry (hereditary landholder) who she killed with a stick. As a result, the clan had to leave that area and settle in the village of Jaura near Tarn Taran. One of the elders of the village became a disciple of lord Nashriya Shah, who asked the clan to establish a new village, and they founded Naushehra at its current location. The village is named after the lord Nashriya Shah. The ruins of his tomb and the adjoining mosque are in the northeastern section of the village in Desuwal Patti. An alternative legend tells that the village was constructed by Baba Rassal under the spiritual guidance of Baba Mange Shah, the village's other patron. The legend states that Mange Shah blessed Baba Rassal with a 50 paise coin that would double each day. Baba Rassal used this money to construct the town and its mud-brick fortifications including the city walls and gates around the village. In return for his patronage and blessings, Baba Mange Shah asked Baba Rassal not to reveal the source of this money to anyone. However, Baba Rassal was increasingly pressed by his wife and revealed the source of the wealth. As a result, the money stopped doubling and work stopped abruptly. It is believed that this is the reason why the village fortifications appear unfinished. According to this legend, Baba Rassal had six sons, to whom he bequeathed six different pattis or sections of the village. Desuwal Patti is one of these original pattis. = 17th‚Äì18th Century = The 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, regularly communicated with the sangat () at Naushehra Pannuan through a set of Hukamnama (orders given in the form of hymns). Four of these formal orders were issued between 1699 and 1702 and are preserved at the local Baba Dhanna Gurudwara, a major place of Sikh worship. During this period, Baba Dhanna (from Naushehra Pannuan) served as the gardner of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the latter giving his kanga () and dastaar (turban) to Baba Dhanna. Hukamnama from Sri Gobind Singh Ji, to the Sangat at Naushehra: (translated) \\"To Naushehra Pannauan of Amritsar. Come to Diwali with the offerings for the Guru. Give to no one else. Send tola of gold by draft. Contributors will be blessed. Oct 5th, 1699\\" People from Naushehra Pannuan played a major role in the rise of Sikh power during the Sikh Misl period, 1760‚Äì1790. People from Naushehra Pannuan were part of the Karora Singhia Misl headed by Baghel Singh which conquered Delhi in 1783. = 19th Century = The first reference to Naushehra Pannuan in a book can be found in Buta Singh's Geographical description of Punjab written in the 1840s. In the book, he reports that Naushehra had \\"700 homes and 50 shops\\". He also mentioned that the land was owned by Pannu Jatts. The first modern public-development project in Naushehra Pannuan was a local canal extension to the Upper Bari Doab irrigation network implemented by the British Raj in 1859. The villagers helped excavate this canal, and it has irrigated the local farmland since its construction. The 1890 flu pandemic greatly affected Naushehra, killing a large percentage of its population. As a result of large-scale deaths, the villagers decided to abandon the original town centre, which they believed was riddled with rats, and relocated to outer areas of the village. The citizens of Naushehra moved to the new patti of Jagpur. Similarly, the villagers of nearby sub-village of Chaudriwala decided to move from the original town centre to the current location of Chaudriwala. Hospital at Naushehra Pannuan Block Development office at Naushehra Pannuan = 20th Century =  Pre-independence  Development of Naushehra Pannuan continued with the construction of a primary and middle school in 1938. Their ruins can be seen in the north section of the village from National Highway 15. The post office located in the old bazaar was built during the British rule.  Independence and Partition of India  During the Partition of India in 1947, a large number of Naushehra Pannuan Muslim residents left their homes in the bazaar to move to Pakistan. These homes were taken over by the remaining villagers. One prominent Muslim's home was known to be near the village pond. The bricks and earthworks from this home were used to build a bridge that connects Naushehra and Chaudriwaal. Independence brought new institutions such as Panchayti Raj and Block-based administration. As a result of these new institutions, a steady stream of new developments rolled out. First was the previously mentioned bridge in 1956. This was the same year that senior secondary education came to Naushehra in the form of a senior secondary high school. The local Block development office was built in 1961, and was instrumental in rural development around Naushehra Pannuan.  1980s  During the turmoil of the 1980s, as a village located in the rural Majha region, Naushehra Pannuan suffered due to conflict. The village was a battleground between government and militant forces for much of the late 1980s. Several drive-by shootings occurred during this period. One such shooting in 1983 resulted in the deaths of three Hindus. As a result, a number of Hindu families felt a threat to their lives and moved from the village. Some Hindu families were defiant in the face of adversity and resolved to stay in the village. A number of Sikh families chose to leave India to escape the troubles. Gurudwaras, temples and shrines Gangwala Gurudwara Thakurdwara at Naushehra Pannuan Mange Shah Samadh The village features centres of worship for various different religions and belief systems. A major Sikh place of worship is the prominent Baba Dhanna Gurudwara on the National Highway 15. This gurudwara is dedicated to Baba Dhanna who was the gardner of the Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and preserves the latter's letters to the village. The gurudwara was reconstructed in the late 1980s. Other Sikh places of worship include Jaggu ki Patti Gurudwara and Gang wala Gurudwara. Thakurdwara is a major Hindu temple near the village bazaar. The two patron saints/peers of the village have their shrines in the Desuwaal region. Baba Mange shah Samadh received patronage and popularity over the last 30 years and have since been rebuilt and reconstructed. The site is used for a major religious festival in the honor of Baba Mange Shah, who is considered the founder-saint of the village. Education BVN School Sarkari Elementary School The village features many schools at a primary and senior secondary level, which are affiliated with the Punjab School Education Board and the Central Board of Secondary Education. Here is the list of major schools in the village: * Government Senior Secondary School * National Public School, G.T. Road * B.V.N Model School * Government Primary School * Oxford Public School Rivalry and animosity with Sarhali Until late in the 20th century, the villages of Sarhali and Naushehra Pannuan were known for their intense rivalry. Marriages between residents of the villages were taboo. According to a local legend, Baba Rassal chose two suiters from Sarhali for marriage with his daughters. Two of his sons accompanied the brides to Sarhali to deliver them safely on their wedding day. The two brothers were invited on a hunting trip by the grooms, during which a fight broke out and the brothers were murdered by the Sarhali grooms. The daughters of Baba Rassal were given the heads of their brothers to take back to their home village, where Baba Rassal and Naushehra sought retribution. They lured the Sarhali villagers with the pretext of reconciliation through another marital alliance, and when the baraat () arrived the Naushehra villagers murdered them. This was followed by a series of revenge massacres. It is believed that the villagers maintain a watch for approaching mobs from the rival village. It is said that the watchtower of Naushehra Pannuan was near the neighbouring town of Kheda.

They stood out because they took the risk of making a big spectacle in their concerts in order to reach to the level of other international heavy metal bands. In addition, the lyrics they write and the feelings they transmit connect with the people that follow them. As they said in an interview: \\"All our songs, some more and some less, have a meaning\\". Far away from renouncing to their genre, they have always claimed that they were a heavy metal band and they even wrote a song about this genre in their first LP called \\"Dosis de Heavy Metal\\". In 2012, because of their 30th anniversary, they did a Tour around Spain. History Early in 1980, two young men from Madrid, Juan Luis Serrano and Francisco Laguna, (Bass and Guitar), who had been together in other bands such as Red Box or Madrid 20, decided to form Ob√∫s. In 1981 they won the Rock festival of Villa de Madrid and they opened for the veteran and successful band Bar√≥n Rojo. Soon after, they recorded Prep√°rate, produced by record producer and Spanish singer Tino Casal. This first album was very successful and their popularity rose. The song that gives the name to the album reached the number 1 in the 40 Principales radio station, the Spanish Top 40 chart. On November 6, 1981, the band presented the album in a massive concert at the Real Madrid stadium. Their 1982 album, Poderoso como el Trueno (produced as well by Tino Casal), and their following release, El que M√°s (1984), saw a high volume of album sales. This last album was recorded with sound engenieer Mark Dodson (producer of Judas Priest) and includes the popular hits El que m√°s, Autopista, La raya, FM, Alguien and Vivir√©. Ob√∫s fought for the relevance of the Spanish heavy metal, giving big concerts in different festivals such as the concerts of June in 1985 in the Casa de Campo, in the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) annual festival, in front of over 20.000 people. According to the audience and music critics, it was one of the most gratifying moments in the recent history of Spanish music. The official live album, recorded in the pavilion of sports of Madrid the 21st of February 1987 is considered their apex. It was followed by a period with ups and downs until they presented their study album Otra Vez En la Ruta in 1990. This album was considered O.K. and a quality one, for that matter, but it didn't reach the success of previous releases. This prompted the decision to put the band in halt for the time being. During the time they were separated, Fortu joined Saratoga, a band made up by veteran rock musicians from bands such as Bar√≥n Rojo, Muro and Santa. A band with former members of such successful bands was thought to be impossible at the time, however, the collaboration between members gave birth to one of the best bands in the Spanish metal scene. The first album they wrote, Saratoga, (same name as the band) managed to bring a full house to the Sala Agualung, in Madrid, one of the most popular live music venues in the Spanish capital. After recording their second album, Tributo, Fortu decided to leave the band. Meanwhile, Juan Luis and Fernando had started his own rock band, called Venganza, but they didn't gather a lot of success. Paco, in the other hand, was trying to convince his past companions to revive the band. Just a week after Fortu abandoned his band Saratoga, Venganza decided to split and Ob√∫s was revived in 1996. Originally scheduled to take place at a festival in which Panzer (band) and Judas Priest were also to perform, it fell through. However, they decided to go on tour on their own. At the time, the heavy metal scene in Spain was falling out of grace and younger generations grew interested in older bands. Because of this, Ob√∫s found a very receptive audience. Due to the success of the tour, they start thinking of recording a new album. In 2004 During the tour \\"Segundos fuera\\" Juan Luis left the band and Peter Oteo replaced him. They incorporated Nacho GG-R as bassist to the band. In 2008 Fernando experienced heath issues which led him to leave the band, being replaced by Carlos Mirat. In 2009 during a tour around South America, Nacho GG-R left the band and Pepe Bao (bassist of O'funk'illo) substituted him.

PAQ was developed at Purdue University by McCormick, E.J., & Jeanneret, and Mecham in 1972. The PAQ method involves a series of detailed questioning to produce many analysis reports. This method is widely used within industrial and organizational psychology, individual psychological assessment and human resource departments, and can be easily administered by any individual trained in job analysis. Purpose Positional Analysis Questionnare was developed with the hope that it could be used with a minimum of training on the part of the individual analyzing a job. Compared to many other methods in job analysis, PAQ has been found to be effective, inexpensive, and easy to use for human resource and trainees. Its purpose is to define the duties and responsibilities of a position in order to determine the appropriateness of the position classification, essential functions and/or whether or not the position is exempt from overtime. PAQ contains 195 items called \\"job elements\\" and consists of six different divisions: # Information input # Mental processes # Work Output # Relationship with other people # Job context # Job related variables  Advantages and disadvantages Position analysis questionnaire is inexpensive and takes little time to conduct. It is one of the most standardized job analysis methods, it has various levels of reliability, and its position can be compared through computer analysis. PAQ elements apply to a various number of jobs across the board, as diverged with job assignments. Position analysis questionnaires can be used for individuals repairing automobile generators, serving food to patrons in a restaurant, taking samples of blood from patients, or with worker characteristics such as general learning ability, verbal aptitude, numerical aptitude, manual dexterity, stamina, and reaction time. PAQ uses simple wording and less complex questions than more in-depth job analysis methods. Research has shown PAQ to be an easy and effective method for human resource and other departments in the hiring process. In 1975 Ekkehart Frieling criticized PAQ, stating it is not possible to use one method to differentiate and classify equally all conceivable occupations. Other criticisms state that the PAQ was written at the college level while the incumbents had the education of 10th to 12th grade level, and that PAQ was developed for all jobs but has been demonstrated as limited to 195 jobs and six dimensions. Revision The three basic steps to conduct a position analysis questionnaire are: # Human resources and other staff attend a PAQ job analysis training course. PAQ questionnaires are filled out by trained professionals, not job incumbents. # Trained PAQ job analysts then use the position analysis questionnaire to analyze selected jobs. # The PAQ questionnaires are submitted to PAQ for scoring, with the results then used to analyze by human resource or other trained managers. Patrick and Moore have revised the PAQ and developed a couple of changes called Job Structure Profile (JSP). JSP included item content style and new items to increase the discriminatory of the decision making dimension. This method is designed to be used more by job analysts than by job incumbents. Another alternative to the position analysis questionnaire, the Job Element Inventory (JEI), was developed by Cornelius and Hackel in 1978. It is very similar to the traditional PAQ, but is constructed to be easier to read for incumbents, job analysts and applicants.

Anelosimus jabaquara was first described by Herbert W. Levi in 1956. These spiders cooperate to spin and repair the colonial web, capture prey, and care for the brood. Colony size is small, and the sex ratio is biased towards females. Description Adult males are on average smaller than adult females. The mean male cephalothorax length is 1.38 cm, while the mean female cephalothorax length is 1.62 cm. Similar to other Anelosimus species, Anelosimus jabaquara has a minute colulus, three teeth on the anterior margin of the chelicerae and denticles on the posterior. The palpus distinguishes this species from others. The eyes are subequal in size. For males, the carapace and sternum are orange-yellow. The legs are dusky yellow. The abdomen is dusky with dorsal and ventral black bands. For females, the carapace is red, except for black rings around the eyes. The clypeus, chelicerae, and endites are orange, and the sternum and labium are red. The legs are light brown with darker segments on the distal end. The tibiae and femora have dark rings in the middle. The abdomen is dark brown with a dorsal medium band containing black spots. Life cycle Anelosimus jabaquara females have one brood per year, and develop through eight instars (stages). Males begin dying soon after copulation; males are not involved in brood care. Spiderlings go through their first instar while inside the egg sac. The spiderlings leave the egg sac in their second instar, however the protective behavior of the female remains. Females feed their spiderlings through regurgitation. This happens until the spiderlings reach the third instar, when they are then able to capture small prey on their own. During the fourth instar, the juveniles of one brood will mix with other broods, capturing prey together in groups. Females begin dying when their brood reaches the 5th instar. Behavior =Reproduction= Anelosimus jabaquara reproduction begins in December, and the brood develops from April to October through the care of the females. Each female lays at least one egg sac containing around 27 eggs. The female is able to produce a second sac after abandoning the first. If a female's egg sac is experimentally removed, she will try to steal an egg sac from another female. Female size is positively correlated with clutch size. =Daily activity= The spiders remain under leaves during the hottest hours of the day. During this time, they stay in the resting position with their legs retracted under the cephalothorax. In the evening the spiders leave the leafy area above the web sheet, ‚Äúthe retreat,‚Äù in order to renew the silk threads in the web or to position themselves to wait for prey to be captured. During cold and rainy days, the spiders are active throughout the day. Prey capture can happen during the daytime if the prey vibrates enough to attract the spider to leave the retreat to capture the prey. =Female guarding behavior= Eggs sacs are kept in the retreat, guarded by the female. Females guarding their egg sacs move very little and therefore no new silk threads are added to the web during this period. The only times females leave their eggs sacs are to capture prey or copulate. A female that is guarding her egg sac will attack an approaching female by touching the female with its front pair of legs, biting, or pursuing it for a distance. It is hypothesized that the aggressiveness towards other females is used as a means to protect the egg sac or brood from cannibalism. =Feeding behavior= Adult males, females, and juveniles participate in prey capture. Bigger females attack the prey first by biting the thorax and abdomen of the prey. The smaller females join by biting the appendages or releasing silk threads over the prey. After the prey is immobilized by the females, the males will bite the thorax and abdomen of the prey. Juveniles in their fourth instar will aid by biting the appendages of the prey. Females feed on the prey in groups, or if they prey is small, they break the prey into parts and feed individually. Dead females are eaten by the juveniles or other adult females. Colony formation Colony formation usually occurs through the construction of small solitary webs by adult or subadult females, though it may occur through colony budding. Some subadult females found new colonies following solitary dispersal, while others remain in their natal nests. It is argued that emigration is a consequence of a strong selection pressure to maximize food availability before the egg- laying season. Emigrating females are significantly larger and lay larger clutches, while smaller females do not disperse and lay significantly larger eggs. Because emigration requires high-energy expenditure, it is hypothesized that smaller females do not disperse because they are unable to do so successfully. Colony characteristics Colony sizes are small, ranging from 1 to 55 individuals. This suggests that the colonies are the result of one or two females that matured and reproduced. Once the colony is established, females do not leave the web unless it is greatly damaged. The subadult sex ratio is biased towards females with around 1.8 females per male. Anelosimus jabaquara colonies are composed of individuals of the same instar or differing by one molt, except during the overlap of maternal and filial generations. Web structure Web structure is very variable. Webs are usually shaped like a sheet over the branches. The size of the colonial web ranges from 20 cm^2 to 4000 cm^2. The sheet functions as protection from enemies coming from underneath the web. Above the sheet is an area made up of leaves surrounded by loosely spun non-adhesive silk threads, called \\"the retreat\\". The spiders commonly hide underneath these leaves during the day.

It is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, with Jake Berry having been the Member of Parliament since 2010. Like much of Bacup, Broadclough is rapidly becoming a commuter area for cities and towns such as Manchester, Burnley, Accrington, Preston, Blackburn, Rochdale (and further afield). Broadclough is serviced by the mixed maintained Northern Primary School, which sits at the top of the ridge of the clough from which the village gets its name and Broadclough Lodge which is a special school. Children at Northern Primary School may take an 11 Plus exam to be considered for selection to Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School. History The Goidelic Celts occupied the area around Broadclough and wolves were encountered in the hills around the clough as late as the 13th century. Broadclough is said to be the site where a Danish chieftain was killed in a battle between the Danes and Saxons. His grave is said to be at a farm near Stubbylee, which is located around 1 1/2 miles south of Broadclough. =Broadclough Dykes= Photograph looking south at the main stretch of Broadclough Dykes.The village is made more significant because there exists what has been argued to be the most important archaeological site in the East Lancashire area, namely Broadclough Dykes. It has been claimed that in the 10th century, the Anglo-Saxons battled against Gaels and Norsemen at Broadclough, with some arguing this was the setting for the site of, or an encampment of an army before the Battle of Brunanburh. Although the Dykes near Dykes House Farm have been studied, there are other earthworks that have yet to be studied. These include those that run next to the Roman road and Lane Head Farm, Bacup Old Road and Plantation View in neighbouring Weir. In addition there are other properties which aren't associated with the Dykes such as Dikes Barn Farm which suggest there may be other locations in Broadclough that need to be analysed. Others have suggested these are of Roman rather than Saxon origin, whilst others believe it is a cross dyke, perhaps sharing its history with other neolithic features in the area, such as the nearby neolithic settlement at Tooter Hill, from which the dykes are highly visible. The prevailing train of thought places Broadclough Dykes as an ancient structure, however, there is a suggestion that it may actually have an industrial origin as open-cast site for extraction of fireclay, from beneath an exposed coal seam. Whilst the industrial nature of the dyke is a possibility, Thomas Newbigging, in his 1887 book Historical Sketch of the Forest of Rossendale, reported the farmer from Dykes House Farm confirmed the undulating and pitted land closer to the turnpike, and behind what is now Broadclough Mill, is invariably made up of loose soil and is of a filled-up character, containing fragments of stick, bark and other substances that where not normally found in the natural deposits, suggesting the soils dug out of the dyke had been used to construct defences further down the slope. =Broadclough Buildings= Before Bacup rose in significance and before deafforestation, Broadclough historically sat in the Forest of Rossendale's Newchurch township, being a clough within the Bacup Booth. Broadclough Hall at Lower Broadclough was the seat of the Whittaker family, one of the most important families in the Forest of Rossendale, who held the position of Greave of the Forest as a quasi-hereditary title from around 1515. Considered the only \\"ancient hall\\" in Rossendale, Broadclough Hall was originally built around 1596, with a coach house believed to date from circa 1750 featuring a rare recessed/rebated frontage with veranda. The hall had a number of notable visitors including Beatrix Potter and John Wesley. Whilst there is a date- stone of 1666 over the former side door, the present building was built in 1816, being the third hall to be built on the site, although it is likely a building had existed on or near the site previously. Whilst many of Broadclough's buildings were built by the Whittakers of Broadclough Hall, a family by the name of Lord grew to become a significant property owner and there are a number of listed buildings within Broadclough that are associated with them, as well as a number of place names (including Lord's Court and Lord's Barn). Broadclough Farm, Higher Broadclough Barn and Dikes House Farm have date-stones associated with John Lord, with dates of 1697, 1729 and 1737, whilst Broadclough Mill features a date-stone - with the initials of his namesake descendant - which is dated 1835. Furthermore, Broadclough Farm has a stone trough dated 1877 built into a garden wall, although this trough was discovered near the barn and moved to its current location in 1982. After over a hundred years of trading and having lost its licence in 1959, in 1971, Broadclough's pub, the Roebuck (opposite Lord's Court), was demolished as part of the Bacup slum clearance, allowing Burnley Road to be straightened. Whilst The Roebuck is generally considered to be Broadclough's only pub, some argue the Irwell pub sits at the outer edge of the village. Transport Higher Broadclough (at Broadclough Farm and Step Row) was originally the furthest point of the road that is now A671 before it turned 90 degrees and headed up through the farm yard, past the notable Step Row and up the road that is now Bacup Old Road. There is also an old bridge (extant but no longer in use) which probably predates the 18th century and which sits 10 yards south east of Dog Pits Lane bridge, having once served to connect Bacup Old Road to Todmorden Old Road before the turnpike was built. Parliament enacted the Rochdale to Burnley Turnpike Trust in 1755, which extended the main road through the village to Weir, via a huge embankment running between Higher Broadclough to Deerplay Moor, making Burnley much more accessible to road traffic.River Irwell close to Broadclough Hall serving Meadows Mill The turnpike tolls on the road were abolished on 14 August 1880. The section of Burnley Road that runs through Broadclough has become an accident blackspot, where speeding is seen as a problem on the road, with people into Broadclough from Weir often driving like they're still in open countryside according to local residents whilst Councillor Jimmy Eaton said: \\"It's not that long ago that a lady was killed not so far away from where this accident took place, and that wasn't the first. There have been many accidents along that stretch in recent times and I'm very concerned that there will be another fatality if something isn't done.\\" The County Councillor has gone on to spearhead residents' calls for the creation of a bypass with the suggestion of utilising elements of the old highway Bacup Old Road. There have been several attempts to further develop Broadclough; however, to date these have been refused on several grounds, with the main concerns have been the impact on the open countryside and moorlands and of Burnley Road, on which there has been a large number of accidents. The land on the boundary of Weir, adjacent to Broadclough Farm and Northern Primary School, has had several attempts at development including a 61-home plan as well as an 80-bed residential care unit which was refused locally and had an appeal dismissed by the planning inspectorate. In June 2014 the police announced they would be monitoring the A671 between Weir and Bacup (which passes through Broadclough) as it has become an accident blackspot with a high number of accidents which have resulted in serious injury and even deaths. Broadclough is served by the TransDev Rosso Number 8 bus between Burnley and Bacup, with stops near York Street, Northern Primary School, Broadclough Mill and Meadows Mill. Industry Broadclough Mill There was around 50 farms owned by the Whittaker family in the Broadclough area in the 17th century however the industrial history of the area rapidly progressed with Broadclough becoming one of the first areas to industrialised, firstly through water mills off the River Irwell, notably those off Dog Pits Lane, opposite Broadclough Farm/ behind Lord's Court and Higher Broad Clough Mill, which was also known as the Owd Engine/Old Engine. These early mills were quickly replaced by steam powered spinning mills including the early 19th century Broadclough Mill and Meadows Mill. Broadclough Mill's chimney still dominates the areaThe Grade 2 Broadclough Mill was built in 1824 as a successful water powered woollen mill which became steam powered by the 1830s, becoming a cotton spinning mill following enlargement and was later separated out into business units which is how it operates today. Broadclough Mill is the traditional starting point of the Bacup and Stacksteads Carnival parade which takes place each year in June. Meadows Mill at Lower BroadcloughThere was also a colliery in the village known as Broadclough Colliery Coal Mine which was owned by George Hargreaves & Co, was operational by 1894 employing 3 men underground and one above ground however was disused by 1931. Broadclough has one of the most significant gravity mine water discharges in the UK which flows from the Old Meadows mine area of Broadclough, through the Broadclough Minewater Treatment Works to the River Irwell close to Broadclough Mill. Broadclough Residents' Group is currently in the process of developing a plan to plant trees on former industrial or built areas of the hamlet to preserve an understanding of the area's industrial past. In September 2015 it was announced the Broadclough Residents' Group had been awarded almost 500 saplings by the Woodland Trust to plant around the area. Geography The geography of Broadclough is central to the development of the settlement. It is a three-sided valley which is cut through at the northeast end by the River Irwell which runs the length of Broadclough. There is a trig point on the summit of Brex Height above Broadclough which marks the extent of the village's hinterland to the west. The Trig Point pillar built in May 1948 and was last maintained by the OS in October 1979. Brex Height is also the 12th highest summit in the West Pennines at 409 m (1342 ft).

It includes flight tracking information, origins and destinations, flight numbers, aircraft types, positions, altitudes, headings and speeds. It can also show time-lapse replays of previous tracks and historical flight data by airline, aircraft, aircraft type, area or airport. It aggregates data from multiple sources but, outside of the United States, mostly from crowdsourced information gathering by volunteers with ADS-B receivers and satellite-based ADS-B receivers. The service is available via a web page or mobile device apps. The Guardian considers the site to be \\"authoritative\\". History The service was founded by two Swedish aviation enthusiasts in 2006 for Northern and Central Europe. The service was opened in 2009, allowing anyone with a suitable ADS-B receiver to contribute data. From 3 March 2020, ADS-B data collected by satellite was made available to all users. Aircraft located using satellite data are coloured blue on the map, and yellow if located by terrestrial receivers. The service received extensive exposure in 2010 when international media relied on it to describe the flight disruption over the north Atlantic and Europe caused by the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano eruptions. In 2014 it was used by multiple major news outlets following several high-profile crashes. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and in July 2014 after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, and in December when Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 went missing. Flightradar24 reported that its web traffic increased to around 50 times normal and caused some access congestion to users. In November 2015, The Guardian newspaper reported that Metrojet Flight 9268 en route to Saint Petersburg from Sharm el-Sheikh International Airport had broken up in the air based on information available from Flightradar24. Tracking alt=An ADS-B receiver, coloured black with the Flightradar24 logo, at a table. Flightradar24 aggregates data from six sources: # Automatic dependent surveillance ‚Äì broadcast (ADS-B). The principal source is a large number of ground-based ADS-B receivers, which collect data from any aircraft in their local area that are equipped with an ADS-B transponder and feed this data to the internet in real time. The aircraft-based transponders use the GPS and other flight data input to transmit signals containing aircraft registration, position, altitude, velocity and other flight data. As of 2019, about 80% of aircraft in Europe are equipped with ADS-B and 60% in the US. Airbus aircraft are ADS-B equipped but Boeing 707, 717, 727, 737-200, 747-100, 747-200, 747SP do not come equipped and are not generally visible unless retrofitted by their operators. Typical ADS-B receivers include Kinetic Avionic's SBS-1 and AirNav-systems's AirNav and these receivers are run by volunteers, mostly aviation enthusiasts. ADS-B signals can also be received and uploaded by a low-cost Software-defined radio. # Multilateration (MLAT): The second major source is multilateration using Flightradar24 receivers. All aircraft types will be visible in areas covered by MLAT, even without ADS-B, but while 99% of Europe is covered, only parts of the US are. At least four receivers are needed to calculate the position of an aircraft. # Satellite: Satellites equipped with ADS-B receivers collect data from aircraft outside of Flightradar24's terrestrial ADS-B network coverage area and send that data to the Flightradar24 network. # North America Radar Data # FLARM: A simpler version of ADS-B with a shorter range, primarily used by smaller aircraft, in most cases, gliders. The range of a FLARM receiver is between 20 and 100 km. # Federal Aviation Administration: The shortfall in the US is mostly made up from five minute delayed data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) but this may not include aircraft registration and other information. Privacy The site blocks some ADS-B information from display for \\"security and privacy\\" purposes. For instance, the position of the Japanese Air Force One aircraft used by the Japanese emperor and prime minister was visible on the site until August 2014, when the Japanese Ministry of Defense requested that the information be blocked. This has subsequently meant that the aircraft no longer has its flight track posted online or on the site.

Amenities ships included movie theaters and canteens staffed by mercantile crews of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary service. These ships were intended to provide a place where British Pacific Fleet personnel could relax between operations. Background As the Royal Navy prepared for operations in the Pacific Ocean during the final stage of World War II, it was recognized warships would be operating far from base facilities. Mobile naval base facilities were prepared for remote Pacific harbors without shore facilities. Each mobile base would include repair ships and depot ships to provide maintenance and personnel services for flotillas of small ships like destroyers, submarines, minesweepers, and landing craft. Base ships were outfitted with offices to provide administrative and communications services for efficient refueling and resupply of ships using the base, and accommodation ships provided living quarters for base staff and personnel awaiting transfer.

It is located on the Filchner Ice Shelf. History Sobral was founded with the goal of asserting Argentine sovereignty over the area while providing a launch platform for that year's planned land expedition to the South Pole. The establishment of the base required over three months of continuous work done in a then barely-known region under extreme environmental circumstances. More than of equipment were transported by tractors over heavily cracked terrain that slowed and often halted the tracked vehicles and sleds. The settling team went across a total of . A Cessna plane from Belgrano I provided route reconnaissance. Sobral was founded on 2 April; just a day after, operation leader Captain Gustavo Adolfo Gir√≥ Tapper sent a radio message to Buenos Aires urging his superior command to speed up launching of the expedition to the South Pole so it could be carried out in the first days of October; he argued that the recently surveyed route between Belgrano I and the foothills of the polar plateau sector had very rough ice and, given the known instability of the Filchner Ice Shelf, the expeditionaires would find their path full of unknown obstacles. Thus, on 26 October 1965 a group of ten men left Belgrano I and a few days later arrived in Sobral, the last foothold before getting to the Pole, which they finally did on 10 December 1965. It was the first time in history that Earth's southernmost point was reached by land through the Weddell Sea. By 1968 the slow drifting of the Filchner barrier was causing deep, often hidden crevices and structural stresses on the buildings. The base was thus closed on 28 October 1968 after three years of continuous service; it was quickly buried by falling snow. 15 years later, in November 1983, it was located and reopened by a six-men reconnaissance patrol after a 9-day trip traveling from Belgrano II on Ski-Doo bikes, with the mission of establishing a new connection route between both bases. The team performed maintenance, made meteorological measurements, and over 23 days surveyed the Diamond Mountains, a place never visited by humans before. After leaving written records in plastic tubes and having marked the base's placement with flags, they successfully returned to Belgrano II. In 1997 another team reached the place but this time they could not find the buildings, covered under thicker ice. They left fuel tanks for future operations in the region. On 10 October 2000 a six-men research expedition established a scientific camp at Sobral's emplacement and measured local ozone levels with a spectrophotometer. The temporary occupation was conducted by personnel belonging to Belgrano II and a technician from the National Antarctic Directorate; since then, a new expedition is sent every year between September and December, where the lowest annual average concentration of ozone in Antarctica is recorded. In order to reach the remote base this team must travel for distances up to over very rugged ice terrain filled with numerous cracks, which pose an often unpredictable threat. Snowcat heavy vehicles are used to cover half of the route; light vehicles like the Yamaha VK-540 II Ski-Doo are preferred for the rest. The party carries all the necessary equipment for a three-months stay, such as tents, fuel, supplies, survival kits, communication hardware and scientific instruments. Description Sobral is the southernmost Argentine base ever established: it is south of Belgrano I, less than distant from the South Pole, from the Southern Ocean coastline, and from Ushuaia, the nearest port city. Common tasks at the base include maintenance, logistic support for scientific projects, and search and rescue. =Scientific activities= Scientific research carried out at Sobral include meteorology, ionospheric observations and measurements of Earth's magnetic field. Stratospheric ozone data obtained at the base complements the spectrometer network located in Ushuaia, Marambio and Belgrano II. Climate Because of its high latitude and elevation of above sea level, climatic conditions in the area are extreme: air is very dry, winds often exceed , atmospheric pressure is high and temperatures often fall below The maximum registered temperature at Sobral was , and the minimum, on 14 April 1967.

He was appointed Prefect of Police on 21 February 1831, replacing Jean-Jacques Baude. He was criticized for excessive zeal by the opposition, but also was criticized for lack of decisiveness on the Republican riots in April and July 1831. He disagreed with the Minister of the Interior, Casimir Pierre P√©rier, and had to give way to Henri Gisquet on 17 September 1831, when he became a State Councillor. Vivien was elected a deputy on 17 February 1833 for the Saint-Quentin extramural arondissement, and reelected until 1848. He maintained an independent position in the house, and played a leading role in the debates over the laws concerning the organization of department and arrondissement councils in 1833.

Built in 1903 on the site of an older mill, the gristmill demonstrates the continuing viability of wood framing for mill buildings in an era when it had become uncommon. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It has been converted to professional offices. Description and history The former Ashland Gristmill is located near the eastern end of downtown Ashland, where Main Street (New Hampshire Route 132) crosses the Squam River. The mill stands just north of the road, with the dam extending further north across the river. The dam, originally a wooden construction, is a concrete structure long and high, and has a spillway. The mill is a large three-story structure, consisting of a central tower section with flanking two-story wings. The tower section is built using massive timbers for framing, while the wings are built using the more recent balloon framing method. Its basement still houses the turbine and controlling hardware, although these are no longer operational. The mill was built in 1903, after the previous gristmill on the site was destroyed by fire. The central portion originally housed nine large hoppers, while the wings housed storage spaces for maintenance equipment and milled flour. The heavy timber framing was necessitated to help manage vibrations and stresses incurred by the operating machinery of the mill.

A member of the Labor Party, he served in the Legislative Assembly on three occasions ‚Äì from 1901 to 1905, then again from 1906 to 1917, and finally from 1924 until his death. Johnson was elected leader of the Labor Party (and thus leader of the opposition) in October 1905, but three weeks later lost his own seat at the 1905 state election. He had previously been a minister in the government of Henry Daglish (from August 1904 to August 1905), and later returned to the ministry under John Scaddan (from October 1911 to July 1916). Towards the end of his career, Johnson also served just under a year as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, from 1938 to 1939. Early life William Dartnell Johnson was born on 9 October 1870 in Whanganui, New Zealand.J. R. Robertson, 'Johnson, William Dartnell (1870‚Äì1948)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1983, accessed online 18 March 2014 His father was George Groheim Johnson, a plumber, and his mother, Elizabeth Ann McCormish. He went to the Turakina State School in Turakina until the age of thirteen. From the age of thirteen to the age of sixteen, he worked in a post office. He then worked as a carpenter, emigrating to Western Australia in 1894, at the age of twenty-four. A year later, he moved to the Goldfields, settling in Kalgoorlie. There, he founded the Kalgoorlie branch of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, and he served as its first President. He also helped establish the Kalgoorlie, Boulder and District Trades and Labor Council, and served as its secretary for two years. He then served as the first business manager of the Westralian Worker, a newspaper in Kalgoorlie. Politics He became a member of the Labor Party. From 1901 to 1905, he served as the Labor MLA for the Electoral district of Kalgoorlie in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly.Parliamentary Library Western Australia: Kalgoorlie Electorate Profile During his tenure, he spearheaded the Midland Railway Workshops. In 1904, he served as Western Australia's Minister for Works, and later as regional Minister for Mines and Railways.Western Australia Ministers for WorksWestern Australia Ministers of Railways & Transports He then became the leader of the Western Australian Labor Party, but quit his role in October 1905. From 1906 to 1917, he served as MLA for the Electoral district of Guildford in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. In October 1911, he began a term as Minister for Works, and from November 1914 he served as Minister for Lands and Agriculture. In the assembly, his proposal to build a railway line going North from Esperance, Western Australia rejected. In January 1915, he helped pass the Industries Assistance Act to help farmers whose livelihood had been jeopardized by the recent drought. However, he lost his ministerial portfolio as a result of the Nevanas affair. Moreover, he lost his seat in the assembly to Joseph Davies (1866-1954) as a result of his opposition to the conscription of Western Australians in the First World War. From 1924 to 1930, he served again as MLA for the Electoral district of Guildford in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, and from 1930 to 1940 as MLA for the Electoral district of Guildford-Midland. He also served as Speaker of the Assembly from August 1938 to August 1939, and as Chairman of the parliamentary party from 1924 to 1948. He was a 'state socialist' and rejected the proposed secession of Western Australia. He was a freemason. Personal life On 27 November 1901, he married Jessie Elizabeth Stewart, n√©e McCallum, who had been recently widowed. They had a son and three daughters. Death He died on 26 January 1948, and he was buried in the Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth.

The winter of 2013‚Äì14 was one of the most significant for the United States, due in part to the breakdown of the polar vortex in November 2013, which allowed very cold air to travel down into the United States, leading to an extended period of very cold temperatures. The pattern continued mostly uninterrupted throughout the winter and numerous significant winter storms affected the Eastern United States, with the most notable one being a powerful winter storm that dumped ice and snow in the Southeast and Northeast in mid-February. Most of the cold weather abated by the end of March, though a few winter storms did affect the western portions of the U.S. towards the end of the winter. While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used. Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2013 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2014 occurred on March 20. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28. Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability. __TOC__  Seasonal forecasts  On November 21, 2013, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook. Sea surface temperatures had been near average since spring 2012, and forecasters expected these conditions to continue through winter 2013‚Äì14, with neither El Ni√±o nor La Ni√±a conditions expected to affect the season's climate. In the outlook, little rainfall was anticipated in the Southwestern United States, and the development of drought was expected in the Southeastern United States. Below-average levels of precipitation and below-average temperatures were expected in the Alaskan panhandle. Below-average temperatures were also favored in the Northern Plains, while above-average temperatures were favored in New England, the South-Central, Southeastern, and Southwestern United States, and western Alaska. The remainder of the country fell into the outlook's \\"equal chance\\" category, with an equal chance of above-average, below-average, and near-average temperatures and/or precipitation.  Events  = October storm complex = The first winter storm of the season, a significant system, was forecast by the National Weather Service, which issued a Blizzard Warning on October 3 preceding the storm. The storm occurred as an early season blizzard, and, according to the Weather Prediction Center, was an event of a magnitude unseen for the past decade. Many locations in Colorado, Nebraska, Montana, Wyoming, , and received near or over of snow. Some areas in South Dakota received nearly of snow, with receiving . In many locations, there were high winds of over , with some locations reporting winds of nearly hurricane force, being . = Late November storm complex = Around Thanksgiving, there was a winter storm that was responsible for at least 14 deaths in 5 states. The Weather Channel meteorologist Jonathan Erdman described the storm as \\"about as expansive a winter storm as it get,\\" On November 24, 2013, 300 flights were cancelled at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Flagstaff, Arizona recorded 11 inches of snow, and near the Four Corners as much as 4 feet fell. As much as a foot of snow fell in Colorado and Utah, and 13 people had died as of November 25. The serious winter storm that was expected did not materialize. As of November 27, 2013, 475 flights had been cancelled, with 3,600 delays, many in the New York City and Philadelphia areas. Snow turned to rain in Pittsburgh despite an ominous forecast, but 9 inches fell in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, and 4.5 inches in Buffalo. Atlanta had less than an inch of snow, but it was the third November snow since 1930. Morehead City, North Carolina had serious damage, and damage was also reported in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, from an EF2 tornado. = December cold wave = On December 1, 2013, the weakening of the polar vortex led to the beginning of an abnormally cold trend in the Eastern and Central United States. On December 6, the continued deterioration of the polar vortex led to the jet stream pushing southward, bringing record cold temperatures across the Eastern U.S. During the cold wave, which extended from December 6‚Äì10, over 150 daily precipitation records and close to 100 daily snowfall records were broken across the northeastern, southeastern and south central United States. Numerous airline flights were canceled and there were reports of power outages. = Early December winter storm = On December 2, a Pacific storm system entered the Western United States, and it spread heavy rain and snow from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains. As the storm continued to move east, high snow totals fell in its wake. Maximum reported snowfall totals in this area were found to have occurred in Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana, where or greater were reported. High winds were widespread as well, with multiple locations in the mountainous regions of the western US reporting winds of greater than . As reported by the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, the surface low reached its peak strength at approximately 6:00 UTC on December 3 while it was over western Wyoming, where a central pressure of was observed. = Pre-Christmas storm complex = The ice storm over the Central United States on December 21 On December 19, a strong cold front moved southward across much of the Great Plains. By daybreak on December 20, temperatures in many parts of Oklahoma had dropped to mostly between . However, despite the freezing temperatures, the depth of the cold air was rather shallow, with a depth of generally no more than . As a result of the shallow depth of the front, once the front reached parts of the higher terrain in northwestern Arkansas, the front stalled, leaving areas just ahead of the front significantly colder than areas behind it. While temperatures in much of the Plains remained at or below freezing, an upper low was forming over the Southwestern United States. As the low pushed eastward and northeastward across parts of eastern New Mexico and West Texas, it interacted with moisture over the Southern Plains; there was an unusually high amount of moisture across the area for December, and the low drew much of it over the cold air-mass near the surface. With the moisture in place, light rain began to fall in some locations prior to sunset. The rain persisted and spread from southwest to northeast overnight, with moderate rain beginning to fall across much of Southwest, Central, and northeastern Oklahoma and Southeast Kansas. By late morning on December 21, much of the rain had ended in Southwest and Central Oklahoma, where many areas had received over of ice accumulation with some locations receiving over or even, in localized areas, of ice; isolated power outages occurred, and multiple trees and tree limbs were broken and/or pulled down by the weight of the ice. Heavy icing continued along the Interstate 44 corridor and parts of Osage County in Oklahoma; in these areas, there were reports of of ice, and in southeastern Oklahoma and extreme northwestern Arkansas, there were lesser reports of of ice. Additional ice totals occurred in Southeast Kansas, where there were isolated locations which received ice accumulations of as high as . = Early 2014 cold wave and nor'easter = 2014 began on an active note, with a major winter storm affecting much of the United States. Between of snow fell across a wide area spreading from central Missouri across Illinois and Indiana to Lower Michigan. Snowfall totals of near were recorded across northern Indiana, and additional accumulations occurred downwind from the major Great Lakes. This storm was accompanied by some of the coldest temperatures to affect the Central and Eastern United States in 20 years. Upper flow which was meridional all the way up to the Arctic Circle provided a direct path for cold air advection to occur southward to the United States. The average temperature of the contiguous United States was , the coldest day since January 12‚Äì13, 1997 and the 40th- coldest day in the United States since 1900. During the event, wind chills dropped as low as the -60s ¬∞F (-50s ¬∞C) across the Northern High Plains. The event was short-lived, with the portion of the polar vortex that had traveled across the Great Lakes lifting northeastward into Quebec soon after. = Late January blizzard = On January 20, a moisture-starved Alberta clipper zipped through the Upper Midwest, putting down anywhere from . As it moved towards the East Coast, it began to intensify and snowfall began to spread from areas like Washington D.C. to Hartford, Connecticut. A surface low formed and began to track northwards, with winds increasing along the coastline, causing blizzard conditions. It then continued to rapidly intensify before reaching a peak of . Snowfall totals from this storm ranged anywhere from . The storm was also proceeded by more cold temperatures as well. = Late January southern winter storm = Early on January 27, a cold front crossed into the Gulf of Mexico, with temperatures ahead of the front in Texas and Louisiana in the 60s ¬∞F (10s ¬∞C) dropping to below freezing only one day later. As this occurred, a southern stream upper-level trough translated in an eastward direction across northern parts of Mexico. This also coincided with the backing of low-level winds along the western Gulf Coast. Relatively warm and humid air overrode the colder air near the surface, resulting in precipitation falling in Texas, Louisiana, and parts of the Southeastern U.S. as a mixture of rain, freezing rain, and snow. Late in the day, a broad northern stream upper-level trough containing a trough axis was located over the Central and Eastern United States, and the storm began to develop as this trough axis, initially reaching from the Upper Midwest to the northern Rocky Mountains, sharpened and moved in a southeastward direction during the following 24-hour period. This activity coincided with the movement of additional cold air at the surface. Many areas experiencing liquid precipitation falling at the surface saw rain switch over to freezing rain by 12:00 UTC January 28 as temperatures dropped. A mixture of frozen to partly frozen precipitation spread eastward over the following period into the early hours of January 29, impacting much of the Deep South. Widespread ice accumulations in excess of occurred as a result of the event. As the southern stream trough axis weakened while it moved eastward across the western Gulf of Mexico, a northern stream trough amplified as it headed toward the Southeastern U.S. Overrunning wintry precipitation affected the area as a weak surface low traveled along the front and crossed into the Atlantic. = Early-February winter storms = View facing west from 46th Street‚ÄìBliss Street station in Sunnyside on February 3, 2014. The Manhattan skyline, ordinarily visible, is obscured by whiteout conditions. From January 29 to February 3, a storm system affected a large area from the West Coast to the Northeast. The initial storm dropped heavy snow in the western states (mostly in the mountains), before affecting the Plains, Midwest, and the Great Lakes with snow, sleet, and freezing rain on February 1. Accumulations were generally light to moderate, with localized amounts over 6 inches (15 cm). On February 2‚Äì3, a secondary system developed along the frontal boundary leftover by the first system in the Southern Plains, and moved along the Ohio Valley into the Northeast. Snowfall amounts were generally 3-6 inches (8-15 cm), but reached 8 inches (20 cm) in New York City and 9.3 inches (24 cm) in Allentown, Pennsylvania. From February 4 to 7, a much larger and more potent storm emerged from the West and tracked from the Midwest into the Northeast, with heavy wintry precipitation along the way. A large swath of over 6 inches (15 cm) of snow occurred from the Central Plains into the Interior Northeast, with significant freezing rain just to the south. Snow accumulations reached 8.5 inches (22 cm) in Indianapolis, Indiana, 9 inches (23 cm) in Toronto, 9.2 inches (23 cm) in Kansas City, Missouri, 10.7 inches (27 cm) in Columbus, Ohio, and 13.2 inches (33 cm) in Topeka, Kansas. New York City saw 4 inches (10 cm) of snow followed by 0.25\\" (7 mm) of ice. Parts of Interstate 55 through Arkansas was rendered impassable by freezing rain. = Mid-February winter storm = A winter storm on February 13 On February 11, a quick-moving area of low pressure moved across the Southeast, bringing rain and snow to areas like Atlanta, interacting with some of the cold air to the north of it. It then quickly moved offshore by roughly 3 p.m. This part of the storm was only the beginning of a crippling 2-day streak of winter nightmares across the South. Accumulations from this half of the winter storm ranged anywhere from of snow and a glaze of icing across the South. Later on February 11, another area of low pressure formed on the extreme southern edge of the Gulf Coast, near the TX‚ÄìLA border. Drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, it was able to fire up a small area of showers and thunderstorms near the coastline. As it tracked eastward, it began to interact with the cold air above it, producing an area of ice and snow on its backside as it moved to the east. On February 12, the swath of ice exploded in size as the conditions for freezing rain began to come together. Areas from eastern Alabama, including Atlanta in Georgia to the Southeast coast and South Carolina were included in this swath of icy precipitation. Meanwhile, to the south, near the Gulf Coast, heavy showers and thunderstorms were consisted in a streak of rain stretching up to southern parts of Georgia. As the low moved east, it then dissipated as a new area of low pressure developed off the South Carolina coast late on February 12, and that began to strengthen as it tracked to the north, placing the Northeast in the fire zone for the winter storm. Early on February 13, more snow began to develop on the northern side of the storm as the precipitation shield approached the New York metropolitan area in colder air. Heavy bands of snow set up as the system began its transition into a nor'easter, with some of these bands containing snowfall rates of up to per hour. At the same time, warmer air was beginning to funnel into the storm system, and as a result the rain/snow line slowly creeped up the state of New Jersey as the warm air began to further intrude into the winter storm. By 10 a.m, most of the precipitation had moved north of New York City, and began to reach into areas like Boston. Even though the area of low pressure, which had now deepened to late on February 13, was offshore of the East Coast, little to no precipitation was falling as a result of dry air to funnel its way into the storm. Most of the snow totals in these areas ranged anywhere from , as a result. = Late February storm complex = On February 19, an area of low pressure moved out the High Plains into the Midwest. Originally devoid of moisture, it began to track to the north. Drawing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, it began to intensify. This was thrown back into cold air that was situated over parts of the Midwest at the time. As a result, an intense swath of snow developed from northern parts of Nebraska to western Iowa near Omaha early on February 20. As the storm system continued to move northwards, the winds began to pick up, setting the stage for blizzard conditions. Thundersnow was also observed in parts of the affected areas, due to the instability in the atmosphere. Wind gusts of up to and of snow were reported from this system. Another threat from this system was the potential of severe weather. As the winter storm moved to the north, a long squall line of heavy showers and thunderstorms fired up ahead of its cold front. Most of the main threats from this portion of the system was damaging winds and hail, with the isolated chance of a tornado. The squall line rapidly weakened as it progressed towards the East Coast. The massive system continued to produce hefty snowfall and strong winds even after it weakened on February 21; it was slowly retreating into Canada. It finally dissipated on February 22. = Early March winter storm = On February 28, an extratropical cyclone moved near California, intensifying as it did so. Showers and thunderstorms began spreading into California early on March 1 which is the atmospheric river with heavy snowfall in the mountains, torrential rainfall, triggering numerous flash floods, and even spawning two EF0 tornadoes in Arizona and California The storm weakened somewhat as it began to pass through the southwestern United States, but maintained its structure as it began to move towards the central part of the country. At the same time, an Alberta clipper was moving through the Upper Midwest, dropping relatively light to moderate snow through the areas. The energy between the clipper system and the remains of the extratropical cyclone combined to produce energy for a long tracked winter storm. Late on March 2, snow and ice began to develop along a weak area of low pressure near Texas and Oklahoma. Numerous locations reported thunderstorms with sleet and freezing rain due to the intense upper-air dynamics and Arctic air at the surface. A small squall line began to set up ahead of the cold front. Snow and ice began to reach into the Mid-Atlantic near midnight, which eventually started to sag southwards, keeping most of the heaviest snow accumulations to the south of the Northeast. The system then moved off by evening on March 3. Snowfall accumulations ranged from from the winter storm. At least 16 fatalities were reported. = March ice storm = A gulf low moved inland over the peninsula of Florida on March 5, bringing abundant moisture into the Southeast. An area of high pressure settled in over the Northeast, which pushed cold air down into the Southeast. This set the stage for an ice storm in those areas. On March 6, the northern edge of the system moved into the cold air, and ice began to break out in northern parts of the Carolinas. Ice accumulations totaled up to in some of the hardest hit areas, which some did not have power for several days. On the colder side of the ice storm, snow accumulations ranged up to in the higher elevations. The system then turned to the east and moved offshore near the North Carolina‚ÄìSouth Carolina border late on March 7 and accelerated into the northern Atlantic Ocean. = Late March bomb cyclone = The massive nor'easter at its peak intensity Late on March 25, a winter storm emerged off the coast of the Southeastern United States and began to undergo explosive intensification, becoming a meteorological bomb by March 26. Powered by moisture coming from the Gulf of Mexico, the storm quickly became an unusually powerful nor'easter four times the size of , and reached a maximum low pressure of . The system produced powerful sustained winds up to , and wind gusts up to , with unofficial amounts reaching . After making landfall on Nova Scotia, the system weakened to a nor'easter on March 27, before weakening further to a storm on March 28. On March 29, the system deteriorated into a weak winter storm over Greenland, where it would remain for the next few days while slowly dissipating. = Early April storm complex = At the beginning of April, a rare snow event set up in the Midwest, something uncommon in those areas. On April 2, an area of low pressure was over California, and began to move eastward. Following this, it began to turn to the northeast, setting its target on the upper Midwest, which was already above snowfall for the season. Wet snowfall began to fall near Denver allowing to accumulate. The system then began spread snowfall on a northeast axis, and it began to move into parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, at the same time, severe thunderstorms started firing up along the cold front, which also contributed to a tornado outbreak. Meanwhile, the storm continued to crank out snowfall as it began to accelerate somewhat, drawing cold air into parts of the upper Midwest, where it began to produce more snowfall where rates approached 2 inches per hour. The storm complex moved into Canada. Snowfall totals from this late-season winter storm reached as high as (with a sharp snowfall gradient near Minneapolis), however it melted rapidly soon afterwards due to warm temperatures filtering in the days after the storm.

Licences to operate amateur stations are granted to individuals of any age after they demonstrate a knowledge of the appropriate Amateur Operator's Certificate of Proficiency syllabus for their license grade. Operator's licences are divided into different classes, and offer different operating privileges in accordance with the increasing knowledge required per licence class. Over time these classes and their knowledge requirements have changed and there now remain three different classes. Current licence classes The ACMA currently issues the following grades of licence. * The entry-level Foundation Class licence. This licence grants the use of portions of the 80-metre, 40-metre and 15-metre using AM and SSB voice as well as hand keyed morse code. Also permitted are portions of the 10-metre, 2-metre and 70-centimetre band using AM, SSB and FM voice as well as hand keyed morse code. * The intermediate Standard Class licence. This licence class grants access to all the foundation class bands as well as 20 metres, 6 metres, 23 centimetres, 13 centimetres and 6 centimetres. Amateurs with the Standard class licence or higher can use any emission mode provided their transmissions do not exceed a certain bandwidth. * The highest level Advanced Class licence. This licence class grants access to all the standard class bands as well as 2200 metres, 630 metres, 160 metres, 30 metres, 17 metres, 12 metres, 3 centimetres, 1.25 centimetres, 7.5 millimetres, 3.7 millimetres, 2.5 millimetres, 2 millimetres and 1.25 millimetres. Advanced licence holders may use any bandwidth on the 70 centimetre band and higher. Also issued to amateurs are Repeater and Beacon licences. These are issued to qualified radio amateurs that wish to operate an Amateur radio repeater or beacon respectively. Radio Operator testing and licensing In March 2019, the Australian Maritime College of the University of Tasmania was awarded by the Australian Communications and Media Authority a Deed of Agreement to provide Amateur Radio license testing for Australia, and administration of license issue recommendations to ACMA. AMC has established a system of exam invigilators, often associated with Amateur Radio Clubs, who receive license tests from AMC upon application by candidates, conduct the test session, and return the tests to AMC for marking and further administration. While ACMA formally issues licenses, it does so upon advice from ACM that also administers beacon and repeater licenses, and changes of licenses.Amateur Radio, AMC, 2019Changes to amateur radio qualifications, ACMA, 2019-03-07, accessed 2019-05-15 References External links * The Wireless Institute of Australia.

He stood down from his position on 9 October 2018.  Early life and education  Wilson grew up in Rotorua, New Zealand and was educated at the University of Waikato. Career Wilson joined National Mutual, an insurance business based in New Zealand in 1987, and progressed through the management structure. He became chief executive of AXA South East Asia in 2001, chief executive of AXA Hong Kong in 2003 and chief executive of AIA in March 2009. He went on to become chief executive officer (CEO) of Aviva on 1 January 2013. In March 2018, Wilson was appointed as a non-executive director of BlackRock. Wilson was named in the 2016 Debrett's list of Britain's 500 most influential people, a group of individuals who have influenced or made a difference to British society. He was included in that year's list for his role in returning the British insurer to profit and finalising the ¬£5.6bn acquisition of Friends Life, the largest takeover in the insurance sector in nearly 15 years. The merger turned Aviva into one of the UK's largest investors, managing ¬£300bn- plus in assets. In 2016 Wilson was ranked 12th in Bloomberg's evaluation of the world's best value CEOs. Bloomberg looked at the pay-for-performance ratio of 100 CEOs at some of the largest companies around the world to see which companies are getting the best value from their CEO. Wilson was listed in the 2016 Debrett's 500 List as one Britain's most influential people in finance for returning the insurance multinational to profit and overseeing the Friends Life acquisition. = Business experience = Wilson was credited with steering AIA through the financial crisis ‚Äì a period that saw parent company AIG bailed out by the US government. He prepared AIA for its flotation on the stock market in Hong Kong in 2010, increasing the company's value to $36bn at the time of listing. He has continued his turnaround work at Aviva, which had run into difficulty at the point of his arrival. Wilson refocused its life and general insurance businesses and bolstered its balance sheet. Under Wilson's leadership, Moody's upgraded Aviva Plc's senior unsecured debt rating to A2 from A3 and Aviva Plc's commercial paper rating to P-1 from P-2. Having turned around Aviva's performance, he is now looking to transform Aviva into a fintech firm. Opening 'Digital Garages', setting up a new insurance digital business in Hong Kong with Tencent and Hillhouse Capital, the MyAviva digital hub and Aviva's investment in its own digital transformation are all indicators of Wilson's effectiveness in achieving this aim. =Social purpose= On 25 September 2015 Wilson joined 193 world leaders to commit to the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations in New York. In a rare opportunity for a private sector CEO, Wilson addressed a UN General Assembly plenary session on behalf of the global business community, calling for business and governments to work together to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. He was also a leader in setting up the World Benchmarking Alliance, a set of league tables scoring companies against their sector peers on their responses to major sustainability issues. Wilson stated his aim as being to ‚Äúturn the SDGs into a corporate competitive sport‚Äù. He is also a member of the EAT Foundation advisory board, which he joined in June 2017. The Foundation‚Äôs ambition is to reform the global food system so that it is sustainable and supports a growing global population with healthy food from a healthy planet. Wilson has written about various social issues including putting the brakes on fraudulent insurance claims, and ensuring everyone plays their part to keep the flood threat at bay. Wilson is a chairman of the Geneva Association, the international think-tank of the insurance industry. He is a member of the development board of the Royal Foundation for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. He stepped down from his position as CEO of Aviva on 9 October 2018. Awards Wilson received a distinguished alumni award from Waikato University in 2017.

Early investors included James Averdieck, founder of G√º, the investor network Incito Ventures and the South East Seed Fund. Bluebella was the first company to get funds from the London-based female investor club Addidi Business Angels. The business experienced rapid growth ‚Äì doubling turnover every 12 months from 2007 to 2010. History Company founder Emily Bendell studied philosophy, politics and economics at Magdalen College, Oxford, and worked as a journalist on a legal journal for a few years, before founding Bluebella in 2005. Bendell road-tested her idea for six months, doing parties for friends and family members. She told Jazz FM's Elliot Moss: \\"It was just me in my bedroom initially. I'd go out and do the orders, then I‚Äôd do all the packing and, if someone called, I'd answer the phones too.\\" In an interview with the fashion industry trade magazine Drapers, Bendell explained how she overcame sexism to secure investment from well-connected female investors. \\"There is an issue in this country, particularly with female-focused businesses, because the investment community is very male dominated. Before crowd-funding, we had previously been through some angel investor rounds. The business angel community is 95% male and typically invest in businesses they understand and have experience of. After one early round of funding, I was quite disillusioned and just put on an event myself, cold-calling high-net worth women asking them to come along.\\" By 2008, Bluebella had 100 agents operating across the UK. Online retailer Lovehoney invested a six-figure sum in 2010. Other online retailers, including ASOS and Figleaves, began stocking Bluebella's lingerie range. In February 2014, the department store Selfridges announced that it would be stocking Bluebella lingerie. For 2014, sales tripled to ¬£3.7 million, with a profit of ¬£347,000 against a ¬£430,300 loss the previous year, boosted by Tesco selling their Fifty Shades range. The company raised over ¬£1m in a crowd-fund in December 2016 to expand into the US. By summer 2018 they were stocked in Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom department stores and online retailers Revolve and ShopBop. They had media coverage, with actress Maggie Gyllenhaal and singer Nicki Minaj wearing their lingerie in photo shoots. In 2016, Bluebella worked with three GB Olympic athletes on a body confidence campaign, #BeStrongBeBeautiful, to get more schoolgirls into sport and fitness. The company launched the campaign, as statistics showed that more than half of secondary school girls drop out of sport after the age of 13 because of body issues and negative experiences of PE lessons. Windsurfer Bryony Shaw, shooter Amber Hill and Paralympic long-jumper Stefanie Reid did a shoot in Bluebella lingerie and discussed their body confidence issues growing up to try to encourage girls to do more sport and fitness activities. In July 2018, the company formed a swimwear design collaboration with Amber Davies, winner of reality TV series Love Island Series 3 In 2019, they formed a wholesale partnership with Victoria's Secret, with Bluebella's autumn 19 collection being stocked in selected stores and online. For the month of March 2020, the company donated ¬£1 from every purchase to social enterprise Beam.org, to crowdfund job training for homeless women. Recognition and awards Bendell has been invited to receptions at Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street. In 2012, she became one of a dozen ambassadors for the government's newly-formed start-up loans company, which provided mentor-supported loans to young people looking to start their own businesses. The scheme, which also involved Dragon's Den investor James Caan, was promoted by Bendell alongside other young entrepreneurs such as James Eder (The Beans Group) and Romy Lewis (Lola's Kitchen). In 2014, Bendell was included in the Management Today \\"35 under 35\\" list of the UK's most successful young women entrepreneurs. In 2017 and 2018, Bluebella won Drapers \\"Lingerie Brand of the Year\\" award. In 2018, they won Marketing Campaign of the Year at the UK Lingerie Awards 2018 for their \\"Dare To Bare\\" campaign launch for September 2017's London Fashion Week, in which 19 non-professional models did an outdoor catwalk show at Oxford Circus.

It is administered under the Northern Asia-Pacific Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  History  Taipei Adventist American School had its beginnings in 1955 as a small elementary school for overseas missionaries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who mostly came from North America to pioneer the SDA mission work in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. At first, the school was located in the basement of the Taipei City Adventist Church across from Da‚Äôan Park on XinSheng S. Road. Over time this space grew too small to provide the right kind of outdoor space that American parents expected. Sometime in the 1960s the school was moved to the Taiwan Adventist Hospital compound on Bade Road across from where the Taipei arena currently stands. It remained there until 1986. At this time, the school, needing more room for the modest increase in the number of students that were desiring an American Education, again decided it was best to move to a larger location. In 1984, the school board voted to build another new school building out of the city on Yangming Shan. The Adventist Church already owned a few large pieces of land on Yangming Shan where they had built a compound where many of the Taiwan Adventist Hospital Doctors and other missionary families lived. The western style compound had six homes and two large grassy areas for play and gardening. By 1986, a three-level building was constructed with two apartments downstairs and a fenced-in play area on the third floor, with classrooms, a library, offices and bathrooms on the second floor. In 1991, the school was registered with the Taiwan government as a foreign school for international students. This allowed any student with a foreign passport to attend the school. As the population of the school grew from 15 children of missionaries to over 120 students, renovations took place to accommodate the growing size. Over successive remodels during the 1990s and 2000s, the school transformed to three levels of classrooms with grades one to four on the third floor, grades five to seven on the second floor, and eighth grade, administrative offices, work space, storage, and a technology lab on the first floor. In 2010 and 2016, the school converted one of the compound's houses into more classroom and work space by remodeling it for Chinese and ESL classrooms, learning support offices, music rooms, and a multipurpose kitchen work space.  Campus  The current campus consists of: *A main building with eight classrooms with one grade per class room, one ELL pullout classroom, two administrative offices, two auxiliary staff offices, a computer lab, and a science lab. *An English Language Learning (ELL) building with one ELL homeroom class, and one classroom for students to be pulled out from regular classes for extra English help, two Chinese language classrooms, one learning support staff office, and a large music room. *A covered gym area for Physical Education. *One large open grass field with adjacent play ground. *A large grass soccer/sports field. *Five western style faculty homes. *An adjacent property with a large three story 100 year old traditional farmhouse that holds a multi-purpose meeting room, offices, a guest room, a board room and two faculty houses.  Academics  TAAS specializes in holistic individualized American-style instruction in a way not possible in a larger school setting. As part of the Adventist education system TAAS focuses on intellectual, spiritual, physical, and social education. TAAS believes that in a smaller family-type setting with a lower student/teacher ratio that not only is learning benefited, but social development is also enhanced. In fact students consistently score 12 months or 1 grade level ahead of their American peers. Children that are part of the SDA education system become more independent and do better academically because the ‚Äúteachers have higher expectations of students and encourage them to take hard classes. They are more likely to support the notion that ‚ÄòGod doesn‚Äôt make junk‚Äô and that students are often capable of achieving more than they realize.\\" Because of the western-style education students are encouraged to take responsibilities for their own learning apart from the pressures of the teacher or other authorities. Students learn how to act independently and act cooperatively. Christian morals and values are another integral part of the education system. Integrity, honesty, respect for others, and responsibility are cultivated. TAAS offers learning support services for children with mild to significant need. Almost 100 percent of TAAS graduates continue their education at another American-based curriculum institution either in Taiwan or abroad. The vast majority choose to continue at The Primacy Collegiate Academy, Taipei American School, Taipei European School, or another school in the United States. TAAS is accredited by the Adventist Accrediting Association.  Student body  The combined K-8 school enrollment is approximately 120. The student body is made up of 17 different nationalities with the majority being American, Canadian, Korean, Japanese, and Philippine, respectively. TAAS abides by the Republic of China Foreign Schools Law, which requires all international schools to only admit students who hold non-ROC passports.

Built in 1877-78, it is an excellent example of Second Empire architecture, although its architect is unknown. It served as a school until 1990, and now houses community organizations. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The former Ashland Junior High School stands on a rise overlooking Ashland's village center, on the north side of School Street just east of the entrance to the modern Ashland Elementary School. It is a three-story brick building, topped by a mansard roof. Its basic plan is somewhat typical for institutional Second Empire buildings: it is roughly square, with a three-bay facade, a central projecting pavilion, and a tower, in this case a wooden structure with a belfry. Windows are set in segmented- arch openings, which are themselves typically set in slightly recessed panels with brick corbelling at the top. The exterior is little changed from its original construction, although the interior has been subjected to period modernizations. The school was built in 1877-78, in response to school administration complaints about the poor conditions in the extant village schools. It cost to build, running over its $10,000 appropriation. The school was closed in 1990, and the town voted to demolish it in 2000. A community effort rescued the building from that fate, and it has been rehabilitated for use by community organizations.

Built in 1869 and remodeled in 1891, it is a well- preserved example of a rural 19th-century railroad station. It is now a museum operated by the Ashland Historical Society. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Ashland Railroad Station is located south of the commercial center of the village of Ashland, on the south side of Depot Street at its junction with Winter Street. Depot Street, running roughly east‚Äìwest, is crossed by a single-track railroad line on a diagonal from northwest to southeast. The station is located on the northeast side of the track, its long side oriented in parallel to the track. It is a single-story wooden structure, with post- and-beam framing, which is covered by a hipped slate roof. The roof has wide overhangs visually supported by knee braces. The station is basically rectangular, with projecting elements on the long sides near the center. The track side projection houses the station agent's ticket office, while that on the other side houses restrooms. The rail line was built through Ashland, then part of Holderness and known as Holderness Village, in 1849. The first station built by the Boston, Concord, and Montreal Railroad (BC&M;) was used for both passenger and freight traffic. In 1869, the railroad built this station in order to provide passengers a station separate from the freight depot. It was extensively remodeled in 1891 by the BC&M;'s successor, the Concord & Montreal Railroad, giving it its present appearance. The station was sold into private hands in 1960, and given to the Ashland Historical Society in 1980, which now operates it as a local history museum.

Castello Bufalini History Built in medieval period by the Ghibelline Dotti family of Sansepolcro, it was rebuilt in the Renaissance period (circa 1500) by the Marquis Niccol√≤ di Manno Bufalini of Citt√† di Castello, who had become lord of San Giustino. The work was directed by Mariano Savelli and the brothers Giovanni and Camillo Vitelli. After 1530, Giulio Bufalini expanded the fortress using as an architect Nanni Unghero. The square layout of the fortress from the outside is replete with medieval military architecture measures for defence including crenellation and corner bastion towers. Decoration of the interiors was begun in earnest with Giulio Bufalini who commissioned frescoed interiors from Cristofano Gherardi of San Sepolcro (1508-1556), who painted frescoes of antique Roman grotteschi interspersed with quadri riportati depicting mythologic and historic scenes. The topics include the history of Rome, the Myth of Prometheus and Pandora. Starting in the final years of the 17th century, under the guidance of the architect and painter Giovanni Ventura Borghesi, the castle was repurposed into a rural villa, with gardens and a labyrinth designed in 1692. The interiors were also frescoed by Mattia Battini. In 1789, an earthquake toppled a bell-tower and caused major damage to the structure. Short of funds, the marquis owner sold much of his art collection, including works collected by Cardinal Giovanni Ottavio Bufalini, and works in the art gallery of Palazzo Bufalini of Citt√† di Castello. After renovations in the twenty-first century, the castle and gardens are now open to visitors. References *Beni Culturali Italian Website. *Comune di San Giustino entry on Castle.

Interest in these bioengineered cardiac tissues has risen due to their potential use in cardiovascular research and clinical therapies. These tissues provide a unique in vitro model to study cardiac physiology with a species-specific advantage over cultured animal cells in experimental studies. hECTs also have therapeutic potential for in vivo regeneration of heart muscle. hECTs provide a valuable resource to reproduce the normal development of human heart tissue, understand the development of human cardiovascular disease (CVD), and may lead to engineered tissue-based therapies for CVD patients.  Generation of hECTs  hESCs and hiPSCs are the primary cells used to generate hECTs. Human pluripotent stem cells are differentiated into cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) in culture through a milieu containing small-molecule mediators (e.g. cytokines, growth and transcription factors). Transforming hPSC-CMs into hECTs incorporates the use of 3-dimensional (3D) tissue scaffolds to mimic the natural physiological environment of the heart. This 3D scaffold, along with collagen ‚Äì a major component of the cardiac extracellular matrix ‚Äì provides the appropriate conditions to promote cardiomyocyte organization, growth and differentiation.  hECT Characteristics  At the intracellular level, hECTs exhibit several essential structural features of cardiomyocytes, including organized sarcomeres, gap-junctions, and sarcoplasmic reticulum structures; however, the distribution and organization of many of these structures is characteristic of neonatal heart tissue rather than adult human heart muscle. hECTs also express key cardiac genes (Œ±-MHC, SERCA2a and ACTC1) nearing the levels seen in the adult heart. Analogous to the characteristics of ECTs from animal models, hECTs beat spontaneously and reconstitute many fundamental physiological responses of normal heart muscle, such as the Frank-Starling mechanism and sensitivity to calcium. hECTs show dose-dependent responses to certain drugs, such as morphological changes in action potentials due to ion channel blockers and modulation of contractile properties by inotropic and lusitropic agents.  Experimental and Clinical Applications  Even with current technologies, hECT structure and function is more at the level of newborn heart muscle than adult myocardium. Nonetheless, important advances have led to the generation of hECT patches for myocardial repair in animal models and use in in vitro models of drug screening. hECTs can also be used to experimentally model CVD using genetic manipulation and adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. In animal models of myocardial infarction (MI), hECT injection into the hearts of rats and mice reduces infarct size and improves heart function and contractility. As a proof of principle, grafts of engineered heart tissues have been implanted in rats following MI with beneficial effects on left ventricular function. The use of hECTs in generating tissue engineered heart valves is also being explored to improve current heart valve constructs in in vivo animal studies. As tissue engineering technology advances to overcome current limitations, hECTs are a promising avenue for experimental drug discovery, screening and disease modelling and in vivo repair.

He was best known for his publications of applied mathematics. He made significant contributions to analysis, algebra, geometry, integral equations and many other fields that pertain to his interests.  Life and education  Istv√°n Feny≈ë was born on 5 March 1917 in Budapest, Austria-Hungary into a family who were \\"cultured and interested in arts\\". He attended P√°zm√°ny P√©ter Catholic University in Budapest to study mathematics and physics; his advisor was Lip√≥t Fej√©r who was the chair of mathematics \\"for 48 years from 1911 to 1959\\". After his graduation in 1939, which allowed him to teach those subjects at secondary school in Hungary, he continued his studies in chemistry and in 1942 earned the diploma. He then worked on his research publication \\"√úber die 'Polynom-Kerne' der linearen Integralgleichungen\\" in 1943. During his doctorate, he developed his thesis \\"On the theory of mean values\\" (translated) in 1945. = Career = After Feny≈ë's education, he held his position as the lecturer at the Technical University of Budapest. In 1950, he was promoted to Extraordinary Professor of Mathematics. A decade later, he became the full Professor and then the first chair of mathematics and computer sciences. In 1968, he \\"left the Technical University of Budapest\\" and became the visiting professor in Germany \\"for several years\\". He was the first head of department until 1982.  Personality  Based on Paganoni, Feny≈ë became fascinated and interested in sciences, humanities and arts since he was a child: Feny≈ë was a passionate mathematician who readily engaged in conversation and showed a great affinity to work on his publications. He was able to speak in different languages; Paganoni describes his warm personality:  Mathematical Work  Similar to Paul Erd≈ës and Leonardo da Vinci, Feny≈ë was a prolific and brilliant publisher of mathematical work; during the late 1940s, he wrote numerous works; some in collaboration with mathematicians, like J√°nos Acz√©l, while he published others by himself. His two works, \\"Mathematics and the dialectial materialism\\" and \\"Les fondaments des math√©matiques et la philosophie du mat√©rialisme dialectique\\" were \\"delivered at the Tenth International Congress of Philosophy in Amsterdam\\" and \\"printed in the Proceedings\\" in 1949. His two-volume work, \\"Mathematics in electrical engineering\\", was published in 1964, and a decade later a Bulgarian translation of these volumes was published in 1977 and 1979. His interests in other sciences, including history of mathematics, philosophy of science and computer science, grew as he continued to publish his mathematical work. = Moderne mathematische Methoden in der Technik = Amongst his contributions, Feny≈ë was mainly successful for publishing three encyclopedic volumes of his textbook, \\"Moderne mathematische Methoden in der Technik\\" that involve classical analysis, geometry and algebra. The first volume includes set theory, Lebesgue and Stieltjies integrals, calculus and differential equations. Feny≈ë, along with his coauthors, proved Titchmarsh's theorem, which is important to integral theory. Unlike the first and the third volumes, the second contains \\"a mixture of topics\\", like linear algebra, graph theory and network theory, that are used in engineering and technology. The third volume involves integral equations and functional analysis that deal \\"with the theory of operators\\". = Integral equations = One of Feny≈ë's main interests was integral equations. In 1976, he wrote \\"√úber die Wiener-Hopfsche Integralgleichung\\"; it focuses on the nature of the set of L^2 solutions of the Wiener-Hopf integral equation :g(x) - \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} K(x - t)g(t)\\\\,dt = f(x) for the case \\"where f(x) and g(x) are permitted to be tempered distributions\\". \\"Theorie und Praxis der linearen Integralgleichungen\\" was the six-volume work, written by H-W Stolle and Feny≈ë, that made significant contributions to integral equations. The first volume \\"is devoted to the theory of linear operators\\", and the second volume discusses the theory of integral equations \\"of the second kind\\". In the third volume, Feny≈ë explores the applications of integral transforms to mathematical physic and types of integral equations. Based on A E Heins' review of the three final volumes, those volumes focus on classical theory of linear integral equations that helped the \\"development of integral equations\\". = Functional equations = Feny≈ë also made a huge number of contributions to functional equations. One of his works, \\"The solution of a functional equation by Laplace transformation\\", focuses on proving two theorems that the functional equation has an analytic solution. He also discovered the \\"most general solution f\\" of the following functional equation: :f(x + y)(f(x) + f(y) - 1) = f(x)f(y) In 1980's, he proved the theorem, using D.H. Hyers' propositions for solutions of functional equations. Feny≈ë, along with Gian Luigi Forti, also found the solutions to the following inhomogeneous Cauchy functional equation in a Banach space E: :f(x + y) - f(x) - f(y) = d(x,y) where x,y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and d:\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow E is a bounded function. He was also known for discovering types of Jacobian functions that are related to functional equations. In the late 1980s, he collaborated with Paganoni in discovering a rule of rational addition in functional equation. The amazing result of this work is that the nonzero solutions for the functional equation f(\\\\psi(x,y)) = f(x) + f(y) (where \\\\psi(x,y) is the unique rational nonintegers functions) are of the form :\\\\psi(x,y) = \\\\dfrac{xy(\\\\beta \\\\gamma - \\\\alpha) + (x + y)\\\\alpha \\\\beta (1 - \\\\gamma) + \\\\alpha \\\\beta(\\\\alpha \\\\gamma - \\\\beta)}{xy(\\\\gamma - 1) + (x + y)(\\\\beta - \\\\alpha \\\\gamma) + \\\\alpha^2 \\\\gamma - \\\\beta^2} where \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and \\\\gamma (\\\\beta - \\\\alpha) eq 0 with f(x) = c\\\\log\\\\gamma (x - \\\\alpha)/(x - \\\\beta) (with the condition that c eq 0). Another form of the solutions is :\\\\psi(x,y) = \\\\dfrac{(\\\\alpha \\\\lambda + 1)xy - \\\\alpha^2 \\\\gamma (x + y) + \\\\alpha^2(\\\\alpha \\\\lambda - 1)}{\\\\lambda xy - (\\\\alpha \\\\lambda - 1)(x + y) + \\\\alpha(\\\\alpha \\\\lambda - 2)} where \\\\alpha, \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} with f(x) = c(1/(\\\\alpha - x) - \\\\lambda) (c eq 0). = Functional analysis = Feny≈ë also spent his time researching topics in functional analysis; his works include \\"An extension of a theorem of Tikhonov\\" and \\"a representation of the generalized inverse in Hilbert spaces\\". For the rest of his contributions, he worked on inverse of the linear operators in Hilbert spaces. = Differential equations = A few of Feny≈ë works also focus on differential equations. In \\"Uber die kleinsten Nullstellen von Losungen von Differentialgleichungen vierter Ordnung\\", he looks at the existence of zeroes of the solutions of the following fourth-order differential equation: :((ry) + qy)' - py = 0 where p,q,r \\\\in C(a,\\\\infty) and r(x) > 0 for any x. Using the identities found by J√≥zef Maria Hoene-Wro≈Ñski, he found that if this differential \\"equation has a solution with a zero of type 1\\", then it also has zeroes of type 2 and 4. = Hankel transformations and distributions = A few of Feny≈ë's works emphasize the concepts of Hankel transformations and distributions. His work, \\"On the generalized Hankel transformation\\", discusses that the transformation h_n of integral order n, defined by \\\\langle h_n(u),s\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\langle u, th_n(\\\\psi) \\\\rangle where u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}^+ is a distribution and \\\\psi \\\\in H_k, is an algebraic isomorphism between the test function space \\\\mathcal{D}^+ and a proper subspace H_k of the test function space \\\\mathbb{Z}. Feny≈ë also uses Fourier transforms of the functions for his other work \\"On the Hankel-transformation of Schwartz distributions\\", which focuses on four main theorems about Hankel-transformation H_k that are used to establish \\"a new definition of the Hankel transformation of distributions\\". = Mathematical History = Feny≈ë also wrote historical math articles and papers throughout his life. Specifically, he wrote about Lip√≥t Fej√©r and Frigyes Riesz in two of his works, \\"Some aspects of the relations between Italian and Hungarian mathematicians\\" and \\"L. Fej√©r et F. Riesz-100.Geburtstag\\". The first work covers the relationship of those two mathematicians \\"with Italian mathematicians during the inter-War period\\", whereas the second work includes the biographies of Fej√©r and Riesz.

She was born in Saint-Rambert-d'Albon. Her philosophy of dance and her research led to the publication of several books. Piollet joined the Paris Opera Ballet company in 1960. She gained the rank \\"coryph√©e\\" in 1963, \\"sujet\\" in 1964, soloist in 1966, and was promoted to principal dancer (√©toile) in 1969. In 1973, Nouvelle lune c-√†-d (Andy Degroat) was created for her retirement of the Paris Opera. Invited as a guest by Rudolf Nureyev, she danced at the Paris Opera until 1990, the year when Jean Guizerix left (Carte Blanche). At the Paris Opera and worldwide, she performed the classical, neo-classical and contemporary repertory, and from the 1980s, the Baroque and Renaissance ones. She ended her dance career in 2003 with a piece on Isadora Duncan's dances studied with Madeleine Lytton, and performed with Jean Guizerix. Biography Wilfride Piollet attended the Paris Opera Ballet School in 1955 and was integrated into the corps de ballet of the Paris Opera Ballet five years later. By 1969, she was named Danseuse Etoile, and in 1983, she left. She began teaching at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1989. Main teachers were: *Ballet : Lioubov Egorova, Marguerite Guillaumin, Vera Volkova, Yves Brieux, Serge Perrault, Serge Peretti *Jazz : Gene Robinson *Mime : Georges Wague *Piano : Marguerite Long Maurice B√©jart gave her her first soloist role in Noces in 1965. She was promoted to the rank of Principal dancer in Harald Lander's Etudes in 1969. She performed at the Paris Opera and throughout the world the leading roles of the classical repertory (Giselle, Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Coppelia‚Ä¶) with amongst others, Rudolf Nureyev, Cyril Atanassoff, and Fernando Bujones. Interested in contemporary creations of Merce Cunningham, Lucinda Childs, Douglas Dunn, Andy Degroat, F√©lix Blaska, Dominique Bagouet and Daniel Larrieu, she formed a duet on stage and in everyday life with her husband Jean Guizerix . She also danced the neoclassical works of Georges Balanchine (Agon‚Ä¶), Jerome Robbins (En sol‚Ä¶), Serge Lifar (Suite en Blanc‚Ä¶) and Roland Petit (Notre-Dame de Paris‚Ä¶). From 1977 onwards, she choreographed her own pieces such as The Wooden Prince, Eight Hungarian Dances, Fox, Lettera amorosa, Dam'Oisel, Momerie, Figurative Ballet, Penth√©sil√©e, and The Conspiracy. In 1986, she danced in the Baroque creation Atys of Francine Lancelot. Between 1986 and 2003 she ran with Jean Guizerix the Piollet-Guizerix company presenting choreographies like Gondolages, Giselle √©chapp√©e, L'√©l√©phant et les faons, Tierce galante ... From 1989 to 2008, she taught her pioneering training method and Ballet repertory at the Conservatoire national sup√©rieur de musique et de danse de Paris (CNSMDP). She made a books series for children and their teachers called Les gestes de Lilou. In 2008, it was uploaded online and published in 2012 by Clef de Sole. From 1990 onwards, she started to recreate some standards of the ballet repertory (Copp√©lia ... ) and to carry on her choreographic practice in different shapes and forms: Le petit Atelier, Romance, L'Amour m√©decin (2005) for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, and Anonymes (2006), for the National School of Circus Art ( l'Ecole Nationale des Arts du Cirque) at Rosny-sous-bois. After 2009, she worked with the Strasbourg Conservatoire (conservatoire √† rayonnement r√©gional de Strasbourg) (commissioned works, conferences, pedagogy). She married Jean Guizerix.  Research  In 1973, while working with Merce Cunningham for the Un jour ou deux creation at the Paris Opera, she realised after a class that her movements were much easier than after a traditional warm-up. From then on, she stopped working at the barre and started straight in the middle of the studio. This would be the beginning of a whole research process which led her to devise a pioneering technique in movement understanding called Flexible Barres.Interview de Wilfride Piollet par Florence Poudru sur le site Num√©ridanse.tv, 2003 Working on body memory and the use of imaginary, she entirely rethought dancer training, developing a practice out of any specific aesthetic. She was particularly influenced by the notions of AFCMD (analyse fonctionnelle du corps dans le mouvement dans√© - body and dance movement functional analysis), drawn from her collaboration with Odile Rouquet and her encounter with Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen.  Pedagogy  Since 1990, she has collaborated with No√´lle Simonet to write in Laban notation the exercises of her method. At the CNSMDP she is supervising the analysis work of Claire Roucolle (2005), Lini√®le Chane and Kyung-eun Shim (2008) for their final exams in Laban Notation. She takes part in dance related events and gives conferences in France and worldwide, such as Sur la trace des Dames Blanches, commissioned by the Cin√©math√®que fran√ßaise de la Danse(Dance videos center). Several university dissertations were inspired by her conception of dance: ;Bachelors *√âlodie Bergerault, 1999, Universit√© Paris VIII - Wilfride Piollet, une p√©dagogie, un regard d'√©l√®ve *Christophe Duveau, 2004, Facult√© de Lettres Nice Sophia-Antipolis - La m√©thode de Wilfride Piollet (pr√©c√©d√© d'un M√©moire en analyse fonctionnelle du mouvement dans√©, en 1997 - Le r√¥le du toucher dans les appuis sur le corps) ;Masters *Michel de Saint Rapt, 2005, Universit√© Blaise Pascal Clermont-Ferrand - Wilfride Piollet : Quel corps fait-elle danser? ;Thesis *Nad√®ge Tardieu, 2006, Universit√© Blaise Pascal Clermont-Ferrand - Savoirs en construction dans la danse classique de Wilfride Piollet: Anthropologie de la transmission From 1990, she was frequently invited to present her work in several universities, arts institutes and international training centers, especially in Nice, Leuven, Montreal, Tokyo, Osaka, Prague and Damascus. In 2002-2003, she became a member of the network led by the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme and La Rochelle University Society, and supported by the Research Ministry and the DMDTS of the Culture and Communication Ministry called: Le mouvement dans√© : recherches pluridisciplinaires et processus de cr√©ation(Dancing movement: pluridisciplinary research and creative process). She was also a member of the Laboratoire d'Anthropologie des Pratiques Corporelles (Labracor), at the Blaise Pascal University (Clermont 2) in Clermont-Ferrand.  Awards  Piollet received the distinction of Commander, National Order of Merit in 1989; and in 2008, she joined its board.

Energy Payback Time of a Solar Photovoltaic Powered Waste Plastic Recyclebot System. Recycling 2017, 2(2), 10; doi: 10.3390/recycling2020010  History  The history of the RecycleBot was largely derived from the work on the RepRap Wiki under GNU Free Documentation License1.2. The first recyclebot was developed by students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. This design was a proof of concept and was hand-powered, and so had a small ecological footprint, but did not create filament of high enough quality to be useful for 3D printers. The design for the waste plastic extruder (Recyclebot v2.0 and v2.1) developed at Queen's University Canada and Michigan Tech was heavily influenced by the Web4Deb extruder, which extrudes HDPE for use as a growth medium in aquaponics. Web4Deb's blog. This design for the recyclebot was developed, tested and published in the peer-reviewed rapid prototyping literature. This device proved viable for producing 3D printing filament. The Recyclebot v2.2 is being developed by the Michigan Tech in Open Sustainability Technology Research Group. Many makers or DIY enthusiasts have made various versions of RecycleBots. The most notable is the Lyman Filament Extruder. Lyman, a retired engineer, won a design contest to make a low-cost 3D filament fabrication system. As of 2014, there were many types of recyclebots, many of which are at the early stages of commercialization. Futurist speculation Jeremy Rifkin has hypothesized that such recycling with recyclebots and distributed production with 3D printing will lead to a zero marginal cost society.Jeremy Rifkin, Zero Marginal Cost Society, Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.

The species exhibits an extreme degree of cryptobiosis ‚Äì the ability of a life form to enter a non-metabolic state, extending life indefinitely. Description Chorisodontium aciphyllum grows in banks along the Antarctic coast in the Drake Passage region. It has also been found in Argentina, Chile, Antarctica, New Zealand, and South Georgia. As the moss banks grow taller, the layers more than an inch below the surface turn brown from lack of sun exposure and eventually become part of the permafrost. The mounds of moss can grow to be more than tall. Chorisodontium aciphyllum was first described by Joseph Dalton Hooker and William M. Wilson in 1844 as Dicranum aciphyllum in the London Journal of Botany. Viktor Ferdinand Brotherus reclassified the species into its current genus in 1924. Cryptobiosis In 2014, terrestrial ecologist Peter Convey and his colleagues from the British Antarctic Survey and the University of Reading discovered that C. aciphyllum remains viable after being frozen for more than 1500 years. Samples of the moss were harvested from Signy Island in Antarctica using a coring drill and taken to the University of Reading for analysis. The core was cut into sections and exposed to light and temperature levels common to the regions in which the moss grows naturally. After three to eight weeks, depending on sample, new growth was visible. Convey said contamination was not a plausible explanation for the observed growth because only clean saws were used and because C. aciphyllum does not produce spores in the Antarctic region. The deepest (oldest) sample was dated between 1,533 and 1,697 years old using radio-carbon dating techniques. The findings were published in Current Biology. Previously, it was believed that a multi-cellular organism could only survive in a non-metabolic state of \\"suspended animation\\" known as cryptobiosis for a few decades. Cases of bacteria and other single-celled microbes were previously known. No moss had previously been documented to survive more than 20 years frozen, but moss stems frozen under Teardrop Glacier on Ellesmere Island for 400 years had spawned new growth when ground up and placed in petri dishes. Using complex cloning techniques, 31,000-year- old seeds of Silene stenophylla were revived in 2012.

The episode was written by Vincent Angell and directed by Nicole Kassell. Summary Micah and Joe watch a news clip on Lily Gray, put together by Carrie Cooke. Micah tells Joe that he wants to \\"make a splash\\" like Lily did. Joe calls Jana Murphy, Gina's former spouse, to let her know that he needs her help. Carrie asks Ryan out for dinner; he declines but promises to keep her updated on the Joe Carroll case. Max and Weston look through Max's research of possible moles in the FBI. Agent Gina Mendez is one of the suspected few, though Ryan doesn't believe she's guilty despite her usage of her security access to get into deceased FBI agent Debra Parker's e-mail. Micah and Joe start filming a video of Micah making an announcement but are interrupted by Robert and Emma, who are preparing to go on a mission for Micah. Micah tells them they'll be joined by Lance, an ex-killer who has been locked up with other killers for bad behavior. Before they leave, Emma and Joe share a kiss and Robert questions their relationship, though Emma denies there is anything serious going on. Ryan questions Gina after a disguised Max plants a tracker on her while passing her by. She denies any involvement and Ryan walks away. Gina goes to Jana's house, with Mike and Ryan following behind. She lets herself in and asks Jana to speak with her privately, since she has company over. Jana brings Gina into the garage, where Gina questions her involvement with Joe. Jana stabs Gina and takes her gun. She then goes upstairs to gather her money as her friend lets Mike and Ryan in and they find Gina laying in a pool of blood in the garage. They corner Jana, all with their guns raised, and ask her where Joe is. Jana, saying that it doesn't matter, shoots herself in the head. Gina is taken into the ambulance alive and apologizes to Ryan. Micah asks Joe for advice on how to handle Julia's recent discomfort with Micah and his intentions. Joe explains his position, saying his one regret is what happened to Claire. Micah has Julia brought to him and they argue until Julia says she will go along with his decisions. Instead however, she reaches for his gun and attempts to shoot him, though the gun was empty. Joe wraps her neck with a garrote wire and kills her, to which Micah says \\"thank you.\\" Robert, Emma, and Lance enter a book store and walk around separately. A book signing with Carrie begins and Emma waits on line. After asking for her book to be signed out to Joe Carroll, Carrie recognizes her and screams for help. Robert and Lance begin killing the bookstore shoppers and employees at random while Emma hands Carrie a video clip and instructs her to share it with the world, threatening they will come back for her and those she loves if she doesn't. Robert and Emma escape before police enter, but Lance stays behind, ditching his mask and weapons. Later, as police and the FBI are inventorying the crime scene, Ryan notices Lance acting suspicious, eventually pulling a gun on him after he pulls a knife on a female police officer. The officer escapes Lance's grasp and he is shot dead. Joe passes out drinks to Micah, Robert, and Emma as they begin watching Carrie's news report where she plays the clip Emma gave her. Micah realizes the clip they're watching is not the one he recorded, but is of Joe revealing to the world he is alive and nobody should feel safe. Micah begins to foam at the mouth and dies from the drugs Joe put in his drink. Robert has the Korban cult proclaim Joe as their new leader, informing them all that Micah and Julia have joined the afterlife. Back at Ryan's apartment, Carrie shows up when Max and Weston leave after Weston receives a phone call. Carrie and Ryan have dinner and share a kiss before she leaves. After Weston leaves, he gets into the back of a car. The driver brings him to meet up with another driver, where he blindfolds himself until they get to another location. Weston goes inside and meets up with Agent Philips, who brings him into a room. Inside the room, Weston is greeted by Claire Matthews, whom both Ryan and Joe believe to be dead.

A year later, her clerical status was stripped and she considered herself removed from communion with the Church. She later found a spiritual home in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), and in Buddhism. Her return to South Africa was complicated by a loss of citizenship during the apartheid era, and her change of sex classification. Granted a passport with a male sex descriptor in 1991, her requests for a passport with a female sex descriptor were passed around the South African Home Affairs and Health Departments. Gross rejected a suggestion of \\"genital \\"disambiguation\\" surgery\\" as \\"an immoral suggestion\\". Eventually she was granted a passport and a birth certificate with female sex markers, on the basis of a mistaken original classification.

The novel centers on the Lorimer sisters, who decide to open their own photography business after the death of their father leaves them in poverty. The novel examines the opportunities and difficulties of urban life for the \\"New Woman\\" in the late nineteenth century.  Synopsis  The novel opens in April, shortly after the death of the Lorimers' father. The house and most of their belongings are to be sold in the coming week, leaving the four Lorimer sisters ‚Äì Fanny, Gertrude, Lucy, and Phyllis ‚Äì very poor. The young women realize that they must find a way to earn money in order to support themselves. Gertrude, the novel's central character, proposes that they open a studio and put their skills in photography to use. They decide that Gerty, Lucy, and Phyllis will operate the studio while Fanny acts as housekeeper. Lucy departs for a three- month apprenticeship at the successful photography studio of a family friend while Gerty begins to seek a location for their own studio. She leases two floors with an attached studio at 20B Upper Baker Street which they can afford with the modest means left to them. The sisters, with help from their friends the Devonshires, labor through all of June to prepare the studio for its opening. The studio opens at the end of July after Lucy returns from her apprenticeship. The Lorimers receive steady business from friends and acquaintances through the fall, though many customers hold a prejudice and expect to pay less for their services than they would for male photographers. Soon the Lorimers are hired to photograph artists' works. They begin making connections within the artistic community of London. Post-mortem photography grew in popularity in the Victorian era. One evening in October, a housekeeper arrives at the studio and requests their services to photograph the recently deceased Lady Watergate. Though the prospect makes Gertrude uncomfortable, she accepts the job. While Gerty photographs Lady Watergate, the motionless silence of the gloomy Lord Watergate leaves a vivid impression in Gerty's mind. Frank Jermyn, an artist who lives across from the Lorimers, visits the shop to hire the sisters to photograph his work. In need of income, Lucy accepts the job and enters Frank's studio unaccompanied despite the social impropriety of the action. Frank recommends the Lorimers to his artistic acquaintances. Soon the Lorimers' business grows, and Frank becomes a common visitor and good friend to the sisters. The Lorimers are hired to photograph the work of Sidney Darrell, a member of the Royal Academy prominent in London society. When Gerty arrives at his studio, she is uncomfortable and detects a lurking contempt behind his polite indifference. She self-consciously photographs Darrell's work and is relieved when her job is over. In March, Frank invites the sisters to attend a showing of his work. Many members of the artistic community attend the event, including Mr. Darrell and Lord Watergate. Despite her shabby mourning clothes, Phyllis's beauty catches the attention of both men. After the Lorimers leave, Lord Watergate asks Frank if they might make photographs for him to use during his scientific lectures at the Royal Institution. Soon, the sisters receive more work from Lord Watergate as well as Mr. Darrell. Darrell soon invites the sisters to attend a private viewing of his own work, where he asks Phyllis if she will pose as Cressida for him. Gertrude does not like the idea but cannot stop the sessions from beginning. Under Fanny's supervision, Phyllis soon begins to sit regularly for Mr. Darrell. He gives her frequent gifts, and Phyllis enjoys Darrell's attention. One evening in June, Frank Jermyn arrives at the Lorimers' unexpectedly. He tells the sisters that he is to leave for Africa the next day as a special reporter to make newspaper illustrations. Frank proposes to Lucy. They have each been fostering growing feelings for one another and Lucy joyfully accepts. Frank leaves for Africa the next morning. Rumors surrounding Phyllis' modeling spread throughout the summer. Gerty is worried that Phyllis cares too much for Darrell. When Mr. Darrell announces that he must leave for Paris and cannot finish Phyllis' portrait, Phyllis is hurt by his unexpected departure. In September, the girls learn of an ambush of British troops in Africa that leaves nearly all killed. However, Frank Jermyn is among those who are missing. Lucy soon departs to visit Frank's parents at their request in Cornwall in order to grieve together. Gertrude sees Lucy to the station. When she arrives back at the studio, she finds Lord Watergate there to discuss business. However, they find a note which Phyllis has left to say that she is running away to Italy with Mr. Darrell. Gerty and Lord Watergate are alarmed; Lord Watergate informs Gerty that Mr. Darrell is already married. The two rush off to Mr. Darrell's together but fear they will be too late to stop the pair. Gertrude and Watergate have arrived just in time. Gertrude storms into Darrell's studio and convinces Phyllis to return home over the protests of Mr. Darrell. Lord Watergate denounces Darrell as a scoundrel. Phyllis faints, and Gerty and Lord Watergate rush home with her. Phyllis is very unwell after this. She has consumption, and a physician tells Gerty that Phyllis' death within months is certain. Phyllis dies within a few weeks. Lord Watergate pays Gertrude a visit a few weeks later with the news that there is a rumor that Frank has been seen alive. An emergency expedition finds Frank. By March, he has returned to London. Lucy and Frank are to be married immediately. Lucy will carry on the photography business after marriage. Gertrude's own future is uncertain, and she turns away Lord Watergate's advances in a tearful burst of emotion. Weeks later, Frank and Lucy are married and away on honeymoon, and Gerty is left alone in the studio. She painfully reflects on her uncertain future and playing out the part of a \\"strong-minded woman\\" into which she had been cast. She regrets that she turned down a future of love when she sent Lord Watergate away. However, there is suddenly a knock at the door; Lord Watergate has returned in spite of Gerty's rejection. Gerty tells Lord Watergate that she did not reject him because she did not value his love, but because she was afraid of embracing the happiness he offered. The novel's epilogue details the sisters' lives after marriage. Fanny and her husband remain happy together, but wish for children. Lucy and Frank have two children, but Lucy continues photography and specializes in children's portraits. The Watergates also have a child, and Gerty hopes he will inherit Lord Watergate's scientific mind.  Major characters  * The Lorimer sisters :* Gertrude Lorimer: the novel's main character, and the most passionate of the sisters. She is 23 years old at the novel's opening and dreams of being a writer before putting it aside to make a living through photography. Gerty often takes charge of the situation, and is also regarded as the cleverest of the Lorimers. She speaks slightingly of her own plain looks. :*Lucy Lorimer: the most practical and rational of the Lorimer sisters, who is described as \\"fair, slight, upright as a dart.\\" She describes herself as a \\"middling sort of person,\\" and is 20 years old at the novel's opening. :* Phyllis Lorimer: the youngest and most beautiful of the Lorimers. Phyllis is often sickly, but is mischievous and spoiled by everyone around her. She is 17 years old when the novel opens. :* Fanny Lorimer: the oldest and most old-fashioned of the sisters. Fanny is a half-sister to the other Lorimers, and is 30 years old at the novel's beginning. She is concerned with domesticity and femininity, and is described as \\"a superannuated baby\\" and \\"an anachronism\\" with \\"just the sort of qualities men seem to think desirable in a wife and mother.\\" * Frank Jermyn: an artist who makes newspaper engravings for a living. He lives across from the Lorimers' studio and becomes a good friend of the sisters before eventually marrying Lucy. * Sidney Darrell: a prominent London artist who invites the Lorimers to many social events. He asks Phyllis to pose for him as a model, and later they plan to leave for Italy together. * Lord Watergate: a physiologist with connections in artistic circles, and a friend of Mr. Darrell. He first contacts the Lorimers to make post-mortem photographs of his deceased wife. Later he marries Gertrude.  Historical background  = Photography = The work of artists like Clementina Hawarden in the mid- nineteenth century elevated photography to the realm of fine art. By the 1880s, photography was a well-established as a medium used for many purposes, including portraiture, journalism and documentation. The work of artists such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Clementina Hawarden active in the mid-century helped advance the medium to the status of fine art. In the 1880s, there were nearly 300 photography studios in London. Commercial photography was widespread in its applications, and the many types of photographs which the Lorimers are hired to take, including photographic studies for artists, lecture slides, postmortem photography, and portraiture, were all common. = Imperial England = Britain's colonial empire serves as an essential backdrop for The Romance of a Shop; key plot developments center on Britain's imperial connection to faraway colonies. When Aunt Caroline initially tries to convince the girls to marry she considers sending them to India to find husbands, which \\"works wonders in that regard.\\" Fanny initially rejects her suitor Mr. Marsh because he is poor, and leaving for Australia provides the opportunity for him to accumulate wealth over time and return to Britain with the resources to marry. British fighting in the African colonies calls Frank Jermyn away as an illustrator to report on war developments. His departure, possible death, and return is essential in the plot surrounding Lucy's courtship.  Literary background  Levy inserts many autobiographical details in The Romance of a Shop; for example, Gerty's poem which is published in The Woodcut is actually Levy's own poem \\"A Game of Lawn-Tennis\\" which had been printed two years earlier and would be reprinted in Levy's posthumously published Plane-Tree one year later. Additionally, Levy places Lord Watergate's residence at the home where the Levy family lived from 1872 to 1884. Levy targeted a popular audience with Romance and strove for a commercially successful reception rather than significant literary achievement, a purpose which she reserved for her more serious work Reuben Sachs. In an 1888 correspondence to Violet Paget, Levy wrote demeaningly of her aspirations in writing The Romance of a Shop in comparison to Reuben Sachs, stating \\"I have purposely held in my hand.\\"  Genre and style  In Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters, Linda Hunt Beckman calls The Romance of a Shop \\"a model of the realism of its age,\\" citing its narrational style, use of contemporary speech and topical references, such as popular songs and novels, and its clear moral vision. Levy intended The Romance of a Shop to target a popular audience, and utilized literary themes and techniques readers would find familiar from other popular fiction of the time. In her introduction to The Romance of a Shop, Susan David Bernstein identifies the novel as \\"on the cusp of literary modernism,\\" and states that \\"Levy's writing reflects a shifting consciousness, a mode of representation hovering between romance and realism, between idealized versions of remodeled lives for women and men, and the mundane hazards of such social change.\\"  Themes  = The Woman Question = Gertrude, Lucy, and Phyllis Lorimer all portray aspects the \\"New Woman\\" of the late nineteenth century in their urban self-sufficiency, independent thought, and readiness to challenge accepted rules. One contemporary reviewer remarked that Gerty and Lucy both possess \\"the independence which is characteristic of the times.\\" However, Fanny's traditional nature serves as a comical foil to that of the progressive, younger Lorimers. In consequence, Fan is often dismissed as irritating or hapless by Gertrude. = The urban environment = Nearly all of The Romance of a Shop is set in urban London and revolves around specific neighborhoods and London establishments, with references to venues like the Grosvenor Gallery and the Reading Room of the British Museum. The urban environment is a source of both opportunity and danger for the Lorimers and the New Woman. While the city is an ideal place for the Lorimers' studio, they are also subject to the gossip which spreads surrounding their business and personal lives. The city streets offer a stage for the young women to move about freely and independently, especially on the recently introduced omnibuses, but can also facilitate danger for the girls, such as when Phyllis runs away with Mr. Darrell. = Gaze = The Lorimers' photographic lens highlights their ability to turn the gaze of society around them upon their photographic subjects. Levy's \\"women in business\\" are the producers of spectacles rather than the subject of them. As young women working for their livelihood and living independently in late-Victorian London, the sisters are subjected to a social stigma against women who work at all. \\"Through her characters' position as women in business and in their excursions in London, Levy employs discourses about the shopgirl to expose the difficulty women have in escaping the spectacle of their gender even as they articulate a space for themselves in the public spaces of the city.\\" (Evans) The gendered dynamic of gaze is represented in The Romance of a Shop through Levy's references to others' judgmental gaze turned upon the Lorimers, such as Mr. Darrell's critical gaze cast over Gerty as she photographs his artwork, as well as inverted by Levy's emphasis on the Lorimers' \\"intensely modern young eyes\\" and the photographic lens they employ. = Commercial accommodation = The need for artists to adapt their craft to the commercial art market is present throughout The Romance of a Shop. Frank Jermyn originally aspires to be a painter, but switches to work as an engraver for The Illustrated News instead. At the onset of the novel, Gerty is in the process of writing an ambitious verse-drama about Charlotte Corday, but abandons it to pursue commercial photography. Later, when one of her poems is published in a popular magazine alongside one of Frank's engravings, Gerty plaintively muses \\"It is rather a come down after Charlotte Corday, isn't it?\\" to which Frank responds \\"We all have to get off our high horse, Miss Lorimer, if we want to live.\\" As Linda Beckman points out, in targeting a popular audience with The Romance of a Shop, Levy accepts, like Gerty, the commodification of fiction and sets an example to show that a commercially viable work and artistic merit need not be mutually exclusive.  Contemporary reviews  The Romance of a Shop was met with generally positive regard. The Spectator called it \\"decidedly a success\\" and commented that \\"the dialogue is bright and sometimes witty, and the reader's attention, hardened novel reader though he may be, is fully sustained.\\" An October 26, 1888 review in British Weekly called it \\"touched by a true artist's hand\\" with \\"flashes of wit on every page\\" and claimed that \\"a more charming story we have not read for a long time.\\" The Jewish Chronicle, to which Levy was a contributor, praised The Romance of a Shop as a \\"bright and animated novel\\" but voiced concerns regarding Phyllis' \\"tendency to rather vulgar slang.\\" As Levy's first work of fiction, The Romance of a Shop was the first time many reviewers were introduced to Levy as an author. Many expressed their optimism for Levy's growth as a writer in the future. A November 24, 1888 review in The Graphic stated of Levy \\"Her novel gives not only promise for the future [of Levy's career], but much present interest and pleasure.\\" However, others gave Romance itself only tempered praise, such as a November 10, 1888 review in The Academy beginning \\"It appears to us that with a little more experience Miss Amy Levy may write a very good novel,\\" but that \\"some scraps and bits of character drawing here and there [...] carry the reader pleasantly through for the present, and give good promise to the future.\\" In his 1890 obituary for Levy in The Woman's World, Oscar Wilde praised The Romance of a Shop as \\"a bright and clever story, full of sparkling touches.\\"  Notes   Citations   References   Category:British romance novels Category:Novels set in London Category:Fictional photographers Category:1888 British novels Category:Literary realism ","title":"The Romance of a Shop"},{"id":"42232529","text":"Oderisi da Gubbio (Gubbio, circa 1240 - Rome, 1299) was an Italian painter and manuscript illuminator of the 13th century.

There is no means test for the Higher Old Age Allowance given to recipients of age 70 or above. The Normal Old Age Allowance for elderly residents between the ages of 65 and 69 was only offered to people who fell below certain income and asset thresholds, but since 2013 such people are now covered by the similar but separate Old Age Living Allowance scheme instead. Residence requirement OAA recipients were originally required to have been absent from Hong Kong for no more than 56 days in the year prior to the date of their application, and to be present in Hong Kong for 125 days per year thereafter. The latter limit was relaxed to 60 days in 2011, but this still meant that people who had retired in mainland China or abroad and did not often return to Hong Kong were ineligible. A 2012 challenge to these residence requirements before Judge Johnson Lam in the Court of First Instance failed. In his ruling, Lam suggested that the applicant apply for the means-tested Portable Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) instead. In 2013, the Social Welfare Department began accepting applications for OAA from Hong Kong residents who lived in Guangdong. However, receipt of payments continued to require an account at a Hong Kong bank, which proved difficult for some recipients whose banks told them they could not maintain an account without a Hong Kong address. Means testing Recipients of Normal Old Age Allowance of ages between 65 and 69 have long been required to meet a means test; however, attempts to introduce a broader means test as a trade-off for increasing the OAA have proven politically controversial. In 2008, when the OAA was HK$625 per month, Chief Executive Donald Tsang faced calls to raise the allowance to at least HK$1,000 per month, and proposed a means test in response. However, public opinion was strongly against such a means test, with some elderly recipients saying they would prefer the continuation of lower payments instead; they saw the payments as too small to constitute a living allowance in either case, and thought of them simply as a \\"token of appreciation\\" for their decades of contributions to Hong Kong society. Eventually, Tsang was forced to withdraw his proposal for a means test. In July 2012, Chief Executive C. Y. Leung announced the new Old Age Living Allowance, which would provide monthly payments of HK$2,200, roughly double the existing OAA, to applicants who met a means test. By June 2013, three months after the OALA scheme had begun, there were more than 310,000 recipients, mostly former NOAA recipients between the ages of 65 and 69 who had been automatically converted to the new OALA scheme.

ASN-209 ASN-209 is designed for Medium Altitude Medium Endurance (MAME) tactical missions. =Design= ASN-209 Tactical UAV System is composed of Aircraft Platform, Avionics, Airborne Mission Payload, Data Link, Ground Control Station and Launch and Recovery Equipment, ASN-209 UAV can perform aerial reconnaissance, battle field survey, target location, destroy validation and artillery fire adjustment in day and night in real time. ASN-209 uses digital flight control and navigation system, its flight control mode has manual, program and emergency control. In addition, ASN-209 uses rocket booster launch, parachute recovery which render the operating system of ASN-209 flexible due to the fact that no contact with an airport is needed, and the GCS allows multitasking and can be edited in real-time. In civil application, it can be fitted with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), electro-optical payload, and multi-function payload, etc. that can be applied for forest fire prevention, anti-drug action, communication, nature disaster forecast, ground observation, atmosphere measuring, aviation photo, resource detection, climate observation and artificial raining, etc. In military operation, it can be with multiple operational configurations for Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Electronic Warfare (EW), Ground Target Designation (GTD) and Communication Relay. ASN-209 uses twin-boom pusher layout, rear installed engine disposition with high-set wings and a stabilizer linking the twin fins. Excellent overall aerodynamic design and EMC design enable the system to install many different kinds of airborne equipment, such as Electronic countermeasures (ECM), communication relay and weather detection. With a coverage radius is 200 km and endurance of 10 hours, ASN-209 UAV System can supervise big area and frontier within one sortie. In order to overcome with refueling issue, using two UAVs and switching them out when one reaches its 10-hour limit so that they can be used for 24 hours consecutively. The practicality of the ASN-209 system reduces the needs for maintenance or parts from China, as ASN-209 can be deployed using a modified truck and is controlled using electronics equipment installed in a cargo van, which in turn overcomes the disadvantage of comparable US UAVs that depend on US parts and maintenance. =Development= The ASN-209 was developed in 2011 by ASN Technology Group, which is a Chinese company specialized in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Egypt and China had signed an agreement to build twelve ASN-209 UAVs including technology transfer in order to enhance Egypt's domestic drone industry. In addition, China uses fewer proprietary technologies in their designs in order to reduces licensing and manufacturing costs as the ASN-209 system costs 30 percent less than comparable US design while providing many of the same performance and most of the same tasks. In May 2012 six Egyptian drones of ASN-209 was built in collaboration with a foreign defence manufacturer during the first phase and are fully operational under the Egyptian armed forces according to Hamdy Weheba, the Chairman of the Arab Organization for Industrialization which he claimed that Egypt has started the production of the ASN-209 Multi-purpose UAV System and about 99.5% of the components are locally manufactured. He also claimed that with the latest manufacturing venture, Egypt is entering into the second phase of mass ASN-209 production. =Operators= ASN-209 operators ; * People's Liberation Army ; * Egyptian armed forces =Specifications= Silver Eagle Silver Eagle (Yin- Ying or Yinying, Èì∂Èπ∞) is a derivative of ASN-209 deployed by Chinese military. The most obvious visual difference between Silver Eagle and its predecessor ASN-209 is the addition of four vertically installed antenna, two of which are arranged in sequential order atop the fuselage, and one each on the wing, near the wingtip. Estimated range is around 150 km and the estimated endurance is several hours. Maiden flight of Silver Eagle took place in the coastal region of northeastern China on June 1, 2011 and lasted three and half hours. The UAV has since entered service with Chinese navy. Silver Eagle is launched from a 6 x 6 truck, which is both the launching platform and transportation vehicle, and the UAV utilizes rocket assisted take-off. Presumably, there would be at least another vehicle housing the ground control station. Very little information has been publicized by the official Chinese government sources, which only reveal (as of 2014) that Silver Eagle is a shore-based naval UAV. There are postulates that Silver Eagle can either act as a communication relay or electronic intelligence gathering platform, or as an aerial jamming platform, but such claims have yet to be confirmed.

Six years later they moved to Pomona where Burton Frasher expanded his studio by publishing postcards. Frasher went to great lengths to find images for his real photo postcards. He traveled extensively through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada, ranging up through Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, and down through Baja, California and Sonora, Mexico taking pictures during a time these locations were all still largely unaccessable by roads. The photographers most famously associated with the American West are Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. Whereas Weston and Adams treated the landscape as a canvas for formal artistic exploration, Frasher sought to capture the scenic wonders. He included the distant vista, the trail of footsteps, and the occasional human being, all devices to keep monumentality in scale.

The X99 chipset supports both Intel Core i7 Extreme and Intel Xeon E5-16xx v3 and E5-26xx v3 processors, which belong to the Haswell-E and Haswell-EP variants of the Haswell microarchitecture, respectively. All supported processors use the LGA 2011-v3 socket. The X99 chipset was released in late August 2014, while the supported processors were released in late August 2014 (Haswell-E) and early September 2014 (Haswell-EP). In May 2016, X99's processor support was extended to the Broadwell variants of the Intel Core i7 Extreme and Intel Xeon E5-16xx v4 and E5-26xx v4 processors, which belong to the Broadwell-E and Broadwell-EP variants of the Broadwell microarchitecture, respectively.  Features  High-level diagram of the Intel X99 high-end desktop (enthusiast) platform The X99 chipset uses a Direct Media Interface (DMI) 2.0 √ó4 link for the connection between the processor and itself; that way, a total bandwidth of 20 Gbit/s is available to all connectivity options provided by the chipset. Up to eight PCI Express 2.0 lanes are provided by the X99 chipset, with speeds of up to 5 Gbit/s per lane and a possibility to configure these lanes into √ó1, √ó2 and √ó4 links. Additionally, the X99 chipset supports a configurable layout of the PCI Express 3.0 lanes provided by the processor, which may be bifurcated into up to two √ó16 links and one √ó8 link, or into up to five √ó8 links (the total number of available PCI Express 3.0 lanes depends on the used processor). Two Serial ATA (SATA) 3.0 controllers are integrated into the X99 chipset, providing a total of up to ten ports for storage devices and supporting speeds of up to 6 Gbit/s per port, with hardware support for the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) logical interface. Each SATA port may be enabled or disabled as needed. Six SATA ports provided by the first controller may be configured for Rapid Storage Technology (RST) 13.1, which supports RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10 levels; additionally, Smart Response Technology (SRT) disk caching allows the creation of hybrid volumes. SATA Express and M.2 are also supported, providing the ability for interfacing with PCI Express-based storage devices. Each of the X99's SATA Express ports requires two PCI Express 2.0 lanes provided by the chipset, while the M.2 slots can use either two 2.0 lanes from the chipset itself, or up to four 3.0 lanes taken directly from the processor. As a result, the X99 provides bandwidths of up to 3.94 GB/s for connected PCI Express storage devices. One Extensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) controller and two Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) controllers are integrated into the X99 chipset, providing a total of up to 14 USB ports. Out of those ports, up to six can be configured as USB 3.0 ports with speeds of up to 5 Gbit/s per port, while the remaining are USB 2.0 ports with speeds of up to 480 Mbit/s per port. Each USB port may also be enabled or disabled as needed. Integrated Intel High Definition Audio (HD Audio) supports up to four hardware audio codecs and multi-channel audio streams. An Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller is also integrated, supporting (among other features) receive-side scaling (RSS) with two hardware receive queues. Some of the connectivity options and interfaces provided by the X99 chipset are configurable via Flexible I/O, which allows certain hardware capacities of the chipset to be selectively distributed between the PCI Express, USB 3.0 and SATA interfaces. That way, connectivity options of the X99 chipset may be adjusted to fit the needs of a particular motherboard implementation; for example, some of the SATA or USB 3.0 ports may be exchanged for additional PCI Express 2.0 lanes. The X99 chipset supports Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (Intel VT-d), which provides hardware support for virtualization by implementing an input/output memory management unit (IOMMU). The chipset also integrates a Low Pin Count (LPC) interface, supporting interrupt controllers, timers, power management, super I/O, real-time clock (RTC), etc. Integrated Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) allows interfacing with devices such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and serial flash devices. System Management Bus (SMBus) is also provided, with additional support for I2C devices. Overclocking is available for unlocked variants of the supported processors. As a significant new feature, the X99 enthusiast platform as a whole was the first to support DDR4 memory. Thanks to the features of integrated memory controllers (IMCs) of supported processors, the X99 platform also supports dual- and quad-channel memory layouts, with optional support for registered ECC memory.

Bryce Edwards said in The New Zealand Herald that Shaw represented \\"the more environmentally-focused, non-left side of the [Green] party ‚Äì what might be called the New Greens faction ‚Äì people who are more at home in the business world wearing corporate attire than amongst the far left. ... There will be many that see Shaw as a future co- leader of the party.\\" =First term in Parliament: 2014‚Äìpresent= Shaw was elected to Parliament in the 2014 general election on the Green Party list. When Russel Norman announced his retirement from the co-leadership position, Shaw was one of the four candidates who ran to replace him. During the campaign, he said that as co-leader he would try and connect with \\"the 28 percent of voters that considered voting Green last year and didn‚Äôt and remove all of the barriers that are currently stopping them voting Green\\". At the Green Party AGM on 30 May 2015 he received the highest number of votes, and was elected male co-leader. Shaw won 54 per cent of the first preference votes, compared to Kevin Hague who won 44 per cent (the other two candidates both won 1 per cent). The day after becoming co-leader, he called for a cross- party consensus on climate change, and said there was room for the Greens and National to work together on the issue. He also said in his first major speech that he wanted the Green Party to be \\"more like modern New Zealand\\", and expand its membership both in terms of numbers and to include a more diverse group of people. =2017 general election= Following the resignation of co- leader Metiria Turei due to the political fallout over her benefit and electoral fraud disclosures, James Shaw became the Green Party's solo leader for the duration of the 2017 general election campaign. A female co-leader will be appointed after the Party's AGM in 2018. As party leader, Shaw has called for calm in the wake of hostility among party members towards the media and the resignation of fellow Green Members of Parliament David Clendon and Kennedy Graham in protest of Turei's initial refusal to resign. On 13 August, Shaw announced the Party's new slogan \\"Love New Zealand\\" at a relaunch in Auckland. During the Green Party's climate change campaign launch in Auckland, Shaw announced that New Zealanders would get an annual dividend of $250 as part of a proposed Kiwi Climate Fund that would tax farmers for pollution and replace the current New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme. Shaw also proposed a Zero Carbon Act with the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and the establishment of an Independent Climate Change Commission. During the 2017 election, the Green Party's share of the party vote dropped to 6.3% with the Party retaining eight seats in Parliament. As the first on the Green party list, Shaw was re-elected. During coalition-forming negotiations, Shaw announced that the Greens would be pursuing a coalition with Labour and the socially-conservative New Zealand First parties but ruled out cooperating with the National Party. =Coalition Government, 2017-present= In October 2017, the Greens entered a confidence and supply arrangement with the Labour Party and New Zealand First which gives them three ministers outside cabinet and one under-secretarial role. This marks the first time the Greens have been in government. Shaw assumed the ministerial portfolios for Climate Change and Statistics, and Associate Minister of Finance. As Minister for Statistics, Shaw received criticism from National MP Nick Smith for the low response rate during the 2018 New Zealand census. Shaw has attributed the lower response to a lack of Internet access particularly among the older generation. In April 2018, Shaw as Minister for Climate Change expressed support for the Government's decision to end future gas and oil exploration, hailing it as the \\"nuclear-free moment of our generation.\\" He also reiterated the Green Party's support for ending deep sea oil and gas exploration, stating that \\"fossil fuels are not our future.\\" According to figures released by the Department of Internal Affairs, Shaw was the government minister to spend the most on air travel fares in late 2018. Shaw spent NZ$77,771 on international air travel fares during the period between October and December 2018 while Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spent NZ$54,487 during that same period. Shaw clarified that these air travel fares had been spent on attending multiple international climate change conferences. On 14 March 2019, Shaw was assaulted while walking to Parliament, sustaining a black eye and lacerations to his face. The attack was condemned by politicians from all sides of the political spectrum. Police have confirmed that a 47-year-old man was arrested and charged with injuring with intent to injure in relation to the incident. During a press conference held the following day, Shaw expressed support for climate change school strikes held across the country calling for governments worldwide to take action on climate change. Shaw declined to give details about the assault, stating it was under police investigation. On 8 May 2019, Shaw introduced the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill into the New Zealand Parliament. The Bill subsequently passed its first reading on 22 May 2019. In late August 2020, Shaw attracted criticism from the opposition National Party, school principals, teachers unions' and members of his own Green Party after he approved the allocation of NZ$11.7 million from the Government's $3 billion COVID-19 \\"shovel-ready\\" recovery fund to the private \\"Green School New Zealand\\" in Taranaki. This funding boost violated the Green Party's own policy of opposing state funding being allocated to private schools. Shaw had defended the decision, claiming it would have created 200 jobs and boosted the local economy. Former Green MPs Catherine Delahunty, Mojo Mathers and Sue Bradford criticised Shaw's decision as a betrayal of the Green Party's policies and principles. According to Newshub, Shaw refused to sign the Government's NZ$3 billion \\"shovel-ready\\" infrastructure fund until the Green School in Taranaki was approved. On 1 September, Shaw apologised for approving the funding of the Green School, describing it as \\"an error of judgment.\\" Shaw has also apologised to Green Party members in a Zoom call. Representatives of the school have reportedly approached the Crown to convert part or all of the Government's grant into a loan. On 3 September, the Education Minister Chris Hipkins disputed Shaw's claim that he had given verbal approval to the allocation of NZ$11.7 million to the private Green School in Taranaki. Political views Shaw believes that the market can be reformed to incorporate sustainability within its normal operations. In an interview with the Aro Valley Valley Voice he put forward his views: On 5 June 2020, Shaw and fellow Co-Leader Marama Davidson described United States President Donald Trump as racist in response to a question fielded by press gallery journalists in response to the protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd in late May 2020. Personal life Shaw and his wife Annabel live in Aro Valley.

FARM was also responsible for an earlier series of annual conferences, named Action For Life, between 1981 and 1987, as well as two special conferences in 1991 and 1997. Between 1988 and 1996, the annual animal conferences were organized by the former National Alliance for Animal Rights. Early years In August 1975, Dr. Alex Hershaft\\"The Brains Behind the Great American Meatout\\" VegNews. Retrieved 2014-3-17. became involved in the vegetarian movement after attending the World Vegetarian Congress in Orono, ME, and meeting Jay Dinshah. A year later, he founded the Vegetarian Information Service (VIS) to distribute information on the benefits of a vegetarian diet.\\"Holocaust survivor heads animal rights group Alex Hershaft throws himself into cause\\" Baltimore Sun.

VIS also organized several conferences in DC and Pennsylvania on strategies for promoting vegetarianism. Some conference participants, influenced by Peter Singer‚Äôs 1975 treatise Animal Liberation, argued that the scope of these conferences should be expanded to include animal rights. Accordingly, in the summer of 1981, Hershaft organized Action For Life, a national conference at Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, that effectively launched the U.S. animal rights movement, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the Farm Animal Reform Movement, and the since defunct Trans-Species UnlimitedLawrence & Susan Finsen. The Animal Rights Movement in America. Twayne Publishers, 1994; p. 121.Norm Phelps. The Longest Struggle. Lantern Books, 2004; pp. 190, 226. and Mobilization For Animals.\\"1983 Mobilization for Animals\\" Primate Research. Retrieved 2014-3-17. Participants included such animal rights pioneers as Cleveland Amory, Ingrid Newkirk, Alex Pacheco, Peter Singer, Henry Spira, Gretchen Wyler, as well as radio host Thom Hartmann. These conferences continued for seven more years in San Francisco (1982), Montclair, NJ (1983), Washington (1984), Los Angeles (1985), Chicago (1986), and Cambridge, MA (1987). In 1991, FARM organized A Decade of the Animals conference in Washington, DC, to commemorate the 1981 launch. Between 1988 and 1996, the annual conferences were taken over by Peter Link and the National Alliance for Animal Rights.Lawrence Finsen and Susan Finsen. The Animal Rights Movement in America: From Compassion to Respect. Twayne Publishers, 1994; pp. 75-76.Norm Phelps. The Longest Struggle. Lantern Books, 2007; p. 222. In 1990, his March on Washington attracted 25,000 participants. In 1996, a similar effort led to a much smaller turnout of 3,000. The disappointment at the small turnout and allegations of financial mismanagement sent Link into exile from the animal rights movement, and he was never heard from again. Current series In 1997, FARM jumped in to organize a national conference in Washington to lift the disappointment of the preceding year and to signal that the animal rights movement was alive and well. With no other group stepping forward for the next two years, FARM arranged another conference in the 2000 \\"Millennium Madness\\" year. The 2001 and 2002 conferences followed, all in Washington DC. By then, West Coast animal rights activists began clamoring for moving the conference to Los Angeles. Unsure of whether the West Coast could support a conference and wary of losing the continuing interest of the Washington area, FARM organized two conferences in the summer of 2003, in both Washington and Los Angeles. The success of the latter ensured that, beginning in 2004, the annual animal right rights national conference alternated between the two cities. In 2018, Alex Hershaft retired as Conference Chair. Former Conference Operations Director, Jen Riley, is currently named Conference Chair, working with Program Manager & Registrar, Ethan Eldreth, a Program Advisory Committee consisting of longtime movement leaders, as well as a team of managers. Mission & Program The annual animal rights national conference is dedicated to the vision of a world where animals are free from all forms of human exploitation. Yet, it recognizes that there are multiple paths, missions, strategies, and tactics for advancing that vision. Thus, a key mission of each conference is to provide a forum where relative merits of these paths, missions, strategies, and tactics may be discussed in an atmosphere of mutual respect. Other key missions include: * Documenting animal abuses for food, research, amusement, and more * Training attendees in personal growth and organizing * Offering opportunities to network and ‚Äúrecharge batteries‚Äù * Providing exposure to potential new movement leaders A typical conference involves a thousand attendees, 90 presenters from 60 organizations, a hundred sessions, screening of new video documentaries, 90 exhibits, and 15 co-sponsors.Norm Phelps. The Longest Struggle. Lantern Books, 2007; p. 274.(August 17, 2008) ‚ÄúAnimal Advocate Envisions a Vegetarian World‚Äù The Washington Post. Retrieved 2014-3-17. The program is structured along several parallel tracks, dealing with issues, organizing, advocacy, campaign reports, and discussions. Social highlights include evening receptions, Awards Banquet, and the closing party. Awards Beginning in 2000, animal rights conference presenters have inducted national leaders, authors, or other key agents of change to the U.S. Animal Rights Hall of Fame.

Legacy FARM's 1981 Action for Life conference provided the springboard for formation of the U.S. animal rights movement. The animal rights conferences that followed still offer the only national networking opportunity for movement leaders and activists. In fact, a number of animal rights movement leaders got their start here: * A young couple was inspired by the 1985 Los Angeles Action For Life conference to launch Farm Sanctuary the following year. * Peter Link, organizer of the 1990 March for Animal RightsLawrence Finsen and Susan Finsen.

Early life and education The son of Walter and Ruby McElreath Patrick, Patrick was born in Fickling, Georgia on October 11, 1935. Patrick graduated from North Georgia College, now part of the University of North Georgia, at which time he received his Army commission through the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).

It was released on January 31, 2014 on Nuclear Blast. Vocalist JB Christofferson described the album as \\"really powerful, majestic and less 'hard rocky' than\\" previous album, The Hunt (2012).Dick, Chris (March 7, 2014). \\"JB Christoffersson (Grand Magus) interviewed\\". Decibel Magazine. Retrieved March 17, 2014. Christofferson described Triumph and Power as \\"really the essence of this band\\". Recording Grand Magus continued its concern with obtaining a strong drum sound, which Christofferson identified as a reaction against the strong focus on the guitar sound. He noted that in heavy metal the drums are extremely important, maybe more important than many people realize. There has been a tendency in \\"modern\\" metal to focus too much on a fat guitar sound, resulting in really weak sounding or fake sounding drums. In my experience, the fat guitar sound is a result of the combination of drums and bass guitar, rather than using all space/frequencies for the guitars. You have to have a really solid foundation to make things explode, hence the focus on the drums. Critical reception The album has received generally favourable reviews. In Popmatters, Dean Brown praised Triumph and Power for \\"lift[ing] even the weariest of hearts with the power found in its mountain-shaking riffs, rhythms and vocal hooks\\" that provided \\"pure heavy metal made for any decade\\". Dave Schalek observed in About.com that the album featured stronger songwriting than previous album The Hunt, with many of the songs assuming an \\"anthem-like quality\\". Describing Grand Magus as \\"one of the coolest working the heavy circuit today\\", Greg Pratt wrote in Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles that the band's traditionalist approach to heavy metal was \\"meaty, weighty, metal, and proud\\". Greg Fisher of Sputnik Music similarly described the band as a \\"prime traditional metal purveyor\\" and suggested that Triumph and Power was \\"nothing short of triumphant\\" in that it \\"clearly matches up to the output of the luminaries that have inspired it\\".

He was an advocate of the \\"Social Gospel\\" views of Walter Rauschenbusch. Personal Charles David Williams was born July 30, 1860 in Bellevue, Ohio. He was educated at Kenyon College and Bexley Hall where he was ordained an Episcopal deacon on June 17, 1883 and priest on October 30, 1884. He died February 14, 1923. Professional Williams served as priest of Fernbank, Ohio and Riverside, Ohio from 1884 to 1889; as deacon at St. Paul's in Steubenville, Ohio from 1889 to 1893; and as dean of Trinity Cathedral in Cleveland from 1893 to 1906. In 1906, he was consecrated as bishop of the Michigan Diocese of the Episcopal Church, where he remained until his death in 1923. In his religious and social views, Williams was a liberal clergyman who advocated for the views of Walter Rauschenbush. Williams believed that the church should play an active role in resolving social problems. Although convinced that the church would always need to minister to individual philanthropic causes, he argued equally vigorously that the established denominations, in their teachings and advocacy of basic principles, should support reform of the economic and industrial system. He was a member of the commission of church leaders that investigated the steel industry and was national president of the Church League for Industrial Democracy. After the January 1920 raids in Detroit, Bishop was recruited as part of a citizens committee to help release the over 1000 men illegally arrested for peaceful assembly by the Justice Department run by General Palmer.

Background  It is not known when Liu Jun was born. His father Liu Chongwang was a prominent late-Tang official and served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong. Several of his uncles, including Liu Chongwang's older brother Liu Chonggui (ÂäâÂ¥áÈæú), were also prominent.Book of Southern Han (ÂçóÊº¢Êõ∏), vol. 10.Old Book of Tang, vol. 179. During Emperor Zhaozong's reign, the realm was in great turmoil. Sometime after Liu Chonggui's becoming the military governor (Jiedushi) of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), early in Emperor Zhaozong's Dashun era (890-891), Liu Jun, wanting to avoid the turmoils, followed his uncle Liu Chonggui to Qinghai and became dependent on Liu Chonggui. He remained at Qinghai's capital Guang Prefecture (Âª£Â∑û) after Liu Chonggui's death in the middle of Emperor Zhaozong's Qianning era (894-898).  Service under Liu Yin  Liu Chonggui had, in or around 894, commissioned Liu Yin as the defender of Heshui Base (Ë≥ÄÊ∞¥ÈéÆ, in modern Nanning, Guangxi), and then as the prefect of Feng Prefecture (Â∞ÅÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Therefore, after Liu Yin subsequently became the military governor of Qinghai, first in an acting capacity in 901Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. and then officially in 904,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Liu Yin, in showing gratitude to Liu Chonggui, treated Liu Jun with respect. He invited Liu Jun to serve on his staff, serving with Li Yinheng and Ni Shu, often consulting them on key decisions.  Service under Liu Yan  In 917, Liu Yin's brother and successor Liu Yan, who had previously been a vassal of Tang's successor state Later Liang, declared himself emperor of a new state of Yue (later changed to Han, and therefore historically known as Southern Han).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. He commissioned Liu Jun as the minister of imperial clan affairs (ÂÆóÊ≠£Âçø, Zhongzheng Qing) and deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang). Toward the end of Liu Yan's Qianheng era (917-925), there was a time when Liu Yan mobilized an army and placed it at Chao Prefecture (ÊΩÆÂ∑û, in modern Chaozhou, Guangdong), preparing to launch it against Southern Han's northeastern neighbor Min. Liu Jun found this inadvisable, so he discussed this with the chancellor Yang Dongqian. Yang agreed with him and tried to dissuade Liu Yan, to no avail. In 924, Liu Yan led the troops to take up a position between Min's Ting (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Zhang (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures. A Min army attacked him, and he was forced to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. He thus greatly regretted not listening to Yang and Liu Jun. After Yang died in 936,The 936 date here is based on Liu Jun's biography in the Book of Southern Han. However, Yang Dongqian's own biography in the Book of Southern Han indicated that he died in 935. See Book of Southern Han, vol. 9. Liu Yan promoted Liu Jun to be chancellor, with the titles of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé) and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), to replace Yang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. It was said that Liu Jun was honest and frugal. He often encouraged Liu Yan to love his people and rest his army, in terms that were delicate but firm. He died while serving as chancellor, but the date was not given. (As nothing was said about his serving under Liu Yan's successors, presumably he died before Liu Yan's death in 942.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.

This included pushing the Kansas House of Representatives to pass a resolution supporting the state of Kansas' work on UAS issues. He also pushed for a 2013 drone privacy bill to be drafted in a way to protect the Kansas drone economy. In March 2019, he amended the state budget to include funds for Kansas State Polytechnic University to receive $500,000 to hire more instructors for the pilot education program. He has also introduced legislation to create an aviation tax credit program for students studying engineering and aviation in the state and want to work in the Kansas aviation industry. The bill passed the state House of Representatives by a vote of 106-18 in March 2019. He has been active in working with state panels focused on unmanned aerial systems and a pilot program granted to the state by the Federal Aviation Administration. During a September 2019 meeting of the Kansas Capitol Preservation Committee he questioned why a new plaque including the names of former governors involved in the Kansas Capitol renovation project did not include former legislative leaders involved in the planning.

These certifications were sold for between $189.95 to $549.95. According to a Federal Trade Commission complaint, Claeys and his company Tested Green never tested any of the products certified and would certify anyway for simply paying. Part of the purported fraud includes using the claims that the Tested Green certification was endorsed by the National Green Business Association and National Association of Government Contractors. These associations were both owned and operated by Claeys and were in no way independent endorsements. The FTC approved this complaint unanimously at a vote of 5-0. This led to 20 year sanctions on Claeys and his company. Another aspect of fraud in this case was the misrepresentation of the number of clients tested green had certified. Tested Green claimed to be the \\"nation's leading certification program with over 45,000 certifications in the United States.\\" In reality, the FTC found that only 129 companies had ever been certified. The place of residence for Claeys has also come into question. While seeking his second term for the Kansas House of Representatives, it was reported that Claeys had filed to run for office under his sister's address. During the controversy, he claimed to live with his sister, her husband, and their three children for personal reasons. When confronted by a reporter to see that he actually had a living space within his sister's home, he declined to let the reporter enter, stating \\"I'm not going to be held to a different level of scrutiny than everybody else is,\\" and \\"It's nobody's business.\\" The listed address was controversial for many reasons, most of which revolved around a property owned by Claeys in Lawrence, Kansas. The property was a condominium valued at $433,400 for tax purposes. A resident who lives in the same complex in Lawrence was quoted as saying \\"J.R. has a two-car garage and a stall for his boat,\\" and \\"He votes on issues that come up in the Bella Sera Homeowners Association.\\" Claeys defended having the property stating that was the residence he used while the Kansas House of Representatives was in session. He also defended the price valuation by saying that the apartment was one of several locations he bought out of foreclosure. On September 6, 2017, Claeys tweeted that he would \\"rather give money to North Korea than to public radio\\".

It was, before the buy-out from IAG New Zealand Ltd, a Mutual insurance company, meaning it was owned by its policy holders. History =Effect of Canterbury earthquakes on AMI= After the Christchurch Earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 some doubt over obtaining sufficient reinsurance cover for further earthquakes, plus lack of exact figures from the government's EQC to indicate how much of the earthquakes' insurance costs would have to come from Allied Mutual Insurance (AMI), led to uncertainty over the insurer's financial state. The New Zealand government talked of bailing out the company up to $1000 million because of the chaos that would ensue if it collapsed, and eventually agreed to a NZD 500 million support deed, but large losses led to a NZD 76 million shortfall of its NZD 198.6 million regulatory capital requirement and so forced the controversial sale of AMI, to the New Zealand arm of Australia and New Zealand's largest insurance group, IAG. IAG NZ already had acquired major insurance names in New Zealand, such as NZI (formerly New Zealand Insurance) and State Insurance, and with acquiring AMI's business (other than Christchurch earthquake-related work) IAG covered 60% of the domestic insurance market. =Southern Response= The government created a government-owned company, Southern Response Earthquake Services, to take over the part of AMI's work that related to the Christchurch earthquake repairs. It is responsible for settling claims by AMI policyholders for Canterbury earthquake damage which occurred before 5 April 2012. Perceived poor performance of that organisation has led to some protests and a lawsuit, but a large percentage of the easier repairs have been actioned despite a period of work outstripping resources in post-quake Canterbury. In 2018 it was revealed that four years earlier Southern Response had employed private investigation company Thompson and Clarke to attend and record public meetings held by groups of AMI/Southern Response claimants. A report by the State Services Commission found that in doing so Southern Response had acted inconsistently with the State Services Code of conduct on a number of occasions in 2014-2016. =2020 closure of branches= On 23 July 2020, IAG announced that AMI would be closing all of its 53 branches and its remaining State store in New Zealand in phases. The Albany, Botany, Te Rapa, Mount Maunganui, Wellington, Hornby, and Dunedin stores will close in June 2021 while most remaining stores will close on 18 September. The Timaru branch will remain open until 27 November 2020. 65 branch manager jobs will be eliminated while 350 jobs would be transferred to customer service and other departments.

The Board members are predominantly senior university academics, drawn from the University of Queensland, Griffith University, James Cook University and the Queensland University of Technology. In addition to the Board, Research Associates (also mostly university academics) and policy experts have been invited to join the organisation to provide a source of expertise for policymakers, and contribute to the website.TJ Ryan Foundation web site The stated aims of the Foundation are to: * stimulate debate on issues in Queensland public administration, including effective resource allocation, service delivery, governance and accountability; * review policy directions of current and past State governments on economic, social and cultural issues, and to analyse options for future decision-makers; and * assist policy-makers inside and outside government in developing progressive evidence-based policy.Official brochure, TJ Ryan Foundation, 27 February 2014. Despite seed funding being provided by the Queensland Labor Party (ALP) and the Queensland Council of Unions (QCU), the goal of the TJ Ryan Institute is to be a politically independent source of policy analysis and commentary and in the words of Executive Director Professor Roger Scott, to \\"reach beyond the ideological confines of the ALP\\". Other left-leaning or progressive think tanks commenting on public policy in Australia include The Australia Institute, the ALP's official think tank the Chifley Research Centre, the socialist Fabian Society, the Evatt Foundation, the Grattan Institute and the centre-left Per Capita. Avowedly non-partisan think tanks include Centre for Policy Development and the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. Conservative or right-leaning think tanks include the libertarian Centre for Independent Studies, the Menzies Research Centre, the H. R.

He is venerated as blessed by the Catholic Church. Life De Bono was born on 5 January 1530 in Valencia, the second of the four children of Juan de Bonom (or Joan de Bonome), who had emigrated from Gascony, and his wife, Isabel Juana Manz√≥n (or Monzon), originally from Villa de Cervera in the Province of Lleida (). Upon his birth, he was baptized at the nearby Church of San Nicol√°s. Having been born on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany, he was named for one of the Biblical Magi. Although Gaspar's parents were very pious, the family was poor. His father was a linen weaver by trade, but when his mother was blinded three years after his birth and became unable to help in the family trade, the father was forced to sell their home and his tools and took work as a grinder and reseller. As a child, he developed a noticeable stammer, a problem from which he suffered his whole life. At the age of ten, De Bono began working with a silk merchant, but soon realized that his vocation was religious and began to study Latin while continuing to work to support his family. About 1545, he was admitted as a candidate to the Dominican Order, but, just as he was about to enter their novitiate, he was talked out of this by a brother-in- law, after which he returned home. At age twenty, De Bono joined the army of the Emperor Charles V, in search of fortune. He served as a soldier for about ten years, but continued to try and live a devout and religious life, by praying, saying the rosary daily, donating to charity and frequenting places of worship. He fought in Lombardy where he was seriously wounded in the head. Left for dead, De Bono made a promise to enter the Minim friars, founded by Francis of Paola, if he survived. De Bono did in fact recover, and soon entered the Minim Monastery of San Sebasti√°n in Valencia, which was located a short distance from his family home, receiving the religious habit on 16 June 1560. He professed his religious vows as a member of the Order on 17 June of the following year and was ordained as a priest in 1562. De Bono soon became known for his virtue and strict compliance with the Rule of Life of the Order. He was available to all the people of the neighborhood which he knew thoroughly. He was present to comfort his parents in their final hours, his mother dying on 29 April 1583, and his father a year later. He was soon named Master of novices for the Catalan Province of the Order, being responsible for the founding of a Minim monastery in Barcelona. He was elected to serve as Vicar Provincial. At the insistence of the Archbishop of Valencia, Juan de Ribera (now honored as a saint), in 1602 he was elected Corrector Provincial (regional superior) of Valencia. He is said to have remained humble and austere; retaining his devotions and customs, and continued to be noted for his prudence and charity throughout his life. De Bono died in Valencia on 14 July 1604, at the age of 74. His remains were first entombed in the Church of San Sebasti√°n, to which the monastery was attached. After the suppression of the monastery under the Napoleonic rule of Spain, the urn containing his bones was moved in 1835 to the Church of San Nicol√°s, where he had been baptized as a baby, and enshrined under the altar of the Chapel of St. Raphael. Veneration De Bono was beatified by Pope Pius VI on 10 September 1786. His eulogy is written in the Roman Martyrology for 14 July: At Valencia in Spain, Blessed Gaspar de Bono, a priest of the Order of Minims, who left the arms of the prince of the world for the militia of Christ the King and for the sake of the house of ' Order in the Spanish province, who ruled with prudence and charity. Each year, on the 14 July, small celebrations are held in De Bono's honor at the Impasse of Ca√±ete in the Carmen neighborhood, the street where he was born.

Beetham Family Collection William Beetham (25 July 1809 ‚Äì 3 August 1888) was an English-born portrait painter, who painted mainly in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. He exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts in London (1834‚Äì53) and painted in Hamburg, Copenhagen and at the court of the Tsar in Saint Petersburg. He emigrated to New Zealand in 1855 and became a significant figure as a colonist, pastoralist and portrait artist. He had a society clientele and received commissions to paint portraits of aristocrats and national leaders, including important MƒÅori Rangatira chiefs. Beetham's paintings are in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London and Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. He was the founder and Chair of the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts in 1882. Mezzotint prints of Beetham's drawings are in the permanent collection of the Science Museum, London Beetham's paintings and drawings have also sold at Bonhams auction house. Biography William Beetham R.A. was born in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England and started his career painting scenes of his home town. His grandfather Joshua Beetham Sr established 'Beetham Wine and Spirits' merchants which lasted for five generations. William established his reputation as a society portraitist, firstly in England by painting portraits (oil on canvas) of noble dignitary such as the Reverend Nathaniel Bond and the former Prime Minister F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich (1843). He exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy Of Art, London and travelled overseas to paint in Hamburg, Copenhagen and at the Court of the Tsar in St. Petersburg. His decision to emigrate to New Zealand in 1855 was motivated by the improved financial opportunities in the colonies and a desire to settle his large family of seven sons and three daughters on pastoral land. Beetham at 46 years of age and a European (pakeha) became one of the early settlers in New Zealand's colonial history when he arrived aboard the William and Jane Steamship at Port Nicholson, Wellington harbour on 1 December 1855. He settled at Te Mako, Taita in the Hutt Valley in 1860 after taking over a lease of land from MƒÅori Chief Wi Tako NgƒÅtata of Te ƒÄtiawa, NgƒÅti Ruanui and Taranaki iwi, who was the most influential MƒÅori chief in Wellington at that time and lived nearby at Naenae. The land was owned by Alexander Currie, chairman of the directors of the New Zealand Company. After Chief Wi Tako relinquished the lease of Te Mako in 1860, he agreed to have entrusted in Beetham's care a nationally significant MƒÅori pƒÅtaka store house Nuku Tewhatewha that he had commissioned in 1856. This was carved by Horonuku Te Heu Heu of NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa. This taonga remains an important MƒÅori carving and a symbol of solidarity and support to the MƒÅori King movement Kingitanga. It formed one of the seven \\"Pillars of the Kingdom\\" (Nga Pou o te Kingitanga) and is the only one to have survived. In 1982, after 122 years of care Hugh Beetham, William's great grandson decided to return the pƒÅtaka to the City of Lower Hutt and it is now permanently housed at the Dowse Art Museum. Beetham eventually purchased the Te Mako land in 1876. In 1856 Beetham also purchased a leasehold for land at Wainuioru in the Wairarapa for his sons, which by 1857 they had developed into the Brancepeth Estate. After the marriage of his eldest daughter Annie Beetham to T.C. Williams in 1858, Brancepeth was rapidly expanded and run by the Beetham-Williams family partnership to become one of the largest pastorals stations in New Zealand with 77,000 acres, 100,000 sheep, 300 employees and a 32 room homestead (10,000 sq ft) of Scottish baronial styled design with battlemented tower. Designed by the architect Joshua Charlesworth, Heritage New Zealand has listed Brancepeth as a Category 1 site. Brancepeth was used as a location for Board meetings of the International Wool Secretariat in 1964 and also visited by H.R.H. Charles, Prince of Wales when he wanted to observe an exemplary sheep station in New Zealand. Brancepeth also welcomed the BBC and Robin Day to film farming in NZ for the British public. Beetham remained in the Hutt Valley where he farmed a small holding, though painting remained his private and public priority. In accordance with the tradition of Victorian portrait painters, Beetham never signed or dated his work. The subjects were considered of more importance than the artist. Identification of the artist of such work relies on solid provenance. Beetham's first commission to paint MƒÅori came within a month of his arrival to NZ when Tamihana Te Rauparaha requested a posthumous portrait of his father Te Rauparaha, a MƒÅori rangatira Chief and war leader of the NgƒÅti Toa tribe who composed the famous Haka called Ka Mate. Beetham also painted Te Rauparaha's wife Rita or Ruth. Beetham's portraits of MƒÅori preceded those of C. F. Goldie and Gottfried Lindauer and many commissions followed with the MƒÅori noting Beetham‚Äôs accurate painting of the TƒÅ moko. Beetham painted the MƒÅori rangatira chiefs in Regency style to indicate class and status. Most of the MƒÅori sitters in Beetham's portraits are pictured in formal European dress as many of the younger chiefs had grown up among pakeha and adopted their European dress and hairstyles. Beetham rarely dated or signed his portraits, which was a common practise amongst portrait artists of his era. Beetham‚Äôs portraits were popular among MƒÅori and pakeha alike, and his paintings of social groups, urban and rural leaders, children and family groups, provide a fascinating light on social as well as political interactions of the day and the early settlement history of the wider Wellington region. Set during the aftermath of the New Zealand Company and the early provincial era, Beetham's portrait paintings featured the eminent movers of the day, such as the son of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and William Mein Smith the Surveyor General of the New Zealand Company. Beetham also painted the portrait of Archdeacon Henry Williams (missionary) who translated the Treaty of Waitangi for the British Crown into Te Reo MƒÅori language. Henry's son T.C. Williams was married to Beetham's daughter Anne. The controversy and implications surrounding the sale of Wellington land between the MƒÅori and the early European settlers is captured in Beetham's nationally significant painting Dr. Featherston and the Maori Chiefs, Wi Tako and Te Puni (1857‚Äì58). This features the portraits of Dr. Isaac Featherston and the MƒÅori Rangatira Chiefs Wi Tako NgƒÅtata and Honiana Te Puni (paramount chief of Te Whanganui-a- Tara , Wellington Harbour) and is housed in the permanent collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington. Beetham painted little after the late 1860s, after which he turned to poetry and to establishing a more secure future for the arts in his adopted country. In 1882 Beetham founded the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts in Wellington and as chair of the Association he formed the objective to promote and encourage fine arts in New Zealand. He also served as President of the Academy. William Beetham died in Wellington on 3 August 1888 and is buried with his wife at the Bolton Street Memorial Park in Wellington, NZ. The first major survey of Beetham‚Äôs work was presented by the Wairarapa Arts Centre in 1973 and curated by Guy Ramsden. It was to be another 40 years before the most significant exhibition of Beetham's work to date was commissioned and titled Te R≈´ Movers & Shakers; Early New Zealand Portraits by William Beetham. This was curated by NZ art historian Jane Vial and exhibited at the New Zealand Portrait Gallery in the capital city of Wellington in 2013 followed by a smaller spin-off exhibition titled Close to Home ‚Äì William Beetham Portraits at Aratoi - Wairarapa Museum of Art and History in Masterton in 2014. The Te R≈´ exhibition included items from both private and public collections and showcased notable portraits of Chief Wi Tako and of his daughter, which had not previously been seen publicly. Te ƒÄti Awa gifted the Te R≈´ piece of the exhibition title. Personal William Beetham married Mary Horsley at St Georges Parish Church, Doncaster on 25 June 1835. They had ten children together and thirty-two grandchildren. They lived firstly in Hexthorpe near Doncaster before moving to Prospect Street, Horncastle, Lincolnshire and then onto Frimley Hill, Ash Vale, Surrey. From there they emigrated with their family to New Zealand, settling at Te Mako at Taita in the Hutt Valley, Wellington district. William sold the Te Mako property in 1885 and it was later destroyed by fire in 1929. They moved to their final residency in Wellington where Beetham died on 3 August 1888. His funeral attended by the Governor-General of New Zealand. After Beetham's death his wife Mary moved to the home of their daughter Annie and her husband Thomas Coldham Williams at Hobson Street, Wellington. William and Mary are both buried at the Bolton Street Memorial Park, Wellington, NZ. Plot 6801 on Trustees Crescent. William Beetham was father to 10 children. Those with national recognition in NZ were Richmond Beetham a NZ artist and senior Magistrate of Christchurch, William Henry Beetham a NZ wine pioneer who together with his French wife Marie Zelie Hermance Frere Beetham planted the first pinot noir grapes in NZ in 1888 at their Lansdowne vineyard in Masterton, The wine was tasted by Romeo Bragato the famous viticulturist who considered it exceptional.

Vimeo, LLC, 972 F. Supp. 2d 500, 972 F. Supp. 2d 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), was a 2013 copyright infringement case out of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The decision resolved cross-motions for summary judgment filed by a video-sharing service (Vimeo) and a pair of record labels.Law 360. How Capitol Records v. Vimeo Shapes The Content Stream. http://www.law360.com/articles/480010/how-capitol- records-v-vimeo-shapes-the-content-stream Vimeo sought a ruling that, as a matter of law, it was entitled to safe harbor protection under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as to a series of copyrighted videos that were uploaded to its platform; the record labels sought the opposite ruling.  Facts  Vimeo began operating in 2004-2005 as an online video platform that requires its users to upload only material they have created or participated in the creation of. Vimeo does not pre-screen the uploaded material, and relies on community reviews to guarantee that users follow its Terms of service, which include a \\"Community Guideline\\" that sets restrictions on uploaded content. Vimeo also provides a web page for its copyright infringement policy regarding the DMCA. The policy is enforced by the \\"Community Team,\\" which uses \\"Moderator Tools\\" to filter and remove videos that contain offensive or infringing content. In December 2009, record companies Capitol Records and EMI filed a lawsuit claiming that 199 videos on Vimeo‚Äôs platform infringed their music copyrights.September 2013 Order. p 5. Vimeo did not dispute that it lacked authorization from the copyright owners and that the videos infringed the plaintiffs' copyrights. Nevertheless, Vimeo argued that it was entitled to ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù protection under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512(c) (information residing on systems or networks at direction of users) of the DMCA.September 2013 Order. p 6.  Opinion  = September 2013 Order = In evaluating a safe harbor defense under the DMCA, a court will first evaluate whether the party has met a set of three threshold criteria. The court will then decide whether the party has fulfilled the requirements of the safe harbor protection it invokes.  Threshold criteriaSeptember 2013 Order. pp 12-23.  The threshold criteria require that an online service provider has adopted, reasonably implemented, and informed users of a policy to terminate accounts of users who repeatedly infringe their copyright policy. Based on this, the District Court discussed the following: # Whether or not Vimeo qualified as a service provider: \\"Service provider\\" is a broad term covering various online entities. The court noted that sites that provide more than basic file storage for users have consistently been found to be service providers. Thus, it reasoned, Vimeo can be considered an online service provider. # Whether or not Vimeo had adopted a repeated infringement policy: Vimeo's repeated infringement policy was clearly stated in its terms of use, and supported by emails that show employees did terminate accounts based on infringement. The court held this was enough to show adoption. # Whether or not Vimeo had informed users of the policy: This criterion requires the service provider to notify users that they face termination of their use of the service if they repeatedly violate copyright laws. The court determined that Vimeo required registered users to agree not to infringe one another's copyrights, informed users that their accounts could be terminated if the agreement was violated, and provided contact information for Vimeo's DMCA agent. # Whether or not Vimeo reasonably implemented the policy: The plaintiffs claimed that Vimeo's implementation was inadequate because it banned email addresses, not IP addresses, and that its treatment of notices received within a three-day period as single instances of infringement was too lenient. However, the court determined that the implementation need not be perfect, only reasonable, and that Vimeo met this requirement. # Whether or not Vimeo's policies interfered with \\"standard technical measures\\" of identifying and protecting copyrighted works: The court determined that although Vimeo's privacy policy did make it more difficult for copyright holders to collect information regarding their works, it did not specifically interfere with technical measures. Based on this, the court determined that Vimeo met the threshold requirement for safe harbor protection under the DMCA.  Safe Harbor RequirementsSeptember 2013 Order. pp 23-54.  As to whether Vimeo qualified for a safe harbor pursuant to ¬ß512(c), the District Court discussed several factors: # Storage at the direction of a user: 10 of the 199 videos had been uploaded by users who were or became Vimeo's employees. The court found that there was a triable issue as to whether they stored the content as \\"users\\" or as employees acting on behalf of Vimeo. # Knowledge of infringement: 2.a) Some employees had interacted with 55 of 199 infringing videos (by liking, commenting, or reviewing). There was a triable issue as to whether Vimeo acquired \\"actual or red flag knowledge\\" of the infringing videos due to these actions by their employees; 2.b) A series of emails by Vimeo employees commenting on or ignoring infringing content was insufficient to establish \\"willful blindness\\" on the part of Vimeo. # Ability to control infringing content with financial benefits: the court decided that Vimeo‚Äôs control tactics were not pervasive enough to induce or influence its users to upload copyrighted material. # Expeditious removal: The court found that Vimeo had removed the infringing videos expeditiously at plaintiffs' request.  Pre-1972 RecordingsSeptember 2013 Order. pp 54-55.  The court shared the plaintiffs' view that the DMCA safe harbors did not apply to recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, but declined to extend the DMCA protections, stating this was a policy matter that should be resolved by the Congress. Therefore, the court held that any infringing video-in-suit recorded prior to 1972 was not eligible for safe harbor protection. = December 2013 Order = On December 31, the court decided that: 1) Vimeo was entitled to summary judgment as to seventeen more videos related to the case. Fifteen of them were uploaded by \\"Plus\\" users, who accounted for 36% of the 43,000 new videos uploaded daily to the website. The court reasoned that the sheer number of these users made it unrealistic to believe that employees watched every one of their uploaded videos. As to two other videos that played copyrighted songs for a short time in the background, the court concluded that the infringement was not ‚Äúobvious to a reasonable person‚Äù, leaving room for a fair use defense. 2) The court also allowed Plaintiffs to add other instances of infringement to the suit, many related to songs recorded before February 15, 1972 or to videos that Vimeos interacted with.December 2013 Order. pp 14-16. 3) Finally, the court certified questions raised by the defendant, which means that : \\"(a) Whether the DMCA's safe-harbor provisions are applicable to sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972; and (b) Whether, under Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., a service provider's viewing of a user-generated video containing all or virtually all of a recognizable, copyrighted song may establish 'facts or circumstances' giving rise to 'red flag' knowledge of infringement.\\"December 2013 Order. p 26  Significance and reactions  The case has generated different reactions from reviewers. Justin E. Pierce and Matthew R. Farley have argued that cases like this help shed light on the fine-tuning of online service providers' rights, obligations and potential eligibility for safe harbor protection. In their analysis of the September 2013 Order, they pointed out some implications to providers of streaming video: \\"Don‚Äôt hedge on a copyright enforcement policy, and put it front and center. (...); Actions speak louder than words. (...); Streaming media companies should manage how their employees interact with users. (...); Although it may be difficult, streaming media startups should resist uploading initial content in order to populate and popularize their services. (...); As a general matter, tolerating ‚Äúgray areas‚Äù will cost money. (...); 'Red flag' knowledge and willful blindness are significant expansions on actual knowledge.\\" Evan Sheres has stated: \\"Judge Abrams failed to establish a reasonable precedent regarding 'red flag' knowledge, further eroding the 'red flag' standard. Actual employee interaction with the infringing material, especially where the employees make it harder for copyright owners to issue takedown notices, should be sufficient to constitute infringement which is ‚Äòobjectively‚Äô obvious to a reasonable person.\\"Copyright Alliance.

The antigens and antibodies combine by a process called agglutination. It is the fundamental reaction in the body by which the body is protected from complex foreign molecules, such as pathogens and their chemical toxins. In the blood, the antigens are specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an antigen- antibody complex. The immune complex is then transported to cellular systems where it can be destroyed or deactivated. The first correct description of the antigen-antibody reaction was given by Richard J. Goldberg at the University of Wisconsin in 1952. It came to be known as \\"Goldberg's theory\\" (of antigen- antibody reaction). There are several types of antibodies and antigens, and each antibody is capable of binding only to a specific antigen. The specificity of the binding is due to specific chemical constitution of each antibody. The antigenic determinant or epitope is recognized by the paratope of the antibody, situated at the variable region of the polypeptide chain. The variable region in turn has hyper-variable regions which are unique amino acid sequences in each antibody. Antigens are bound to antibodies through weak and noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. The principles of specificity and cross-reactivity of the antigen-antibody interaction are useful in clinical laboratory for diagnostic purposes. One basic application is determination of ABO blood group. It is also used as a molecular technique for infection with different pathogens, such as HIV, microbes, and helminth parasites. Molecular basis Immunity developed as an individual is exposed to antigens is called adaptive or acquired immunity, in contrast to immunity developed at birth, which is innate immunity. Acquired immunity depends upon the interaction between antigens and a group of proteins called antibodies produced by B cells of the blood. There are many antibodies and each is specific for a particular type of antigen. Thus immune response in acquired immunity is due to the precise binding of antigens to antibody. Only very small area of the antigens and antibody molecules actually interact through complementary binding sites, called epitopes in antigens and paratopes in antibody. =Antibody structure= Structural model of an antibody molecule. Rounded portions indicate antigen binding sites. In an antibody, the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region is formed from the amino-terminal end of both the light and heavy chains of the immunoglobulin polypeptide. This region, called the variable (V) domain, is composed of amino acid sequences that define each type of antibody and their binding affinity to an antigen. The combined sequence of variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (VH) creates three hypervariable regions (HV1, HV2, and HV3). In VL these are roughly from residues 28 to 35, from 49 to 59, and from 92 to 103, respectively. HV3 is the most variable part. Thus these regions are the paratope, the binding site of an antigen. The rest of the V region between the hypervariable regions are called framework regions. Each V domain has four framework domains, namely FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Structure of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antigen. (A) The 3-D structure of HEL (CPK representation) together with three Abs (ribbon representation). (B) The structure of HEL colored according to the same three epitopes as in (A). (C) The structure of HEL colored according to the epitopes predicted by Discotope (light blue), ellipro (purple), and seppa (pink). Properties =Chemical basis of antigen-antibody interaction= Antibodies bind antigens through weak chemical interactions, and bonding is essentially non-covalent. Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions are all known to be involved depending on the interaction sites. Non-covalent bonds between antibody and antigen can also be mediated by interfacial water molecules. Such indirect bonds can contribute to the phenomenon of cross-reactivity, i.e. the recognition of different but related antigens by a single antibody. =Affinity of the interaction= Antigen and antibody interact through a high affinity binding much like lock and key. A dynamic equilibrium exists for the binding. For example, the reaction is a reversible one, and can be expressed as: :[Ab] + [Ag] <=> [AbAg] where [Ab] is the antibody concentration and [Ag] is the antigen concentration, either in free ([Ab],[Ag]) or bound ([AbAg]) state. The equilibrium association constant can therefore be represented as: :K_a = \\\\frac{k_\\\\ce{on}}{k_\\\\ce{off}} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{[AbAg]}\\\\ce{[Ab][Ag]} where K is the equilibrium constant. Reciprocally the dissociation constant will be: :K_d = \\\\frac{k_\\\\ce{off}}{k_\\\\ce{on}} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{[Ab][Ag]}\\\\ce{[AbAg]} However, these equations are applicable only to a single epitope binding, i.e. one antigen on one antibody. Since the antibody necessarily has two paratopes, and in many circumstances complex binding occurs, the multiple binding equilibrium can be summed up as: :K_a = \\\\frac{k_\\\\ce{on}}{k_\\\\ce{off}} = \\\\frac\\\\ce{[AbAg]}\\\\ce{[Ab][Ag]} = \\\\frac r {c(n-r)} where, at equilibrium, c is the concentration of free ligand, r represents the ratio of the concentration of bound ligand to total antibody concentration and n is the maximum number of binding sites per antibody molecule (the antibody valence). The overall strength of the binding of an antibody to an antigen is termed its avidity for that antigen. Since antibodies are bivalent or polyvalent, this is the sum of the strengths of individual antibody-antigen interactions. The strength of an individual interaction between a single binding site on an antibody and its target epitope is termed the affinity of that interaction. Avidity and affinity can be judged by the dissociation constant for the interactions they describe. The lower the dissociation constant, the higher the avidity or affinity, and the stronger the interaction. Auto immune disease Normally antibodies can detect and differentiate molecules from outside of the body and those produced inside the body as a result of cellular activities. Self molecules as ignored by the immune system. However, in certain conditions, the antibodies recognise self molecules as antigens and triggers unexpected immune responses. This results in different autoimmune diseases depending on the type of antigens and antibodies involved. Such conditions are always harmful and sometimes deadly. The exact nature of antibody-antigen interaction in autoimmune disease is not yet understood. Application Antigen-antibody interaction is used in laboratory techniques for serological test of blood compatibility and various pathogenic infections. The most basic is ABO blood group determination, which is useful for blood transfusion. Sophisticated applications include ELISA, enzyme-linked immunospot (Elispot), immunofluorescence, and immunoelectrophoresis. =Precipitation reaction= Soluble antigens combine with soluble antibodies in presence of an electrolyte at suitable temperature and pH to form insoluble visible complex. This is called a precipitation reaction. It is used for qualitative and quantitative determination of both antigen and antibody. It involves the reaction of soluble antigen with soluble antibodies to form large interlocking aggravated called lattice. It occurs in two distinct stages. Firstly, the antigen and antibody rapidly form antigen-antibody complexes within few seconds and this is followed by a slower reaction in which the antibody-antigen complexes forms lattices that precipitate from the solution. A special ring test is useful for diagnosis of anthrax and determination of adulteration in food. =Agglutination reaction= It acts on antigen-antibody reaction in which the antibodies cross-link particulate antigens resulting in the visible clumping of the particle. There are two types, namely active and passive agglutination. They are used in blood tests for diagnosis of enteric fever.

Meaning UtsƒÅha (Sanskrit: ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§π) means ‚Äì 'enthusiasm', 'zeal', 'energy', 'strength', 'power', 'fortitude', 'strength of will', 'resolution', 'firmness', 'effort', 'endurance', 'perseverance', cheerfulness', 'joy', 'happiness'; it also means 'initiative' or 'drive'. As psychical essential Sridharswami regards joy as the energy (utsƒÅha) of the mind due to the attainment of cherished objects or the union with a beloved person; in other words, utsƒÅha is a mode of essence of the mind; it is an essential psychical element in a violation, which precedes a voluntary action. Therefore, Madhus≈´dana describes it as a resolution of the mind. UtsƒÅha or enthusiasm is roused in superior persons by the absence of sadness; this dominant state rouses the vira rasa or the emotion of heroism, and by rousing utsƒÅha, jadata or stupor and nidra or sleep caused by physiological action, is inhibited. As emotional essential Bharata, the legendary author of Natyashastra, speaks about the nine primary emotions by which Rasa, the primary sentiment that appeals to poetic sensibility, is nourished; they are ‚Äì rati ('enjoyment'), hƒÅsya ('mirth'), ≈õoka ('grief'), krodha ('anger'), utsƒÅha ('enthusiasm'), bhaya ('fear'), jugupsa ('disgust'), vismaya ('surprise') and sama or ≈õanta ('peace'), based respectively on nine navarasas ('primary sentiments'). UtsƒÅha or energy relates to 'virya rasa' and to persons of the superior types. Utsaha is a 'bhava' (emotional state) caused by Determinants such as absence of sadness, power, patience, heroism and the like, and is represented on the stage by Consequents such as steadiness, munificence, boldness of an undertaking and the like. As divine essential According to Abhinavagupta the rasas are like gods, and ≈õanta is like their highest centre, Shiva, he insists on transcendence as the highest value in literary aesthetics. Bharata does not consider complete detachment, Nirveda (world- weariness) as the sthƒÅyibhƒÅva of ≈õanta because detachment ordinarily does not arise from knowledge of the truth. Ishvarakrishna states that from detachment comes only prƒÅkrtilaya i.e. the dissolution of the eight causes, and not moksha, and Patanjali states that from knowledge of truth arises aversion to the gunas (detachment) which is really the highest state (ka≈õtha) of knowledge. Atman alone, possessed of pure qualities such as knowledge, bliss etc., and devoid of enjoyment of imagined sense-objects, is the sthƒÅyibhƒÅva of ≈õanta. ≈öanta is sama and sama is the true nature of the Self. Energy may be said to be based on egoism as its essence, and ≈õanta may be said to consist in the loosening of egoism, but there is no state that is devoid of utsƒÅha (energy). UtsƒÅha or dynamic energy is the sthƒÅyibhƒÅva or primary state of vira rasa, without utsƒÅha one cannot act; NƒÅtya ≈öastra VI.66 tells us that vira rasa is a dynamic energy (utsƒÅha) which arises from various causal factors (artha≈õe≈õa) such as decisiveness, not giving way to depression, not being surprised or confused. As rational essential A ruler is supposed to possess and the means of gaining three kinds of shakti (powers) viz., the powers of mantra (counsel), prabhutva (command over material resources) and utsƒÅha (energy). Yudhishthira considered counsel as being superior to the command over material resources and dignity, and Chanakya puts utsƒÅha in the lowest position among these three powers. UtsƒÅha also refers to heroic energy or effort. \\"Resolve is the root of king‚Äôs righteousness‚Ä¶He who is strong on resolve rules over those strong on words.\\" Mahabharata (XII.58.13-15),and utsƒÅha is one's resolve. The Vedic king was not regarded as the lord of the earth (bhu-pati) but the lord of men (nr-pati) (Rig Veda IV.38.2) or cattle (go-pati)(Rig Veda VI.28.3); it is at the time of the epics that territorial rights had assumed a dominant role. As realistic essential Bhagavad Gita (XVIII.26) refers to utsƒÅha as the untiring self-application and dynamic enthusiasm for achieving a chosen goal. Krishna tells Arjuna that one who performs his duty without association with the modes of material nature, without false ego, with great determination and enthusiasm ( ‡§ß‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§∏‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡§É), without wavering in success or failure is said to be a worker in the mode of goodness; this means that such a person is always enthusiastic till the completion of such work. Ramana uses the word, uran to refer to the strength of will, self-control or knowledge or to mean specifically strength of conviction to know oneself. As working instrument in Yoga Aurobindo recalls to mind the combined working of the four great instruments of Yoga for gaining Yoga-siddhi or perfection in yoga, viz., ≈õƒÅstra i.e. the knowledge of truths, principles, powers and processes that govern self-realization, utsƒÅha, the patient and the persistent action on the force of personal effort on the lines laid down by knowledge, gur≈´ or teacher and kƒÅla the instrumentality of Time. UtsƒÅha is a mental spirit (mƒÅnasƒ´ kriyƒÅ) which leads to promptness in every action. But, in Amera Kosha it occurs as a synonyme of adhyavasƒÅya meaning Buddhi or intelligence, and MitƒÅkshara explains adhyavasƒÅya or utsƒÅha ‚Äì ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡§® ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ø‡§É - as the effort or perseverance in the performance of acts accomplishing the objects of man. In the context of SpandakarikƒÅ (St.15) which states that only the effort directed towards the product of action disappears here (in states of intense introverted contemplation), it has been explained that \\"the product of action\\" is the created object of perception, the \\"effort directed towards it\\" is the exertion or utsƒÅha inherent in the agency of the Self.

During the 1960s and 1970s they were present at harvest and other crops in the west of the country and began to maintain a permanent presence in the city of Buenos Aires standing out in the horticultural work.

Part of its brief was to present new, experimental drama, and before the Second World War plays by T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood and others were presented there.Trewin, J. C., and Sayoni Basu. \\"Dukes, Ashley (1885‚Äì1959), playwright and theatre critic\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 4 October 2020. After the war the Mercury continued to present new plays. In April 1946 the theatre staged a double bill, comprising the first British performance of The Resurrection by W. B. Yeats and the world premiere of Fry's A Phoenix Too Frequent.\\"The Mercury: Plays by Poets\\", The Stage, 2 May 1946, p. 7 Both works have small casts: four performers in the first and three in the second.

The play opens with the first night of gloomy fast and broken sleep, disturbed at 2 a.m. by Tegeus, a soldier. He has been put on guard over the bodies of six criminals hanged nearby. He is drawn by the light in the tomb and enters. Dynamene, encouraged by her maidservant Doto, gradually finds Tegeus so attractive that she opts for life with him rather than death with Virilius.Fry, p. 32 They discover that in Tegeus's absence from his post one of the dead bodies has been cut down; this neglect of his duties renders Tegeus liable to court martial. He decides to kill himself rather than face the disgrace. Dynamene suggests that they substitute the body of Virilius. Tegeus is appalled, but she persuades him: How little you can understand! I loved His life not his death. And now we can give his death The power of life. Not horrible: wonderful!

History In 1875, pioneer Ezra Faunce homesteaded this property. Faunce was one of the first European settlers in the area, and served in multiple offices in the township and school district. In 1881, he constructed the barn located on this property, which is one of the oldest barns in the township. In 1895, James McMichael purchased the farm from the Faunce family. In 1900, he built the farmhouse that now stands on the property. Description The Faunce‚ÄìMcMichael Farm is a complex of buildings located on about seventeen acres. The buildings include the 1881 barn, the 1900 farmhouse, a chicken house, and a former pumphouse / shop building.

Brice portrays a videographer assigned to record an eccentric client, played by Duplass. Creep was inspired by Brice's experiences with Craigslist and the movies My Dinner with Andre, Misery, and Fatal Attraction. Brice and Duplass refined the film's story during filming, which resulted in multiple versions of each scene and several alternate end scenarios. The film premiered on March 8, 2014, at South by Southwest, and was released on video on demand on June 23, 2015, by The Orchard prior to an international release via Netflix on July 14, 2015. It received positive reviews from critics and has a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 89%. A sequel was released in 2017, also directed by Brice and starring Duplass, with a third film planned for a future release. Plot Struggling videographer Aaron accepts an assignment to travel to a remote cabin, where he meets his client Josef. Josef explains that he has an inoperable brain tumor and is expected to die before his pregnant wife Angela gives birth, so he wishes to have Aaron record a video diary for his unborn child. Throughout the day, Josef demonstrates eccentric behavior that makes Aaron uneasy, which culminates in Josef confessing that he raped his wife. As an increasingly- disturbed Aaron finds his attempt at departing hindered by being unable to locate his car keys, he intercepts a phone call from Angela, who reveals that she is actually Josef's sister and urges Aaron to escape. Josef, however, attempts to stop Aaron from leaving and a scuffle ensues before Aaron gets away. Back at his home, Aaron starts receiving items in the mail from Josef, including a recording of Josef digging a grave. The police are unable to take action due to Aaron knowing little about Josef, whom Aaron realizes is stalking him. A final DVD is sent to Aaron, where Josef offers to meet him in a public park to make amends. Aaron accepts Josef's offer, but places a camera on himself and sets his phone to speed dial the police as a precaution. As he waits on a park bench for Josef to arrive, Josef emerges from behind and kills him with an axe. Reviewing the footage, Josef questions why Aaron did not turn around in the moments leading up to his death. He concludes that Aaron believed he was a good person who would not harm him and because of this, he declares Aaron to be his favorite victim. Josef later receives a phone call from his newest target, now calling himself Bill, as he places a DVD of Aaron's murder alongside recordings of his past victims. Cast * Mark Duplass as Josef * Patrick Brice as Aaron Duplass' real-life spouse Katie Aselton makes an uncredited appearance as the voice of Angela. Production Duplass said that the film's story \\"was inspired by character-driven dramas that are, at their heart, two-handers: My Dinner with Andre, Misery, and Fatal Attraction\\" as well as \\"[his] myriad of strange Craigslist experiences over the years.\\" Brice and Duplass originally began working on Creep under the working title Peachfuzz after the wolf mask owned by Duplass' character, but chose to rename the film as the title's relevance came later in the movie's plot and they did not want viewers to \\"spend the first half hour trying to figure out why the movie is called Peachfuzz and [not] pay attention to the very intricate details\\". The two built the movie from a series of conversations they had with one another and decided to refine Creep while they were filming, which enabled them to film and screen portions of the film to see what would or would not work on camera. As a result, the film had multiple alternate end scenarios and Duplass stated that there were \\"10 to 12 permutations of each scene\\". Of the creative process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained: \\"We were interested in the psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don‚Äôt quite understand what‚Äôs up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe a little bit too much love here and there. But, for me, there‚Äôs something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'\\" Release Creep received a world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival on March 8, 2014, and film rights were purchased by RADiUS-TWC shortly thereafter. Plans for an October 2014, video on demand release fell through, when RADiUS didn't release the film. In June 2015, The Orchard and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (Orchard's parent company) acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was released on June 23, 2015, on video on demand, prior to a global release on Netflix on July 14, 2015. =Home media= Creep was released on DVD on April 5, 2016, from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Reception Creep received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.06/10. The critical consensus states, \\"a smart, oddball take on found-footage horror, Creep is clever and well-acted enough to keep viewers on the edges of their seats\\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 6 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Hollywood Reporter and Indiewire both gave the film positive reviews, and Indiewire noted that although the film had its flaws, they mostly worked in Creep's favor. Variety remarked that Creep \\"could have been more effective if Duplass‚Äô performance were a shade more ambiguous, and the audience had a chance to at least fleetingly believe Josef might be telling the truth\\" but that \\"despite the blatancy of his character‚Äôs ulterior motives, Duplass scores a considerable impact by making the most of the aforementioned plot twists.\\" Shock Till You Drop panned the movie overall, stating that \\"Creep might work for those don't regularly digest horror films, but for the hardened fan, this is a film that spins its wheels all too often and feels like an exercise in self-indulgence.\\" Sequel Shortly after Creep's premiere at South by Southwest, Duplass announced that he intended to film a sequel and after the film distribution rights were purchased by RADiUS- TWC, he further announced that he was planning on creating a trilogy. In August 2014, Duplass further stated that he and Brice planned on filming the second Creep film at the end of the year, that the film's cast would be announced during that time, and that the trilogy would be completed in 2015. However, in February 2015, Duplass commented that neither he nor Brice had been able to start filming on Creep 2 due to scheduling issues, as the careers of both men had greatly expanded since Creep release, but that the both of them were still actively developing the project. In May 2016, Duplass and Brice announced discussions had begun on the sequel. In August 2016, Duplass revealed that he had begun trying on costumes for the film. In September 2016, it was announced production had begun on the film, with Duplass returning, and Desiree Akhavan joining the cast, with Brice returning as the director. Creep 2 premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 6, 2017, and was released through video on demand on October 24, 2017. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 7.55/10. Brice and Duplass announced plans to create a third film and in March 2020, stated that they were struggling to come up with a concept as they wanted the third film to be \\"super inspired\\".

A team is a collection of individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose. There are six different team effectiveness models including Rubin, Plovnick, and Fry's GRPI model, the Katzenbach and Smith model, the T7 model, the LaFasto and Larson model, the Hackman model and the Lencioni model. Overview The evaluation of how effective a team is, is achieved with the aid of a variety of components derived from research and theories that help in creating a description of the multifaceted nature of team effectiveness. According to Hackman (1987), team effectiveness can be defined in terms of three criteria: # Output ‚Äì The final outputs produced by the team must meet or exceed the standards set by key constituents within the organization # Social Processes ‚Äì The internal social processes operating as the team interacts should enhance, or at least maintain, the group's ability to work together in the future # Learning ‚Äì The experience of working in the team environment should act to satisfy rather than aggravate the personal needs of team members cohesion, efficacy and without group conflict (2007) In order for these criteria to be assessed appropriately, an evaluation of team effectiveness should be conducted, which involves both a measure of the teams‚Äô final task performance as well as criteria with which to assess intragroup process. The three major intragroup process constructs examined are intra-group conflict, team cohesion, and team-efficacy. Intra-group conflict is an integral part of the process a team undergoes and the effectiveness of the unit that was formed. Previous research has differentiated two components of intra-group conflict: * Relationship conflict ‚Äì This is the interpersonal incompatibilities between team members such as annoyance and animosity * Task conflict ‚Äì This occurs when members convey divergent ideas and opinions about specific aspects related to task accomplishment Team cohesion is viewed as ‚Äò‚Äòa general indicator of synergistic group interaction‚Äîor process‚Äô‚Äô. Furthermore, cohesion has been linked to greater coordination during team-tasks as well as improved satisfaction, productivity, and group interactions. Team efficacy refers to team members‚Äô perceptions of task-specific team competence. This construct is thought to create a sense of confidence within the team that enables the group to persevere when faced with hardship. According to Hackman (2002), there are also 5 conditions that research has shown to optimize the effectiveness of the team: # Real Team ‚Äì Stability in the group membership over time # Compelling Direction ‚Äì A clear purpose that relies on end goals # Enabling Structure ‚Äì The groups dynamic must be producing good, not bad # Social Support ‚Äì The group must have a system to collaborate properly # Coaching ‚Äì Opportunities for a coach to give help The Aristotle project, a multi-year initiative by Google Inc. aimed at defining the characteristics of an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each team member feeling like they have an impact. Work teams Work teams (also referred to as production and service teams) are continuing work units responsible for producing goods or providing services for the organization. Their membership is typically stable, usually full-time, and well-defined. These teams are traditionally directed by a supervisor who mandates what work is done, who does it, and in what manner is it executed. Work teams are effectively used in manufacturing sectors such as mining and apparel and service based sectors such as accounting which utilize audit teams.  Self-managed work teams  Self-managed work teams (also referred to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine how they will accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route they will take to complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process. They also select their own members and evaluate the members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety. Self- managed work teams do not always have positive results, however. These teams can be expensive to start, have the potential for the greatest conflict, and are often difficult to monitor the progress of. The move to self-managed work teams at Levi Strauss & Co. in the 1990s pitted highly skilled and efficient workers against their slower counterparts, who the faster workers did not feel were sufficiently contributing to the team. Parallel teams Parallel team solving a problem (2013) Parallel teams (also referred to as advice and involvement teams) pull together people from different work units or jobs to perform functions that the regular organization is not equipped to perform well. These teams are given limited authority and can only make recommendations to individuals higher in the organizational hierarchy. Parallel teams are used for solving problems and activities that are in need of revision or improvement. Examples of parallel teams are quality circles, task forces, quality improvement teams, employee involvement groups. The effectiveness of parallel teams is proven by the continuation of their usage and expansion throughout organizations due to their ability to improve quality and increase employee involvement. Project teams Project teams (also referred to as development teams) produce new products and services for an organization or institution on a one-time or limited basis, of which the copyrights of that new product or service will belong to the establishment that it was made for once it is completed. The task of these teams may vary from just improving a current project, concept or plan to creating an entirely new projects with very few limitations. Projects teams rely on their members being knowledgeable and well versed in many disciplines and functions, as this allows them to complete the task effectively. Once a project is completed, the team either disbands and are individually moved to other special functions or moves on to other projects and tasks that they as a unit can accomplish or develop. A common example of project teams are cross-functional teams. A project team's effectiveness is associated with the speed with which they are able to create and develop new products and services which reduces time spent on individual projects. Management teams Management teams (also referred to as action and negotiation teams) are responsible for the coordination and direction of a division within an institution or organization during various assigned projects and functional, operational and/or strategic tasks and initiatives. Management teams are responsible for the total performance of the division they oversee with regards to day-to-day operations, delegation of tasks and the supervision of employees. The authority of these teams are based on the members position on the company's or institution's organizational chart. These management teams are constructed of managers from different divisions (e.g. Vice President of Marketing, Assistant Director of Operations). An example of management teams are executive management teams, which consists of members at the top of the organization's hierarchy, such as chief executive officer, board of directors, board of trustees, etc., who establish the strategic initiatives that a company will undertake over a long term period (~ 3‚Äì5 years). Management teams have been effective by using their expertise to aid companies in adjusting to the current landscape of a global economy, which helps them compete with their rivals in their respective markets, produce unique initiatives that sets them apart from their rivals and empower the employees who are responsible for the success of the organization or institution.

Life Illingworth was the third son of William Illingworth, a tradesman in Nottingham; Cayley Illingworth was an elder brother. After attending Nottingham Grammar School and Manchester Grammar School, he was articled to a Nottingham attorney named Story. By 1788 Illingworth had established himself in practice in London as an attorney of the King's Bench. His skill in deciphering manuscripts led to his being appointed 1800 a sub- commissioner on the Royal Commission on Public Records. His character impeded his later promotion. Illingworth was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1805. He made a general arrangement of the public records held in the chapter house of Westminster Abbey, and in 1808 drew up a press catalogue of their contents. He went with Thomas Edlyne Tomlins to cathedrals in England and Ireland to search for original statutes; and he also inspected the state of the records in Ireland. In about 1805 he was chosen deputy-keeper of the records in the Tower of London under Samuel Lysons. When Henry Petrie succeeded Lysons as keeper in August 1819, he refused to continue Illingworth's employment as deputy-keeper, offering him instead a post as a clerk: Illingworth objected and resigned. Working as a record agent and translator, Illingworth entered Gray's Inn on 25 June 1825, but was not called to the bar. He had hopes of becoming a sub-commissioner to the sixth Record Commission, and in May 1831 drew up a set of Observations on the Public Records of the Four Courts at Westminster, and on the measures recommended by the Committee of the House of Commons in 1800 for rendering them more accessible to the public, for the private use of the commissioners: fifty copies were printed by the board. He advised the secretary, Charles Purton Cooper, but was not appointed; and Cooper made use of Illingworth's notes without acknowledgement. In the case of Roe v Brenton, Illingworth produced from the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's office an extent of the assessionable manors of the Duchy of Cornwall in the reign of Edward II; and in the case of the Mayor and Corporation of Bristol against Bush he brought forward rolls of the reign of Henry VI, which established the rights of the Corporation of Bristol to all the tolls on shipping coming in and out of the port. He gave evidence to the second committee of the House of Commons regarding the record commissioners on 2 March 1836. Later years and death Before his death Illingworth became blind and fell into poverty; and a subscription was made for him by the Incorporated Law Society. He died at 13 Brooksby Street, South Islington, London, on 21 February 1845. Publications In 1800 Illingworth published an Inquiry into the Laws, Antient and Modern, respecting Forestalling, Regrating, and Ingrossing. He transcribed and collated the Statutes of the Realm from Magna Carta to nearly the end of the reign of Henry VIII; transcribed and printed the Quo Warranto Pleadings (Record Commission, 1818) and the Hundred Rolls (Record Commission, 1812‚Äì18), and wrote the preface and compiled in Latin the subject index to the Abbreviatio Placitorum (Record Commission, 1811). With John Caley he edited the Testa de Nevill (Record Commission, 1807), and he assisted in the preparation of the first volume of the Rotuli Scotiae (Record Commission, 1814). Illingworth's Index Cartarum de Scotia from the chapter house was privately printed in folio by Sir Thomas Phillipps at Middle Hill about 1840.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History Archibald and Carl Newton (descendants of Sir Isaac Newton) purchased the island of Saint Helena, near the Straits of Mackinac, in 1853. The brothers (married to sisters of Chippewa descent) developed the island into a fuel and supply stop for passenger and cargo ships traveling through the straits. The venture proved successful, and they used the profits to establish commercial interests in Cheboygan. In 1870, Archibald Newton was elected village president. In 1871, Archibald Newton (a widower) constructed this house as a wedding present for his second wife, Cornelia Allaire. Archibald Newton died in 1892, and Cornelia in 1916. Cornelia willed the house to her brother, Joseph Allaire Jr., who moved in that year. The house remained in the Allaire family for 127 years. In 2013, the home reverted into the Newton side of the family when the home was purchased by the great-great grandson of A.P. Newton. Description The house is a two-story red brick Italianate structure with a hip roof. The symmetrical facade is three bays wide, and includes rounded arch windows with brick lintels and keystones above. Carved bracketry supports the wide eaves. At the peak of the roof sits a cupola (or belvedere) with its own rounded arch windows and hip roof supported at the eavesline with bracketry. A wide porch wraps around the first floor of the house. A projecting side-wall houses a bay window and entryway. A modern gable-roof garage is connected to the rear of the house. Multiple ghost sightings have been reported at the home by the Allaire family and residents of Cheboygan. Several incidents involve flickering lights, rooms that become ice cold, and objects that mysteriously move on their own.

Daughter of Yoga Guru, Bijoylaxmi Hota and former bureaucrat Purna Chandra Hota, Reela was exposed to dance, yoga & ashram life since childhood. Having trained under the 3 doyens of Odissi dance, Guru Gangadhar Pradhan, Srimati Madhavi Mudgal and Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, she inculcated perfect rhythm, sophistication, grace and presentation skills. A trend setter, Reela Hota pioneered in making Indian spiritual philosophy such as Yoga, Kundalini and Sanskrit the theme of her performances and is credited for adding a new dimension to Odissi Dance - the spiritual aspect.  Background  Reela is the youngest daughter of the Sri Purna Chandra Hota, IAS and Bijoylaxmi Hota. Purna Hota was the topper of the 1962-batch Civil-Services and went on to be the Chairman UPSC. Bijoylaxmi Hota is a great yoga teacher and has written eight books on the subject 'Yoga and Food'. She has an elder sister Reema Singh, IRS and an elder brother Prasenjeet Hota. Career She started training early at the age of eight under Guru Gangadhar Pradhan. She went on to advance her dancing skills under the able guidance of Gurvi Madhavi Mudgal and the legendary Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra. A trend setter, her association with the great spiritual master, Paramahamsa Swami Satyananda Saraswati, inspired Reela to make Indian spiritual philosophy the theme of her performances. Reela Hota, founded the Rays of Wisdom Society, an organization dedicated to highlighting how music, dance and vital therapeutic practices in traditional systems of healing can combine to meet lifestyle challenges of today. A grade artist, she has been awarded the Sanatan Nritya Puraskar for her outstanding contribution to Indian Arts. Reela is based out of New Delhi, India. =Dance Fusion= She diversified her range of productions by fusing Odissi with several other classical dance forms of India namely Manipuri, Kathak, Bharatnatyam and Chhau. One such masterpiece creation is Rabindra Abhivyakti, a unique fusion production based on the poetry of great Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, which brings out the \\"explain the spiritual and yogic significance of his poems through different art forms\\". In 2013 Reela achieved another milestone in her career to create a unique dance fusion on the healing aspect of Sanskrit when she collaborated with Ballet dancers from Bucharest National Opera House in what is the first-time-ever \\"amalgamation of Western classical and Odissi\\". Sometimes a talk from a leading expert in the field precedes the dance performance to enable a better appreciation of the work. In the second day of the International Ancient Arts Festival, 2013, a talk on \\"Psychodrama as a Living Process\\" by Psychodrama Institute of Melbourne director Sue Daniel preceded the events for the day. In 2014, Reela worked with Broadway current sensation, Jason Macdonald to create an Unusual and exotic synergy of Dance, Music and Drama on symbolism of seven chakras. Fusion with Italian Opera Reela produced and starred in the first ever Opera \\"Ramleela in Opera\\". Ramleela in Opera art form saw 100 artists from 5 countries: Italy, France, Hungary, USA and India, working hard to put the spotlight at the confluence of culture and ideas. Written by Reela's mother, Yoga Guru Bijoylaxmi Hota, the story of Ramleela in opera art form started with Lord Rama's marriage to Sita, followed by the banishment of the trio (Ram, Laxman and Sita) from Ayodhya and Sita's abduction. The opera continued with Hanuman from Kishkindha visiting Lanka, clearing the path for Lord Rama to battle it out with Ravana. It finally ended with the famous trio returning to Ayodhya followed by celebrations. Directed by Maestro Marco Pucci Catena, Ramleela in Opera, was performed to a live orchestra of 45 Indian & Western elements, conducted by Maestro Fabrizio Da Ros. The spectacle had Mattia Oliviere(Baritone), Raffaele Abette( Tenor ) and Federico Benitti( Bass) play Lord Rama, Prince Lakshman and Shri Hanuman respectively while Reela essayed the role of Sita. The Operatic score was written by the contemporary composer Maestro Antonio Cocomazzi[11] who remarked \\"It's a wonderful idea that two worlds that are so far apart both geographically and culturally unite through the Ramayana\\". =Organization= She has organized the International Ancient Arts, a unique festival-cum- symposium in collaboration with Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). These are like long-weekend festivals and include events ranging from Ramlila, classical dances, Qawwali, foreign dances, fusions and even puppetry and folk dances. The International Ancient Arts Festival of 2012, organised by Reela Hota was a two-day gala affair where Aruna Broota, a Delhi-based clinical psychologist, had some hard-hitting points to make about the social perceptions regarding the arts and Vivien Marcow Speiser, a dance therapist and professor at Lesley University expounded on the idea of 'the body as a sacred instrument'. This time the fusion was very strong with international collaborative music performance, featuring Wang Fei from China on the Geqin, Bahman Panahi from Iran on the Tar and Ustad Johar Ali from India on the violin with Reela giving a magnificent Odissi performance. In 2013, the International Ancient Arts focused on the therapeutic benefits of music and dance through ancient languages, in particular Sanskrit. The highlight of the festival was \\"Sanskrit: the Mantra Bhasha\\" where Reela danced with ballet dancers from Bucharest National Opera House to Hindustani classical music and Western classical symphonies. =Television= She is the youngest celebrity and only Odissi dancer to be featured in by Doordarshan Bharati on the Program: ‚ÄòWhat Celebrities Say‚Äô with stalwarts such as Padma Bhushan Dr. Raja Reddy, Pandit Birju Maharaj and Padma Bhushan Pandit Debu Chaudhari. She was interviewed on Doordarshan. She produced and performed in a fusion dance for Colors of India series of the Rajya Sabha TV with artists Bogdan Canila, Christina Dijmaru, Lipsa Das, and others. Previously, she had also performed for the Lok Sabha TV series \\"State of Culture\\". Community Development Since 2008, Reela teaches dance to the local community of Rikhia, Jharkhand, as her 'sewa' or selfless service. Notable performances Reela Hota has performed in many prestigious Indian dance festivals. A few of the notable performances are listed below. # Kartik Poornima, Eternal Mewar Festival # November, 1998 - The Story of Shiva, Sri Ram Center of Art and Culture, New Delhi Major achievements * She is the youngest celebrity and only Odissi dancer to be featured in by Doordarshan Bharati on the Program: ‚ÄòWhat Celebrities Say‚Äô with stalwarts such as Padma Bhushan Dr. Raja Reddy, Pandit Birju Maharaj and Padma Bhsushan Pandit Debu Chaudhari * She is the youngest performer and Artistic director for International BRICS, CAPAM and CVC Conference by Government of India * She was sponsored by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in 2006 to visit five countries for the promotion of Indian dance and culture: Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa Awards # Sanatan Nritya Puraskar by Sanatan Sangeet Sanskriti (2007) by Rai Foundation for Outstanding Contribution to Indian Arts # Utsav Nritya Ratna by Uthsav Music, Chennai (2012) for Outstanding Contribution to Indian # Art & Culture appreciation Award ( 2018) by PHD Chamber of Commerce & Industry # Atal Bihari Vyajpayee Award for Art and Culture ( 2018) Asian Academy of Arts and International Chamber of Media Industries References Category:Indian female classical dancers Category:Performers of Indian classical dance Category:Odissi dancers Category:Women educators from Odisha Category:Educators from Odisha Category:20th-century Indian dancers Category:People from Balasore district Category:Indian women choreographers Category:Indian choreographers Category:Dancers from Odisha Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century Indian women artists Category:Women artists from Odisha ","title":"Reela Hota"},{"id":"42233959","text":"Tara Jayne Andrews (born 13 March 1994) is an Australian association football player, who plays for Newcastle Jets in the Australian W-League.

Biography Jonsson was born outside Eksj√∂ in J√∂nk√∂ping County, Sweden. Little is known of his early years or education. Lars Str√∂mb√§ck assumes in his short biography that as a boy he was apprenticed to a local builder. Lars Str√∂mb√§ck, \\"Jonas Jonsson, en modern storbyggm√§stare\\" , Brukskultur √Ötvidaberg, 2002. Date retrieved: 17 March 2014. Records from 1826 mention Jonsson as foreman (\\"verkm√§stare) at the building of the empire style church at Lofta on √ñland which was designed by the prominent architect Axel Nystr√∂m (1793‚Äì1868). Johnson was to collaborate for many years with Nystr√∂m, and had by 1836 progressed to being in full charge of the building of Nystr√∂m's church in Utna. In the late 1830s he was commissioned to construct Brunkebergs hotell in central Stockholm. The hotel which was erected between 1837‚Äì1841 was designed by Nystr√∂m and remained in operation until 1969. Jonsson was prodigiously productive throughout his career. This took place at a time when the Empire style was popular throughout Europe; particular so in Sweden where it had been introduced by King Karl Johan of Sweden (former Marshal of France General Bernadotte), where it was named the \\"Karl Johan Empire style\\". The style remained popular in Scandinavia throughout the nineteenth century. This fashion was sustained by France paying some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes rather than in currency. The buildings Jonas Jonsson supervised were often designed by prominent architects including Nystr√∂m as well as J√∂ran Folke Oppman and his son Folke Birger Oppman (1818-1876). These were financed by parishes, or rural nobility and gentry as well as the Swedish state. His influence on building practices at Tjust in Sm√•land was such that the characteristic Tjust empire style (Tjustempiren) was sometimes referred to as the \\"Jonsson empire style\\". He also gradually acquired some architectural skills, and was himself behind the design of a number of buildings including Link√∂ping Savings Bank (Link√∂pings Sparbank) and Ljungstedtska school (Ljungstedtska skolan). The rapid growth of shipping in the mid-19th century led to a need for more lighthouses along the Swedish coasts, and Jonsson was responsible for many new or refurbished lighthouses during the 1840s: Vinga, Kullen, L√•nge Erik, F√•r√∂ and Landsort. He was so successful as a lighthouse-builder that he was eventually offered such jobs without the standard tender procedure for government-financed buildings. However, there are also records of complaints from both workers and government inspectors, giving a picture of an unyielding man. Personal life Jonsson married Fanny Sundstr√∂m in 1842 and they had four children. In 1852, he moved with his family to Link√∂ping, which became the center of his construction activities over the next 20 years. Str√∂mb√§ck describes Jonsson as an example of social mobility: from humble rural beginnings, he became a wealthy citizen of the thriving city of Link√∂ping, owner of several houses and member of the city council.

Biography Patrick Allan was born in Arbroath in 1813, a son of weaving merchant Robert Allan. He began training as a solicitor but was then indentured in his grandfather's house-painting business, and was encouraged to study at the Trustees' Academy at the end of his apprenticeship. There he met Robert Scott Lauder and accompanied him to Rome in the mid-1830s. The Lauders returned to Scotland in 1838 but Fraser settled for a time in Paris, painting views of the city. He was back in Arbroath by 1839, but then settled in London.Patrick Allan Fraser in the Dictionary of Scottish Architects Hospitalfield House, Arbroath Allan returned to Arbroath in 1842 on the invitation of the Edinburgh publisher Cadell, who wanted him to illustrate a new edition of Walter Scott's The Antiquary; however, the edition was never published. In 1843, Allan married heiress Elizabeth Fraser and took her name. Together they remodelled Hospitalfield House; the scheme used mainly local craftsmen and converted an eighteenth-century barn into a gallery, added a five-storey bartizan and a large wing. In 1856 the Frasers began the renovation of the Blackcraig Castle estate in Strathardle. Patrick became an architect and supervised the renovation himself. He commissioned portraits of members of The Clique group of English artists for Hospitalfield. After his wife's death in 1873, he built a mausoleum in her name, the Fraser Mortuary Chapel in Western Cemetery, Arbroath. The Mortuary Chapel has been a Category A listed building since 1997. In 1873, he moved to Rome and was elected president of the British Academy of Arts in Rome. He died, childless, on 17 September 1890. He endowed the Patrick Allan-Fraser of Hospitalfield Trust to establish Hospitalfield House as an art college \\"for the assistance and encouragement of young men not having means of their own who shall be desirous of following up one or more of the professions of painting, sculpture, carving in wood, architecture and engraving.\\" The Fraser Mortuary Chapel in Arbroath that he built for his wife Style Fraser's architectural style was described in his lecture \\"Architecture With Special Reference to Local Buildings\\", which was published in The Building Chronicle issue of May 1854 as \\"Amateur Criticism of Architectural Works\\". He put great stress on building economically and morally, notions that were expounded in his 1861 work An Unpopular View of Our Times.

It commonly refers to 96 or 192 kHz sample rates. However, there also exist 44.1 kHz/24-bit, 48 kHz/24-bit and 88.2 kHz/24-bit recordings that are labeled HD Audio. Research into high resolution audio began in the late 1980s and high resolution audio content started to become available on the consumer market in 1996. Definitions Approximate dynamic range and bandwidths of some high-resolution audio formats High-resolution audio is generally used to refer to music files that have a higher sampling frequency and/or bit depth than that of Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA), which operates at 44.1 kHz/16-bit. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in cooperation with the Consumer Electronics Association, DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group, and The Recording Academy Producers & Engineers Wing, formulated the following definition of high-resolution audio in 2014: \\"lossless audio capable of reproducing the full spectrum of sound from recordings which have been mastered from better than CD quality (48 kHz/20-bit or higher) music sources which represent what the artists, producers and engineers originally intended.\\" File formats capable of storing high- resolution audio include FLAC, ALAC, WAV, AIFF and DSD, the format used by Super Audio Compact Discs (SACD). History link=Super Audio CD link=DVD- Audio One of the first attempts to market high-resolution audio was High Definition Compatible Digital in 1995. This was followed by three more optical disc formats claiming sonic superiority over CD-DA: DAD in 1998, SACD in 1999, and DVD-Audio in 2000. Following a format war, none of these achieved widespread adoption. Following the rise in online music retailing at the start of the 21st century, high-resolution audio downloads were introduced by HDtracks starting in 2008. link=Blu-ray Further attempts to market high- resolution audio on optical disc followed with Pure Audio Blu-ray in 2009, and High Fidelity Pure Audio in 2013. Competition in online high-resolution audio retail stepped-up in 2014 with the announcement of Neil Young's Pono service. In 2014 the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) announced a specification and accompanying \\"Hi-Res AUDIO\\" logo for consumer audio products. Sony reaffirmed its commitment towards the development in the high-resolution audio segment by offering a slew of Hi-Res Audio products. Controversy Whether there is any benefit to high- resolution audio over CD-DA is controversial, with some sources claiming sonic superiority: * \\"The DSD process used for producing SACDs captures more of the nuances from a performance and reproduces them with a clarity and transparency not possible with CD.‚ÄîThe Mariinsky record label of the Mariinsky Ballet (formerly Kirov Ballet), St. Petersburg, Russia, that sells Super Audio CDs (SACDs) * \\"the main claimed benefit of high-resolution audio files is superior sound quality [...] 24-bit/96 kHz or 24-bit/192 kHz files should, therefore, more closely replicate the sound quality that the musicians and engineers were working with in the studio.\\"‚ÄîWhat Hi-Fi? * \\"...music professionals with access to first generation data have widely reported subjectively better sound, and a meta-analysis of previously published listening tests comparing high resolution to CD found a clear, though small, audible difference that significantly increased when the listening tests included standard training (i.e., with experience in listening).\\"‚ÄîJournal of the Audio Engineering Society, Volume 67, Issue 5 ...and with other opinions ranging from skeptical to highly critical: * \\"If they [the music business] cared about sound quality in the first place, they would make all of the releases sound great in every format they sell: MP3, FLAC, CD, iTunes, or LP.\\"‚Äîcnet * \\"Impractical overkill that nobody can afford\\"‚ÄîGizmodo * \\"A solution to a problem that doesn't exist, a business model based on willful ignorance and scamming people.\\"‚ÄîXiph.org Business magazine Bloomberg Businessweek suggests that caution is in order with regard to high-resolution audio: \\"There is reason to be wary, given consumer electronics companies' history of pushing advancements whose main virtue is to require everyone to buy new gadgets.\\" High-resolution files that are downloaded from niche websites that cater to audiophile listeners often include different mastering in the release thus many comparisons of CD to these releases are evaluating differences in mastering, rather than bit depth. Most early papers using blind listening tests concluded that differences are not audible by the sample of listeners taking the test. Blind tests have shown that musicians and composers are unable to distinguish higher resolutions from 16-bit audio at 48 kHz.

Attestation Khui is not known from historical sources and the only certain attestation of his existence is a fragmentary relief on a stone block showing his cartouche which was published in 1912 by the Egyptologist Ahmed Bey Kamal and later republished by Raymond Weill. The block was excavated from a mastaba tomb of the necropolis of Dara near Manfalut. This necropolis is dominated by a massive funerary structure which was hastily attributed to this obscure king (the so-called Pyramid of Khui), assuming that the block came from its almost disappeared mortuary temple.Mark Lehner, The Complete Pyramids, Thames & Hudson, , p. 164Egyptian History Dyn. 6-11 Pharaoh or nomarch Based on the cartouche surrounding Khui's name on the relief from Dara, Egyptologists including J√ºrgen von Beckerath have proposed that he was a king of the early First Intermediate Period, belonging to the Eighth Dynasty. On the other hand, Egyptologists Barry Kemp and Toby Wilkinson believe it more likely that Khui was a nomarch, that is a provincial governor, who took advantage of the power vacuum following the collapse of the Old Kingdom and proclaimed himself king, in the same way as the coeval and neighboring Heracleopolite founders of the 9th Dynasty.Barry Kemp, Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization, 2nd ed., New York, Routledge, 2006, pp. 338-339.Toby Wilkinson, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt, New York, Random House, 2010, p. 123.

The idea states that managers need to look beyond revenues to see the shape of their industry's profit pool. Strategies can then be created which result in profitable growth. While the concept is simple, the structure of Profit Pools can usually be quite complex. Some segments of the value chain will have deeper pools than the others. The depths may also vary within an individual segment. For example, the profitability of a segment may vary widely by customer group, product category, geographic market, and distribution channel. The pattern of profit concentration in an industry will often differ from the pattern of revenue concentration. The model is often applied to identify new sources of profit, to rethink the role of a company in the value chain, refocusing a company on its traditional sources of profit, and also applied when making product, pricing and operational decisions.

Life His father Richard Inett married into the Hungerford family of Down Ampney, Gloucestershire. He attended Bewdley grammar school, and then aged 14 went to University College, Oxford, in 1661. He matriculated there on 17 July 1663, graduating B.A. in 1666 and M.A. in 1669. He was ordained deacon by William Nicholson, the Bishop of Gloucester on 22 September 1667, aged 20. Inett was presented to the rectory of St Ebbe's Church, Oxford, where he made the acquaintance of Thomas Barlow, who recommended him to Sir Richard Newdigate, 1st Baronet. Newdigate had him presented by the Crown to the vicarage of Nuneaton, Warwickshire, in 1678, and Inett acted as Newdigate's chaplain at Arbury Hall, Warwickshire. In February 1681 (N.S.) Bishop Barlow appointed Inett precentor of Lincoln Cathedral. In 1685 he was presented by the dean and chapter to the living of Tansor in Northamptonshire. In 1700 Inett was appointed chaplain in ordinary to William III. He was incorporated member of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1701, and took the degree of D.D. in that university, to which he sent two of his sons. In 1706 he resigned the living of Tansor in favour of his son Richard, and took instead that of Clayworth, Nottinghamshire. In 1714 he was presented by the crown to the living of St Mary's Church, Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Inett died in 1717, and a tablet was erected by his widow to his memory in Lincoln Cathedral. Works On 1 August 1680 Inett preached an assize sermon at Warwick, which was published. It took a shrewd political line. In 1688 Inett published a short book of devotions, Guide to the Devout Christian, to which he added a second part in 1692, Guide to Repentance. These books were popular; in 1764 were issued the sixteenth edition of the former and the tenth edition of the latter. Inett's major work was his book Origines Anglican√¶, of which the first volume was published in London in 1704. His object in writing was to fill the gap between two substantial histories, Edward Stillingfleet's Origines Britannic√¶ and Gilbert Burnet's History of the Reformation. He took advice from White Kennett, and the first volume was well received if inaccurate; when the second volume was ready he made over the copyright to the Oxford University Press, who brought it out in 1710. The two volumes covered the history of the English church from 401 to 1216. It had a vogue in its own time, and was republished, edited by John Griffiths, Oxford, 1855; but was shortly superseded by Jeremy Collier's Ecclesiastical History. Browne Willis used Inett's collections for his Survey of Lincoln Cathedral. Family In 1680, Inett married Mary, daughter of the Rev. Richard Harrison, chancellor of Lichfield Cathedral, at Arbury.

It was built in the late 11th century. It retains about half of the total volume, and was recovered in the early 21st century in a performance that received the award given by the organization Europa Nostra in 2010. History Few places take name and surname as Vitoria-Gasteiz. The walled medieval enclosure of the city was constructed at the end of the 11th century, a century before the foundation of the city for King Sancho IV of Navarre in 1881 under the name of New Victory. By then it was a walled town which represented a defensive outpost of the kingdom of Navarre. The name Vitoria is the village that was located on the hill. Vitoria has historically enjoyed a strategic position because it is on the shortest route between the Castilian plateau and northern Europe. Throughout its history it has always had a strong commercial aspect. Historians have found that in the 13th century three weekly markets were held and after 1399, two annual fairs gathered many visitors. During the last centuries, it remained hidden among the buildings of the old town. In 2001, a team of archaeological researchers from the University of the Basque Country conducted archaeological excavations in the basement of the Cathedral of Santa Maria and the remains of the foundations of the old wall were discovered. After analyzing the remains it was found that the foundations correspond to the first wall that surrounded the town but were older than the founding of the city. This would denote a certain economic power and social leadership, unknown to this day who could be your drivers or they defended using many resources for this. Rehabilitation Though the walled enclosure had a total length of approximately 900 meters and had approximately 22 towers, now only half remains. After the discovery realized in the excavations of the cathedral it was decided to carry out a restoration of the remains of the wall that were remaining in the hillside west. Canton pulmonias * First stage: in 2006 was uncovered the section that corresponds to the rear of numbers 98 to 104 Street Raid. They were discovered about 136 meters from the ancient walls and remains of slaughterhouse and 19th-century market. * Second stage: was released in 2010 and offers the chance to see 160 meters in the rear wall of San Miguel through a wooden lattice that mimics the shape of the wall that is not preserved. * Third stage: is between the first two phases and is still to be adapted. Visit the wall Through the Cathedral of Santa Maria Foundation can arrange guided tours that take tourists through the two reclaimed areas. They can be observed from the misguided restorations carried out in the style of the time in the 1960s, through the different construction types, the most modern lattice cedar that recreates the dimensions of the wall at its best. The itinerary, across a walk landscaped of 3,000 square meters, allows to cross part of the defensive wall and to contemplate from a system of walkways to the 136 meters of wall bounded by two large towers. The wall reaches its highest point at 11 meters and the towers rising up to 15 meters. The wall is not preserved exactly as it was in the 11th century, because throughout the ages have been adding other elements. The gateway through which visitors can return to the 11th century runs around the perimeter of the passage round and sound, through a ramp to a lookout placed on the abutment attached to the Palace of Escoriaza Esquivel.

He died in Vitoria on 11 February 1818. Olaguibel was one of the most important neoclassic architects in the Basque Country. The architect studied in the Image School in Vitoria and in Royal San Fernando Academy of Madrid (in Spanish Academia Real San Fernando). He designed many landmarks of Vitoria, such as Los Arquillos or the Plaza Espa√±a of Vitoria. He also designed two roads: the one which connected Vitoria with La Guardia and the road that connected Bri√±as and Amurrio, in 1792 and in 1793.  Biography  = Early life = The Olaguibel family was originally from Durango. However, in the XVIII the family was already located in Vitoria and it was related to the field of construction. Justo Antonio's father, who was a master builder, took a lot of care of his son's career, so he signed his son up at an early age in the Drawing School of Vitoria, which was dependent of the Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del Pa√≠s. The father's aim was his son to be educated following the academic methods of that period. As a student, Olaguibel stood out among the other pupils, due to his fast learning. This fact encouraged Olaguibel to apply for a place in the Royal San Fernando Academy of Fine Art, in Madrid, in order to improve his studies in architecture and to achieve the qualification he needed. = Beginning as an architect = In 1781, once he was in Vitoria again, Olaguibel was offered to design the Plaza Espa√±a, the first neoclassic square, which was a model when building the ones in Tudela, San Sebastian and Bilbao. This square became the centre of urban activity of Vitoria. Nevertheless, the square was not yet connected to the ancient part of the city, because of the slope between them. Therefore, Olaguibel designed Los Arquillos in 1790, which was a solution to the problem, as it connected the square with the old part of Vitoria harmoniously. Between the two parts are balconies and platforms connected by stairs. The purpose of the architect was to join the old and new parts of Vitoria in a fluent way. These two works made Olaguibel famous, not only because of adding the first neoclassic buildings to Vitoria, but also to the Basque Country. = Religious architecture = After having creating these two works and specially after 1794, Olaguibel directed his career towards religious creations such as arcades, towers and other smaller constructions, which took part in many villages in the prairie of Alava. His career seemed to be prospering, but this change in the architect's mind made other architects from Vitoria and from other cities to take part in the construction of buildings in the city. Justo Antonio de Olaguibel never had a government job, despite the high social class of his job. However, he was related to some personalities of the epoch, such as Samaniego. Olaguibel spent most of his effort building the facade of the Magdalena Convent (Spanish: Convento de Magdalena) in 1783. The convent was located where the New Cathedral of Vitoria is now sited. Nevertheless, they managed not to demolish the building and the facade was transferred to Vicente Goikoetxea street. Fausto I√±iguez de Betolaza was the one in charge of the move. = Last years of life = In 1789 the architect built the San Andr√©s church in Elciego, showing his perfect architecture and how expert he was in his job.

The Great Sequoia was an individual sequoia tree located in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the capital city of the Basque Country, and was a symbol of the city because of its enormous dimensions. It was declared as an individual tree by Decree 265, on 16 May 1995, and died in 2014. Location and measurements The tree measured 40 meters of height, 8 meters of perimeter of trunk and 16 meters of crown. It was located in the back court of a public building at Magdalena street N¬∫12, close to Urkide's college and 200 meters from the Florida. It was the oldest living being of Vitoria-Gasteiz until 2014, having been planted in 1860 by D. Juan Ibarrondo. It was one of the \\"Colossuses of Vitoria\\". Endangerment and protection Sequoia's Big Trunk. The monumental sequoia of Vitoria-Gasteiz is surrounded by walls and buildings, bordering the court of the college. The Building work of the nearby block of housings damaged its roots, and deprived the tree of light. At one point, it was to be felled because its dimensions were perceived as a nuisance, but the Town Hall ruled that the large sequoia was not to be cut down. Because it was close to a school, some children's games contributed to trampling the soil. As consequence, the leaves started yellowing and the sequoia's condition started to become worrisome because some of the sequoias located on the Campillo de Deleitosa had been disappearing during the last years. Subsequently, actions tending to protect the tree and to create a suitable environment for it began. The initial project was modified attending to the suggestions of the Deputation, competent in the management of the singular trees in Alava. A few platforms of wood supported on the soil were built to help aerate the soil, preventing visitors from walking through it. The rest of the space, most of the garden, was covered by plant remains to further prevent walking upon the soil.

Encyclop√©die compl√®te. 1885 √† nos jours. Etymology Initially the cars used six-cylinder engines, hence the word \\"Six\\" in the company name. History Jules Daubeck founded the business in Pantin in north-eastern Paris in 1922. Later, in 1925, the business relocated to the west side of the city, to premises at Boulogne-Billancourt in the Rue de Silly. Production ended in 1930. The cars were designed by Maurice Gadoux, who previously had worked for Hispano-Suiza, and focused on the same \\"compact luxury\\" market segment. Approximately 50 cars were produced annually. Cars The first model used a 1996cc overhead camshaft engine that placed it in the 12 HP car tax band and produced a claimed 50 hp of power. Claimed top speed for an open topped sports-bodied car was 120 km/h (75 mph). There was a choice of or wheelbases. Available body styles included a \\"Touring car\\", a \\"Limousine\\" (sedan/saloon) and \\"Coup√© de Ville\\" (town car). For 1924 Solex carburettors were fitted, power increased to 55 hp, and four speed transmission replaced the three speeds with which it had been launched. At the 19th Paris Motor Show in October 1924 the 1996cc overhead camshaft engine had twin carburetors and the wheelbase was increased to . It was priced, in bare chassis form, at 60,000 francs. A larger 2660cc engine was available in 1926, and was exhibited alongside the 1996cc model in October 1926 at the 20th Paris Motor Show.There was no Paris Motor Show in 1925, the venue being used instead for an Exhibition of Decorative Arts. In October 1926 the list prices for the base chassis were 65,000 francs (1996cc) and 70,000 francs (2660cc). At the 22nd Paris Motor Show in October 1928 the six cylinder cars were still on display, using the chassis and now priced, in bare chassis form, at 80,000 francs (1996cc) and 85,000 francs (2660cc). There was also a 3-litre 6-cylinder \\"competition\\" engine that used twin \\"Cozette\\" carburetors and for which 150 hp was claimed. In 1929 the 6-cylinder range was supplemented by two new 8-cylinder engined cars with displacement respectively of 3-litres and 4-litres (17CV and 24CV). The 8-cylinder cars had a wheelbase and were priced at 115,000 francs and 120,000 francs.

It is a shrub with glabrous green leaves, small sepals and purple or lilac-coloured petals and it occurs in arid and semi-arid areas of Western Australia and South Australia. Description Eremophila weldii is sometimes an open, erect shrub which grows to a height of and sometimes a compact, prostrate shrub to high and wide. Its branches are glabrous, yellowish-green to green in colour but often with a purplish tinge near the ends but light brown in the older, woody parts. The leaves are arranged alternately, sometimes scattered, others clustered near the ends of the branches. They are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, tapering towards the base, mostly long, wide, mostly glabrous except at the base, green or light green with a purplish tinge. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on smooth stalks long. There are 5 overlapping egg-shaped to lance-shaped sepals which sometimes have a purplish tinge and are long and hairy on the inner surface. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is lilac-coloured to purple, often whitish on the lower surface. The petal tube and lobes are mostly glabrous except that the lower petal lobe and the inside of the tube are covered with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are enclosed in the petal tube although 2 may be the same length as it. Flowering occurs from March to December after rain and is followed by fruit which are oval-shaped to cone-shaped with a pointed end, long with a hairy, wrinkled surface. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1870 by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in the seventh volume of his Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. Mueller's description was based on specimens collected from Eucla and Point Dover by John Forrest. The specific epithet weldii honours Frederick Aloysius Weld, then Governor of Western Australia. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in the Nullarbor, Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island botanical regions of South Australia where it is widespread on calcareous soils and red-brown earths. In Western Australia it grows on the Nullarbor Plain east of Balladonia in the Coolgardie, Hampton, Mallee, Murchison and Nullarbor biogeographic regions. Conservation Eremophila weldii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This is one of the hardiest eremophilas and is well suited to a low maintenance garden. It is easy to strike from cuttings which can be taken at any time of the year. The shrub grows in a wide range of soils, including heavy clay, rarely requires watering, even during a long dry spell and is very frost tolerant.

The robust, woody liana or small tree is armed with strong spines on the main stem and branches. It occurs sparsely or commonly in forest, bush, riparian fringes and in wooded ravines. It is sometimes employed as a bonsai subject, and it can be propagated from either seed or cuttings. Range It occurs widely in coastal, montane or riparian forests of southern Tanzania, Mozambique, Eswatini and eastern South Africa. In South Africa it is present in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces. The Hluhluwe River is named after this species, due to its prevalence on the banks of the river. The species is virtually confined to White‚Äôs Tongaland-Pondoland centre of endemism. Description Their thick (up to 15 cm) and 10 to 30 m long ropes have sturdy, sideways-directed spines which may grow in clusters, and encircle the stems. The spines which are up to 10 cm long, hook onto adjacent vegetation to direct the plant towards the canopy. The bark is dark greyish brown. The alternate leaves are up to 8 cm long, finely compound and are bluish green on their upper surfaces. The 21 to 41 oblong leaflets (i.e. 10 to 20 pairs plus terminal) have a sub-opposite or alternate arrangement. The leaflets close in overcast weather, and the foliage is popular with browsing animals. Draped over a forest tree Their very small, sweetly scented flowers are creamy-white in colour. They appear in early summer, and are born in dense terminal or axillary clusters. The small and thin seed pods measure about 5 by 2 cm. They are papery in texture and lemon-yellow to pale brown in colour. The indehiscent fruit which hold 1 to 3 seeds each, are often produced in profusion. They appear in clusters on horizontal branch tips, from late summer. Similar species The Zebra-wood is also armed and has an overlapping range, but its leaflets are fewer (7 to 13) and larger, while its flowers vary from white to pink. Other Dalbergia species of the region have hairy pods, or velvety undersides to the leaflets. The Thorny elm has simple leaves.

In a speech at a Defend Demonracy event in Stepney, Tower Hamlets (east London), in April 2015, Herbert said: \\"Racism is alive and well and living in Tower Hamlets, in Westminster and, yes, sometimes in the judiciary.\\" He also criticised the \\"decision to bar the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, from holding public office for five years\\".

On 15 November 2015 members of the judiciary tried to pressure Herbert into refraining from sitting as a judge. In 2016, Herbert sued the Ministry of Justice for recommending that a formal warning be made against him. In January 2017, the disciplinary panel investigating Herbert said he should be given an apology from \\"a suitable senior person\\" for the treatment he received from other members of the judiciary, and that he should also receive a dressing down for his comments in the speech, which were deem to be misconduct (\\"because of the inferred criticism that another judge had given a judgment [about Rahman] on racial grounds\\") and \\"likely to undermine public confidence in the judiciary\\". Herbert appealed to the JCIO against the decision, saying that the panel had racially discriminated against him and that their treatment of him had made him feel \\"like a nigger\\". In his defence and as an example of double standards in the judiciary's treatment of fellow judges, Herbert pointed to Supreme Court Judge Lord Neuberger's apparent criticism of his colleague Lady Justice Hale's comments \\"relating to the court case on whether Parliament must be given a say on Brexit\\" ‚Äì a criticism for which Lord Neuberger was not disciplined.

The honorary consulate provides limited consular services to Australians in Paraguay. September 2011, when Paraguay opened an embassy in Canberra, with diplomats Esteban Bedoya and Yuli Kujawa present until 2014. Cultural relations The most notable event between Australia and Paraguay was the establishment of New Australia a utopian socialist settlement in Paraguay founded by the Australian New Australian Movement. This movement was founded by William Lane. Lane recruited 220 shearers, stockmen and unionists and sailed from Sydney in July 1893 for Paraguay. At the time, the Paraguayan government was keen to get Australian migration to boost the population of young men to rebuild the population and boost the local economy and the Government had offered the group a large area of good land. The colony was officially founded on 28 September 1893 as Colonia Nueva Australia and comprised 238 adults and children. Trade Bilateral trade between Australia and Paraguay is small, reflecting on deals happening at times rather than continuous arrangements of supply. In 2013-14, two-way merchandise trade totaled AUD$3.4 million, of which AUD$1.3 million were Australian exports, made up mainly of paper and paper products, civil engineering equipment and machine tools for working metal. Australia's major import from Paraguay (2013-14) was oil-seeds and oleaginous fruits. In December 2009, P&O; Maritime Services acquired a 70 per cent stake in the Dos Santos Group Bulk Barging business, a river navigation business based in Asunci√≥n. P&O;'s head office is based in Melbourne and the company maintains operations in five Australian ports. There may be some openings for investment in the agribusiness sector and for the export of agriculture related and other products and services from Australia. The mining industry in Paraguay has, to date, been relatively underdeveloped but the recent discovery of one of the world's three largest deposits of ilmenite (a titanium ore) has the potential to greatly expand mining in the country. Australian companies with existing interests in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay may find that the close commercial ties that these countries have with Paraguay may facilitate entry into the Paraguayan market. In 2011, the Paraguayan-Australian Chamber of Commerce was formed.

She also carried out extensive research on the history of African American dance from the 19th century. Early life Born in Sherman, Texas as the daughter of Mattie Jefferson (1877-1955), Flowers showed an interest in dance from the age of seven when she performed at folk festivals. In 1904, she moved with her parents to Kansas City, Missouri, where as a nine- year-old she danced with friends in her backyard. As an African-American, it was not easy for her to embark on a professional dance career but in 1913 she was able to study voice, dramatics and pageantry at Kansas State Teacher's College where she became a member of the Orchesis Society dance club. In the summer, she taught dance at the Kansas City YWCA. Career Flowers' first assignment after graduation was as a physical education teacher at the Sumner High School in Cairo, Illinois. She also performed as a professional dancer at the Cairo Opera House. She returned to her studies in physical education at Northwestern University, Chicago, where she graduated in 1924. While she was there she began to take a special interest in the history of African-American dance, strongly encouraged by anthropologist Melville Herskovits who took a special interest in African studies. From 1924, she spent 25 years in Chicago teaching physical education in the city's public schools while continuing her interest in dance. In 1944, Katherine Flowers opened the Flowers School of Dance in Chicago, teaching ballet and classical dance while forming a group of professional dancers known as the Katherine Flowers Dancers. By 1949, when she retired from public school teaching, she was devoting all her time to the dance company, with a production titled Bamboula to Ballet (later Bamboula to Bop) which presented the development of a truly African-American style of dance. The company made successful tours of the United States and Israel in the early 1950s which enabled her to join her son and daughter who had settled in Los Angeles. For a period, she operated a school of dance in there before moving to New York in 1955 where she again opened a school although neither of these was as successful as her school in Chicago. As a result, she took up additional work, teaching in the local public schools, arranging summer workshops, and teaching yoga to those working for the United Nations. She died in New York in July 1982. Flowers' left two children, Posie and Orlando. Posie Flowers, who was also a dancer, performed in the Broadway production of Carmen Jones in the 1940s while Orlando Flowers, Jr. (1920-1974) was the first African-American colonel in the California National Guard. Legacy With a view to writing a history of African-American dance, over the years Flowers collected a substantial amount of information on the popularization of African-American dance in the 20th century and its origins in the 19th century. Her papers are now stored in the Northwestern University Archives. They also contain information about Katherine Dunham with whom she collaborated from the 1940s.

It may need protection from strong winds, but is frosthardy to - 10 ¬∞C, as long as the soil is not waterlogged or excessively wet.

The album was arranged and conducted by Gary McFarland and produced by Creed Taylor for Verve Records. This was Stan's second bossa nova album for Verve following Jazz Samba, his very successful collaboration with guitarist Charlie Byrd. The music was recorded at the CBS 30th Street Studio in New York City on August 27 and 28, 1962. Music The music for the album consists of four songs by Brazilian composers and four original compositions by McFarland. The instrumentation chosen by McFarland eschews the traditional big band format of eight brass and five saxophones for a smaller ensemble featuring four woodwinds and French horn as well as three trumpets and two trombones. The four piece rhythm section is augmented by two percussionists. McFarland freely mixes his instrumental colors to provide a constantly shifting palette in support of Getz' tenor. Jim Hall, Hank Jones, Doc Severinsen and Bob Brookmeyer are each featured in short solos. Noted jazz critic Don DeMichael, writing in the December 6, 1962 issue of Down Beat magazine, awarded the album the top rating of five stars. DeMichael went on to say: \\"Getz' melodic gift was never more evident; even the way he plays \\"straight\\" melody is masterful. Few jazzmen have had this gift... and it has to do with singing by means of an instrument, for Getz doesn't just play a solo, he sings it, as can be heard on any of these tracks, most evidently on Triste and Saudade. About the writing DeMichael says: \\"McFarland shares in the artistic success of the album. His writing is peerless... he knows the proper combination of instruments to achieve certain sounds and he has the taste not to use all the instruments at hand all the time. His sparing use of the ensemble allows the beauty of the soloist and the material to shine through\\".

Her first novel, Thursdays in the Park, became an unexpected best seller. Her work, often dealing with the erotic lives of older people, has given rise to a new literary genre, described by the Observer newspaper, as 'gran-lit'. Early life Boyd was born and spent the first six months of her life in Prestatyn, North Wales, where her father, an army major, was stationed after the war. She was later educated in London, then at the boarding school Roedean. She trained as a nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, and subsequently as a marriage guidance counsellor with Relate before reading English Literature at London University in her late 30s. Non-fiction After college, Boyd became a health journalist, writing about depression, step-parenting and pregnancy. She began writing fiction as a hobby whilst raising three children and working at various day jobs including running a cancer charity, Survive Cancer, working for an engineering company, and an online vitamin site. First novel Boyd wrote, and publishers rejected, five novels before her first published novel, Thursdays in the Park, appeared from Quercus Books in 2011. Boyd was 62. In an interview for ITV News, Boyd said of her years of rejection: 'Writing was always my hobby so I would cry a little, get over it, and start again, and I would have done that until I died'. Publishing fiction in later in life, Boyd was inevitably compared with late bloomer writer Mary Wesley, whose first novel appeared when Wesley was 71. Thursdays in the Park had modest success in print form, although it was noted at the time that the investigation of the romantic lives of people in their 60s was unusual in popular literature. It was the e-book form of Thursdays that turned the work into an unexpected best-seller, topping the Amazon best-seller list for six weeks and selling, ultimately more than 650,000 copies in paper and e-book form. Comparisons were made between Thursdays in the Park and the BDSM phenomenon Fifty Shades of Grey. The Times described Boyd as \\"putting the sex back into sexagenarian\\"; and the phrase \\"Fifty Shades of Grey for the over 60s\\" was taken up by a number of newspapers including The Mail and The Independent. Underneath the hyperbole, Boyd's novel had identified and given voice to altered expectations amongst older people. By giving life to characters in their 60s with clearly articulated sexual desires, she undermined the idea that sex is something that fades with time, and that older people are no longer sexual beings. Themes Boyd can be seen to adopt a broadly feminist position in her works, demonstrating a particular interest in the influence older women have over their own lives as they age. A recurring thematic thread investigates the twinned ideas of invisibility and freedom. She is intrigued by the notion of the family unit as the bedrock on which all other human interactions are built, stating 'It is in the family that we learn ‚Äì or don't learn ‚Äì to relate effectively to others'.

Operations These schools, which usually hold classes on weekends, are primarily designed to serve the children of Japanese residents temporarily residing in foreign countries so that, upon returning to their home country, they can easily re-adapt to the Japanese educational system.Mori and Calder, p. 292 (PDF p. 3/21). As a consequence, students at these schools, whether they are Japanese nationals and/or permanent residents of the host country, are generally taught in the age- appropriate Japanese curriculum specified by MEXT.Kano, p. 104. Article 26 of the Constitution of Japan guarantees compulsory education for Japanese children in grades one through nine, so many weekend schools opened to serve students in those grades. Some weekend schools also serve high school and preschool/kindergarten.Doerr and Lee, p. 426. Several Japanese weekend schools operate in facilities rented from other educational institutions.Maguire, Mary H.

The remainder of the curriculum consists of other academic subjects, including mathematics, social studies, and sciences. In order to cover all of the material mandated by the government of Japan in a timely fashion, each school assigns a portion of the curriculum as homework, because it is not possible to cover all material during class hours. ,() author of \\"Japanese Community Schools: New Pedagogy for a Changing Population,\\" stated in 2011 that the supplementary schools were dominated by \\"a monoglossic ideology of protecting the Japanese language from English\\".Kano, p. 106. The Japanese government sends full-time teachers to supplementary schools that offer lessons that are similar to those of nihonjin gakk≈ç, and/or those which have student bodies of 100 students each or greater. The number of teachers sent depends upon the enrollment: one teacher is sent for a student enrollment of 100 or more, two for 200 or more students, three for 800 or more students, four for 1,200 or more students, and five for 1,600 or more students.

Some 12,500 children of Japanese nationality living in the United States attended both Japanese weekend schools and American day schools. They make up more than 60% of the total number of children of Japanese nationality resident in the United States. In the 1990s, weekend schools began creating keish≈çgo, or \\"heritage education,\\" classes for permanent residents of the U.S. The administrators and teachers of each weekend school that offers \\"heritage classes\\" develop their own curriculum.Doerr and Lee, p. 427. In the years prior to 2012, there was an increase in the number of students who were permanent residents of the United States and did not plan to go back to Japan. Instead, they attended the schools \\"to maintain their ethnic identity.\\" By that year, the majority of students in the Japanese weekend schools in the United States were permanent residents of the United States. Kano argued that the MEXT curriculum for many of these permanent residents is unnecessary and out of touch.

Bernstein Chair of Translation Theory. Gideon Toury was a pioneer of Descriptive Translation Studies.Gideon Toury's publications Biography Gideon Toury was born in Haifa, the first child of the historian Jacob Toury (1915‚Äì2004) and his wife Eve. He completed high school at the Reali School in Haifa in 1960. After high-school, he did his military service in the Nahal Brigade and the paratroopers and as part of his training was sent to a kibbutz, to help out with the farming.My way to translation studies He lived there for six years, and he ended up editing the kibbutz journal and organizing cultural events. This experience helped him obtaining a position in a children's journal, where he did his first translations, and later as the editor of the Hebrew version of Popular Photography. He graduated with honors in Hebrew language and Literature at Tel Aviv University in 1970, and completed a PhD Literary Theory at the same university in 1977 on the topic of Translational Norms and Literary Translation into Hebrew, 1930-1945. In 1980 he won the Hans Christian Andersen Award for his translation into Hebrew of C.S. Lewis The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.IBBY, IBBY Honour List (1956-1980), April 1980, p.34 He was the first chair professor in CETRA, the research program in Translation Studies created by Jose Lambert in 1989.Research Summer School In 1999, he was awarded honorary membership of the UNESCO Chair of Translation Studies at Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.Tel Aviv University Webflash 2000 In 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Middlesex University, London. From 1970 to 1983, he worked with Benjamin Harshav, Itamar Even-Zohar and Menachem Perry in the journal Literature and in 1989 he founded Target, International Journal of Translation Studies and has been general editor since. He is also General Editor of the Benjamins Translation Library.Bio at Tel Aviv University He was also a member of the boards of The Translator and the Translation Studies Abstracts until he was \\"unappointed\\" following the decision of Mona Baker to boycott Israeli academia.  Research  His main research is on the theory of translation and descriptive translation studies, with emphasis on the history of the Hebrew translation of the Bible to the present. According to Toury, there are prescriptive and descriptive studies. Prescriptive approaches aim to formulate rules that should be followed by anyone who produces a text of a given type. They are focused on finding the most optimal or correct solutions. Descriptive approaches are about looking into existing texts and describing the rules they seem to follow. He came up with the term \\"translation norms\\", as hidden rules followed by the majority discovered by descriptive observation of actual translation. They are not understood as prescriptive rules but as norms specific to a context. Therefore, norms change with time and culture, so translation re-visits the same problem over and over again.  Publications  He has published three books, a number of edited volumes and numerous articles, in both English and Hebrew, in the fields of translation theory and comparative literature. His articles have also appeared in translation in many other languages, and he is himself an active translator too (with about 30 books and many articles to his credit). = Books in English = * In Search of a Theory of Translation.

December 8, 1952. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running for the lead.

In November 1953, MGM announced it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter Karl Tunberg to write it.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Bank of America Wins Movie Suit.\\" The New York Times. November 4, 1953. Zimbalist was chosen because he had produced MGM's Best Picture-nominated Christians-and-lions epic Quo Vadis in 1951. The studio then announced in July 1954 that production would start in March 1955 with 42 speaking parts and 97 sets.\\"Kidd Will Repeat Dances for Movie.\\" The New York Times. July 29, 1954.

December 5, 1954. In September 1955, Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete, announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process.\\"Six Books Bought for Fox Films.\\" The New York Times. September 10, 1955. MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Sidney Franklin Resigns at M-G-M.\\" The New York Times. June 17, 1958. By the late 1950s, court decisions forcing film studios to divest themselves of theater chainsUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM.Block and Wilson, p. 411. In a gamble to save the studio, and inspired by the success of Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur.Eagan, p. 558‚Äì559. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15 million by the time shooting began‚Äîmaking it the costliest film ever produced up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars. One notable change in the film involved the opening titles. Concerned that a roaring Leo the Lion (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet.Schumach, Murray. \\"Metro Stills Leo for the First Time.\\" The New York Times. November 26, 1959. It was the first time in MGM history that the lion logo was not seen roaring. Pre-production =Development= Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, Ben- Hur: A Tale of the Christ, ran to about 550 pages. Zimbalist hired a number of screenwriters to cut the story down and turn the novel into a script. According to Gore Vidal, more than 12 versions of the script had been written by various writers by the spring of 1958.Vidal, p. 73. Vidal himself had been asked to write a version of the script in 1957, refused, and been placed on suspension for his decision. Karl Tunberg was one of the last writers to work on the script. Zimbalist had initially chosen director Sidney Franklin to helm the picture,Eagan, p. 559. and Tunberg consulted with Franklin about the script.Cole, p. 379. Tunberg cut out everything in the book after the crucifixion of Jesus, omitted the sub-plot in which Ben-Hur fakes his death and raises a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, and altered the manner in which the leperous women are healed. Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 482. The silent film version had introduced Esther early in the picture, rather than midway as in the novel, and Tunberg retained this feature in his script as well.Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 489. But Zimbalist was unhappy with Tunberg's script, and felt it was \\"pedestrian\\" and \\"unshootable\\".Kaplan, p. 440. The writing effort changed direction when Franklin fell ill and was removed from the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film,Freiman, p. 24. in early 1957.\\"Wyler Weighs Offer.\\" The New York Times. February 5, 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script to be \\"very primitive, elementary\\" and no better than hack work.Herman, p. 394. It lacked good characterization, the dramatic structure was poor, and the leads were uninteresting (just \\"villains and heroes\\"). Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race, and Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. Zimbalist told Wyler, \\"Forget the chariot race. That's just second-unit stuff\\",Herman, p. 395. stating that the real challenge would be to give the picture \\"body, depth, intimacy\\", which Wyler was renowned for. Zimbalist also told Wyler that MGM would spend up to $10 million on the film, and Wyler, impressed with the large budget, agreed to review the script a second time. The more Wyler thought about the story, the more he became intrigued with its possibilities. However, according to a report in The New York Times, Wyler refused to take the job until he was sure he had a good leading man. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.Makiewicz, Don. \\"Tour Around the Lot.\\" The New York Times. April 7, 1957. By June 13, 1957, MGM was still declining to confirm that Wyler had been hired to direct.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"British Plan Film on 'Silent Enemy'.\\" The New York Times. June 13, 1957. Yet, production was due to start, the studio said, in March 1958. In fact, despite conducting screen tests and engaging in other pre-production work for Ben-Hur, Wyler did not agree to direct the film until September 1957, and MGM did not announce his hiring until January 3, 1958.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Debbie Reynolds Is Cast By M-G-M.\\" The New York Times. January 4, 1958. Even though he still lacked a leading man, Wyler took the assignment for many reasons: He was promised a base salary of $350,000 as well as 8 percent of the gross box office (or 3 percent of the net profits, whichever was greater),Herman, p. 393. and he wanted to work in Rome again (where he had filmed Roman Holiday). His base salary was, at the time, the largest ever paid to a director for a single film. Professional competitive reasons also played a role in his decision to direct, and Wyler later admitted that he wished to \\"out DeMille\\" and make a \\"thinking man's\\" Biblical epic.Eldridge, p. 15. In later years, William Wyler would joke that it took a Jew to make a good film about Christ. =Writing= Wyler, like Zimbalist, was also unhappy with the script. He felt Tunberg's draft was too much of a morality play overlaid with current Western political overtones, and that the dialogue was too modern-sounding.Madsen, p. 342. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Behrman spent about a month working on the script, but how much he contributed to the final version is unclear. Both a contemporary account in the British magazine Films and Filmmaking as well as Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan claim that Anderson was ill and unable to work on the script. The New York Times however, reported in June 1957 that Anderson was at work on the script. Vidal said that, by spring 1958, the script largely reflected Anderson and Behrman's work and nearly all the dialogue was in Anderson's \\"elevated poetic style.\\" Kaplan describes the script at this point as having only a \\"modest to minimal\\" understanding of what the ancient Roman world was like, dialogue which veered \\"between flat Americanisms and stilted formality\\", and an ill-defined relationship between Judah Ben-Hur and Messala.Kaplan, p. 441. Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal said that pre-production on the film was already under way in Italy when he flew to Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed to work on the script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production.Kaplan, p. 442. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian, and knew a great deal about ancient Rome. Wyler, however, knew almost nothing about the period, and spent most of March having nearly every Hollywood film about ancient Rome flown to him in Italy‚Äîwhere he spent hours screening them. Vidal's working style was to finish a scene and review it with Zimbalist. Once Vidal and Zimbalist had come to agreement, the scene would be passed to Wyler. Vidal said he kept the structure of the Tunberg/Behrman/Anderson script, but rewrote nearly all the dialogue.Kaplan, p. 445. Vidal admitted to William Morris in March 1959 that Fry rewrote as much as a third of the dialogue which Vidal had added to the first half of the script. Vidal made one structural change which was not revised, however. The Tunberg script had Ben-Hur and Messala reuniting and falling out in a single scene. Vidal broke the scene in two, so that the men first reunite at the Castle Antonia and then later argue and end their friendship at Ben-Hur's home. Vidal also added small character touches to the script, such as Ben- Hur's purchase of a brooch for Tirzah and a horse for Messala. Vidal claimed that he worked on the first half of the script (everything up to the chariot race), and scripted 10 versions of the scene where Ben-Hur confronts Messala and begs for his family's freedom.Herman, p. 400.Giddins, p. 247. Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal first made the claim in an interview in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role as if he were a spurned homosexual lover.Joshel, Malamud, and McGuire, p. 37‚Äì38. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot little of what he wrote or made little contribution to the script.\\"Chuck Roast.\\" The Advocate. June 25, 1996, p. 82. Accessed December 25, 2011. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written \\"years before\\" Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts \\"there is no reason to doubt\\" Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation was just part of the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: \\"... the big cornpone [the crew's nickname for Heston] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. You should have seen those boys embrace!\\"Quoted in Kaplan, p. 444. Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.Feeney, p. 66‚Äì73. The final writer on the film was Christopher Fry. Charlton Heston has claimed that Fry was Wyler's first choice as screenwriter, but that Zimbalist forced him to use Vidal. Whether Fry worked on the script before Vidal or not, sources agree that Fry arrived in Rome in early May 1958 and spent six days a week on the set, writing and rewriting lines of dialogue as well as entire scenes, until the picture was finished.Herman, p. 401. In particular, Fry gave the dialogue a slightly more formal and archaic tone without making it sound stilted and medieval. For example, the sentence \\"How was your dinner?\\" became \\"Was the food not to your liking?\\" By early June, Fry (working backward from the ending) had finished the screenplay.Kaplan, p. 444‚Äì445. Film historian Daniel Eagan, however, claims that Fry did not finish the screenplay. Rather, as time went on, Wyler stopped seeking improvements to the script in order to finish the picture. The final script ran 230 pages. The screenplay differed more from the original novel than did the 1925 silent film version. Some changes made the film's storyline more dramatic. Others inserted an admiration for Jewish people (who had founded the state of Israel by this time) and the more pluralistic society of 1950s America rather than the \\"Christian superiority\\" view of Wallace's novel.Hezser, p. 136‚Äì138. Credits dispute Wyler said that he tried to get Tunberg and Fry co-credit for writing the screenplay. Tunberg initially agreed, Wyler said, but then changed his mind when the Screen Writers' Guild routinely investigated the claim.Herman, p. 412. According to Gore Vidal and film historian Gary Giddins, however, Wyler tried to get Fry an unshared credit for the screenplay.Giddins, p. 248. The dispute over who would receive screen credit quickly became a public one. According to The New York Times, Vidal challenged the initial determination by the Screen Writers' Guild regarding who would receive writing credit for the film. The Screen Writers' Guild arbitrated the credit under its screenwriting credit system, and unanimously awarded full and sole credit for the script to Tunberg (who, coincidentally, was a former president of the Guild). Both director William Wyler and Sol C. Siegel, head of production at MGM, appealed the Guild's ruling.\\"'Ben-Hur' Credit Is Urged for Fry.\\" The New York Times. October 29, 1959. Tunberg agreed to share credit, but the Guild refused to change its ruling. Wyler publicly campaigned to get Fry screenwriting credit, feeling that insider politics had led the Guild to give Tunberg sole credit. In retaliation, the Guild took out advertisements in trade newspapers accusing Wyler of trying to undermine the integrity of the credit and arbitration system. When Ben-Hur won Academy Awards in a wide range of categories except best screenplay, the Guild then accused Wyler of interfering with Tunberg's nomination. Later, when Charlton Heston accepted his Oscar for Best Leading Actor, he thanked Christopher Fry in his acceptance speech. The Guild sent him a letter which accused Heston of deliberately impugning the Guild and Tunberg's reputation. =Casting= Charlton Heston and Marina Berti in Ben- Hur Several actors were offered the role of Judah Ben-Hur before it was accepted by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster claimed he turned down the role because he found the script boringAlexander, p. 84‚Äì85. and belittling to Christianity. Paul Newman turned it down because he said he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson, Geoffrey Horne, and Leslie NielsenGiddins, p. 247‚Äì248. were also offered the role, as were a number of muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English).Herman, p. 395‚Äì396. Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston, who was formally cast on January 22, 1958.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Heston Will Star in M-G-M 'Ben-Hur'.\\" The New York Times. January 23, 1958. His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a prorated salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.Herman, p. 396. Stephen Boyd was cast as the antagonist, Messala, on April 13, 1958.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Goetz to Produce 3 Columbia Films.\\" The New York Times. April 14, 1958. William Wyler originally wanted Heston for the role, but sought another actor after he moved Heston into the role of Judah Ben-Hur.McAlister, p. 324, n. 59. Wyler tried to interest Kirk Douglas in the role of Messala, but Douglas turned him down.Kinn and Piazza, p. 135. Stewart Granger also turned down the role, reportedly because he did not want to take second billing to Charlton Heston. Boyd was a contract player at 20th Century Fox when Wyler cast him. Because both Boyd and Heston had blue eyes, Wyler had Boyd outfitted with brown contact lenses as a way of contrasting the two men.\\"An Actor to Watch,\\" Coronet, January 1, 1959, p. 22. Wyler typically cast the Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore the divide between the two groups.Solomon, p. 207.Magill, p. 150. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired after two days of work because she could not cry on cue.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Frenke Signs Pact With Seven Arts.\\" The New York Times. August 4, 1958. Heston says that he was the one who suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott (who had played the mother of Heston's Moses in The Ten Commandments, and with whom he'd worked on Broadway) as Miriam.Heston, p. 196. Scott was hired on July 17, 1958.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Seven Arts Unit Joins Paramount.\\" The New York Times. July 18, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline (Ben-Hur would be her last screen performance) Wyler cast her as Tirzah. More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Israeli Actress Cast in 'Ben-Hur'.\\" The New York Times. May 17, 1958. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test.Pratt, p. 135. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality.\\"An Actor to Watch,\\" Coronet, January 1, 1959, p. 71. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958,Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Seven Arts Group Teaming With U.A.\\" The New York Times. April 4, 1958. primarily because he had become famous for his roles as a wise old patriarch in a number of films.Morsberger and Morsberger, p. 481. Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar the same day as Jaffe. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Wyler's efforts at persuasion were successful, and Hawkins was cast on March 18, 1958.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"TV Suit Is Settled By United Artists.\\" The New York Times. March 19, 1958. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the comical Sheik Ilderim.Monush, p. 296. Finlay Currie had worked with Zimbalist before on Quo Vadis, playing St. Peter, was cast as Balthasar. Out of respect for the divinity of Christ, and consistent with Lew Wallace's stated preference, Wyler decided before the production began that the face of Jesus would not be shown. The role of Jesus was played by Claude Heater, who was uncredited for the role. Heater was an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film. In casting, Wyler placed heavy emphasis on characterization rather than looks or acting history.Parish, Mank, and Picchiarini, p. 27. For example, he cast a British actor for the role of the centurion who denies Judah Ben-Hur water at Nazareth. When the actor demanded higher pay, the first assistant director selected a different actor. Wyler, who believed the centurion's reaction to his confrontation with Jesus Christ was critical, shut down the production at a cost of $15,000 while the original actor was retrieved from Rome.Herman, p. 404‚Äì405. MGM opened a casting office in Rome in mid-1957 to select the 50,000 individuals who would act in minor roles and as extras in the film.Freiman, p. 25. The studio announced that casting for leads in the film was complete on September 12, 1958, when Kamala Devi was cast as Iris, Sheik Ilderim's daughter.Godbout, Oscar. \\"'Lolita' Bought By Screen Team.\\" The New York Times. September 13, 1958. However, neither the character nor the actress appeared in the film. A total of 365 actors had speaking parts in the film, although only 45 of them were considered \\"principal\\" performers. According to The New York Times, only four of the actors (Heston, O'Donnell, Jaffe, and Scott) had worked in Hollywood. Production =Cinematography= Robert L. Surtees, who had filmed several of the most successful epics of the 1950s and who had worked with Sam Zimbalist on Quo Vadis in 1951, was hired as cinematographer for the film.Sultanik, p. 299. Early on in the film's production, Zimbalist and other MGM executives made the decision to film the picture in a widescreen format. Wyler strongly disliked the widescreen format, commenting that \\"Nothing is out of the picture, and you can't fill it. You either have a lot of empty space, or you have two people talking and a flock of others surrounding them who have nothing to do with the scene. Your eye just wanders out of curiosity.\\"Herman, p. 406. The cameras were also quite large, heavy, and difficult and time-consuming to move. To overcome these difficulties, Surtees and Wyler collaborated on using the widescreen lenses, film stocks, and projection technologies to create highly detailed images for the film. For establishing shots, they planned to show vast lines of marching Roman troops and sailing ships, immense architectural structures lined with thousands of extras, expansive landscapes, and action which moved across the screen.Hall and Neale, p. 145. Wyler was best known for composition in depth, a visual technique in which people, props, and architecture are not merely composed horizontally but in depth of field as well. He also had a strong preference for long takes, during which his actors could move within this highly detailed space. Widescreen cinematic technology, however, limited depth of field. Surtees and Wyler worked to overcome this by creating scenes in which one half of the screen is filled with a foreground object while the other half is filled with a background area, and then rack-focusing between the two as the action shifts from foreground to background. Notable instances of this occur when the injured Messala waits for Judah Ben-Hur to appear in the racecourse surgery, when Judah Ben-Hur hides behind a rock to avoid being seen by his mother and sister in the Valley of the Lepers, and during the Sermon on the Mount.Hall and Neale, p. 145‚Äì146. The movie was filmed in a process known as \\"MGM Camera 65\\". 1957's Raintree County was the first MGM film to use the process.Eldridge, p. 57. The MGM Camera 65 used special 65mm Eastmancolor film stock with a 2.76:1 aspect ratio.Haines, p. 114. 70mm anamorphic camera lenses developed by the Mitchell Camera Company were manufactured to specifications submitted by MGM.Eyman, p. 351. These lenses squeezed the image down 1.25 times to fit on the image area of the film stock.Block and Wilson, p. 333. The 65mm images were then printed on 70mm film stock.Belton, p. 332. The extra 5mm of space on the film stock allowed the studio to use the new six-track stereo sound, which audiences rarely heard at the time.Altman, p. 158. To make a 35mm print (the type of film stock most smaller theaters could project), a 35mm print with black borders along the top and bottom of each frame was used. When projected, the 2.76:1 aspect ratio was retained. Because the film could be adapted to the requirements of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment.Hall and Neale, p. 153. This allowed more theaters to show the film. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.Cyrino, p. 74.Freiman, p. 31. =Principal photography= Wyler left the United States for Italy in April 1958, five months before post-production on Wyler's The Big Country was finished. Wyler authorized his long-time editor, Robert Swink, to edit The Big Country as he saw fit‚Äîincluding the shooting of a new finale, which Swink did.Herman, p. 391. Wyler asked not to be contacted by United Artists over the changes to The Big Country because Ben-Hur would take all his attention, time, and energy. Swink sent him a final cut of the picture in May 1958, which Wyler endorsed.Herman, p. 392. Pre-production began at Cinecitt√† around October 1957. The MGM Art Department produced more than 15,000 sketches and drawings of costumes, sets, props, and other items needed for the film (8,000 alone for the costumes); photostatted each item; and cross-referenced and catalogued them for use by the production design team and fabricators.Freiman, p. 26, 30. More than a million props were ultimately manufactured. Construction of miniatures for the entrance of Quintus Arrius into Rome and for the sea battle were under way by the end of November 1957.\\"Ben-Hur.\\" AFI Catalog of Feature Films. American Film Institute. 2014. Accessed 2014-03-13. MGM location scouts arrived in Rome (\\"yet again\\", according to The New York Times) to identify shooting locations in August 1957.Hawkins, Robert F. \\"Observations on the Italian Screen Scene.\\" The New York Times. August 4, 1957. Location shooting in Africa was actively under consideration.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Two Stars Named for Wald's Movie.\\" The New York Times. August 10, 1957. In mid-January 1958, MGM said that filming in North Africa (later revealed to be Libya) would begin on March 1, 1958, and that 200 camels and 2,500 horses had already been procured for the studio's use there.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Hollywood's Varied Vistas.\\" The New York Times. January 12, 1958. The production was then scheduled to move to Rome on April 1, where Andrew Marton had been hired as second unit director and 72 horses were being trained for the chariot race sequence. However, the Libyan government canceled the production's film permit for religious reasons on March 11, 1958, just a week before filming was to have begun.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Libya Cancels U.S. Film Permit.\\" The New York Times. March 12, 1958.\\"Ben- Hur,\\" AFI Catalog of Feature Films, American Film Institute, 2014, accessed 2014-03-13; Otman and Karlberg, p. 33. It is unclear whether any second unit filming took place in Israel. A June 8, 1958, reported in The New York Times said Marton had roamed \\"up and down the countryside\\" filming footage.Schiffer, Robert L. \\"Israel Screen Scene.\\" The New York Times. June 8, 1958. However, the American Film Institute claims the filming permit was revoked in Israel for religious reasons as well (although when is not clear), and no footage from the planned location shooting near Jerusalem appeared in the film. Principal photography began in Rome on May 18, 1958. The script was still unfinished when cinematography began, so that Wyler had only read the first 10 to 12 pages of it.Kaplan, p. 444. Shooting lasted for 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week. On Sundays, Wyler would meet with Fry and Zimbalist for story conferences. The pace of the film was so grueling that a doctor was brought onto the set to give a vitamin B complex injection to anyone who requested it (shots which Wyler and his family later suspected may have contained amphetamines).Herman, p. 403. Wyler was unhappy with Heston's performances, feeling they did not make Judah Ben-Hur a plausible character. Wyler shot 16 takes of Heston saying, \\"I'm a Jew!\\"Herman, p. 404. By November 1958, the production was becoming bogged down. In part, this was due to the extras. More than 85 percent of the extras had no telephone and no permanent address, so contacting them required using word-of-mouth. It could take several days before all the extras were informed they would be needed. An experienced extra was put in charge of about 30 inexperienced extras, moving them in and out of make-up and wardrobe. On days when there were thousands of extras, individuals would begin getting into costume at 5 A.M., while the last extras would get out of costume around 10 P.M. To speed things up, Wyler often kept principal actors on stand-by, in full costume and make-up, so that he could shoot pick- up scenes if the first unit slowed down. Actresses Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell spent almost the entire month of November 1958 in full leprosy make- up and costumes so that Wyler could shoot \\"leper scenes\\" when other shots didn't go well. Shooting took nine months, which included three months for the chariot race scene alone.Solomon, p. 213. Principal photography ended on January 7, 1959, with filming of the crucifixion scene.Eagan, p. 560.Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Mirisch to Film New Uris Novel.\\" The New York Times. January 8, 1959. The sequence took four days to film. Heston said that the final day's shoot was such a \\"flurry of grab shots\\" that the conclusion of principal photography was hardly remarked. Chariot race sequence Chariot wreckage in Ben-Hur The chariot race in Ben-Hur was directed by Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt,Wyler, p. 216. filmmakers who often acted as second unit directors on other people's films. Each man had an assistant director, who shot additional footage. Among these were Sergio Leone,Solomon, p. 15. who was senior assistant director in the second unit and responsible for retakes.Frayling, p. 97. William Wyler shot the \\"pageantry\\" sequence that occurs before the race, scenes of the jubilant crowd, and the victory scenes after the race concludes.Dunning, p. 251. The \\"pageantry\\" sequence before the race begins is a shot-by-shot remake of the same sequence from the 1925 silent film version.Brownlow, p. 413. Wyler added the parade around the track because he knew that the chariot race would be primarily composed of close-up and medium shots. To impress the audience with the grandeur of the arena, Wyler added the parade in formation (even though it was not historically accurate).Herman, p. 402. The original screenwriter, Karl Tunberg, had written just three words (\\"the chariot race\\") to describe the now-famous sequence, and no other writer had enlarged on his description.Herman, p. 405. Marton and Canutt wrote 38 pages of script which outlined every aspect of the race, including action, stunts, and camera shots and angles. According to editor John Dunning, producer Sam Zimbalist was deeply involved in the planning and shooting of the chariot sequence, and the construction of the arena. =Set design= The chariot arena was modeled on a historic circus in Jerusalem. Covering , it was the largest film set ever built at that time.Coughlan, p. 119. Constructed at a cost of $1 million, it took a thousand workmen more than a year to carve the oval out of a rock quarry. The racetrack featured long straightaways and five-story-high grandstands. Over of metal tubing were used to erect the grandstands. Matte paintings created the illusion of upper stories of the grandstands and the background mountains.Solomon, p. 210. The production crew researched ancient Roman racetracks, but were unable to determine what a historic track surface was like. The crew decided to create their own racecourse surface, one that would be hard enough to support the steel-rimmed chariot wheels but soft enough to not harm the horses after hundreds of laps. The construction crew laid down a bed of crushed rock topped by a layer of ground lava and finely ground yellow rock. More than of sand were brought in from beaches on the Mediterranean to cover the track.Pomerance, p. 9. Other elements of the circus were also historically accurate. Imperial Roman racecourses featured a raised high spina (the center section), metae (columnar goalposts at each end of the spina), dolphin-shaped lap counters, and carceres (the columned building in the rear which housed the cells where horses waited prior to the race).Herman, p. 398. The four statues atop the spina were high.Hudgins, Morgan. \\"'Ben-Hur' Rides Again.\\" The New York Times. August 10, 1958. A chariot track identical in size was constructed next to the set and used to train the horses and lay out camera shots. =Preparation= Lipizzan horses, like this one in Vienna, were used for chariot teams in Ben-Hur. Planning for the chariot race took nearly a year to complete. Seventy-eight horses were bought and imported from Yugoslavia and Sicily in November 1957, exercised into peak physical condition, and trained by Hollywood animal handler Glenn Randall to pull the quadriga (a Roman Empire chariot drawn by four horses abreast).Freiman, p. 27. Andalusian horses played Ben-Hur's Arabians, while the others in the chariot race were primarily Lipizzans.Solomon, p. 207, 210. A veterinarian, a harness maker, and 20 stable boys were employed to care for the horses and ensure they were outfitted for racing each day. When a blacksmith for making horseshoes could not be found, an 18-year-old Italian boy was trained in the art of blacksmithing in order to do so. The firm of Danesi BrothersFreiman, p. 28. built 18 chariots, each weighing . Nine were practice chariots. Principal cast members, stand-ins, and stunt people made 100 practice laps of the arena in preparation for shooting. Because the chariot race was considered so dangerous, a 20-bed infirmary staffed by two doctors and two nurses was built next to the set to care for anyone injured during shooting.Didinger and Macnow, p. 157. Heston and Boyd both had to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an experienced horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly.Solomon, p. 129. (He also learned sword fighting, how to throw a javelin, camel riding, and rowing.)Raymond, p. 32‚Äì33. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers. Among them was Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. The production schedule originally called for the chariot race to be shot in the spring, when weather was cooler for the horses and when Wyler would not be placing heavy demands on Heston and Boyd's time. However, the arena surface was not ready, the arena set was not finished, and the horses had not finished their training. Shooting of the chariot sequence began on the same day as principal photography. Once again filming was delayed. The racecourse surface proved so soft that it slowed the horses down and a day of shooting was lost as the yellow rock and all but of crushed lava were removed.Herman, p. 405‚Äì406. =Filming= Marton and Canutt filmed the entire chariot sequence with stunt doubles in long shot, edited the footage together, and showed the footage to Zimbalist, Wyler, and Heston to show them what the race should look like and to indicate where close-up shots with Heston and Boyd should go. Seven thousand extras were hired to cheer in the stands. Economic conditions in Italy were poor at the time, and as shooting for the chariot scene wound down only 1,500 extras were needed on any given day. On June 6, more than 3,000 people seeking work were turned away. The crowd rioted, throwing stones and assaulting the set's gates until police arrived and dispersed them.\\"Romans in Mob Scene Not in 'Ben Hur' Script.\\" United Press International. June 7, 1958. Dynamite charges were used to show the chariot wheels and axles splintering from the effects of Messala's barbed-wheel attacks. Three lifelike dummies were placed at key points in the race to give the appearance of men being run over by chariots. The cameras used during the chariot race also presented problems. The 70mm lenses had a minimum focal length of , and the camera was mounted on a small Italian-made car so the camera crew could keep in front of the chariots. The horses, however, accelerated down the straightaway much faster than the car could, and the long focal length left Marton and Canutt with too little time to get their shots. The production company purchased a more powerful American car, but the horses still proved too fast. Even with a head start, the larger American car could give the filmmakers only a few more seconds of shot time. Since the horses had to be running at top speed for the best visual impact, Marton chose to film the chariot race with a smaller lens with a much shorter minimum focal length. He also decided that the car should stay only a few feet ahead of the horses. This was highly dangerous, for if the car did not make its turns or slowed down, a deadly crash with the horses could occur. The changes, however, solved the problems the camera crew was encountering. As filming progressed, vast amounts of footage were shot for this sequence. The ratio of footage shot to footage used was 263:1, one of the highest ratios ever for a film. John Dunning and Ralph E. Winters edited the footage of the chariot sequence. According to Dunning, Winters edited most of the chariot race but the two men discussed it at length with some input from Wyler.Dunning, p. 251‚Äì252. The two editors decided that, once the race was under way, one of the charioteers should be killed immediately to demonstrate to the audience that the race was a deadly one. Inserts of the barbs on the hub of Messala's chariot were inserted repeatedly throughout the sequence to make it obvious that his chariot was highly dangerous. As footage was shot, it was roughly edited by Ralph Winters. If the footage was poor, the stunts didn't come off on camera well, or coverage was lacking, then more footage would be shot. At the end of three months, Dunning says, Winters had so much footage on hand that he asked Dunning to come to Rome to help him edit together the final sequence.Dunning, p. 252. One of the most notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal accident. Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, did Heston's more dangerous stunts during the sequence. When Judah Ben-Hur's chariot jumps over the wreckage of a chariot in its path, Ben-Hur is almost thrown out of his chariot. He hangs on and climbs back aboard to continue the race. While the jump was planned (the horses were trained to leap over the wreckage, and a telephone pole had been half-buried in the earth to force the chariot to jump into the air),Herman, p. 407. stunt man Joe Canutt was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton wanted to keep the shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard constitutes one of the race's most memorable moments.Canutt and Drake, p. 16‚Äì19. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled to near death, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.Raymond, p. 32. In all, the chariot scene took five weeks (spread over three months) to film at a total cost of $1 million and required more than of racing to complete. Two of the $100,000 70mm lenses were destroyed during the filming of the close-up shots. Once the \\"pageantry\\" and victory parade sequences of the race were finished, Wyler did not visit the chariot race set again. Marton asked the editors to put together a rough cut of the film, with temporary sound effects, and then asked Zimbalist to screen it for Wyler to get Wyler's approval for the sequence. Zimbalist said no. Wyler was tired, and might not fully appreciate the rough cut and demand that the whole race be refilmed. Zimbalist changed his mind however and showed the rough cut to Wyler several days later. According to Zimbalist, Wyler said \\"it's one of the greatest cinematic achievements\\" he had ever seen. Wyler did not see the final cut of the chariot race until the press screening of Ben-Hur. =Myths= Several urban legends exist regarding the chariot sequence. One states that a stuntman died during filming. Stuntman Nosher Powell says in his autobiography, \\"We had a stunt man killed in the third week, and it happened right in front of me. You saw it, too, because the cameras kept turning and it's in the movie.\\"Powell, p.254. But film historian Monica Silveira Cyrino discounted this statement in 2005, and said there were no published accounts of any serious injuries or deaths during filming of the chariot race. Indeed, the only recorded death to occur during the filming was that of producer Sam Zimbalist, who died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on November 4, 1958, while on the set.\\"Sam Zimbalist, 57, Film-Maker, Dead.\\" The New York Times. November 5, 1958. MGM executives asked Wyler to take over the executive producer's job, with an extra salary of $100,000. Wyler agreed, although he had assistance from experienced MGM executives as well.Herman, p. 408‚Äì409. Production supervisor Henry Henigson was so overcome by stress-related heart problems during the shoot that doctors feared for his life and ordered him off the set. Henigson, however, returned to the production shortly thereafter and did not die. Nor were any horses injured during the shoot; in fact, the number of hours that the horses could be used each day was actually shortened to keep them out of the summer heat.Herman, p. 408. Another urban legend states that a red Ferrari can be seen during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth.Sandys, p. 5. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race. Heston points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.Nichols, Peter M. \\"Home Video: All of 'Ben-Hur' and Its Secrets.\\" The New York Times. March 16, 2001. =Production design= Entrance to Cinecitt√† Studios, where Ben-Hur was filmed. Italy was MGM's top choice for hosting the production. However, a number of countries‚Äîincluding France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom‚Äîwere also considered.Freiman, p. 26. Cinecitt√† Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 on the outskirts of Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location.Hawkins, Robert F. \\"Viewed on the Bustling Italian Film Scene.\\" The New York Times. February 16, 1958. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long- term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film. Henigson arrived in Italy in the spring of 1956. Art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production. A skeleton crew of studio technicians arrived in the summer of 1956 to begin preparing the Cinecitt√† soundstages and back lot, and to oversee the construction of additional buildings which would be needed to house the production team. The largest Cinecitt√† soundstage was not used for filming, but was used as a vast costume warehouse. Another soundstage housed a dry cleaning facility, a traditional laundry, a sculptors' workshop, and a shoe repair facility.Freiman, p. 29. Costumes used in Ben-Hur The Ben-Hur production utilized 300 sets scattered over and nine sound stages.Cyrino, p. 73. It was filmed largely at Cinecitt√† Studios. Several sets still standing from Quo Vadis in 1951 were refurbished and used for Ben-Hur. By the end of the production more than of plaster and of lumber were used.Eagan, p. 559‚Äì560. The budget called for more than 100,000 costumes and 1,000 suits of armor to be made, for the hiring of 10,000 extras, and the procurement of hundreds of camels, donkeys, horses, and sheep. Costume designer Elizabeth Haffenden oversaw a staff of 100 wardrobe fabricators who began manufacturing the costumes for the film a year before filming began. Special silk was imported from Thailand, the armor manufactured in West Germany, and the woolens made and embroidered in the United Kingdom and various countries of South America. Many leather goods were hand-tooled in the United Kingdom as well, while Italian shoemakers manufactured the boots and shoes. The lace for costumes came from France, while costume jewelry was purchased in Switzerland.Freiman, p. 30. More than of hair were donated by women in the Piedmont region of Italy to make wigs and beards for the production,Freiman, p. 7. and of track laid down for the camera dollies. A workshop employing 200 artists and workmen provided the hundreds of friezes and statues needed. A cafeteria capable of serving more than 5,000 extras in 20 minutes was also built. The mountain village of Arcinazzo Romano, from Rome, served as a stand-in for the town of Nazareth. Beaches near Anzio were also used, and caves just south of the city served as the leper colony.Herman, p. 409. Some additional desert panoramas were shot in Arizona, and some close-up inserts taken at the MGM Studios, with the final images photographed on February 3, 1958. The film was intended to be historically accurate. Hugh Gray, a noted historian and motion picture studio researcher, was hired by Zimbalist as the film's historical advisor. A veteran of the Hollywood historical epic, it was the last film he worked on. Even the smallest details were historically correct. For example, Wyler asked a professor at the University of Jerusalem to copy a portion of the Dead Sea Scrolls for a scene that called for parchment with Hebrew writing on it. One of the miniature Roman triremes used in Ben-Hur in 1959. The sea battle was one of the first sequences created for the film,Dunning, p. 253. filmed using miniatures in a huge tank on the back lot at the MGM Studios in Culver City, California in November and December 1957. More than 40 miniature ships were built for the sequence. The script contained no description of or dialogue for the sea battle, and none had been written by the time the production schedule got around to filming the live-action sequences. According to editor John Dunning, screenwriter Christopher Fry looked at the miniature footage which Dunning had edited into a rough cut, and then wrote the interior and above- deck scenes.Dunning, p. 252‚Äì253. Two long Roman galleys, each of them seaworthy, were built for the live-action segment. The ships were constructed based on plans found in Italian museums for actual ancient Roman galleys. An artificial lake with equipment capable of generating sea-sized waves was built at the Cinecitt√† studios to accommodate the galleys. A massive backdrop, wide by high, was painted and erected to hide the city and hills in the background. Third unit director Richard Thorpe was hired on July 17, 1958, at the request of William Wyler to film the above-decks sequences, but a directing commitment back in the United States required him to leave the production with filming still incomplete. Dunning says he then directed most of the below-decks scenes, including the sequence in which Quintus Arrius' flagship is rammed. To make the scene bloodier, Dunning sought out Italian extras who had missing limbs, then had the makeup crews rig them with fake bone and blood to make it appear as if they had lost a hand or leg during the battle. When Dunning edited his own footage later, he made sure that these men were not on screen for long so that audiences would be upset. The above-decks footage was integrated with the miniature work using process shots and traveling mattes.Brosnan, p. 28. Dunning claimed to have directed most of the critical scene in which Quintus Arrius first confronts Judah Ben-Hur on the galley, as well as the following segment in which Arrius forces the slaves to row at high speed. Some of the dialogue in the scene, he says, was shot by Wyler, but most of the rest (including the high-speed rowing) was shot by Dunning himself. Dunning has stated that he spent several days on the high-speed rowing segment, shooting the sequence over and over from different angles to ensure that there was plenty of coverage. He then edited the immense amount of footage down to obtain a rough cut that matched the script, and then re-edited the footage to be more cinematic and work emotionally on screen. The galley sequence is one of the few scenes in the film which is not historically accurate, as the Roman navy (in contrast to its early modern counterparts) did not employ convicts as galley slaves.Casson, p. 325‚Äì326. One of the most sumptuous sets was the villa of Quintus Arrius, which included 45 working fountains and of pipes. Wealthy citizens of Rome, who wanted to portray their ancient selves, acted as extras in the villa scenes. Among them were the Countess Nona Medici, Count Marigliano del Monte, Count Mario Rivoltella, Prince Emanuele Ruspoli and Prince Raimondo Ruspoli of Italy, the Princess Carmen de Hohenlohe, Prince Cristian Hohenlohe and Count Santiago Oneto of Spain, Baroness Lillian de Balzo of Hungary, and Princess Irina Wassilchikoff (Russia). To recreate the ancient city streets of Jerusalem, a vast set covering was built, which included a high Joppa Gate. The sets were so vast and visually exciting that they became a tourist attraction. Tour buses visited the site hourly, and entertainers such as Harry Belafonte, Kirk Douglas, Susan Hayward, Audrey Hepburn, and Jack Palance traveled to Italy to see the production.Raymond, p. 31. The huge sets could be seen from the outskirts of Rome, and MGM estimated that more than 5,000 people were given tours of the sets.Hawkins, Robert F. \\"Answer to a Question: Quo Vadis, 'Ben- Hur'?\\" The New York Times. January 11, 1959. Another 25,000 tourists stopped by the studios to see the production in progress. The New York Times reported that thousands more viewed the sets without entering the grounds. Dismantling the sets cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking equipment was turned over to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the artificial lake over to Cinecitt√†. MGM retained control over the costumes and the artificial lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted by the men who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe. Post- production =Editing= According to editor John D. Dunning, the first cut of the film was four and one-half hours long (although a mass media report in March 1959 indicated the running time was closer to five hours).Pryor, Thomas M. \\"Extras Negotiate for Pay Increases.\\" The New York Times. March 15, 1959. A total of was shot for the film.\\"'Ben-Hur to Race for 213 Minutes.\\" The New York Times. October 7, 1959. William Wyler said his goal was to bring the running time down to three and a half hours. Editors Dunning and Winters saw their job as condensing the picture without losing any information or emotional impact. Dunning later said that he felt some of the leper colony sequence could have been cut. The most difficult editing decisions, he also said, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors.Dunning, p. 253‚Äì254. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. Because no editing equipment (such as the Moviola) existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost, and according to Dunning \\"you didn't even know what you had until you cut the negative. We'd print up the 70 now and then, and project it to see what we were getting against what we were seeing in the 35. We really did it blind.\\"Dunning, p. 255. When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments. The editors had little to do with inserting music into the film. Composer Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa viewed a near-final cut of the film, and then made scoring notes. Afterward, R√≥zsa consulted with the editors, who made suggestions, and then wrote his score and had music inserted where he wished.Dunning, p. 254. =Musical score= The film score was composed and conducted by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, who scored most of MGM's epics. The composer was hired by ZimbalistHerman, p. 411. (Zimbalist had previously commissioned and then set aside a score from Sir William Walton).R√≥zsa in a Today (BBC Radio 4) interview, BBC Sound Archives R√≥zsa conducted research into Greek and Roman music of the period to give his score an archaic sound while still being modern. R√≥zsa himself directed the 100-piece MGM Symphony Orchestra during the 12 recording sessions (which stretched over 72 hours). The soundtrack was recorded in six-channel stereo. More than three hours of music were composed for the film,\\"On the Sound Track.\\" Billboard. July 20, 1959, p. 19. Accessed December 27, 2011. and two- and-a-half hours of it were finally used, making it () the longest score ever composed for a motion picture. Unlike previous efforts for films set in the distant past, R√≥zsa quoted no ancient Greek or Roman musical themes in his score.Winkler, p. 329. But he did re-use music he had composed for Quo Vadis in his Ben-Hur score. Several times when Jesus Christ is depicted on screen, the full orchestra is replaced with a pipe organ. R√≥zsa won his third Academy Award for his score. , it was the only musical score in the ancient and medieval epic genre of film to win an Oscar. Like most film musical soundtracks, it was issued as an album for the public to enjoy as a distinct piece of music. The score was so lengthy that it had to be released in 1959 on three LP records, although a one-LP version with Carlo Savina conducting the Symphony Orchestra of Rome was also issued. In addition, to provide a more \\"listenable\\" album, R√≥zsa arranged his score into a \\"Ben-Hur Suite\\", which was released on Lion Records (an MGM subsidiary which issued low-priced records) in 1959.\\"Discourse.\\" Billboard. November 23, 1959, p. 24. Accessed April 21, 2012. This made the Ben-Hur film musical score the first to be released not only in its entirety but also as a separate album. The Ben-Hur score has been considered to be the best of R√≥zsa's career.MacDonald, p. 1966. The musical soundtrack to Ben-Hur remained deeply influential into the mid 1970s, when film music composed by John Williams for films such as Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost Ark became more popular among composers and film- goers.Winkler, p. 329‚Äì330. R√≥zsa's score has since seen several notable re- releases. In 1967, R√≥zsa himself arranged and recorded another four-movement suite of music from the film with the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra. It was released by Capitol Records. In 1977, Decca Records recorded an album of highlights from the score featuring the United Kingdom's National Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Sony Music reissued the first two of the three-LP 1959 recording (along with selections from the film's actual soundtrack) as a two- CD set in 1991. Rhino Records issued a two-CD release in 1996 which featured remastered original recordings, outtakes from the original film soundtrack, alternate and recording outtakes, and extended versions of some musical sequences. In 2012, Film Score Monthly and WaterTower Music issued a limited edition five-CD set of music from the film. It included a remastered film score (as heard on screen) on two discs; two discs of alternate versions, additional alternate versions, and unused tracks (presented in film order); and the contents of the three-LP MGM and one-LP Lion Records albums on a single disc.

Since 2000 the development has been in cooperation with the governmental ICT Agency Cipal Schaubroeck. Brocade Library Services is designed as a web-based application, sold via a cloud license model. The system is multilingual and uses open source components History The development of Brocade Library Services started at University of Antwerp Library in 1998. The University of Antwerp started using Brocade on 1 January 2000. From 2000 onwards the UAntwerp has been developing the product in co-operation with the governmental ICT Agency Cipal Schaubroeck. The Brocade software uses a central software repository and counts 1 to 2 new releases per year. Features Brocade Library Services offers library and archival institutions a complete suite of applications allowing them to: * create, maintain and publish bibliographical, archival and documentary databases; * automate all back-office tasks in a library (cataloguing, authority control and thesaurus management, patron administration, circulation, ordering, subscription control, electronic resource management, interlibrary lending and document delivery) and an archival institution (ISAAR authorities, archival acquisitions, ISAD descriptions, descriptions of objects such as manuscripts, photos, letters, ‚Ä¶) * offer electronic services to the library end-users (online public access catalogue, SMS services, personalized MyLib-environment, document requests, alerting service, self-renewal, ‚Ä¶) The networked topology of the application lets libraries work together, share information, share catalogues, while still keeping their own identity and independency when it comes to typical local functions such as acquisition and circulation. =Web based= Brocade Library Services is a completely web-based application, available anywhere, anyplace and anytime (where an internet connection is available) using standard browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and Chrome. Brocade does not require installation of specific clients on the user‚Äôs desktop. Installation of software on local PC‚Äôs is kept to a strict minimum: a PDF reader and an application called Localweb which caters for ticket printing and provides basic circulation operations when the network fails. As the Brocade server is hosted and managed centrally, software updates and system upgrades do not require interaction from the local library staff. Brocade Library Services uses a central software repository from which bug fixes can easily be installed overnight to all Brocade systems. All new releases are also installed centrally from this repository. Whenever possible Brocade integrates with standard system components often available in the open source community, thus allowing easy integration with other internet based services and applications. =Multilingual= The application is developed with a multilingual approach in mind and can be made available in different languages using built-in translation tables. =Menu driven= Brocade works via easy- to-use and user-friendly menu structures and navigation toolbars. Pages are presented to the user as simple and easy-to-follow web forms. Pages and menus can be fully customized, according to each library‚Äôs needs and preferences. Modules Brocade Library Services offers a suite of applications tailored to the needs of libraries, documentation centers and archival institutions. =Cataloguing= Library materials such as (old) books, periodicals, journal articles, dissertations, audiovisual materials etc. can be described in the catalogue according to international standards such as ISBD and AACR2. Records can be imported/exported according to MARC21 or MODS standards. Archival materials are added to the database using ISAD(G) guidelines. Materials held within special collections (manuscripts, photos, letters, ‚Ä¶) can be described using the so-called object module, in which these materials are described using specifically tailored metadata schemes. =Authority Control and Thesaurus management= Brocade Library Services uses authority control for the input of entities such as personal names, corporate names (institutions, organizations), subject classification (UDC, DDC), thesaurus terms, geographical names (cities, countries) etc. The authority control for archival descriptions is based on the ISAAR standard. =Circulation and patron management= Library materials can be circulated to patrons using the circulation module. This module also caters for the loan, renewal and return of library materials. Librarians can use Brocade for sending overdue notices (by surface mail, e-mail or SMS) and calculate fines. For each library in the network the circulation module can be configured in a different way so that even in complex library networks the module behaves according to local policies. Brocade uses the SIP2 protocol to communicate with self-service circulation terminals. =Acquisition and subscription control= Within the acquisition module libraries can manage their funds and suppliers, place orders for books and periodicals and manage the subscriptions (predict the arrival of individual volumes and issues based on prediction and frequency patterns). =Electronic Resource Management (ERM)= More and more books and journals are published electronically: libraries do no longer hold the material in their physical form, but sign license agreements with publishers and agencies for the distribution of electronic resources to their users. The ERM module helps libraries to manage their license agreements and the electronic content covered by these. =Public catalogue= End users can search the catalogue (OPAC ‚Äì Online Public Access Catalogue) to find both physical and electronic materials held by the library. The catalogue can be offered in different ways (simple search, advanced search, browsing, facets) and it is possible to create separate specialized catalogues for specific collections such as dissertations, e-resources, audiovisual materials, ‚Ä¶). Brocade Library Services can easily integrate with discovery tools such as Aquabrowser. =Institutional repository= Brocade Library Services can be used to establish an institutional repository of scholarly publications (journal articles, book chapters, books, reviews, proceedings). It can integrate with applications such as DSpace for the publication of the repository on the web and for harvesting data through the use of the OAI-PMH protocol. =MyLibrary= Brocade offers a MyLibrary application: using a personal userid and password library end users can access this application to check their loans, renew the loan, enter stack requests, order documents from other libraries, place hold on documents, review their alerting profile and change their personal settings. =Digital platform= Libraries that have scanned (part of their) book collections ‚Äì especially books from the hand press period ‚Äì can use the so-called digital platform to let their users discover and navigate digitized materials. =Archival descriptions= Archival records can be described according to international standards such as ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF). Brocade supports EAD and EAC formats for exchange of ISAD records and ISAAR authorities. Last but not least: individual items such as manuscripts, letters, photographs, audiovisual materials, legal documents, logbooks, ... can be described separately using different metadata schemes. Items can be linked to archival descriptions and can be exported in Dublin Core. You can also use the item description module to describe heritage collections independently from archival descriptions. =Helpdesk and Infodesk= The helpdesk module streamlines the communication between the Brocade support team and library management. The infodesk streamlines the communication between end users and the library. Both desks operate in the same way: users can submit questions using a submission form or by sending an e-mail. The messages are received by Brocade and stored in the helpdesk application. From there helpdesk executives can manage the requests (solve the problem immediately or submit the question to a colleague). Each sender is kept up-to-date on the status of his request by e-mails generated by the system. Users Target customers for Brocade are libraries (public libraries, academic and education libraries, special libraries), museums, documentation centres and archival organisations. The Brocade system has been implemented in various libraries in Belgium, The Netherlands and South Africa. In South Africa, Brocade Library Services is branded as SLIMS (SITA Library Information Management System) and is implemented in partnership with SITA (the South African State Information Technology Agency).

The single story brick building was built c. 1910 by the Missouri Pacific Railroad in its distinctive Mediterranean/Italianate style. The building is of particular importance in McGehee because the town is located where it is due to the company's decision to locate the station here.

The painting depicts a young black boy dressed as an archer. The painting is in the collection of the Wallace Collection, in London, England. Attribution For many years the painting was believed to have been the work of Rembrandt, and was purchased as such by Richard Seymour- Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, in 1848. Flinck had studied under Rembrandt in 1631‚Äì32, and his style had become so closely associated with him that for many years a self portrait by Flinck in the National Gallery, London, was thought to have been a portrait of Rembrandt. Flinck painted numerous works in the style of Rembrandt when there was a demand for his work in the 1630s and 1640s. The true origin of the painting was discovered after it was cleaned in 1913, and the signature believed to be by Rembrandt turned out to have been falsely added later. A signature beginning with the letter \\"f\\" was discovered. The painting had been reattributed to Flinck by 1928. Description The style of the painting is known as a \\"tronie\\", meaning \\"a head, a face, or expression\\". Tronies were not portraits of named people but character studies of exotic figures. This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1915, who wrote: Entry 267 for 'A Young Negro Archer' in Hofstede de Groot, 1914 :\\"267. A YOUNG NEGRO ARCHER.

He holds a bow at his breast with his right hand. The quiver hangs over his shoulder by a rich gold chain. There are large pearls in his ears and a narrow gold chain round his neck. He has a loose brownish-green coat over a fine pleated shirt, adorned below with a gold chain having large pearls as pendants. Full light falls from the left across the face and on the white shirt.

The first, an engraving by Cornelis Visscher (c.1648) reads: \\"Dus heft den Moor met pijl en Boogh / Den vyandt of het wilt in't oogh\\" (Thus lifts the Moor his bow and arrow / The enemy [or wildlife] to eye) In the 1750 reproduction of Visscher's portrait, held at the British Museum and published by George Pulley of London, the caption below describes the archer as an American Indian, replacing the word Moor for Indian, the words being interchangeable at the time: Thus Arm‚Äôd, the Indian with his Dart & Bow / Pursues with eager Eye, his Woodland Foe Rembrandt also portrayed people of African origin, including black soldiers and figures in armour. It is not known whether the boy was a model, in the army, or a huntsman of a Dutch country estate. Art critic Andrew Graham-Dixon wrote of the subject of A Young Archer in 2004 that > Whether the young man painted by Flinck was actually from the Sudan, or not, > it seems likely that the painter intended to show him as a living embodiment > of the proud, martial spirit of the Nubian race ‚Äì a poignant contrast to his > actual situation, as a first-generation African slave...The solemn, > thoughtful humanity of Flinck's portrayal makes it unusual, among early > Western European depictions of black Africans, suggesting at the very least > a bond between the artist and the sitter.

History  After working in a bookshop (1954-1956), Leventhal joined the publishing company of Herbert Jenkins Ltd, best known as the publisher of P. G. Wodehouse, and published his first military book in 1960. After a short time with Paul Hamlyn (1964-1966) he set up Arms & Armour Press in 1966. Lionel Leventhal Limited came into being in 1967 as the holding company for the various publishing and other book related companies run by its eponymous owner.  Arms and Armour Press  Founded at a time when few new publishing houses were being established, Arms and Armour Press began on Leventhal‚Äôs kitchen table, but grew rapidly to be one of the UK‚Äôs leading publishers of militaria and military history, with a stable of authors including some of the most renowned specialists in the field, including Ian V. Hogg, David G. Chandler and Steven Zaloga. In 1984 Arms & Armour Press was sold to Link House Books, which owned seven publishers, including Blandford.  The London Book Fair  In 1971 Leventhal organised The Specialist Publishers‚Äô Exhibition for Librarians, with 22 exhibitors displaying titles on tabletops. Subsequently, now with business partner, Clive Bingley, he saw the Fair grow and go through a number of development and name changes, finally becoming The London Book Fair in 1977. The London Book Fair was sold in 1985 to Industrial & Trade Fairs (which later became Reed Exhibitions), by which time the number of exhibitors had increased to 520. He was video-interviewed at The London Book Fair 2017 as part of a surprise celebration of his 80th birthday.  Ken Trotman  1976 saw the acquisition of Ken Trotman Limited, the leading specialist bookseller of books on militaria, which was sold to its manager, Richard Brown, in 1984.  Greenhill Books  In 1984 Leventhal started a new publishing imprint, Greenhill Books. Contractually precluded from publishing any new books for a period, he started with three series of reprints of classic aviation, crime and science fiction titles. In 1985, Greenhill launched the Napoleonic Library series of classic military reprints and soon abandoned fiction publishing to concentrate on military history. As with Arms & Armour Press, the imprint grew, eventually reaching a total of almost 700 titles published and attracting a renowned group of authors, including Chaim Herzog, John Elting and Kenneth Macksey. Additionally, the company undertook European and Commonwealth distribution for a number of overseas military history publishers. Lionel Leventhal's son, Michael, joined Greenhill Books in January 2003 and become a Director the following year. In 2007 Greenhill Books split, with contracted but as yet unpublished titles passing to Frontline Books, an imprint of Pen & Sword Books. Lists distributed on behalf of overseas publishers became the basis of a new company, Casemate UK. Lionel Leventhal Limited retains ownership of stocks and copyright licences of books published under the Greenhill Books and Chatham Publishing imprint. The only new Greenhill Book between 2007 and 2016 was The Hand of History, a compilation of history quotes and commentaries raising money for Parkinson's UK. The book is edited by Michael Leventhal and includes contributions from Antony Beevor, Asa Briggs, Tim Newark, Richard Holmes, Gary Sheffield, Ian Kershaw, Stephen Turnbull and illustrations by Chris Riddell.

Born in Courbevoie, Blondel grew up with his mother in H√©nin-Li√©tard, while his father was active in the French Resistance. After the war, the family reunited in Paris, and Blondel went to secondary school in Nanterre, where he joined the Socialist Youth. He then went to study law while taking various part-time jobs, and one of these led him to join the Trade Union Federation of PTT Workers, part of Workers' Force (FO). Blondel campaigned for Algerian independence, and this led him to join the Autonomous Socialist Party. However, he disagreed with its merger into the Unified Socialist Party and so left political activity. Instead, he became active in the Grand Orient de France, becoming prominent in left-wing freemasonry. In 1960, Blondel began working for ASSEDIC, where he formed a network of union branches. This success led him to become secretary of the union representing workers in social organisations in the Paris region, and from 1961, he served on the executive of the Federation of Employees and Managers (FEC), and then its national secretary in 1965. He began advocating a merger between FO, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), and the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT). This was not popular with the FO leadership, but Blondel continued to rise in prominence, being active in May 1968 movement, and in 1974 winning election as the general secretary of the FEC. In 1980, Blondel moved to work at the national office of FO, leading on economic issues, and in 1981 he was elected to the governing body of the International Labour Organization. In 1989, he was elected as general secretary of FO, narrowly beating Jean-Claude Pitous, and becoming the first leader of FO not to have been part of its 1948 split from the CGT. His victory was owed in part to the support of the Trotskyist Workers' Party, and this led him to face inaccurate accusations of being a Trotskyist himself. Under Blondel's leadership, the FO adopted more radical policies, but faced falling membership. In 1995, it worked with the CGT to campaign against Alain Jupp√©'s plan to reorganise social security. He symbolically shook hands with the CGT leader, Louis Viannet. He was consistently re-elected with large majorities, until he retired in 2004. He then became president of the National Federation of Free Thought, the Friends of Fred Zeller, and the Friends of L√©on Jouhaux.

Born in B√©thune, Mailly grew up in Lens, then studied economic science in Lille. He found work with the National Health Insurance Fund. In 1974, he met Marc Blondel, a prominent figure Workers' Force (FO), a trade union confederation. Mailly's father was already an activist in FO, and Mailly decided to also join the union. In 1981, on Blondel's invitation, Mailly began working full-time for FO, in its federal office. In time, he came to lead FO policy on economic issues, serving on the secretariat from 1989, and then was elected national secretary in 2000. In February 2004, he succeeded Blondel as general secretary of FO. Initially, Mailly's critics claimed that he relied on the support of the Trotskyist Workers' Party, although this proved not to be the case. He started by meeting the leaders of the other main national union federations, breaking with FO tradition, and campaigned alongside them in protests against a new hiring contract in 2005. Initially, he was able unite the large majority of the union, but from 2016 he was more controversial, working closely with the General Confederation of Labour in opposing the El Khomri law, then refusing to organise opposition to Emmanuel Macron, against the wishes of the majority of the union. Mailly retired in 2018, reaching the age of 65. His final activity report only very narrowly winning the approval of a majority of members. His successor, Pascal Pavageau, published details of Mailly's salary and expenses, which proved controversially high. Following his retirement, Mailly formed the company JCBC Conseil, to advise on social, economic and industrial matters.

Born in Suarce, Bergeron was brought up in the Plymouth Brethren faith, but broke with it while still at school, joining the Socialist Youth. He started an apprenticeship in printing, and joined a union affiliated to the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), but the printing company closed in 1939, before he had qualified, and he instead found work with Postes, T√©l√©graphes et T√©l√©phones. During World War II, he avoided serving in the Nazi forces, and in 1941 was arrested, spending much of the war interned in Austria, undertaking forced labour. After the war, Bergeron moved to Belfort and to printing, and in 1946, he was elected as secretary of the local typographers' union. Along with the majority of local trade unionists, he left the CGT and joined the new Workers' Force (FO). From April 1948, he worked full-time for the federation as its representative for Belfort, and from 1949, he also led the Book Federation. He met Irving Brown, who was helping fund FO with CIA money, and the two became friends, Brown directly funding Bergeron's post. He also helped found the FO Book Federation, and although it saw little success, he was elected to the executive of the International Graphical Federation. In 1950, Bergeron began working in FO's national office, where he was a notable voice in support of Algerian independence. While initially highly controversial, he was eventually able to get a union position agreed, and his skills in this led him to win election as general secretary of FO in 1963. He was also appointed as a vice president of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. He largely maintained existing federation positions, pushing for moderate reforms, and working closely with government from both left and right, but strongly opposing the French Communist Party. He championed co-management between workers and employers. In May 1968, he obtained an increase of 3 francs in the minimum wage, a higher figure than the CGT leadership had requested. Bergeron retired in 1989. He was critical of the more radical positions adopted by his successor, Marc Blondel. He became president of the Institute for Social History, and wrote several books, including his memoirs. He died in 2014.

They are best known for the songs \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Tailing You\\", which were minor hits. Both videos were in rotation in the early days of MTV. Background Dirty Looks was formed in 1977 and began playing cover songs before writing a set of gritty pop songs inspired by the 1960s. The band consisted of singer/guitarist Patrick Barnes, drummer Peter Parker, and bassist Marco Sin. The band released two albums for Stiff Records in the UK (Epic Records in the US), \\"Dirty Looks\\" and \\"Turn It Up\\", along with several singles. Their debut album was Stiff‚Äôs biggest ever album release in the United States, selling over 100,000 copies in 1980. \\"Turn It Up\\" was originally produced and mixed by Nick Garvey (of The Motors), Epic Records decided they did not like the edgy approach and wanted a more mainstream sound. The band was discovered by Squeeze bassist John Bentley at CBGB in New York. Bentley brought then Grand Funk Railroad manager Andy Cavaliere to the band's next show and he made the band sign a napkin promising to appear in his office the next day. Their first album; Dirty Looks was first released in America and the band launched the record by appearing unannounced outside the New York offices of EPIC on a flat-bed truck complete with PA, drums etc., and a film crew. 52nd street became filled with lunch-time office workers all grooving to the band and a bunch of New York cops from the local precinct trying to fight their way through the crowd to stop the disturbance. The result was an arrest and a fifteen-minute movie of three Dirty Looks tracks. In 1980, Dirty Looks came to the UK for the In the Son Of Stiff tour. With four other Stiff acts, Dirty Looks played 11 countries in 70 days and played 61 gigs. In Milan, they headlined in front of 6,000 fans and witnessed a fatal stabbing outside the concert hall. They are best known for the songs \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Tailing You\\", which were minor hits. Both videos were in rotation in the early days of MTV. By now Dirty Looks had released three singles: \\"Lie To Me\\", \\"Let Go\\" and \\"Tailing You\\". In 1983, the group prepared demos for an unreleased third album, called 'Unsung Heroes'. Four tracks from it were included on 12 O'Clock High, an Italian career retrospective compilation, in 2002. Bassist Marco Sin (born Marcus Robert Weissmann) died in 1995, following a lengthy history of substance abuse.

During her time managing the notorious Panama Club in Soho she met Douglas Probert-Price, her future husband, in a drug bust whilst hosting London‚Äôs rich, famous and underworld figures. Douglas, a detective at Scotland Yard, was the first commoner to become a barrister, and was once bodyguard to the actress Elizabeth Taylor. Once married, Douglas moved into the large town house where his wife had been raised by her mother in the then very popular South London suburb of Streatham. Renee enjoyed a very varied and glamorous social life, and was friends with an assortment of famous figures, including childhood friend and fellow Streatham resident, designer Norman Hartnell. Probert-Price lived as a recluse for the last 30 years of her life, especially after her husband‚Äôs death in 2000. Work on the 2014 documentary In 2014, the story of Renee Probert-Price was being documented by her great-niece and goddaughter, with an independent film, book and exhibition in development.Behind the Scene with Tania Olive Photography 2014 The collection Probert-Price built up a vast and exclusive collection of dresses over the decades, which were left to her great-niece and goddaughter following her death in 2013. There are over 360 dresses in the collection, with the particularly striking dresses collected between 1955-1965. The collection includes garments by over 140 designers and retailers, including Norman Hartnell, Christian Dior, Harvey Nicholls, Gina, Bourne and Hollingsworth, Frank Ussher, Harrods and Liberty of London. Most of the dresses have London labels, or were designed by Renee herself and made in London by her personal dressmaker. An example of Hartnell‚Äôs work within the collection is an ensemble previously exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The story is that a director and an actor who fall in love with a mysterious woman. It was followed by Aravind 2. This film was remade in Kannada as Nimma Shankarnag. The film was dubbed into Hindi as Bhayanak: A Murder Mystery in 2011. Plot Childhood friends Aravind (Rajiv Kanakala) and Rishi (Richard Rishi) struggled for film industry fame before Aravind's films with Rishi as hero become successful. They made two blockbuster films together. Then Konda thought of directing a new story written by a new writer and made a job offer to some writers. He then saw a story written by a new writer on which Aravind's co-director unfortunately dropped some ink on the script. Aravind found the script very interesting and he along with Rishi planned to go on a road trip to search for inspiration to complete the remaining script of a third film. During the ride, Aravind and Rishi meet Nirupama (Sherlyn Chopra), whom they save from goons. During the journey, Nirupama asked Rishi to overtake a 'black car' which was in front of them. Rishi then drove the car at a great speed and overtook the car but in the meantime, that 'black car' got hit by a truck but Rishi and his friends had not seen the accident, so they moved forward. Rishi slowly fell in love with Nirupama while they were staying in a cottage. But soon Aravind also found Nirupama very interesting, and he also started loving her. Aravind and Rishi then realise that the events that occurred during their journey was very similar to the script that Aravind had read earlier. The last page that he read from the script prophesied that two friends will fight with each other for a girl and, they had actually fought over Nirupama. And he called the writer of the script to the woods and asked him to complete the story. The writer said that the girl for whom the two friends were fighting is a psychopath and would kill one of the friends. Aravind believes that they might get killed, so he warns his friend Rishi to leave her and avoid her. But Rishi ignored him and wanted to elope with her and marry her. Aravind hears that a psychopath was moving in the area they live in and this news made him more sure that Nirupama was the psychopath. Aravind planned to kill Nirupama and save his friend, but then the writer of the script in the story changed the climax of the movie to make the script a romantic story instead of a thriller. As the script changed, the reality also changes with Rishi being safe, but Aravind getting killed by the psychopath (the one on the news). The reasons that made the psychopath kill Aravind and his friends was that she was in the 'black car' that met with an accident in the race. She felt that Rishi and his friends were responsible for her accident and planned to kill them. Rishi, after seeing his friend die, fought with the real psychopath and killed her.

Insects in marine environments are extremely rare while flightlessness, extreme sexual dimorphism, and an extremely short adult life span (of less than 3 hours) contribute to making these midges unusual among insects. They are known from the shores of islands in the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The genus was described by Edwards in 1926 from Samoa. They were originally described as being submarine midges.Edwards FW (1926) On marine Chironomidae (Diptera); with descriptions of a new genus and four new species from Samoa. Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 96:779‚Äì806. Four species were described in the genus P. natans (Edward 1924), P. cottoni (Wormersley 1937), P. pacifica (Tokunaga 1964), and P. oceana (Tokunaga 1964) but DNA analysis determined that cottoni was not distinguishable from natans. Larvae from Puerto Rico were found to be close enough to P. natans based on DNA sequences. This suggests that species in the genus are capable of being dispersed widely across oceans. Algae attached to sea turtles have been found carrying Pontomyia larvae and this form of hitch-hiking can potentially serve as means of dispersion. P. natans is widely distributed around the Indian and Pacific Oceans and its life history is slightly better known than other species. The adults live less than three hours long with males dying shortly after mating and females after laying eggs. Males have long antennae with the mid legs short and tipped in claws. The stubby wings are used like oars to swim at the surface of sea- water. The females are larviform, without wings or functional legs. The eggs are laid in coils in rockpools where they sink to the bottom. The larvae feed on algae and marine vegetation. Adult emergence is linked to lunar cycles, mainly at low tide, and midges are attracted to lights.

Built in 1871, it is a distinctive Victorian interpretation of a typical New England town hall, which has served the town in civic roles (as both town hall and a school) since its construction. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Ashland Town Hall is located on the north side of Highland Street, overlooking the town center to the south. The building is a distinctive Victorian interpretation of a typical New England town hall, with round-arch Italianate style windows, and transom and round-arch windows above the double doors that form the entry on the front facade. The porch that shelters the front entry is a later addition, although its arched surround is sympathetic to the building's other elements. The lower level of the interior, originally a large hall, has been extensively altered to provide space for an increasing number of town offices, while the upper level auditorium space is relatively little altered. The hall was built in 1871, three years after Ashland separated from Holderness, which had retained its town hall. Prior to construction of this building, town meetings were held in a privately owned hall on this site, which burned in April 1871. The hall was used for town meetings and elections until 1950, when a larger facility was built across the street. From 1950 to 1970, the building was used by the local school district to house classrooms. It was returned to municipal functions in 1972, and now houses town offices.

A GCM is either an external testing device or a cord mounted device that measures the electrical continuity of a circuit‚Äôs path to ground.  Regulatory  Ground continuity monitors are a means to provide protection to workers as part of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, Wiring design and protection. 29 C.F.R ¬ß 1926.404 (1996) https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p;_id=10705. This OSHA regulation applies only to construction sites. (e.g. early stages of construction where access to a reliable ground might not exist or where portable generators might be used) The use of ground continuity monitors is one option in these environments. GFCI protected circuits are also one option under the OSHA standard. Specifically, the OSHA regulation specifies ‚ÄúThe employer shall use either ground fault circuit interrupters ‚Ä¶ or an assured equipment grounding conductor program ‚Ä¶ to protect employees on construction sites.‚Äù Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, Wiring design and protection. 29 C.F.R ¬ß 1926.404(b)(1)(i) (1996). https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p;_id=10705 The OSHA regulation also requires that each ground conductor and/or cordset shall be inspected each day, prior to use and after maintenance. The ground is required to be checked for electrical continuity and this test must be documented. The automatic cord mounted GCMs eliminate the need to test each cord or circuit, since the electrical impedance to ground is measured at the attached cord device and visibility indicated there via an LED. These inspections are required by the OSHA regulation on ‚Äúreceptacles which are not a part of the permanent wiring of the building‚Äù.Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, Wiring design and protection. 29 C.F.R ¬ß 1926.404(b)(1)(iii)(D) (1996). https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p;_id=10705 As discussed earlier, the permanent wiring of a building might not be established during the early stages of a construction site and therefore would necessitate some assurance of ground protection.  Operation  Although the OSHA regulations require either a ground conductor program or a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), these two devices provide protection in very different ways. A GCFI disconnects a circuit whenever it detects that the electric current is not balanced between the energized conductor and the return neutral conductor. See main article: Residual Current Device A basic summary of the cord mounted GCM involves a conductor path from the energized conductor (‚Äúhot‚Äù or black wire) directly through a low-current LED and through the ground wire. This arrangement allows an easy visible indication of acceptable ground continuity in the ground wiring (which would be indicated by the LED being on). The minimum current draw of the LED can be designed such that an impedance value above regulatory limits will not light the LED. The arrangement of detection and components is not standardized as many manufacturers provide commercially available GCMs. Portable ground continuity testers have similar arrangements but generally provide a much broader range of testing options for electrical circuits.

The main farm house, built in part about 1818, is a rare early Cape-style house, and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Burt‚ÄìCheney Farm is located in a nominally rural setting in western Bethlehem, its setting interrupted by Interstate 93, which runs north and east of the farmstead, which stands on on the north side of US 302 northwest of its interchange with the highway. A stone wall lines the property along the road, and there are several outbuildings in addition to the main house, some of which date to the earliest days of the farm's settlement. The house is a 1¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a central chimney, gabled roof, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrically arranged windows around a center entrance. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, parlors on either side of the chimney, and a series of smaller rooms to the rear. The house's timber framing is exposed, and walls are finished with wainscoting. The oldest part of the house was built c. 1810 by Simeon Burt, one of the first settlers in the area. The building was expanded by Burt in 1817 to achieve the main block's present center-chimney appearance. It is believed to be the second-oldest house in town, and one of the best- preserved examples of an early rural farmstead in the region. The farmstead was separated from the bulk of its associated lands by the construction of Interstate 93.

It specialises in streaming historic original sounds, interviews, speeches in German language from German audio archives. The web radio stream is accompanied by a web portal which provides written information about the currently aired sound segment. A major principle of Archivradio is that original sounds are unedited and played back in full length. Typical topics in the past have been original recordings by the East German secret police Stasi, the complete proceedings of the first literature congress in Berlin after World War II (Erster Deutscher Schriftstellerkongress) or sounds from World War I, most of them recorded on Phonograph cylinders. Archivradio also gives a voice to the archivists. They appear in interviews about the specific topics of the program. The internet radio consists mainly of spoken word and only broadcasts music in a specific context. Archivradio has no typical presenter; there is only a speaker who briefly announces each title, the date and the source.  History  SWR- archivist Georg Polster, key person in the early days of Archivradio (2007) One of several tapes with original sounds from the German Autumn, streamed in full length in Archivradio Archivradio was initiated by the German public radio journalist Maximilian Sch√∂nherr and his colleague at SWR Detlef Clas in summer 2007. Sch√∂nherr's first test streams with unedited interviews from his own archive took place in 2003. The German Broadcasting Archive DRA, a non- profit foundation supported by the ARD with the largest treasures of historic original sounds in Germany, officially supports Archivradio. In 2010 the channel passed the \\"Drei-Stufen-Test\\" (three steps test), crucial for continuously staying on air. The three steps test is the certificate that Archivradio is of public and educational value and works within uncommercial limits. The funding comes from SWR2, the educational and culture FM channel of SWR. The main target audiences are historians, academics, teachers and students with historic interest. In several cases audio segments aired via Archivradio created spin-offs like radio documentaries. Two of them received the \\"Deutscher H√∂rbuchpreis\\" (German audio book award) and the award for best documentary at Radio Basel, Switzerland.Die Stammheim-Tonb√§nder, Fallbeil f√ºr G√§nsebl√ºmchen References  External links  * Archivradio ‚Äì programme website at German public broadcaster S√ºdwestrundfunk Category:Radio stations in Germany Category:S√ºdwestrundfunk ","title":"SWR2 Archivradio"},{"id":"42236452","text":"Sheet music of \\"If I Knew Then\\" \\"If I Knew Then\\" is a 1939 song written by Dick Jurgens and Eddy Howard, and performed by Jurgens' big band with Howard singing.William Emmett Studwell, Mark Baldin -The Big Band Reader: Songs Favored by Swing Era Orchestras 2000 \\" \\"If I Knew Then\\" (1939) ... \\" Their version charted briefly in 1939.

Early life  Appian was born in Lyon and changed his name to Adolphe Appian when he became fifteen. At the age of fifteen Appian attended the Ecole des Beaux-Arts at Lyon which was an art school which specialized in training to decorate fabrics by a local silk industry. He studied under Jean- Michel Grobon and Augustin Alexandre Thierrat. Later he opened a studio in Lyon and worked as a graphic designer. He travelled to Paris to finish his studies and after he had exhibited a painting and a charcoal drawing in the Paris Salon in 1853 he became friends with Camille Corot and Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny who greatly influenced his style. Appian was elected a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.  Works  In 1866, Appian's two works that he exhibited in Paris were bought by Napoleon III and by princess Mathilde. He painted at the beginning of his career atmospheric pictures in a monochromatic palette of the riverside of the Rhone and the south of France. In 1870 he changed his style to use brilliant and striking color in his paintings but he still continued to make charcoal drawings as well as small etchings of landscapes in the Barbizon style.Fine Art Museums of San Francisco As an etcher, he had a distinct influence on the American artist, Stephen Parrish.Laurence S.

It has suffered from political instability and has had undemocratic rule for much of its history. There is a lack of access to basic facilities, people have superstitious beliefs, and there is high levels of gender discrimination. Although the Constitution provides for protection of women, including equal pay for equal work, but the Government has not taken significant action to implement its provisions. The status of women in Nepal remains very poor in terms of health, education, income, decision-making, and access to policy making. Patriarchal practices, which control these women's lives, are reinforced by the legal system. Women face systematic discrimination, particularly in rural areas. Literacy rates are substantially lower than men's, and women work longer hours. Violence against women is still common, and there are not enough women in professions. Women‚Äôs representation has been ensured in constituent assembly, but women‚Äôs equal participation in all state mechanisms is far from ideal.  History  One of the first forms of discrimination against women in Nepal began with the practice of Sati, which was eradicated by Rana Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher, though even after that the patriarchal situation continued, with women receiving limited access to resources and opportunity. Few of the major issues faced by women were Gender Based Violence, Child marriage, trafficking of women, transitional justice, unequal representation and participation of women in decision making. Literacy rates in Nepal still remain low, at 52.74% (CBS, 2001). Despite improvement in recent years, the disparity in literacy rates between men and women still remains. In 2001, the rate of literacy for females stood at 42.49%. The low rate of literacy for women can be attributed to the discrimination they face at home. Females face gender-based violence and this greatly limits their ability to attend school or receive proper education. Furthermore, religion restricts the opportunities for women to receive education. For example, the majority of the female Muslim population in Nepal is still deprived of basic education, with only 20% having had any level of education. The percentage of women from rural areas who have never attended school: 51.1% (CBS, 2008) as compared to the percentage of women from urban areas who have never attended school is 25% (CBS, 2008). This is reflected in the disparity in literacy rates, between women in rural areas, 36.5%, and those in urban areas, 61.5%. Literacy rates in rural areas are almost half that in urban areas. Although overall female participation in the workforce has increased, the majority of employed women are still heavily concentrated in the low-wage and more labor-intensive industries. Formal sector female participation is 6%. According to the 2008 report from CBS, there were 155 000 male professionals, but only 48 000 female professionals, about 31% of female professionals. This is in stark contrast to female participation in the subsistence agricultural sector, with female participation almost 160% that of male participation. Due to the growing inequality and violence against women, free legal aid was made available by the government of Nepal through the enactment of Legal Aid Act 1997, though the majority target groups of women, children and disenfranchised are unable to access it. Women's rights were only taken seriously once Nepal was under democratic rule post 1990, and a constitution was formed stating equality between men and women as a fundamental right. The newly elected democratic government ratified numerous laws and international treaties specific to women, and The Nepal Treaty Act 1990 ensured that international human rights provisions will be given preference in case of conflict with domestic laws. The laws enforced in 1990 were only finally enacted in 2006, and since the 1990s, Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was the one of the key tools used by women to voice their opinions and enactment of women's rights. The 1990s saw substantial changes in laws within Nepal, which facilitated the interest and formation of NGOs, both as recipients of these programs and as staff members of the NGOS. This began the movement of women empowerment and mobilization of women's NGOs. Due to ongoing violence and discrimination against women, United Nation's recommendations of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review to Government of Nepal, March 2011 included guaranteeing full right to equality and non-discrimination between men and women in line with the international standards (with that of Italy) Furthermore, CEDAW Committee‚Äôs Concluding Observations and Recommendations to Government of Nepal, August 2011 included introducing monitoring mechanisms for better implementation of laws and plans pertaining to equality and development of gender disparity indicators. Access to Health Services Health services in Nepal are inadequate and insufficient and are thus reflected in the low health status of Nepalese in relation to the rest of the Southeast Asian region.The most common illnesses that females at reproductive age face are anemia and malnutrition, due to the discrimination faced in childhood and while growing up. As females, especially girls, are considered to be of the lowest status in the household, they are often the last to eat and thus do not receive the proper nutrition required. Almost 70% of females who have reached puberty suffer from these common illnesses. Also, many women often delay seeking medical help out of fear. The maternal mortality ratio in Nepal, stands at 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, according to estimates by the WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/The World Bank. Although there has been a significant decrease as compared to the ratio of 539 per 100 000 live births in 2003, the ratio is still one of the highest in the world. Because of the inadequate provision of healthcare for pregnant mothers, they are more susceptible to death during the course of pregnancy and during labor itself. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2001, about 10% of all births are carried out in the presence of a qualified doctor or medical staff. This reflects the prevalence of home births, around 81% of all births, in Nepalese society. Due to the cultural beliefs, women are generally reluctant to allow any outsiders to be present or attend to the birth. Geography has also greatly limited the availability of health services especially those in rural and mountainous regions. Even though there has been much road development in recent years, females are less impacted by it, as they remain infrequent road users. Gender-Based Violence to women Gender-based violence (GBV) towards women is a severe issue in Nepal where its women often find themselves susceptible to both public and domestic violence which constitutes rape, sexual abuse in the workplace and at home, and human trafficking. There is a persistence of harmful traditional practices deemed life-threatening such as Deuki (act of offering young girls to Hindu temples to live without proper care or education) and Chhaupadi (menstruating women are kept in a shed away from the home to live under harsh conditions). Based on the study by United Nations Population Fund‚Äôs (UNFPA) entitled Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women in Nepal, abused women are more inclined to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and various reproductive health problems. In the recently published Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2012 by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a study of all 75 districts across the country returned results of 648 women as victims of violence in 2011. In addition, the number of girls under the age of 18 who were affected stands at 379. The proportion of Nepali women who have been subjected to domestic violence are estimated at 60 to 70 per cent. Gender-based violence is worse in rural communities where an estimated 81 per cent of women experience recurring domestic violence. These incidences include physical abuse by husbands, polygamy, dowry-related murders, and physical and psychological harassment by household members. Reasons for gender-based violence in Nepal are largely attributed to social taboos and superstitions associated with women and deeply entrenched beliefs that propagate derogatory attitudes toward female such as Chhori ko janma hare ko karma (\\"A daughter is born with a doomed fate\\"). Likewise, results derived from INSEC‚Äôs monitoring of the situation indicated that subjugating women to domestic violence was considered a deep-rooted traditional practice. Survey results also show that 20 and 23 per cent of men and women in Nepal view domestic violence as being acceptable. Despite efforts of various human rights and women‚Äôs rights NGOs, together with international aid agencies, to lobby for the elimination of domestic violence through implementation of more effective measures, the \\"Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment)\\" bill introduced in 2002 is at a standstill. Complaints by women‚Äôs rights activists are directed towards the lackadaisical efforts of the law enforcement agencies in which disputes are settled without any charges pressed against the perpetrators. This is reflected in a statement by activist and former National Women Commission (NWC) chairperson Bandana Rana, \\"Often, police and local people try to settle the domestic dispute by pressing the women into accepting their ‚Äòfate‚Äô as the society is still dominated by Hindu patriarchy with its own set of strict codes‚Äîmany of which are in conflict with basic rights for women\\". In May 2020, following the Covid-19 pandemic, the HRW reported that social media groups are abusing Nepali women and girls online. The rights group said that offenders are using intimate photos usually obtained from victims‚Äô social media accounts and also using hacking, coercion, or blackmail as a method. The impact of such incident harms their mental health, reputations, relationships, and access to education and employment, the report added.

Hauptman, \\"From Carlisle to Carnegie Hall: The Musical Career of Dennison Wheelock\\", in The Oneida Indians in the Age of Allotment, 1860-1920, (editors) Laurence M. Hauptman and Gordon L. McLester, Volume 253, The Civilization of the American Indian Series, (hereinafter \\"Hauptman\\"),(2006), p. 112. Also, see Elaine Goodale Eastman, Pratt: The Red Man's Moses, (hereinafter \\"Eastman\\"), (1935), p.212. Wheelock was compared at the time to John Philip Sousa, and nominated to be bandmaster of the United States Marine Band.Hauptman, P. 122. At the age of 40 he became an American Indian rights activist and attorney, and within several years was arguing cases for Indian nations at the United States Court of Claims and US Supreme Court. Wheelock was born in the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin. He went to Pennsylvania to be educated at the Carlisle Indian School, returning later for study at Dickinson Preparatory School. Wheelock was appointed as the first Oneida bandmaster of the internationally acclaimed Carlisle Indian School Band, which performed at world fairs, expositions, and presidential inaugurals. While at the school, he composed the Sousa-inspired \\"Carlisle Indian School March.\\" In 1900 he debuted his three-part symphony, Aboriginal Suite, at Carnegie Hall in New York City. In 1911 Wheelock was among the 50 founding members of the Society of American Indians, the first national American Indian rights organization developed and run by American Indians. He had read the law and passed the bar that year, practicing first in Wisconsin. As he represented more Indian nations in his practice, he moved to Washington D.C., where he represented them in actions against the government in the United States Court of Claims and the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1980, to honor him and the celebrated Carlisle Indian Band, Dennison Wheelock's Bandstand was reconstructed on the site of the original at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Early life Brothers Dennison and James Wheelock served as bandmasters, Carlisle Indian School, Carlisle, PA, c.1885 Dennison Wheelock was born June 14, 1871, in the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, second child of James A. Wheelock and Sophia Doxtator.Dennison was baptized at the Hobart Episcopal Church. Hauptman, P. 114. He had an older brother Charles and a total of eight other brothers and sisters, and half-siblings. Dennison grew up in the 1870s and early 1880s in a poor Oneida farm community, which was faced with increasing economic pressures to harvest its timber and a federal push for the allotment of tribal lands to individual households. The Nation struggled with high alcohol consumption and tribal infighting.Hauptman, P. 114. Dennison took up the cornet after hearing his older brother, Charles, playing it. He was impressed by a visiting Tuscarora musician, who taught the youth music reading and simple composition for several months. In 1879, Seneca and Tuscarora musicians won medals of excellence at state fairs.Hauptman, P. 115 Dennison also heard the popular band music of John Philip Sousa at Wisconsin fairs. Locally, the Oneida Union Band and the Oneida National Band were prominent in community events and throughout the Midwest. Carlisle Indian School The collaborative effort between Dickinson College and Carlisle Indian School lasted almost four decades, from the opening day to the closing of the school. Old West, Dickinson College, 1810 Dickinson College provided Carlisle Indian School students with access to preparatory and college-level education, and Dickinson professors served as chaplains and special faculty to the Indian School. left For more than 100 years, numerous Iroquois children, including Oneida, had been sent away from home to Christian schools for education. It was a tradition Wheelock likely heard about. Moor's Indian Charity School, now Dartmouth College, was founded in 1755 by Eleazar Wheelock, a Puritan minister. He established the school to train Native Americans as missionaries. Dennison's surname was adopted by an Oneida ancestor as a tribute to Wheelock.Hauptman, P. 116.Hamilton-Oneida Academy, now Hamilton College, was a seminary founded in 1793 by Presbyterian Samuel Kirkland as part of his missionary work with the Oneida in New York State, their traditional territory. The Oneida people from Wisconsin and New York constituted one of the largest Indian nation's contingents at Carlisle Indian School. Only the Lakota, Chippewa and Seneca had more students enrolled. Between 1885 and 1917, more than 500 Oneida students attended Carlisle. In January 1884 at age 13, Wheelock wrote to Captain Richard Henry Pratt, Superintendent of the Carlisle Indian School, referring to his \\"limited musical education\\" and his musical awakening. In 1885, Wheelock enrolled in the Carlisle Indian School to study under Pratt. Dennison excelled in the classroom, and as a champion debater; he also was a fine tenor in the choir and cornetist extraordinaire in the band. In June 1890, Dennison graduated from Carlisle. He returned to Oneida, Wisconsin, where he started teaching and was appointed as a justice of the peace. But within a year, Wheelock returned to Carlisle. With Pratt's recommendation, he enrolled in the nearby Dickinson Preparatory School. Dickinson College provided Carlisle Indian students with access to college-level education through the Dickinson Preparatory School (\\"Conway Hall\\"). Only a select few of Carlisle students were recommended to this institution. Dennison attended Dickinson Preparatory school from 1891-1892.Hauptman, P. 123.In 1891, the 20-year-old Wheelock served as the Carlisle School's ambassador of goodwill, and dazzled reformers at the Lake Mohonk Conference of Friends of the Indians with a Pratt-like speech. \\"Hauptman, P. 121\\">Hauptman, P. 121 In 1892, Pratt appointed Wheelock as assistant clerk, working directly for him at the School. Later that year, Pratt appointed the young man as bandmaster, a position he would hold for more than eight years, until 1900. Music at Carlisle During the Progressive Era, from the late 19th century until the onset of World War I, Native American performers were major draws and money-makers. Millions of visitors at world fairs, exhibitions, and parades throughout the United States and Europe saw Native Americans portrayed as the vanishing race, exotic peoples, and objects of modern comparative anthropology.David R.M. Beck, The Myth of the Vanishing Race, University of Montana, 2000. L.G. Moses, Wild West Shows and the Images of American Indians, 1883-1933, (hereinafter \\"Wild West Shows and Images\\") (1996), pp.131, 140. Reformers and Progressives fought a war of words and images against the popular Wild West shows at world fairs, expositions and parades. They opposed theatrical portrayals of Wild Westers as vulgar heathen stereotypes. In contrast, Carlisle students were portrayed as a new generation of Native American leadership embracing civilization, education and industry. Music was an important part of the Carlisle curriculum. Every student took music classes, and many received private instruction. Captain Pratt had three goals for the Carlisle musical program: to acculturate Indian school children to majority European-American culture; to use music to promote discipline, with emphasis on the drills of the popular marching bands; and to generate favorable public attention, in order to win continued political and philanthropic support and financing for the school.Hauptman, p.119. Federal appropriations for Carlisle decreased from $128,000 in 1891 to $110,000 in 1899, while the average student attendance rose from 754 to 878. To manage the daily operations, Pratt needed funding from outside sources, such as philanthropy, sales of student crafts, manufactures and agricultural produce, or proceeds from concerts and sports events. R.L. Brunhouse, A History of the Carlisle Indian School: A Phase of Government Indian Policy: 1879 to 1918, MA thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1935. He sent the Carlisle Band on tour directed by Wheelock; this brought favorable publicity for the school and financial support from philanthropists. Hauptman, p.135, n.22. Development of the music program at Carlisle was supported largely by private philanthropy, rather than federal funds.Hauptman, P. 118. Around 1879, a visiting philanthropist from Boston reported hearing \\"tom-toms\\" and Indian singing in the dormitories. Pratt preferred that the \\"tom-toms\\" stopped, but said, > It wouldn't be fair to do unless I can give them something else as good, or > better, on the same line. If you will give me a set of brass instruments, I > will give them to the \\"tom-tom boys\\" and they can toot on them, and this > will stop the \\"tom-tom.\\" Pratt soon received a set of musical instruments: cornets, clarinets, and pianos from Boston. While classical European music was emphasized at Carlisle, the students also sang and drummed traditional tribal music in their dormitories. They played samples of such music at assembly and local community programs. Later, Wheelock featured American Indian music with classical European music in his opera, Aboriginal Suite.On June 20, 1890, the Indian Helper, the Carlisle school publication, noted that an assembly was \\"enlivened by music. We had duets, singing duets, choirs singing, quartets and sextets, operatic and playing, by babies and old men, music on the horns and music without, red music and white music, and all kinds of music.\\"Hauptman, Pp. 113‚Äì114, 116.

First Inaugural Parade of Theodore Roosevelt, March 4, 1905. President Roosevelt waved his hat and members of the President's box rose to their feet to see the six famous Native American chiefs in full regalia on horseback, followed by the 46-piece Carlisle Indian School Band and a brigade of 350 Carlisle Cadets. Pratt established the Carlisle Indian School band in 1880. By the time Wheelock entered the school in the mid-1880s, musical programs were a common feature of the school. Band members mastered Greig, Mozart, Rossini, Schubert and Wagner. They frequently performed at school assemblies, holiday festivities and at the Carlisle Opera House, delighting the students, teachers and administrators at the school and gaining favorable attention among the local white townspeople.Hauptman, P. 123. In 1892, Dennison was appointed bandmaster of the Carlisle Indian Band, a position he would hold for over eight years, until 1900. Wheelock was the first American Indian bandmaster at Carlisle. After his tenure, his brother James took up the baton.Barbara Landis, \\"About the Carlisle Indian Industrial School\\", http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/erdrich/boarding/carlisle.htm. Under the leadership of Dennison Wheelock and James Wheelock, the Carlisle Indian Band earned an international reputation of musical excellence.Eastman, p. 212. The Carlisle Indian Band performed at world fairs, expositions, concert venues and at every national presidential inaugural celebration until the school closed. Taking over the reins of the Carlisle Indian School Band, he recruited new members. Dennison continued to perform at as a solo cornetist and his younger brother James, a student at the school, became a fixture on the \\"E-Clarinet. \\" Wheelock's commitment to music extended beyond the classroom and the bandstand the Carlisle. Throughout the 1890s, he was also composing songs, popular \\"fluff\\", band music, as well as the symphony, which he finally completed in 1900.Hauptman, P. 125. By 1894, the band and the Carlisle Women's Choir, performed throughout the East. On April 15, 1894, the New York Times did a feature on Wheelock with his portrait and band, reviewing their performance at the city's Lenox Lyceum. The review noted \\"few metropolitan bands can boast of greater care and accuracy in the execution of their music.\\" \\"Among other offerings, the band played Mozart and Wagner as well as two selections compose by Wheelock himself: \\"The Carlisle Indian School March\\" and a piece entitled \\"American Medley.\\" \\"The concert's patrons read as a \\"Who's Who\\" of New York's elite families, including Mrs. J. Pierpont Morgan, Mrs. Russell Sage, Mrs. James Harriman and Mrs. Elihu Root. Marriage Louise LaChapelle (Wheelock), a Chippewa from the White Earth Reservation in northwestern Minnesota, arrived as a student at Carlisle two years earlier than Dennison. They met, courted, married and had four children. Richard Edmund Wheelock,Richard Edmund Wheelock (December 5, 1896-October 15, 1929) Paul Wheelock,Paul Wheelock (August 18, 1899-May 15, 1900). Paul is buried at the relocated Indian cemetery at the US Army war College. Haupman, P. 117. Leeland Lloyd Wheelock Leeland Lloyd Wheelock (January 28, 1902-January 26, 1903) and Louise Frances Wheelock.Louise Frances Wheelock (April 20, 1903-June 18, 1938) Their first two children were born in Carlisle. Captain Richard Henry Pratt Captain Pratt was Dennison's mentor and school father, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was Dennison's second-home. Wheelock corresponded with Pratt for over 35 years and confided in each other throughout their lives. Wheelock had affection for Pratt, his wife and Carlisle. Wheelock shared Pratt's views. Both saw federal Indian boarding schools as a temporary educational formula to \\"uplift\\" the Indians, and called for the abolishment of Indian reservations and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They focused upon the release of Indians from federal control, full citizenship, equal opportunity and education in public schools. Wheelock and Pratt had little faith in the efficacy of the Society of American Indians to make real changes, since they believed that the organization had too many BIA bureaucrats, na√Øve reformers from the Indian Rights Association another \\"paper shooters.\\" Wheelock judged the BIA and reservation system as \\"retarding\\" Indian progress. Haupman, P.120,122,130. From 1921 to 1922, Captain Pratt lobbied President Warren G. Harding to nominate Wheelock to be Commissioner of Indian affairs.Hauptman, P. 117. James Riley Wheelock Chief James Wheelock's Band Under the leadership of Dennison Wheelock and James Wheelock, the Carlisle Indian Band earned an international reputation of musical excellence.Eastman, p. 212. Benjey, p. 308. James Riley Wheelock was a younger brother of bandmaster Dennison Wheelock and graduated from Carlisle in 1896.James Riley Wheelock (Unknown- Jan 11, 1941) Like Dennis, James attended the prestigious Dickinson College Preparatory School after completing his Carlisle studies.The Carlisle Arrow, Volumes 13‚Äì14, April 23, 1917. When Dennison resigned as Bandmaster in 1900, James succeeded him. In 1903, James studied music and his specialty, clarinet, in Leipzig, Germany.Journal of Band Research, Volumes 30-31, 1994, and http://arts.unl.edu/music/faculty/peter-m- lefferts. In 1909, James clashed with Superintendent Moses Friedman, Pratt's successor. Wheelock recruited Carlisle students to tour with his professional band during the summer, believing the experience would fit into the parameters of Carlisle's outing program. Superintendent Friedman refused, but several boys from the band attempted join Wheelock's band and had their trunks taken to the train depot. Friedman discovered the plan and the boys were locked in the guardhouse as punishment for their actions. The rest of the Carlisle Band was so resentful at these measures, they refused to perform during that evening's \\"salute to the flag, \\" a daily ritual at Carlisle. James was infuriated by Friedman's actions and charged in newspapers that the Superintendent was jealous of his band's success, was the cause of disciplinary problems at the school and that the students were illegally held in a \\"dungeon.\\" Friedman responded that he had refused permission because in the past, \\"students indulged in the kind of dissipation and debauchery during the summer which taints and brings about an unhealthy condition in the fall when they return to school.\\" The story made local headlines and embarrassed both Carlisle and the Office of Indian Affairs. After several weeks and an official investigation, the matter was dropped. The students who forged resistance through the flag controversy rebelled because of their intense desire to perform beyond the campus.John W. Troutman, \\"Indiana Blues: American Indians and the Politics of Music, 1879‚Äì1934, (2009), p.140-141. In 1914, the Harrisburg Telegraph reported that James Riley Wheelock, director of the Enola Band, was performing in clarinet solos and was one of the best clarinet players in Pennsylvania.Harrisburg Telegraph, March 10, 1914, p.2 During World War I, Wheelock was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army, where he conducted a black regimental band. After the war, he conducted the famous U.S. Indian Band and others well into the 1920s.Hauptman, P. 114. See Journal of Band Research, Volumes 30-31, 1994, and http://arts.unl.edu/music/faculty/peter-m-lefferts. Wheelocks at Carlisle The Wheelocks were likely the first family of Carlisle Indian School, because there were so many of them, and they were mentioned prominently in Carlisle publications.Benjey, p. 308. See Benjey, \\"The Wheelock Family Tree\\", http://tombenjey.com/2010/02/19/the-wheelock-family-tree/ and http://musescore.org/node/6645. The Oneida people from Wisconsin and New York was one of the largest contingents of Indians at Carlisle, and only the Lakota, Chippewas and Senecas had more students. Between 1885 and 1917, over five hundred Oneida students attended Carlisle.Hauptman, P. 116. Of Wheelock's nine brothers, half-brothers, sisters and half sisters, only two-his oldest brother Charles, who also played the cornet, and his youngest half-brother, Harrison did not attend. In addition, several of his first and second cousins were enrolled at the school.Hauptman, p.117. Dennison's younger brothers Hugh Wheelock and Joel Wheelock, who attended Carlisle, were also accomplished musicians, and later directed their own all-Indian bands. Sister Ida Wheelock was active in school organizations such as the Susan Longstreth Literary Society, and Martin Frederick Wheelock, a cousin of Dennison, played American football for the Carlisle Indians from 1894-1902.http://musescore.org/node/6645 In August 1914, Dennison wrote Oscar Lipps, Acting Superintendent at Carlisle: \\"My sister, Martha Wheelock, aged twenty years, whose term expired at Flandreau, South Dakota last June, and is now with me in West De Pere, desires to be admitted to the Carlisle Indian School as a pupil. I am very anxious that she shall go if possible. She is in eighth grade. My son, Edmund is also very anxious to have the benefit of a diploma from Carlisle on account of the prestige it carries with it throughout the West.\\" Edmund, who was born in at the Carlisle Indian School in 1896, had been attending public school in Wisconsin and doing well, but Dennison was concerned about the environment. \\"Unfortunately, however, De Pere is a city of less than five thousand inhabitants, yet has in the neighborhood of twenty- two, or twenty-four saloons, and on account of what is falsely termed liberal sentiment, the saloon keepers do not hold strictly to the law of the land, and as a result we see young boys very frequently under the influence of liquor.\\" Within a month, both Edmund and Martha were attending Carlisle and active in school life and literary societies.Thomas Benjey, \\"Dennison Wheelock sent his son to Carlisle\\", http://tombenjey.com/category/joel-wheelock/. International fame =Carlisle Indian Band= On March 28, 1900, Wheelock and the US Indian Band performed at Carnegie Hall and debuted his three part symphony titled \\"Aboriginal Suite.\\" Carnegie Hall, New York City Paris Exposition. In the early years of the 20th century, Wheelock was compared to John Philip Sousa, and even nominated to be his successor as bandmaster of United States Marine Band.Hauptman, P. 122. Wheelock relished Sousa's music, known for American march music.Bierley, Paul Edmund, \\"The Incredible Band of John Philip Sousa\\". University of Illinois Press, 2006. Sousa organized a band the year he left the U.S. Marine Band, touring from 1892‚Äì1931 and performing at 15,623 concerts On October 10, 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus landing in the New World, Wheelock's thirty-one piece Carlisle Indian Band, along with 300 Carlisle boys and girls, marched on Fifth Avenue in New York City past Washington Square.Hauptman, P. 124. The nation's newspapers praised the boys and girls for their \\"intelligent faces and dignified bearing.\\" \\"But the one that caught the crowd was the Indian band that had the delegation from Carlisle. With the smoothest harmony and in most perfect time, this band played a marching anthem as it passed the reviewing stand. Both the melody and spectacle or so when usual that the people rose to their feet and cheered again and again. The Indian boys marched with perfect step, and they came opposite President Benjamin Harrison's stand with the military precision that no pale faced organization equaled.\\" In 1893, by the time the Carlisle contingent reached Chicago for the beginning of the Columbian Exposition, newspapers nationwide reported about Pratt and his Carlisle Indian students. Upon his return to Carlisle, Wheelock began a nationwide effort to recruit for Carlisle the most promising young Indian musicians from other boarding schools for the best talent. He also started to teach music, now being referred to as \\"Professor. \\" In 1894, Wheelock along with the Carlisle Women's Choir performed throughout the East. In 1896, Wheelock published the Carlisle Indian School March. Also, he presented a composition From Savagery to Civilization for the 17th anniversary celebration of the founding of Carlisle. Dennison performed as a soloist with the band, and the schools newspaper reported that the \\"sounds produced led up from the wild tom-tom, to curious and intricate twists and turns to the sweet and classic streams of civilized horns.\\" Hauptman, P. 126. The composition was a prelude to Dennison's Aboriginal Suite, which he debuted in 1900 at Carnegie Hall. =The Aboriginal Suite= Carlisle Indian School March, 1896 In 1897, Wheelock traveled around the country recruiting musicians for a 70-piece, all-Indian student band to expand the Carlisle Indian Band as a new U.S. Indian Band. During this time, he completed his Aboriginal Suite, a full symphony in three parts: \\"Morning on the Plains\\", \\"The Lovers Song\\" and \\"Dance of the Red Men.\\"Haupman, P. 126. Wheelock planned to perform this symphony at the Paris Exposition of 1900 and the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, New York. Wheelock was thought to be influenced by the music of European composer Edvard Grieg. On March 28, 1900, Wheelock and the U.S. Indian Band performed his Aboriginal Suite at Carnegie Hall, a prestigious venue in New York City. A reviewer for Metronome reported that the concert was part of \\"a series being given by the organization prior to its departure for Paris, where it will demonstrate a new development in Indian civilization.\\" The band also played selections from Gounod's opera Faust (opera) and Meyerbeer's The Huguenots. The response to the concert was overwhelmingly positive: \\"A large and genuinely enthusiastic audience greeted the reservation musicians, forcing them to respond to repeated encores.\\" Hauptman, P. 127. Wheelock said in an interview, > The original Indian music is a strange thing. It is devoid of harmony, but > the melody and time are there, and it is easily harmonized. Some great > critics say that our aboriginal music is the same as played by all primitive > people world over. Chinese music itself is built on the same principle and I > am planning out the composition called the evolution of music. I hope to > show the growth of harmony. First, so many musicians will come out in Indian > costume, play some primitive melody. Others will follow playing something > more advanced, and so on until the whole band is on stage and we are > rendering the best grand opera.Hauptman, P. 128. Six weeks later, Wheelock's 10-month-old son Paul died in Carlisle. he and Louise were grief-stricken, and the school canceled the band's appearance in Paris. In tribute to Wheelock, the National Band of France played the Aboriginal Suite for him. =Haskell Indian School= In 1900, after his son died at Carlisle, Wheelock resigned his post to move his career elsewhere. He worked as a newspaperman in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and then a disciplinarian at the U.S. Indian School at Flandreau, South Dakota. Wheelock performed as guest bandmaster at Willow Grove Park, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This premier venue featured Sousa and his band at the music pavilion every year but one between 1901 and 1926. On one occasion, Wheelock drew 70,000 people to a concert. He was later awarded a gold medal and a silver cup for his brilliant conducting. In 1903, Wheelock was appointed bandmaster of Haskell Indian School in Lawrence, Kansas, where his efforts were nationally acclaimed. In March 1904, a review in Metronome called the band an \\"up-to-date aggregation of capable musicians trained in every respect for high-class concert work.\\" \\"Besides performing \\"their own quaint Indian songs they played Gounod, Mendelssohn, Mozart and Wagner\\".Hauptman, P. 129. In 1904, Wheelock's Haskell Indian Band performed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, known as the St. Louis World's Fair. The band performed a mixture of classical and popular music, and Wheelock's Aboriginal Suite. This included Native dances and war whoops by band members. The Carlisle Indian Band also performed at the Pennsylvania state pavilion.Parezo, Nancy J. and Fowler, Don D., \\"The 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition: Anthropology Goes to the Fair\\", (2007), p.156. That year Captain Pratt was forced out of his post as superintendent at Carlisle by BIA officials. His network of philanthropists stopped donating to American Indian music, and Wheelock faced a financial struggle. He was supporting an aging father, numerous siblings, wife and son. He resigned from Haskell to seek better-paying employment.Hauptman, P. 127-129. Society of American Indians The first conference of the Society of American Indians, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, 1911 Wheelock was among 50 founders of the Society of American Indians, the first national American Indian rights organization developed and run by American Indians. Wheelock was among the 50 founders in 1911 of the Society of American Indians (1911-1923), the first national American Indian rights organization developed and run by American Indians. The Society pioneered 20th-century Pan-Indianism, the philosophy and movement promoting unity among American Indians regardless of tribal affiliation. The Society was a forum for a new generation of American Indian leaders known as Red Progressives: they were mostly prominent professionals from the fields of medicine, nursing, law, government, education, anthropology, ethnology and ministry. They shared an enthusiasm and faith in the inevitability of progress through education and governmental action. The Society met at academic institutions, maintained a Washington headquarters, conducted annual conferences, and published a quarterly journal of literature by American Indian authors. The Society promoted an \\"American Indian Day\\", and led the fight for Indians to have United States citizenship. It lobbied to have U.S. Court of Claims available to hear cases of all tribes and bands in United States. The Society of American Indians was the forerunner of modern organizations such as the National Congress of American Indians. It anticipated important Indian reforms: a major reorganization of the Indian school system in the late 1920s, the codification of Indian law in the 1930s, and the opening of the U.S. Court of Claims to all Indian nations in the 1940s.Hazel W. Hertzberg, The Search for an American Indian Identity: Modern Pan-Indian Movements, Syracuse University Press, 1971, p. 117. =Petition to President Woodrow Wilson= In October 1914, Wheelock hosted the Society's 1914 annual convention in Madison, Wisconsin.Hauptman, P. 130. In December 1914, the Society met in Washington D.C, where its members received a first- class reception from the federal government. Commissioner of Indian Affairs Cato Sells welcomed them to the nation's capital where they toured the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He arranged for a visit to the White House to meet with President Woodrow Wilson. Wheelock presented the president with the Society's petition asking for appointment of a three-member commission to gain US citizenship for American Indians, and for broadening jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Claims so that it could hear all Indian nation claims against the United States. He said to Wilson, \\"We believe that you feel, with the progressive members of your race, that it is anomalous permanently to conserve within the nation groups of people whose civic condition by legislation is different from the normal standard of American life.\\" The outbreak of World War I impeded federal enactment of remedial Indian legislation.Linda M. Waggoner, Fire Light: The Life of Angel De Cora, Winnebago Artist, (2008), p. 229 As an attorney, Wheelock later represented Indian nations before the U.S. Court of Claims and the U.S. Supreme Court. Law career US Court of Claims and the US Supreme Court. In 1910, Wheelock decided to go into law. He took up the study of law by returning to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he had a wide professional network. He \\"reading the law\\" as an apprentice at the office of John Miller, head of the Cumberland County Bar Association.www.cumberlandbar.com He served as a legal apprentice to Miller. In 1911, after completing his training, Wheelock returned to Wisconsin, and completed requirements to be admitted to the Bar. He established his residence and practice in De Pere, near the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin. Wheelock became one of the most successful attorneys in Brown and Outagamie counties. He represented both Indian and non-Indian clients, although in this period, anti- Indian sentiments were rising in North Central Wisconsin. In 1915, Dennison also led the Green Bay Concert Band, which was composed largely of non-Indian musicians.Hauptman, P. 131. During the next decade, Wheelock expanded his practice well beyond Wisconsin. By 1923, he was specializing in representing tribal nations, ranging across the country from those in Washington State to New York, including the Nisqually, Menominee, Mohawk, and Stockbridge-Munsee Band. As he was increasingly representing these nations in claims and actions related to the federal government, he moved his law practice to Washington, DC. There he argued appellate cases before the US Supreme Court and the US Court of Claims.Hauptman, pp. 129, 133. Benjey, p. 308 Later years In 1921, Wheelock served as general manager and bandmaster of the Oneida Indian Centennial Celebration, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the tribe's migration to Wisconsin. His band performed Bizet's Carmen and Western classics. The American Indian nations of Wisconsin set up a traditional-style village, where they sold traditional baskets and other crafts, as well as Indian foods. A special grandstand was used for Indians to perform and celebrate Menominee and Oneida music and dancing.Hauptman, P. 131-132. Wheelock continued his practice in Washington, DC until his death on March 10, 1927, at the age of 56. He was buried in a Masonic funeral at Woodlawn Cemetery, Brown County, Wisconsin.Hauptman, P. 133. His wife Louise LaChapelle Wheelock died on January 16, 1931. She was buried next to him.

The paper discusses the bands of federal Native American boarding schools during their heyday (1880s‚Äì1930s). It sketches the careers of the three most successful bandmasters: Oneida brothers Dennison and James Riley Wheelock, and European-American Nels Samuel Nelson. The paper explores how the repertoire and band dress changed to reflect government policy during these decades.

Life  Ursula G√ºnther was born Ursula R√∂sse in Hamburg.*Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht, \\"G√ºnther, Ursula\\". In The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). After studying piano with D. Kraus and H. E. Riebensahm and music theory with H. Stahmer in Hamburg, she graduated with a music teacher's degree in 1947. From 1948 she studied music with Heinrich Husmann at the University of Hamburg along with other subjects such as art history, German and Romance Literature, philosophy, psychology, and phonetics. In 1957 at Hamburg she wrote a thesis under the tutelage of Heinrich Besseler on the change in style of the French song in the second half of the fourteenth century which built onto the research of Friedrich Ludwig. With financial support from her husband, encouragement from Gilbert Reaney, Armen Carapetyan, and, from 1962, funds from the German Research Foundation, she took the position as a teacher in Ahrensburg in order to finish her habilitation which had been rejected by some German professors. Encouraged also by Oliver Strunk and Nanie Bridgeman, she joined in 1969 the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris as attach√© de recherche (researcher) and was promoted as charg√© de recherche (research fellow) with Jacques Chailley in 1975, where she taught as a lecturer at the Sorbonne from 1969 to 1971 to prepare her \\"Doctorat d' √©tat\\" on Verdi's French years. After obtaining her habilitation in G√∂ttingen in 1972 with an edition of motets of the fourteenth century (published in 1965 by A. Carapetayan in CMM 39), she taught one semester as a lecturer in G√∂ttingen before returning to Paris to resume her work as \\"charg√© de recherche\\". In the summer of 1973 she was a visiting professor at New York University and was subsequently invited to give lectures by numerous American universities such as Princeton, Harvard, Brandeis, Philadelphia, Maryland, Bloomington, UC Davis, and Los Angeles. She was later appointed as charg√© de cours (lecturer) by the Free University in Brussels to teach the history of music notation. In 1973, she turned down an offer from Brandeis University and in 1975 took a job as a lecturer at the University of G√∂ttingen. While she continued to teach in Brussels, in 1977 was appointed professor at the University of G√∂ttingen and finally gave up her post at the CNRS. The new University Act of the State of Lower Saxony enabled her to be director of Musicology in G√∂ttingen for some time. In 1977, she held summer courses on Verdi research at Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois. In 1992, she retired and lived in Ahrensburg near Hamburg, where she died either on 20 NovemberHans Heinrich Eggebrecht [+unidentified editor], \\"G√ºnther, Ursula\\" (updated 15 July 2008), Grove Music Online, edited by Deane Root (accessed 19 March 2014). or 21 November 2006.Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (5 December 2006), Feuilleton section. Influence Ursula G√ºnther coined the term ars subtilior which classified the music of the late fourteenth century to describe the subtle rhythm reflected in the music of the time. Another field of research was the work of Giuseppe Verdi. She published his opera Don Carlos in an issue with the five-act French original version and also with the four-act Italian version. She published widely, becoming one of the most influential musicologists of the twentieth century.

History Born in S√£o Paulo, Clara Sverner's interpretations are well considered by public and critics from Brazil and abroad. She had a sound education, started in S√£o Paulo with Jos√© Kliass, that in turn studied in Berlin with Martin Krause, a Liszt pupil. She got her master's with Louis Hildebrand, at Conservatory of Geneve, where she has got a Gold Medal. She did improvement studies with Leonard Shure, an assistant to Artur Schnabel, and then at the Mannes College of Music, in New York City. While still a teenager, she won the International Wilhelm Backhaus Competition, starting a career that made her one of the most prestigious Brazilian virtuosi. Ms. Sverner participated in recitals and concerts all over Brazil, and toured in Europe, the United States, Japan and Israel. Her programmes usually feature a repertoire that includes pieces from the old English virginalists of the 16th century, to the major composers of 20th century. She highlights, most of all, the aestethic quality, the boldness of invention and the expressive power of the pieces she performs. As such, Clara Sverner is a nonconformist artist, who never tires of enhancing, researching and daring. In the context of Brazilian classical music, she was responsible more than anyone else for the revival of the popularity of the works of Glauco Vel√°squez, a Brazilian classical composer of the 20th century. Clara Sverner recorded several pieces for piano by Chiquinha Gonzaga, and thus was responsible for attracting the attention of the public to her works. Ms Sverner's fruitful partnership with the Brazilian instrumentist Paulo Moura was opened up to several musical universes, exploring works from the Brazilian popular music (like Pixinguinha), to contemporary classical composers like Almeida Prado, Gilberto Mendes, and Ronaldo Miranda, that created pieces especifically for the Sverner and Moura duo. Ms. Sverner's discography has 25 records, available worldwide, and reflects her fine aestethical sense and her esprit d'avant garde.

While some characters only appear in the shore-based chapters at the beginning of the book, and others are captains and crewmembers of other ships, the majority of the characters are crew members of the Pequod. The following is a list of the characters. Captain Ahab Ahab facing Moby Dick Ahab is the tyrannical captain of the Pequod who is driven by a monomaniacal desire to kill Moby Dick, the whale that had maimed him off the coast of Japan during a previous whaling voyage. Ahab‚Äôs obsession with Moby Dick ultimately causes the death of the entire crew of the Pequod, except for Ishmael. He's the main protagonist of the novel. Ishmael Ishmael, the only surviving crewmember of the Pequod, is the narrator of the book, but not the main protagonist. As a character he is a few years younger than as a narrator. His importance relies on his role as narrator; as a character, he is only a minor participant in the action. The name has come to symbolize orphans, exiles, and social outcasts. Moby Dick The title character is a giant, largely white bull sperm whale and arguably the main antagonist of the novel. Ashore =Father Mapple= A former whaler who is a preacher in the New Bedford Whaleman's Chapel. =Elijah= The character Elijah (named for the Biblical prophet Elijah, who is also referred to in the King James Bible as Elias), on learning that Ishmael and Queequeg have signed onto Ahab's ship, asks, \\"Anything down there about your souls?\\" When Ishmael reacts with surprise, Elijah continues: Later in the conversation, Elijah adds: =Captain Bildad and Captain Peleg= The principal owners of the Pequod, two well-to-do Quaker retired whaling captains. Both have names taken from the Bible: Peleg, and Bildad. Peleg served as first mate under Ahab on the Pequod before obtaining his own command, and is responsible for all her whalebone embellishment. Crew of the Pequod The crew is international, having constituents from both the United States and rest of the world. Chapter 40, \\"Midnight, Forecastle,\\" highlights, in its stage-play manner (in Shakespearean style), the striking variety in the sailors' origins. A partial list of the speakers includes sailors from the Isle of Man, France, Iceland, the Netherlands, the Azores, Sicily and Malta, China, Chile, Denmark, Portugal, India, England, Spain, and Ireland. Although in fact 44 members of the crew are mentioned, in the final chapters Melville writes three times that there are 30 crewmembers.Ch 123, 126, 134 Since there were thirty states in the union at the time, it has been suggested that, in its diversity, the Pequod to be a metaphor for American ship of state. =Mates= The three mates of the Pequod are all from New England. Starbuck. The young chief mate. A thoughtful and intellectual Quaker from Nantucket. He is married with a son. Such is his desire to return to them, that when nearly reaching the last leg of their quest for Moby Dick, he considers arresting or even killing Ahab with a loaded musket, and turning the ship back for home. Starbuck is alone among the crew in objecting to Ahab's quest, declaring it madness to want revenge on an animal, which lacks reason; such a desire is blasphemous to his Quaker religion. Starbuck advocates continuing the more mundane pursuit of whales for their oil. But he lacks the support of the crew in his opposition to Ahab, and is unable to persuade them to turn back. Despite his misgivings, he feels himself bound by his obligations to obey the captain. Starbuck was an important Quaker family name on Nantucket, and there were dozens of actual whalemen of this period named Starbuck, as evidenced by the name of Starbuck Island in the South Pacific whaling grounds. Stubb. The second mate. From Cape Cod, always seems to have a pipe in his mouth and a smile on his face. \\"Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew all invited guests\\" (Moby-Dick, Ch. 27). Although he is not an educated man, Stubb is remarkably articulate, and during whale hunts keeps up an imaginative patter reminiscent of that of some characters in Shakespeare. Scholarly portrayals range from that of an optimistic simpleton to a paragon of lived philosophic wisdom.Dagovitz, Alan. \\"Moby Dick's Hidden Philosopher: A Second Look at Stubb\\" in Philosophy and Literature Oct 2008 Flask. The third mate. A short, stout man hailing from Martha's Vineyard, he approaches the practice of whaling as if trying to avenge some deep offense the whales have done him. Flask is nicknamed \\"King-Post\\" by the crew, as his physical stature reminds them of this short, strong timber that is often used to brace ships and structures. =Harpooneers= Queequeg The harpooneers of the Pequod are non- Christians from various parts of the world. Each serves on a mate's boat. Queequeg. Hails from the fictional island of Rokovoko in the South Seas, inhabited by a cannibal tribe, and is the son of the chief of his tribe. Since leaving the island, he has become extremely skilled with the harpoon. He befriends Ishmael early in the novel, when they meet before leaving for Nantucket. He is described as existing in a state between civilized and savage. Queequeg is the harpooneer on Starbuck's boat, where Ishmael is also an oarsman. Queequeg, best friends with Ishmael, is prominent early in the novel, but later fades in significance, as does Ishmael. Tashtego. A Gay Head (Wampanoag) Native American harpooneer. The personification of the hunter, he turns from hunting land animals to hunting whales. Tashtego is the harpooneer on Stubb's boat. Daggoo. A tall (6' 5\\") African harpooneer from a coastal village with a noble bearing and grace. He is the harpooneer on Flask's boat. Fedallah. Harpooneer on Ahab's boat. He is of Indian Zoroastrian (\\"Parsee\\") descent, and is described as having lived in China. When the Pequod sets sail, Fedallah is hidden on board with the crew of Ahab's boat; he emerges only when the boats are first lowered to pursue a whale. Fedallah is referred to in the text as Ahab's \\"Dark Shadow.\\" Ishmael calls him a \\"fire worshipper\\" and the crew speculates that he is a devil in man's disguise. He is the source of a variety of prophecies regarding Ahab and his hunt for Moby Dick, including one about the manner of Ahab's death: \\"Hemp only can kill thee.\\" This prophecy later comes true in the final chapters, when a harpoon rope wraps around Ahab's neck and drags him into the ocean, drowning him. =Pip (The cabin boy)= Pip (nicknamed \\"Pippin,\\" but \\"Pip\\" for short). An African-American youth said to be from Tolland County, Connecticut, although he is referred to as \\"Alabama Boy.\\" He is \\"the most insignificant of the Pequod's crew.\\" Because he is physically slight, he is made a ship-keeper, (a sailor who stays aboard the ship while its whaleboats go out). Ishmael contrasts him with the \\"dull and torpid in his intellects\\" ‚Äî and paler and much older ‚Äî steward Dough-Boy, describing Pip as \\"over tender-hearted\\" but \\"at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe.\\" Ishmael goes so far as to chastise the reader: \\"Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy; behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king's cabinets\\".All quotes are taken from Chapter 93, \\"The Castaway.\\" The after-oarsman on Stubb's boat is injured, however, so Pip is temporarily reassigned to Stubb's whaleboat crew. The first time out, Pip jumps from the boat, causing Stubb and Tashtego to lose their already- harpooned whale. Tashtego and the rest of the crew are furious; Stubb chides him \\"officially\\" and \\"unofficially,\\" even raising the specter of slavery: \\"a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama.\\" The next time a whale is sighted, Pip again jumps overboard and is left stranded in the \\"awful lonesomeness\\" of the sea while Stubb's and the others' boats are dragged along by their harpooned whales. By the time he is rescued, he has become (at least to the other sailors) \\"an idiot,\\" \\"mad.\\" Ishmael, however, thought Pip had a mystical experience: \\"So man's insanity is heaven's sense.\\" Pip and his experience are crucial because they serve as foreshadowing, in Ishmael's words, \\"providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\\" Pip's madness is full of poetry and eloquence; he is reminiscent of Tom in King Lear. Ahab later sympathizes with Pip and takes the young boy under his wing. =Bulkington= Bulkington is a handsome, popular mariner whom Ishmael encounters briefly at the Spouter Inn in New Bedford (Chapter 3), when he has just returned from a four year long voyage. Later, Ishmael finds that he is also a member of the crew of the Pequod. He is the subject of Chapter 23 \\"The Lee Shore\\", but does not appear in the rest of the novel. =Others= Dough Boy. The pale, nervous steward of the ship. Fleece. The Cook. A very old, half-deaf African-American with bad knees, is presented in the chapter \\"Stubb's Supper\\" at some length in a dialogue where Stubb good- humoredly takes him to task over how to prepare a variety of dishes from the whale's carcass. Perth. Blacksmith. Ahab has Perth forge a special harpoon that he carries into the final confrontation with Moby Dick. Perth is one of the few characters whose previous life is described in much detail: his life ashore has been ruined by alcoholism. The Manxman. Oldest member of the crew. He is \\"popularly invested with preternatural powers of discernment,\\" has \\"studied signs,\\" and is given to dark prophecies. His age and origin on the Isle of Man are the subject of one of Ahab's commentaries on the nature of man in Chapter 125 \\"The Log and Line\\". Others met at sea =Captain Boomer= Boomer commands the Samuel Enderby of London, one of the ships that Ahab encounters at sea. He has not only seen Moby Dick recently, but lost his arm to him in a previous attack. Like Ahab, he has replaced the missing limb with a prosthesis made of sperm whale bone, in his case a mallet. Ahab immediately assumes he has found a kindred spirit in his thirst for vengeance, but Boomer is yet another representation of the duality to be found throughout the novel; in this instance, a sane and rational counterpart to Ahab. While Boomer also anthropomorphizes Moby Dick, describing the \\"boiling rage\\" the whale seemed to be in when Boomer attempted to capture him, he has easily come to terms with losing his arm, and harbors no ill-will against Moby Dick, advising Ahab to abandon the pursuit. The Enderby's doctor provides solid reasoning for this attitude, informing the gathering: Boomer jokingly tells a long yarn about the loss of his arm; this attitude, coupled with a lack of urgency in telling where he sighted Moby Dick, infuriates Ahab, leading Boomer to query, \\"Is your captain crazy?\\" Ahab immediately quits the Enderby and is so hasty in his return to the Pequod that he cracks and splinters his whalebone leg, then further damages it in admonishing the helmsman. While appearing to be whole, the leg is badly damaged and cannot be trusted; it now serves as metaphor for its wearer. =Derick de Deer= Derick de Deer is a German whaling captain. Melville disparages the whaling prowess of both de Deer and Germans generally. De Deer's ship has succeeded in capturing no whales, so he begs the Pequod's crew for oil for the ship's lamps. During this transaction, whales are sighted and the crews of both boats pursue, de Deer trying (unsuccessfully) to hinder the rival crews. De Deer is last seen pursuing a fin whale, according to Melville too swift a swimmer to be captured by 19th-century whalers. =Other whaling captains= The Pequod encounters a number of other whaling ships in the course of her voyage. The captains are not named, but some play significant minor roles: *Bachelor: his ship fully laden after a successful cruise, the captain angers Ahab by refusing to believe in Moby Dick's existence, reinforcing the ambiguity between the whale's real and mythical characteristics. *Bouton de Rose (Rosebud): the captain of this French ship is also disparaged, being described as a \\"cologne manufacturer\\". He has captured two sick whales, and Stubb - suspecting that they contain the valuable ambergris - tricks him and his crew into releasing the whales. He is correct, but Ahab hurries the Pequod on before Stubb can collect all his prize. *Rachel: Captain Gardiner wishes Ahab to help him seek a missing whaleboat in which his son was a crew member (described, Biblically, as \\"seeking her children\\"). Ahab refuses. After Moby Dick sinks the Pequod, the Rachel rescues Ishmael, the only survivor. *Delight: the captain has attempted to capture Moby Dick. The whale turned on the whaleboats and destroyed one, prefiguring what is about to happen to the Pequod's boats.

Ltd. out of Liverpool. She sank on 29 December 1916, in the North Atlantic after running aground at Kedge Rock in Baltimore, County Cork, Ireland. Seventeen men of the crew lost their lives while the remaining 23 were rescued. Construction and ownership In 1899, David J. Dunlop of Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, Scotland, built Alondra for the London-based Rio Tinto Company. She was launched on 9 July 1899, and was classified as a passenger and cargo steamship. She was built out of steel and was about 300 feet (90 meters) long, 40 feet (12 meters) wide, and 20 feet (6 meters) deep. She was rigging as a schooner and had two masts. In 1915, Yeoward Bros. Ltd. of Liverpool took possession of the ship and she was their property the day that she ran aground on 29 December 1916. Accident and Rescue The cause of the wreck of Alondra is not entirely clear. What is known is that the ship ran aground on 29 December 1916 on Kedge Rock, an island off Baltimore, County Cork, Ireland, with sheer rock cliffs. After Alondra struck Kedge Rock, 16 of her crew were able to get aboard one of the ship's lifeboats, but they drowned before they could reach safety. Another man died on board. Meanwhile, Archdeacon John Richard Hedges Becher, who was serving as the honorary secretary of the Baltimore Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), set out with a rescue lifeboat. He failed to reach Alondra on the first try, then again on the second. When the sun rose, he and his lifeboat crew set out a third time using a rocket apparatus and managed to reach the vessel. While the lifeboat worked from one position, the crews of Royal Navy trawlers worked from the tops of the cliffs to lift other surviving crew members out of Alondra. In total, 23 men were rescued from the ship. The RNLI awarded Silver Medals for Gallantry to Archdeacon Becher and to Lieutenant Sanderson for assisting with the rescue. In 1913, the RNLI had established a lifeboat station in Baltimore, which could have been of assistance in rescuing the crew of the Alondra. Unfortunately, World War I delayed the official opening of the base until 1919. Depiction in Film In 2013, a professional film crew sponsored by the Arts Council England created a film based on the events surrounding the Alondra shipwreck of 1916. The film was made in collaboration with the RNLI and the Baltimore Drama Group, and featured Pat Flaherty, Tadhg Collins, Michael Walsh, and Bernie O‚ÄôDriscoll. The film was included in an RNLI touring exhibition in commemoration of the organization's involvement in World War I. Dive Site Today, wreck diving is popular in Baltimore at sites such as the Alondra wreck. The ship settled at a depth of 5 to 20 meters (16 to 66 feet) and is located at .

The plot concerns two young girls who get into mischief with their pet horses. They are kidnapped by a pair of bumbling crooks who hold them for ransom, and it is up to their equine pets to rescue them.. Retrieved April 8, 2017. Plot Two- Bits and Pepper are equestrians, living in Central California with their owners, Tyler and her parents, Roger and Carla. One day, after school, Tyler's best friend, Katie, sets out a plan to get her to ride Two-Bits and Pepper into town. Carla refuses to allow Tyler to do so, so Katie makes up a concept to go below the highway that runs across their property rather than to directly cross it, as Carla did not clearly state that they could not go below it. Carla witnesses Tyler and Katie in a hang-out session with Two-Bits and Pepper in town, alongside their best friends. After putting Two-Bits and Pepper into the property, Tyler sets off for the main road. Earlier in the day, Zike and Spider attempt to kidnap a young boy at school under the ploy that it's a free ride home. The boy meets up with his father, who reports Zike and Spider to the police. Tyler crosses the road, but not before meeting up with Zike and Spider. They try to grab her under the ploy that Roger knows them. She escapes by throwing rocks at them. She makes it home at sunset. Carla yells at her for having disobeyed her, leading her to run away, but Carla thinks it was just a trick. Later in the night, Roger arrives at the house to find Carla crying; Tyler is gone. After checking Two-Bits and Pepper's pins, they set off for the police station. Tyler is hanging out at Katie's house. Zike and Spider are pulled over by the police for matching the description of the car that the young boy's father gave them. After letting them go, the police station is rampant with reports and sightings of the kidnappers. The FBI is also on the case. Later that night, Zike and Spider break into Katie's house, leading her to drop a candle and burn the whole house down. They make it out, running into the field. The police, the firefighters, Roger, and Carla make it to Katie's house, which is burning when they arrive. At the same time, Two-Bits and Pepper have made it out of their pins, walking through the fields to find Tyler and Katie with their telepathy. The next day, they are hiding from Zike and Spider in a shack. Suddenly, Zike and Spider burst into the scene, shutting the door to the shack. We do not know what happens next to the Tyler and Katie. A few minutes later, Two-Bits and Pepper run by the search party, making the search crew suspicious. The search crew veers off course, trying to kill Two-Bits and Pepper for horse meat. In the shack, Tyler and Katie are told that there is a ransom to set them free. At the police station, there are missing posters for them, leading Roger to be saddened. Two-Bits and Pepper are taken into the back of a man's truck. After staying at a saloon in town for some time, it is revealed that he is drunk. Pepper sets Two-Bits free and he leaps out of the truck as the man drives off. Zike and Spider set easy traps on Tyler and Katie, leading them to easily be set free from their seats. Just before they escape, Zike and Spider arrive, congratulating them on escaping. Spider grabs a winch and threatens to break their legs with it if they move a muscle out of their seats. They sit back down, following his commands. Meanwhile, Zike is hanging out outside a trading post in town, begging a woman to leave her keys in her car. Suddenly, a small kid grabs a stick and hits Zike in the leg. He then gets bitten by a dog, running to the car. He pretends to own the car as he drives it off; this will soon have a major part in the story. Meanwhile, at the shack, Tyler and Katie trick Spider into leaning over to kill a spider on the floor. After leaning over, he kicks a panel of the wall, leading Tyler and Katie to try to escape. Katie makes it, but Tyler is dragged back into the shack by Spider. Zike arrives with the stolen car, taking Tyler into it; they are gonna drive her to Mexico to sell her to a cartel. Katie runs to safety, while Two-Bits and Pepper enter the chase of a lifetime. Zike, Spider, and Tyler cross a railroad track, leaving Two-Bits and Pepper behind. They find a shortcut, leading Two-Bits under the track, and into town. Pepper is too big for the shortcut, so he must wait. Meanwhile, the police crew bust down the shack, finding nothing suspicious. Two-Bits follows Zike, Spider, and Tyler to a bridge, blocking them just as they cross it. Spider does not run over Two- Bits, citing car concerns. Tyler is crying at this point. Spider jumps out of the car, grabbing a pistol. He messes with it, not pulling the trigger. Soon, Two-Bits makes him flinch, leading him to accidentally fire a shot at him. Tyler is horrified as he falls to the ground. Zike does not take too kindly of the act, letting Tyler pass by and cry with Two-Bits as he's dying. The search crew's helicopter narrows in on the scene, Spider fires multiple shots at it, turning the car around with Zike inside. They survive multiple shots from the helicopter, stopping and taking off on foot. Soon, the police find Tyler, crying beside Two-Bits. Suddenly, Pepper bursts back into the scene, slamming into Zike and Spider. Spider falls into the river and Zike falls onto the hilltop. This leads to Zike's arrest. The police arrive at Two-Bits and Tyler, leading to a large reunion with Roger, Carla, and everybody else. The helicopter crew captures Spider in a net, arresting him. A few hours later, in a veterinary hospital, Two-Bits is undergoing surgery. He survives the gunshot in the end. A few weeks later, Tyler and Katie are riding on Pepper, when Two- Bits arrives behind them. They ride into the sunshine, while the screen goes black. The closing credits are then shown. Legacy Although the movie did not fare well at the box office, it was among the first in a new trend of movie-style in the late 1990s, where an animal was kidnapped or injured by a set of two male antagonists, and it is up to the protagonist (usually a girl) to save it. This movie was different, in where the protagonist was kidnapped and the animal had to save it. This was common in direct-to-video family films in the late 1990s, specifically films released by Walt Disney Home Video. Movies like this included Gordy, The Air Bud Franchise, and Soccer Dog, which was released by Columbia Pictures in 1999. This was rather common in its time, citing an absence in new animation and family entertainment system concepts before the rise of Pixar Animation. This movie is rare and has been seen on some combination DVD sets with other movies, such as a combo with three other movies called 'Askari', 'Pets to the Rescue', and 'Quest Beyond Time', which were low-fare box office or direct-to-video movies. This combo set was released by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.

Overview  The show documents the efforts of Chuck Palumbo (a former WWE wrestler and mechanic) and his partner Rick Dore (a custom car and hot rod builder) as they locate and then clean up the collection of a car hoarder with the main idea being to get classic cars and parts back into the realm of public use and display. The show starts with a tip regarding the location of a collection of vehicles then proceeds to the guys investigating the collection for the potential of the collection in terms of value and worthiness for a restoration candidate. Once a meeting with the owner takes place, a vehicle is selected for restoration and a deal is struck for the restoration of that vehicle while all the others plus any parts are sold to finance the overall effort. Joe Petralia replaced by Roy Wong \\"the money\\" in season 2 is challenged with the task of selling off the excess cars & parts to raise the capital for Rick and Chuck to finish the builds. Some of the vehicles are sold whole as collectibles to other mechanics or restorers, some for parts and the rest for scrap metal in order to raise the money necessary to rebuild and renovate the car hoarders' choice so that the owner may enjoy driving it in the future. The left over money goes toward paying the associated costs of operating a restoration shop. Each show continues by showing the basic design process for the vehicle which is followed by disassembly, modifications and then reassembly of the vehicle. The show wraps up with a presentation to the owner of their restored vehicle and an overview of what it took financially to accomplish all that was done from beginning to end with the hoard.

Kelling Heath Holiday Park is located on the North Norfolk coastline between the market towns of Sheringham and Holt. The holiday park got its name from the surrounding area, Kelling Heath, which is recognised as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  History  The Kelling Heath Holiday Park site was purchased by the Timewell family following a period of prolonged negotiations. Originally opened on 6 April 1984, the park's opening had been rushed to ensure that it could benefit from the popular Easter holiday period, which turned out to be the hottest Easter for years. Over the next few years significant refurbishments were carried out on the site's facilities, including extensive work on its electrical system, as well as its shower, WC and laundry blocks. Just after the 1991 May Day weekend the entire park had to be evacuated when two drums containing toxic chemicals washed up on the nearby Weybourne beach. In 1999 Kelling Heath began its red squirrel breeding programme, which was part of a national initiative to re- introduce these animals into the British eco-system. The program has proven to be a success and the animal can be found throughout the Kelling Heath park. In 2013 the park announced that for the first time it has two breeding pairs of red squirrels, which resulted in two baby red squirrels being born in the park and that were named Sunny and Summer.  Accommodation and Facilities  There are a number of accommodation options at the park, from camping pitches to luxury holiday homes. Onsite facilities include restaurants, a bike hire, swimming pool and shower/WC blocks.  Environmental Impact  Kelling Heath has become noted for its positive impact on the local environment. The holiday park has introduced a number of environmentally-friendly practices, most notably its successful red squirrel breeding programme. The company has also invested ¬£180,000 in harnessing the power of solar energy. The holiday park is located within a Site of Special Scientific Interest and as a result it has become known for its commitment to managing its rare habitat. Many of the park's accommodations are set amongst its woodland environment and the structure of its permanent buildings are sympathetic to its environment. In 2014 the park's environmental credentials were further heightened when it became the location for the popular BBC2 programme, Stargazing Live. This programme highlighted the park's prime position for astronomy enthusiasts and the fact that it is located away from major cities means that it provides the darkness needed for stargazing.  Train Station  Kelling Heath is one of the only holiday parks in the UK to have its own train station, Kelling Heath Halt railway station. The station is part of the North Norfolk Railway, which is a 10.5 mile round trip and connects Sheringham with Holt.  Recognition  Kelling Heath Holiday Park won the 2013 Caravan Holiday Park/Holiday Village of the Year at the Visit England Awards of Excellence. The park was subsequently featured and reviewed in The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror.

Kornbluth: The Life and Works of a Science Fiction Visionary, McFarland, 2009, pp.173-86 written entirely by Kornbluth. The co-authors broke the story down into planned 5000-word segments, which they wrote alternately. \\"Cyril would write what was supposed to be a five-thousand-word section in about three thousand words. I would then go back and rewrite his section to make it five thousand words\\", Merril remembered. \\"Then I would write the next five-thousand-word section in eight thousand words. He would rewrite my section to shorten it\\". They completed the novel in six weeks, writing quickly because both were \\"desperately broke\\".Judith Merril & Emily Pohl-Weary, Better to Have Loved: The Life of Judith Merril, Between The Lines, 2002, pp. 110-11. The novel deals with the transformation of Cade, the title character, from a loyal member of the elite police force of an authoritarian interplanetary regime into an individualistic rebel. Kornbluth and Merril crafted the novel to appeal to Astounding SF editor John W. Campbell, using Fritz Leiber's Gather, Darkness! as their model. \\"We did a really interesting analytical breakdown of what Campbell would and wouldn't buy\\", Merril later wrote. \\"The scientific stuff had to be there, but the sort of spiritual fantasy element had to be there as well. Also, the novel had to contain the sort of humor that made sense to Campbell\\".

He was the third son of the large family of James Jackson, banker, by Henrietta Priscilla, second daughter of Freeman Bower of Bawtry; John Edward Jackson was an elder brother. In 1829 he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar there in 1834. Jackson settled as a banker at Doncaster. He was treasurer of the borough from 1838, and trustee of a number institutions, taking a large part in establishing the Doncaster free library.

She completed a Ladies Literary Course from Oberlin College in 1850. Lucy Stanton Day's life was a testament to the many strong, resilient, and radical women that participated in the first wave of American feminism. Her passionate commitment to abolition especially connected her to her radical female predecessors, such as Angelina E. Grimk√©, who, as early as 1836, linked the abolition of slavery to the Christian duty of women.  Early life  Lucy Stanton was born free, the only child of Margaret and Samuel Stanton, on October 16, 1831. When her biological father Samuel, a barber, died when she was only 18 months old, Stanton's mother married John Brown, an abolitionist famous around Cleveland, Ohio, for his participation in the Underground Railroad. Stanton is noted as saying that John Brown would harbor as many as 13 runaway slaves in their house at any given time.Smith, Jessie Carney (ed.), Notable Black American Women, Vol. 2, Gale Research, 1992.  Education  In addition to his work as an abolitionist, John Brown was also an advocate for African-American education. Stanton attended the Cleveland Free School that Brown formed for African-American children. In 1846, Stanton enrolled in Oberlin College, completing a Literary degree in the \\"Ladies' Literary Course\\" of study in 1849. This degree differed from the B.A. offered to men in that it did not require foreign languages or higher mathematics.Foner, Philip S., and Robert James Branham (eds), Lift Every Voice: African American Oratory 1787‚Äì1900, University of Alabama Press, 1998. At Oberlin College, Stanton was very active in the Ladies' Literary Society, and was invited (and presented) a speech at her graduation entitled \\"A Plea for the Oppressed\\" which expressed her abolitionist sentiments. This speech, in response to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which was about to take effect, urged the audience, particularly women, to put themselves in the place of the enslaved, to join the abolitionist cause, and to ultimately end Slavery in the United States. Her speech was immensely well-received, and reprinted in publications like \\"\\"The Oberlin Evangelist\\"\\", the Oberlin College school newspaper, and \\"\\"The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States Politically Considered\\"\\".  Personal life and activism  Fresh out of school, Lucy Stanton began working as a principal at another free school in Cleveland. On November 25, 1852, Stanton married William H. Day, also an Oberlin College graduate. Stanton worked as a librarian, and assisted her husband as editor for the first of Cleveland's African-American newspapers, The Aliened American. In the first issue dated, April 9, 1853, Stanton became the first African-American woman to publish a work of fiction entitled \\"Charles and Clara Hays. Stanton and Day had a daughter, Florence Day, born in 1858. Shortly after her birth, Day abandoned his wife and child, leaving for England. Stanton successfully received a divorce from Day in 1872. Following Day's abandonment, Stanton worked as a seamstress in Cleveland, while continuing her activism. Her affiliation with the Cleveland Freedmen's Aid Society led to her being sent first to Georgia (U.S. state) in 1866 and then to Mississippi, both to teach newly freed slaves. While in Mississippi, Stanton met, and then in 1878 married, Levi Sessions. The couple moved to Tennessee where Stanton continued to be a supporter of women's and African Americans' rights by working with organizations such as the Women's Relief Corps, the Order of Eastern Star, the Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church. After the death of her mother in 1900, Stanton moved to Los Angeles. In 1904, with the assistance of black church and club women, she established the Sojourner Truth Industrial Club as a \\"safe refuge\\" for the hundreds of black working women migrating to the city. The club sought to promote the guidance and development of young African-American women. Stanton died in Los Angeles, California, on February 18, 1910, at the age of 78 and was buried in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.

The bill would authorize the appropriation of $968 million over the 2015-2019 period. The grant program would go to the states to run programs to analyze DNA samples from crime victims. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Debbie Smith Act of 2004 (42 U.S.C. 13701) provides United States federal government grants to eligible states and units of local government to conduct DNA analyses of backlogged DNA samples collected from victims of crimes and criminal offenders. The Act expands the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) and provides legal assistance to survivors of dating violence. Named after sexual assault survivor Debbie Smith, the Act was passed by the 108th Congress as part of larger legislation, the Justice for All Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-405), and signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 30, 2004. The bill was reauthorized in 2008.Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2008, H.R. 5057, 110th Cong., 2nd Sess. 2008. http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h110-5057 At that time, there remained serious concerns about a backlog in the testing of rape kit DNA samples. Investigations conducted by CBS News and by Human Rights Watch revealed in 2009 that despite five years and millions in federal funding, rape kit backlogs persisted in the United States and had increased in several grant supported states and counties.Strickler, L.

Exclusive: Rape in America: Justice Denied.\\"CBS News.\\" http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/09/cbsnews_investigates/main5590118.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;1 An October 2008 audit of the Los Angeles city crime lab by Human Rights Watch revealed that rape kit backlogs increased between 2004 and 2008, despite nearly $4 million in Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Program grants. In January 2007, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) revealed that approximately 5,000 rape kits resided in LAPD storage facilities. By July 2008 the backlog grew to 7,300, but was later estimated at 5,193 by a February 2009 audit.Human Rights Watch (2009, March 31). US: Los Angeles County Should Test Thousands of Rape Kits. https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/31/us-los-angeles-county-should- test-thousands-rape-kits =Debbie Smith= On March 3, 1989, a man wearing a ski mask entered Debbie Smith's Williamsburg, Virginia, home and threatened her with a gun, dragged her into the woods, blindfolded her and raped her repeatedly over the next hour. She participated in the collection of DNA evidence for a rape kit, but it was not formally tested and entered into a national database until 1994. On July 24, 1995, a DNA technician identified Debbie's attacker, Norman Jimmerson, while analyzing various DNA records. Jimmerson, then serving time for abducting and robbing two women in 1989, was sentenced to 161 years in prison under the three strikes law.Telsavaara, T.V.T, & Arrigo, B.A. (2006).

In 2014, she spoke out in favor of the renewal of the act named for her. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 would amend the Debbie Smith Act of 2004 to reauthorize funding through FY2019 for: (1) the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program; (2) DNA training and education for law enforcement, correctional personnel, and court officers; and (3) sexual assault forensic exam program grants. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on April 2, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4323 would authorize the appropriation of $968 million over the 2015-2019 period for United States Department of Justice programs to enhance the analysis of DNA samples and other work relating to criminal investigations. Assuming appropriation of the specified amounts, we estimate that implementing H.R. 4323 would cost $644 million over the 2015-2019 period, with remaining amounts spent in subsequent years. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4323 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on March 27, 2014 by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R, VA-6). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. It was reported by the committee on April 7, 2014 alongside House Report 113-404. The House voted on April 7, 2014 to pass the bill in a voice vote. Debate and discussion Debbie Smith, who the law is named after, spoke in favor of the bill. She said that \\"these aren't rape kits that need to be tested, these are lives that need to be given back to their owners,\\" arguing that the bill was very important to the victims of rape. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) also spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that \\"this is one of those rare bills that virtually guarantees that it will put real criminals behind bars and protect people more effectively against one of the most traumatic assaults imaginable.\\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte praised Debbie Smith's courage. He also said that he was \\"pleased that the House voted today to stand by these brave victims and ensure that DNA analysis is completed quickly so that law enforcement officials can accurately identify, prosecute, and lock these criminals in jail so that sexual predators are not left free to roam our streets and potentially hurt more women.\\" He also urged the Senate to move quickly to pass the legislation.

The episode was written by series co-creators and showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Weiss. It premiered on April 6, 2014. The title of the episode refers to the two swords Tywin Lannister forges from Ice, Ned Stark's large Valyrian steel sword, in the opening sequence. Plot =In King's Landing= Tywin melts down House Stark's greatsword Ice and forges it into two new swords. One is given to Jaime as the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Tywin wants to send Jaime to rule Casterly Rock, but he refuses, prompting Tywin to disown him. Qyburn gives Jaime a gilded steel hand. Tyrion waits for the arrival of Prince Doran Martell, but his brother Oberyn comes in his stead. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks vengeance for his sister Elia, who was married to Rhaegar Targaryen and killed by Gregor \\"The Mountain\\" Clegane. Shae tries to rekindle her romance with Tyrion, and is overheard by another handmaiden, who informs Cersei. Jaime attempts to renew his relationship with Cersei, who rebuffs him, declaring he \\"took too long\\". Brienne tries to convince Jaime to fulfil his vow to return the Stark girls to safety, but he argues the matter is now complicated by Catelyn's death and Sansa's marriage to Tyrion. Brienne tells Margaery that she didn't kill Renly and vows to kill his killer, Stannis. Sansa is approached by Ser Dontos Hollard, whose life she had previously saved. Dontos gives her his mother's necklace as thanks. =In the North= Tormund and Ygritte meet with a group of cannibalistic Thenns, led by Styr. =At Castle Black= Jon is interrogated by the Night's Watch leadership regarding his killing of Qhorin Halfhand and infiltration of the wildlings.

Production \\"Two Swords\\" was written and directed by producers D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. The episode was directed by the writing team itself, although to comply with the rules of the Directors Guild of America only Weiss is credited for directing. They previously co-directed the season three episode \\"Walk of Punishment\\", in which Benioff received sole directing credit. =Writing= \\"Two Swords\\" was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on George R. R. Martin's original work from his novel A Clash of Kings, chapters Sansa II and Sansa VIII, and A Storm of Swords, chapters Jaime VII, Tyrion V, Tyrion IV, Jon VI, Jon IX, Daenerys V, and Arya XIII. Arya's revenge against Lommy's murderer using the same method of killing was depicted in The Winds of Winter chapter Mercy. =Casting= With this episode, Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth) and Kristofer Hivju (Tormund Giantsbane) are promoted to series regulars.

Reviewing it for IGN, Matt Fowler gave the episode a mark of 8.5 out of 10, and wrote that \\"'Two Swords' was a solid GoT premiere, though it certainly didn't hide the fact that the show, post-Red Wedding, is going to possibly meander more than people might enjoy or expect.\\" Two reviews from The A.V. Club were written, with one intended for those who have read the novels and one for those who have not. Reviewing for the novel readers, Emily VanDerWerff gave the episode an \\"A-\\", while Erik Adams, who reviewed for the non-readers, rated the episode a \\"B+\\".

Production The episode was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. \\"Breaker of Chains\\" was written by executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based upon the source material, Martin's A Storm of Swords. The controversial Jaime-Cersei scene was adapted from chapter 62 of A Storm of Swords (Jaime VII). Other content came from chapters Sansa V, Tyrion IX and Daenerys V. Reception =Ratings= \\"Breaker of Chains\\" was watched by an estimated 6.6 million people during the first hour. Another 1.6 million watched it on rerun. In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 1.665 million viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week. It also received 0.099 million timeshift viewers. =Critical reception= The episode was well received by critics, with a 95% rating from 37 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote that the episode deals \\"with the direct aftermath of King Joffrey's violent demise, though it also [feels] like the most bereft of the first three episodes\\" and that it \\"ended with a big, grandiose Daenerys moment ‚Äì though if one were to compare her launching canisters filled with broken shackles over the walls of Meereen to last year's flamb√©ing of Astapor and stealing off with an entire army (which came at the end of episode 4), this moment lacked 'oomph.'\\" Rape scene The episode attracted controversy for a scene where Jaime Lannister forces himself upon Cersei Lannister in the Great Sept of Baelor. In the episode, Cersei repeatedly tells Jaime \\"no\\", \\"stop\\", and \\"it's not right\\" while attempting to push him away. In the source novel, however, Cersei initially rejects Jaime's advances but changes her mind, saying \\"yes\\", though some readers interpret it as implying rape. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix stated that viewers interpreted the scene as a rape: \\"Though there aren't comments on these reviews at the moment, the reaction I've seen on Twitter, in emails and on other blogs suggests nobody is agreeing with [director Alex] Graves' interpretation of the scene and are viewing it as rape, plain and simple.\\" Sandy Hingston of Philadelphia wrote that the scene had outraged many viewers, but had led others to make \\"tentative attempts in comments sections to explain why maybe actually this wasn't rape.\\" Critics, including Erik Kain of Forbes, Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club, Megan Gibson of Time, Amanda Marcotte of Slate, and Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post, also viewed the scene as rape. The episode's director, Alex Graves, described the scene in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter as \\"and then Jaime comes in and he rapes her\\". In another interview with HitFix, Graves said \\"it becomes consensual by the end, because anything for [Jaime and Cersei] ultimately results in a turn-on, especially a power struggle.\\" In an interview with Vulture, Graves further elaborated: \\"The consensual part of it was that she wraps her legs around him, and she's holding on to the table, clearly not to escape but to get some grounding in what's going on. And also, the other thing that I think is clear before they hit the ground is she starts to make out with him. ... before he rips her undergarment, she's way into kissing him back.\\" Graves stated that it was important for him and others involved with filming the scene to indicate to viewers that the sexual encounter was not completely one-sided, and that he hoped this aspect would not be overlooked. Noting that during filming, \\"nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters\\", he described this whole scene in the Sept as \\"one of my favorite scenes I've ever done\\". Others involved with the series also commented on the scene. David Benioff, who co-wrote the episode and serves as showrunner with D. B. Weiss, described the interaction of the two siblings as \\"a really kind of horrifying scene, because you see, obviously, Joffrey's body right there, and you see that Cersei is resisting this. She's saying no, and he's forcing himself on her. So it was a really uncomfortable scene, and a tricky scene to shoot.\\" George R.R. Martin, author of the novels from which the series is adapted, stated that the dynamic is different between Jaime and Cersei in the show because, as opposed to the books, \\"Jaime has been back for weeks at the least, maybe longer.\\" He stated that while the setting is the same, \\"neither character is in the same place as in the books\\" and that he surmises this \\"may be why Dan [Weiss] & David [Benioff] played the sept out differently.\\" Martin added that he never discussed the scene with them, and that the scene \\"was always intended to be disturbing... but [I] regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons.\\" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who portrays Jaime, said in an interview that while many saw the scene as a brutal rape, \\"that was obviously never intended. I understand that one can see it as that, but for us it was much more complex.\\" As translated in: Lena Headey, who portrays Cersei, declined to comment about whether she interpreted the sex as consensual, but said that \\"it's a very complicated moment for many reasons ... There was this need and it wasn't right and yet it felt great and yet it wasn't right and it played out the way it did. And I was really happy with [the scene].\\" To Saraiya, the series' choice to portray this scene as rape appeared to be an act of \\"exploitation for shock value\\". Marcotte and Josh Wigler of MTV commented that the rape scene may have damaged Jaime's character's arc of redemption from his earlier crimes, and Marcotte wrote that it might never recover from the rape. Dustin Rowles of Salon noted that viewers who were previously able to sympathize with Jaime despite his earlier crimes of murder and incest now became angry at the series' creators \\"for allowing a terrible person to do something more terrible than our minds will allow us to forgive.\\" Andrew Romano of The Daily Beast opined that the scene \\"wasn't supposed to be a rape. It was supposed to look consensual. The filmmakers messed up.\\" He cited the fact that \\"neither the director of the scene nor the two actors who played it seem to think that Jaime raped Cersei‚Äîand the story itself is continuing to chug along as if the rape never happened and Jaime is still a character we're supposed to root for.\\" He suggested that viewers \\"ignore the rape‚Äîat least from a narrative perspective\\" because Benioff and Weiss had \\"botched\\" it. In a broader context, Hingston credited the episode with furthering \\"the furious debate over consent going on in our culture\\". Laura Hudson of Wired described the scene and its appraisal by its director as \\"one that encourages the most dangerous thinking about rape imaginable: that when a woman is held down on the ground, screaming for the man to stop, that deep down inside her she might still really want it.\\" She considered Graves' lack of realization that he was filming a rape scene disturbing because, according to Hudson, his comments encouraged the thinking that a man's persistence might \\"'turn' a rape into something consensual\\", and that it is a \\"dysfunctional, dangerous way of looking at sex and consent, one that is based on the idea of forcing women to give it\\".

First released in 2010, it revolves around a series of events that happen as Little Kanglim(voiced by EunJung), a human boy with extraordinary spiritual power, accidentally encounters ghost messenger Kanglim(voiced by SungTae Park). It falls under the genres science fiction, fantasy, and supernatural, though STUDIO ANIMAL officially states its genre as 'Oriental SF Fantasy'.  Synopsis  THEIR WORLD. HIS BATTLE. In the World of Death, beings beyond the sight of mortal humans use advanced technology to control the life and death of all living kind on Earth. When a mortal‚Äôs time has come, their spirit is summoned to join the ranks of the Dead. Some restless spirits refuse to follow these orders and remain among the physical realm, and that‚Äôs when the Ghost Messengers are called into action. Ghost Messengers are ‚Äòin-between‚Äô beings who can travel freely between the worlds of the dead and the living and are supplied with the technology to capture rogue spirits and bring them to the World of Death. While on a spirit-retrieval mission, Kang-Lim, a particularly powerful Ghost Messenger, mistakenly becomes trapped in his own Soul Phone ‚Äì the device used by the Messengers to capture ghosts ‚Äì and is discovered by a human boy with extraordinary psychic powers that allows him to see spirits. When an unknown force begins unleashing mythological demons to disrupt the strict balance of the lands of the dead and the living, a bond is formed between Kang-Lim and the human boy, known as ‚ÄòLittle Kang-Lim‚Äô, and they join forces in an effort to retain order as the world becomes increasingly unstable.  Characters  ;Little KANGLIM (Íº¨Îßà Í∞ïÎ¶º) :Little Kanglim is a human child with extraordinary spiritual powers. :He runs a antique shop with his grandfather. He is able to see spirits but does not have the ability to stop them from doing harm. But after a Soul Phone comes into his hands, he starts to get involved with the fight. ;KANGLIM (Í∞ïÎ¶º ÎèÑÎ†π) :Kanglim is a Ghost Messenger with strong potential power. :He is in charge of Area 202 in Seoul. Burying the sad stories of his past, Kanglim became a Ghost Messenger after making a contract with Yumla. He has no interest in others, standing alone in the world. One day he accidentally gets captured in his own Soul Phone and encounters Little Kanglim. He is about to change. :Kanglim's Soul Phone is Black Shark. It has a memory capacity of 15 Dan, and can be transformed into a sword-like form. Black Shark is greatly efficient for one-on-one battles. ;BARI (Î∞îÎ¶¨ ÎÇ≠Ïûê) :Bari is the head commander of Sesung Pyeonjeon and has gone through various positions of the Underworld. :She is a smart, brave girl and an excellent Ghost Messenger who always shows perfection on her mission. She has a crush on Kanglim, but in order not to reveal such feelings, she is colder to him than any other. But when Kanglim runs into trouble, she is the first person to stand up for him. :Bari's Soul Phone is Fan Crane. It is a smartphone with a huge memory capacity, and can be transformed to display things on a half transparent, fan-shaped screen. When in battle, Bari usually summons spirits using Fan Crane, rather than having herself fight. ;SARA (ÏÇ¨Îùº ÎèÑÎ†π) :Sara is a Ghost Messenger who belongs to Seocheon Hwarang-bu. :Though he may seem cruel and merciless from the outside, he has a strong belief in the rules of the Underworld and keeps emotions out of the way while on his missions. Being unable to stand anything that is not beautiful, Sara has a sense of great self-respect. Surprisingly though, he also has a sensitive side. :Sara's Soul Phone is Guns N' Roses. It is a pair of Soul Phones that have a memory capacity of 42 Dan(combined, probably), and can be transformed into handguns. Specially-made bullets allow Sara to destroy the Marman of his targets quickly and effectively. ;MAGO (ÎßàÍ≥† Ìï†ÎØ∏) :Mago is a Ghost Messenger with smooth mellowness. :She was originally the goddess of life, but when she saw evil spirits killing so many precious lives, she decided to become a Ghost Messenger. :Mago's Soul Phone is Soul Wave. Its memory capacity is unknown, and can have the form of a long smoking pipe. Soul Wave allows Mago to access Yumla-net's main server directly.  Cast  Little Kanglim was voiced by EunJung Kanglim was voiced by SungTae Park Bari was voiced by JungHwa Yang Sara was voiced by JaeHeon Jung Mago was voiced by JiYun Park Little Kanglim's grandfather was voiced by ManYeong Park(in episode 1)/YongJun Kim(in episode 2 & the movie version) Daesu was voiced by BumKi Hong Monsters were voiced by YeongJun Shi, HoSung Kim, and KyuHyeok Shim Operators were voiced by EunJung Little Kanglim's friends (extras) were voiced by EunJung, SungTae Park, JungHwa Yang, JiHye Park, Jisu Kim, and EunSu Lee  Theme  The theme of Ghost Messenger is \\"to cover, not too lightly nor too gravely, the (Korean) traditional aspect of death and how the living remembers and mourns the dead, and to think about how a boy would change while going through such situations.\\" Accordingly, the world of Ghost Messenger is based upon the Korean traditional view of the afterlife.  In-series references & parodies  Many characters in Ghost Messenger are named after characters in Korean traditional folklore and more or less resemble them in some way, though more differences are noticeable than similarities. For example, Mago comes from the goddess Mago of Korean mythology. Yumla is based on Yeom-ra, while Kanglim has a connection to the main character of Chasa bon-puri, a myth about a Korean grim reaper. Though there is no apparent link yet, Bari has the same name with and is somehow related to the main character of the Korean myth Princess Bari, and Sara lightly references a character of Igong bon-puri with the same name. The character Daesu has an origin too, but is not from folklore nor mythology: Daesu was based on STUDIO ANIMAL PD staff DaeSu Kim. Not only does Ghost Messenger refer to various Korean traditional folklore and myths, but also refer to present-day streets and buildings of Seoul. Two famous tourist attractions, Myeongdong Theater and N Seoul Tower, appear in the opening sequence, and locations such as Anguk station or Samcheong-dong are mentioned in the series. However, due to the animation's production period and long terms between episodes, some scenes show shops and buildings that no longer exist; for example the original reference for the building where Kanglim's office is located was taken down even before the first episode was released. According to the director, Ghost Messenger pays homage to some famous Japanese animations by lightly parodying certain scenes: :The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya: Little Kanglim's seat in the classroom is intended to be the same spot as Haruhi's. :Princess Mononoke: When Kanglim is first released from the Soul Phone by Little Kanglim, one of Ashitaka's lines is referenced. :Fate/stay night: The poses and positions of LIttle Kanglim and Kanglim facing each other in a certain scene after the main battle with the dog spirits is a parody of Shir≈ç facing Saber after he summoned her. :Bakemonogatari: Daesu spilling paper advertisements from under his shirt is a parody of an illustration of Hitagi spilling school supplies from under her skirt. Other than Japanese animations, Medical Island, a past work of STUDIO ANIMAL, is referenced by featuring two characters of the animation as extras.  Production  ;Development Back when smartphones weren't widely used, STUDIO ANIMAL planned Ghost Loader, a mobile TCG game in which players would fight by downloading digitized spirits to their phones. However, due to the circumstances at the time, the game ended up not being developed. 2 years later, when browsing various websites on KOCCA, STUDIO ANIMAL came to read information about various Korean traditional folklore and culture considering the underworld, and when the company combined Ghost Loader with Korean folklore, the concept of Ghost Messenger was born. During the time when the title of Ghost Messenger wasn't decided between Ï†ÄÏäπÏÇ¨Ïûê Í∞ïÎ¶º (The Ghost Messenger KANG LIM) and the current title, STUDIO ANIMAL first made the 1st promotional video of Ghost Messenger. After the PV was made, a Spanish animation company, BRB Internacional, contacted STUDIO ANIMAL and planned to fund them for the production of Ghost Messenger as a TV series, but as BRB asked too much to be edited, the co-production deal between the two companies was broken. In this process though, Little Kanglim was created and set as a main character. Due to the lack of money and considering the various limitations on Korean TV animations-such as those on violence-STUDIO ANIMAL decided to make Ghost Messenger as an OVA series. Currently episode 1 and 2 of the OVA have been successfully released. However, in a 2019 article announcing its global distribution by Portfolio Entertainment, Ghost Messenger: MOVIE.1 has been mentioned as the first part of a trilogy, with each episode being in feature- length. Due to various on-going projects STUDIO ANIMAL has not yet officially commented on this by itself, but seems to do have plans for a sequel. ;Sound Effects & Recording The insertion and arrangement of sound effects and recording of voices were done by YeongBin Lee of Legend Sound. ;Music The overall background music for the first episode of the OVA was edited and/or replaced when it was combined with the second episode into the movie version. The opening theme song is Connexion by Outsider. The ending theme song is track 9 by So-ra Lee. It was selected as the ending theme song because the director of Ghost Messenger thought the lyrics' message, 'despite everything, live on', was in-line with the animation's theme and how Little Kanglim must experience inner growth as the story unravels. Variations of just wanna (Original) by H. Matilda are often used related to the series, and My world (Original) by Jeebag is used in the first episode of the OVA. Most songs, except for the ending theme, were composed by d. a.(Jimmie Park)  Release  The DVD of the OVA's first episode was released on December 21, 2010. The DVD of the OVA's second episode was released on August 19, 2014. OVA episode 1 and 2 were combined and edited as a movie, Í≥†Ïä§Ìä∏ Î©îÏã†Ï†Ä Í∑πÏû•Ìåê (Ghost Messenger: MOVIE.1). On May 22, 2014, it premiered in Lotte Cinema theaters, the Korean Manhwa Museum, and Seoul Animation Center. The official release date of the Blu-ray of this version is January 9, 2015.

Published under the Korean light novel brand Seed Novel, the story revolves around a novel-original male shaman character named ÏÉÅÌõÑ(SangHu). Characters from the animation, mainly Little Kanglim and Kanglim, also appear and interfere with the novel's story. On June 11, 2015, the mobile trading card game made by the collaboration of STUDIO ANIMAL and TTU Soft., Í≥†Ïä§Ìä∏ Î©îÏã†Ï†Ä ÏùºÏõîÏ∞®ÏÇ¨Ï†Ñ, was released on Google Play. However, on September 18th, 2016 the game officially went out of service due to issues of the game company.

It was announced on March 18, 2014 and was released on September 5, 2014 in the US along with new models of the Moto X and the Moto G. Hardware and design The Moto 360's form factor is based on the circular design of traditional watches, supporting a 40mm (1.5 in) viewing diameter and circular capacitive touch display. The case is stainless steel and available in different finishes. Removable wrist bands are available in metal and natural leather. The watch is water resistant and has only a single physical button. The watch has an all day battery, and rather than needing to be plugged in, it charges wirelessly by being placed on an included cradle. Internally Teardown Motorola Moto 360 it has dual microphones for voice recognition and noise rejection and a vibration motor allowing tactile feedback. An ambient light sensor optimizes screen brightness and allows gesture controls such as blanking the screen by placing one's hand over it. Bluetooth 4.0 is included for connectivity and driving wireless headphones. In the June 2015 release notes, Motorola announced Wi-Fi support for the device, such that it could be used out of Bluetooth range. A heart-rate sensor and 9-axis accelerometer support health and activity monitoring. It has IP67 certification for dust resistance and fresh water resistance rated at 30-minutes at 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) depth. Software The Moto 360 runs Android Wear, Google's Android-based platform specifically designed for wearable devices. The 360 currently runs Android Marshmallow and pairs with any phone running Android 4.3 or higher and any iPhone running IOS 8 or higher. Its software displays notifications from paired phones. It uses paired phones to enable interactive features such as Google Now cards, search, navigation, playing music, and integration with apps such as fitness, EverNote, and others. Reception Ars Technica criticized the \\"terrible\\" battery life and performance, blaming it on the outdated SoC (system-on-chip) used in the Moto 360: \\"Motorola inexplicably chose an ancient 1GHz single-core Texas Instruments OMAP 3\\". In a review for Engadget, Jon Fingas wrote, \\"The interface isn't that great at surfacing the information I need at the time I need it, for that matter. Spotify's Android Wear card always showed up on cue, but Sonos' controls appeared inconsistently even when there was music playing. And the watch frequently defaulted to showing apps that weren't really relevant to the situation at hand; no, I don't need to check out my fitness goals in the middle of the workday. Google may be right that watches are primarily about receiving passive streams of information, but that doesn't excuse doing a poor job when I want to be more active.\\" He concluded, \\"Even with those quirks in mind, it's pretty clear the Moto 360 has turned a corner in half a year's time. It's no longer the underdeveloped novelty that it was on launch, and it's now my pick of the current Android Wear crop. True, it doesn't have the G Watch R's true circular display, the ZenWatch's custom software or the Sony Smartwatch 3's GPS, but I'd say of the three, it strikes the best balance between looks, functionality and price.\\" See also * Motoactv * Wearable computer * Microsoft Band * Apple Watch * Pebble References External links * Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Products introduced in 2014 Category:Wear OS devices Category:Smartwatches ","title":"Moto 360 (1st generation)"},{"id":"42238409","text":"Somnath Lahiri (1901‚Äì1984) was an Indian statesman, writer and a leader of Communist Party of India.

Initially an educator and writer of textbooks, he was chairman of the Progressive Party for ten years, and Minister of Justice from 1927 to 1932. Biography J√≥nas was born in Hrifla in Su√∞ur-√ûingeyjars√Ωsla. He studied at M√∂√∞ruvalla School and wanted to attend the Reykjav√≠k Latin School in 1905, but could not afford it--by the time his family had saved enough money he was rejected (by rector Steingr√≠mur Thorsteinsson) for being too old. Instead, he attended the Askov Folk High School in Denmark, and then moved to England to attend Ruskin College in Oxford, known as an institution for working-class students. On his return to Iceland, in 1909, he found himself in opposition to the class of newly-wealthy Icelanders and became involved in politics. He was elected MP in 1922 for the Progressive Party, a Liberal and agrarian-centrist party, a seat he held until 1949. He became attorney general in 1927, and was Minister of Justice from 1927 to 1932. He was chairman of the Progressive Party for ten years, from 1934 to 1944. Legacy J√≥nas was the author of the \\"immensely influential primer\\" √çslandssaga handa b√∂rnum (\\"History of Iceland for children\\", 2 vols., Reykjav√≠k, 1915-1916). The primer molded the \\"historical perception of generations of Icelanders\\" until the 1970s, when it was no longer being used in education. The textbook reflects the nationalist account of Icelandic history (originally introduced by J√≥n J√≥nsson A√∞ils) wherein the Icelandic nation prospered as an independent nation during the medieval period but suffered degradation for centuries after it gave up its sovereignty to the Norwegian King by signing the Old Covenant (1262). According to his textbook, Icelanders had a special status since they hailed from descendants of those who fled the rule of Harald Fairhair, an especially hardy stock of Norwegians; in combination with the harsh natural environment this produced the \\"unique Icelandic nation\\". According to historian Thorsteinn Helgason, J√≥nsson's textbook presents the Icelandic nation \\"as a homogenous and united flock, while foreigners, mainly the Danes, are depicted as evil. More or less fictional figures from mediaeval sagas, together with literary and political personalities of all eras, populate the scene. The book was written during a sensitive period when separation from Denmark was heavily debated, and it was clearly an argument for separation.\\" References Sources * J√≥nas J√≥nsson fr√° Hriflu, official biography at Al√æingi Category:1885 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Progressive Party (Iceland) politicians ","title":"J√≥nas J√≥nsson"},{"id":"42238436","text":"Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science is a monthly peer- reviewed scientific journal covering nonlinear systems and describing their manifestations in a manner comprehensible to researchers from a broad spectrum of disciplines.

The name refers to the ability of the disk to flex across its main axis bending side to side to take up motion in the torque converter as rotational speeds change. Flexplates are generally much thinner and lighter than flywheels due to the smooth coupling action of the torque converter and the elimination of the clutch surface. Like flywheels, flexplates normally handle coupling to the starter motor, via teeth cut along the outer edge of the plate. These teeth give the flexplate a gear-like appearance, in spite of this being a secondary function.

Stowarzyszenie Polskich Kombatant√≥w w Stanach Zjednoczonych, SPK),Not to be confused with Stowarzyszenie Weteran√≥w Armii Polskiej w Ameryce (SWAP), which was originally limited to members of the Blue Army. organized in 1952, formally founded a year later, and terminated in 2012, was a Polish-American association for veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. It was a member of the World Federation of Polish Combatants Association, an umbrella organization that included similar associations from other countries. The Association's President Janusz Krzy≈ºanowski currently serves as the chairman of its liquidation committee, working to create a scholarly source of information about the SPK. History and activity  The Association was created during a November 1952 convention, but scattered groups of Polish combatants in the United States existed prior to the date. Most of the future members of the SPK arrived in the U.S. after the U.S. Congress passed a 1948 law, amended in 1950, which allowed the immigration of Polish soldiers who were demobilized in Great Britain. The bulk of the SPK members were combatants of the Polish Armed Forces in the West, which formed from the so-called \\"soldiers' emigration\\" following the September Campaign of 1939. The SPK, however, did not refer to its members as \\"immigrants.\\" Some had left Poland to fight alongside the French and then, after the fall of France, the British. Others were arrested by the NKVD, miraculously avoided being murdered in the Katyn Massacre and were drafted into the Anders Army created on Soviet soil. Others still came from the First Polish Mechanized Division fighting in Germany, Nazi concentration camps and the Home Army. According to some estimates, the Polish Armed Forces in the West counted quarter of a million troops and were the third largest Allied contingent in West by the end of the war, after those of the U.S. and the U.K. Most of the Polish combatants from the eastern borderlands of Poland, lost to the Soviet Union in 1945, decided to not return home after the hostilities had ended. Many were also wary of the communist regime installed in Warsaw after the treaty of Yalta and its persecution of Home Army soldiers. They decided to stay in the West and continue the fight for free Poland if only by their presence and words. One of the accomplishments of the SPK was influencing the American Congress to pass the Polish Veterans Rights Legislation, signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1976, which gave Polish veterans the privilege of treatment in American veteran hospitals. The SPK published the quarterly Kombatant w Ameryce, which informed members of organizational matters as well as the misery of the Polish Nation under communism and international events. The veterans who belonged to the SPK maintained the graves of Polish soldiers who fell on the European battlefields, located in Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, among others. SPK members are also buried on established section in the cemetery of American Czƒôstochowa of Doylestown, Pennsylvania. The SPK commemorated American and Polish national holidays, including those forbidden in the Polish People's Republic, for example that commemorating the Polish victory over the Bolsheviks. Members participated in radio broadcasts, helped establish Polish Saturday schools, assisted one another financially, cooperated with Polish and American scouts. Some SPK veterans lived to see Poland regain independence in 1989 after the fall of communism and to participate in the 1992 Victory Parade in Warsaw. Some also helped and witnessed Poland's accession to NATO in 1999. Due to a shrinking membership, the SPK was officially terminated during a 2012 convention. SPK President Janusz Krzy≈ºanowski became the chairman of the liquidation committee which includes also Czes≈Çaw Gieniewski, Micha≈Ç Madejski and Jerzy ≈ªmidzi≈Ñski.

Following in the same religious tradition as Umarov, he adhered to the ideology of Salafism.http://www.ict.org.il/Article/132/Salafist- Takfiri%20Jihadism%20the%20Ideology%20of%20the%20Caucasus%20Emirate Salafist- Takfiri Jihadism: The Ideology of the Caucasus Emirate The United States Department of State added Kebekov to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists on March 25, 2015. On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during special operations in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in Buynaksk. An Avar by nationality, Kebekov was the first non-Chechen to lead the North Caucasus insurgency. Early life and career Aliaskhab Kebekov was born on 1 January 1972 in what is now the Shamilsky District of Dagestan. He joined the Vilayat Dagestan wing of the Caucasus Emirate. In October 2010, Kebekov was appointed by Dokka Umarov as the Qadi or judge of the Caucasus Emirate, responsible for giving Shariah rulings on the groups actions. Kebekov accepted the role, despite expressing doubts about his suitability, as he was not a Mujtahid or a scholar with extensive knowledge of the Koran and Sunnah. Caucasus Emirate leadership On 16 January 2014, an audio clip was posted on YouTube, in which a voice claiming to be Kebekov acknowledged receiving the news that Umarov had died. Kebekov seemingly rejected the proposal by other emirs of the group that he should succeed Umarov, stating that he had no military experience and had never served as a commander; instead he proposed Aslambek Vadalov for the role. Nonetheless, in March he acceded to demands and accepted the appointment. The Caucasus Emirate linked Kavkaz Center announced Kebekov's appointment, together with acknowledgment of Umarov's death. In the weeks after this announcement, the site also posted pledges of allegiance to Kebekov from groups in Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, as well as members of the Chechen-led Syria-based Jaish al-Muhajireen wal- Ansar. In a video recording posted on the Internet in June 2014, Kebekov apologised to civilians that had been harmed by Caucasus Emirate attacks and stated that civilians should not be targeted by the group. He also called on militants not to use black widows in armed attacks or suicide bombings. The Caucasus Emirate has become more active in their insurgent activities. On 5 October 2014 a suicide bombing near the Grozny city hall took place. Five Russian police officers were killed, the suicide bomber was also killed, 12 other people were wounded. The Caucasus Emirate took credit for the attack. Byutukayev took responsibility for the 2014 Grozny clashes during which 14 Russian policemen were killed and 35 total people were wounded. The attack was one of the largest since the December 2013 Volgograd bombings, which were also carried out by the Caucasus Emirate. The day after the Grozny attack a Russian Federal Security Service building in neighboring Dagestan was reported to be engulfed in flames. If the attack was carried out by the Caucasus Emirate this would represent three large scale attacks in three months. In late 2014 and early 2015, at least 6 field commanders of the Caucasus Emirate, and an unknown number of ordinary members, switched their allegiance from Kebekov to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during a raid on a house in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in Buynaksk. He was reportedly succeeded as Caucasus Emirate leader by Magomed Suleimanov.

Early years Adrien Barnab√© Athanase Recurt was born in Lassales, Hautes- Pyr√©n√©es, on 9 June 1798. He studied medicine and qualified as a doctor in Montpellier in 1822. He moved to Paris in the last years of the Restoration, and established himself as a doctor in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. He threw himself into the struggles of the liberal cause, aligned himself with the Charbonnerie and was involved in various plots. After fighting on the barricades in July 1830 he remained with the opposition, and soon became a leading member of the Republican party. He was implicated in the affair of April 1834 but was acquitted by the court of peers. On the eve of the February Revolution of 1848 he signed the manifesto calling for the whole nation to become part of the National Guard, and for the army to no longer be used in suppressing disorder. Second republic After the revolution had succeeded Recurt was named Deputy Mayor of Paris. On 23 April 1848 he was elected representative to the Constituent Assembly for the Hautes-Pyrenees. He was appointed Minister of the Interior on 11 May 1848. On 15 May 1848 he was chosen one of the vice-presidents of the Assembly. That day he tried to prevent the invasion of the Assembly by a mob. He submitted a double bill to the Assembly prohibiting any armed meeting or association, and extending the ban from French territory to Louis Philippe and his family. In June 1848 Recurt contributed to the repression of the riots, and personally helped the attack on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. On 28 June 1848 he received the portfolio of Public Works in the ministry of General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac. He resigned this position on 15 October 1848 and on 25 October 1848 was appointed prefect of the Seine. He resigned from this office after the election as President of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, and from then on played an insignificant role in the Assembly.

It was built in 1914 to consolidate the one-room schools in the Brant (1914), McLeod School (1914), Bruce (1914), Argyle (1963), Grassmere, Meridian (1959) and Centre School Districts.  History  When the small one-room schools in Manitoba were reaching a point of growth in the early 1900s, there became a Consolidated School Movement to group them together. Larger schools mean that more courses could be offered, and money was saved by combining the efforts of the many schools scattered across the province. In 1913, the trustees of the Brant and McLeod School Districts began to meet regarding the possible consolidation of their two schools. It was decided that they would build a new structure at the newly established village of Argyle Station, as it was halfway between the two existing schools. A committee was drawn up to decide costs and to place tenders in the local newspapers for construction of a brick veneer, two-storey building. This new structure would have two large classrooms, cloak rooms, a staircase, Trustee's room, principals office, and basement furnace room. = Other structures = The school property also was home to a horse barn with storage for the winter and summer school vans, an outdoor bathroom (with one side for girls, the other for boys) and a water pump house. The entire school yard was fenced with two entrance gates allowing for a \\"U-Shaped\\" dive way for the horse drawn vans. A flag pole was installed directly in front of the school. = Architectural Details = The school was originally built with just two classrooms, with a tower (containing the staircase, trustees room and principals office). At the time of construction the school appeared asymmetrical, with the tower off to the east side of the classroom component of the school. This was done on purpose, so that a future addition would need only classroom facilities, the tower would become centralized to serve both halves of the school. The high ceilings and numerous windows (four on west side of classroom, three on south side of cloakroom) provide abundant natural light. The ceilings are decorative tin, floors are oak and interior walls are lath and plaster. The tower contains an oak staircase, with hand turned balusters. It is suspected that the brick came from the Balmoral Brick Company, located in nearby Balmoral, Manitoba. The exterior of the building is brick veneer, built on a wood frame. The original roof was wood shingle material, with a brick chimney extending up and over the hip style roof line. Shallow brick arches give the windows a slightly round top, local field stone and mortar are used in the foundation and basement. On the tower, over the school's main entrance is a corrugated tin canopy sign reading: \\"Brant Cons School 1914\\" = Expansion = In the Mid 1920s it became clear that the Brant Consolidated School would need to be expanded as the numbers of students in the area were growing. Plans were made to add two more rooms to the school on the east side of the tower. A regular classroom would be upstairs and the main floor classroom would also double as a community room. It was in this room that concerts were held for Christmas, the community would gather for Fowl Suppers in the Fall, Remembrance Day services were held as well as dances, card parties and social events. A three-foot high stage was constructed in this room on the south wall, with two sets of stairs to gain access to the stage. A piano could be found on this stage as well. This was the only room in the building not to have a cloakroom on the south wall. In the north end of this multi purpose room were three doors, one leading outside to the back of the school and the other two were access to the tower component of the building. In the basement of this new half of the school, was a large room for the meals and dances that were held in the school. The kitchen was in the original half side basement and was used for many community functions.  Gymnasium  In the 1970s, the school now required an indoor gymnasium. It was decided that this metal structure would be built on the back of the school, with an adjoining breeze way. The Gym contains a large display case and small kitchen in the entrance area, two change rooms with bathrooms, an equipment room and a furnace room. = The School Today = In 1959, the local school board for Brant Consolidated 1703 was assumed by the newly formed Interlake School Division. In the 1980s the school was renamed Brant-Argyle School and has been administered by the ISD to present day. = Historic Designation = In the late 1990s a committee of community members from the Argyle area began to seek historic designation for the school. In 2003, the Manitoba Government, through Historic Resources Branch designated the school as a Manitoba Provincial Heritage Site. With this new designation, the school's exterior and some interior elements (including the staircase and tower) may not be altered through renovations. This move was important in protecting our local heritage.  References  *http://www.settlersrailsandtrails.com (Settlers, Rails & Trails Inc.

The effect is named after Tinker Bell, the fairy in the play Peter Pan, who is revived from near death by the belief of the audience. Another form is called the Reverse Tinkerbell effect, a term coined by David Post in 2003. It stipulates that the more you believe in something the more likely it is to vanish. For example, as more people believe that driving is safe, more people will drive carelessly, in turn making driving less safe.  Various applications  As an expression, the Tinkerbell effect is applicable to various situations and can be used to better explain concepts and support arguments. = In motion perception = In the Journal of Consciousness Studies, Frank H. Durgin applies this expression to the study of human motion detection and perception in his paper \\"The Tinkerbell Effect: Motion Perception and Illusion\\". He questions the common belief that visual consciousness is a direct translation of the information the visual sensory organs collect. He argues that \\"perceptual awareness pretends to have access to more information than is actually available to visual cognition\\". He relates his argument about the indirectness in motion perception to how, in the play version of Peter Pan, Tinkerbell's revival depends on the live audience expressing their belief in fairies through clapping. The Tinkerbell effect points out a significant flaw in the brain's system of receiving and interpreting visually available information: it is not directly representative of reality. With the overwhelming amount of sensory information, the brain summarizes it by filling in what it cannot make sense of. In other words, it is an act of imagination. = In education reform = David C. Paris (1997) uses the Tinkerbell effect to explain inconsistency in national education reform. He points out that while reform may be set nationally, it tends to vary depending on the school and on how individual schools manipulate it to suit their current education system. Even though reforms are intended to impact schools, schools often change reforms. Education reform can be complicated because the nature of change works from inside the institutions ‚Äì driven by teachers, students, and administrators alike ‚Äì outwards. \\"Because the reform process often works this way-from the inside out, what succeeds at the school and district level can vary widely.\\" Paris states there is also no right way to create a better school. There is no set curriculum or teaching style that guarantees a school's successful reform. Rather, some schools seem to succeed because there is widely shared and rooted belief that their unique system works. This culture of belief affects all the critical influencers on the inside, where change can begin and develop. If the school's teachers believe the work they are doing is special and valuable, the students may likely believe that as well. In this application, hard work is equivalent to the claps of Peter Pan's live audience. If an institution has greater confidence in its methods (by having effective teachers who promote clear goals and who pay personal attention to their students), it is more likely to receive the \\"claps\\" needed for its continued success. Similar to the way in which Tinkerbell's life depends on the audience's belief in her, schools depend on this belief-culture to survive. While this culture of belief in education appears to be beneficial, it cannot be standardized among all schools. Paris argues that without some set measure of program effectiveness, the Tinkerbell effect, that helped some institutions succeed, could hold negative effects on necessary reform. Overconfidence in a system can prevent further improvement and compromise the quality of the program. = In the rule of law = Cameron Stewart uses the Tinkerbell effect to explain why readers should \\"clap\\" for the rule of law principle. The rule of law is \\"a fundamental ideological principle of modern Western democracies, and as such, we are often asked to believe in it with unquestioning acceptance, even though Western states often honour the principle in the breach.\\" Also available here. Stewart states that this concept is much like the character Tinkerbell in that she cannot exist unless people believe in her. He says the rule of law does not currently exist in its entirety. He describes the attempts to implement the liberal philosophies embodied by this principle as the basis of common law constitution. This states that \\"the rule of law, and not parliamentary sovereignty, is the supreme authority of law, placing real limits on the exercise of legislative and executive power.\\" The issue is that it is not easy to formulate and has turned into a product of legal imagination. The author proposes that a connection between the rule of law and democracy is needed to ensure its existence. The Tinkerbell effect is used to try to effectively convince his readers to support his argument. He emphasizes the importance of adhering to or \\"clapping\\" for the rule of law because it is so dependent on our belief.

This article also describes factors outside of the health care system which contribute to this disparity.  Disparity in accessing care  Among patients greater than 50 years of age, women appear less likely than men to be admitted to the ICU. Also, women experience longer waiting times in the emergency department than men.  Disparity in symptom recognition/diagnosis  There are marked differences in the clinical symptom presentation of stroke between men and women. Women who suffer an acute stroke are more likely to present with non-traditional and non-neurological stroke symptoms, for example chest pain and/or shortness of breath. More atypical symptoms in women may result in a delayed diagnosis, longer in-hospital delays, and less aggressive rt-PA treatment.  Disparity in treatment  Research findings indicate that physicians treat women experiencing stroke less aggressively than they treat men experiencing stroke. Women with cardiovascular disease, as an example, are less frequently offered invasive procedures when compared with their male counterparts. The use of rt-PA (Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator), a protein enzyme that helps break up blood clots, is a common treatment for stroke. Research indicates that women have between 22% to 30% lower odds of receiving rt-PA treatment for acute stroke than men. When comparing the treatment of men and women with acute stroke, research has found that women are consistently less likely to receive thrombolytic (blood clot dissolving) treatments, despite findings indicating that women experiencing stroke benefit more than men from thrombolytic treatment. Between 1997 and 2006, women hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were less likely to receive cerebro-vascular and cardiac reperfusion/revascularization therapies, intravenous tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator to break up clots), catheter angiography (imaging of blood vessels), angioplasty/stent (opening of blocked blood vessels), and carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of plaque). Non health-system factors contributing to sex disparity  =Employer-sponsored health insurance and the employment gap= Chart made from data collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation Women do not access health insurance at the rate of men because women are less likely to be employed than men, there are fewer women in the workforce than men, and women are more likely to work part-time than men. In the United States, the current standard for acquiring health coverage by an individual and their family is through a group plan made available by an employer. As of a 2011 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 55.8% of Americans access health coverage through their employer, 20.5% depend on public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, 5.7% access coverage through a private non-group, and the remaining 18% are uninsured. Even for those individuals who are covered by employer-based plans, women remain disproportionately underinsured, meaning that their medical expenses after insurance (and excluding premiums) represent 10 percent or more of their incomes. Twelve percent of insured individuals, between the ages of 19 and 64, are underinsured, and of that group, women paid 16 percent of their income to health care costs, compared with 9 percent paid by men. These factors may make females less likely to seek care because of possible financial strain. References Category:Stroke ","title":"Sex differences in stroke care"},{"id":"42239025","text":"Johnny W.

He co- sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a law that the opponents claim could shut down many abortion clinics. These issues instigated a filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth.

The Texas Association of Realtors gave Stickland a 50 percent rating in 2013. 2016 reelection campaign In the Republican primary on March 1, 2016, Stickland faced opposition in his bid for a third term from Scott Weston Fisher, the senior pastor since 2000 of the Metroplex Chapel in Euless, Texas. Fisher carried the backing of former Governor Rick Perry, who in 2008 appointed Fisher to the Texas Youth Commission. Stickland defeated Fisher in the primary election with 58% of the vote. Comments made by Stickland in 2001 and 2008 in online forums generated controversy amid his primary campaign against Scott Fisher. Stickland apologized for his remarks. In 2008 in a post on a \\"fantasy sports message board, Stickland responded to a user's request for sex advice by saying, 'Rape is non existent in marriage, take what you want my friend!'\\". 2017 legislative session In 2017, Stickland offered an unsuccessful amendment to prohibit state aid to the abatement of feral hogs. In retaliation for Stickland's amendment, his Republican colleague, Drew Springer, Jr., of Muenster, backed by Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, obtained passage of another amendment to defund $900,000 from the Texas Department of Transportation earmarked for Stickland's hometown of Bedford. Stickland in 2017 authored HB375 which would allow Texans who were legally able to own firearms, to carry handguns without a permit from the state of Texas. Stickland is one of only twelve House Republicans organized through the House Freedom Caucus, which he claims is the true representative of most conservative Republicans statewide. He has emerged as a critic of Speaker Joe Straus and an ally in the House of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the presiding officer of the Texas State Senate. In 2017, Patrick and Straus quarreled over the bathroom bill sponsored by State Senator Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham, which would require persons to use the public rest room corresponding with their genitalia at birth. Straus agreed to a more moderate bill because of what he called concerns about economic boycotts of Texas by business and athletic groups who view the bathroom legislation as infringing on the rights of transgender persons. The Patrick-Straus split created an impasse on the legislation as the regular session wound down.Peggy Fikac, \\"Battle raging for control of GOP: Those linked to business interests are vying with Texas tea partiers,\\" San Antonio Express-News, May 28, 2017, pp. 1, A19. Stickland said, \\"I absolutely think that there is a fight going on for the heart and soul of the Republican Party.\\" Stickland used a legislative procedure called \\"chubbing\\" to prevent the consideration of over 200 bills by the Texas House, effectively killing the bills, in what Texas media referred to as the \\"Mothers Day Massacre.\\" 2018 reelection Stickland retained his state House seat in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 29,697 (49.8 percent), he defeated his Democratic opponent, Steve Riddell, who polled 28,251 votes (47.4 percent). Libertarian Party choice, Eric P. Espinoza, received 1,641 votes (2.8 percent). 2019 legislative session Stickland was the author of a bill to ban red light cameras in Texas. The bill passed both the House and the Senate. Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill into law on June 1, 2019.Fedschun, Travis. Red light cameras banned in Texas, FOX News, June 2, 2019. At the end of the 2019 legislative session, when Texas Monthly published its perennial Best and Worst Legislators list, they gave Stickland the \\"first- ever Cockroach Award\\" and wrote that they were \\"enshrining the term for a lawmaker who accomplishes nothing but always manages to show up in the worst possible way.\\" The reasons given for the newly created award included a \\"needless\\" Twitter fight between Stickland and a prominent vaccine researcher, in which Stickland called vaccines \\"sorcery\\" before saying he was only objecting to government-mandated vaccines, and Stickland's verbal sparring with other representatives who resurrected Governor Greg Abbott's signature $100 million plan for high school mental health services after Stickland used a procedural maneuver to kill it. Personal life Stickland and his wife, Krissy, met in church. The couple has two daughters.

After the attack, the Crimean interior ministry stated that a militant from Right Sector had been detained, according to Russian media Gazeta.ru. Right Sector had previously stated (on February 27, 2014) that it did not have any intention to go to Crimea. On March 20, Crimean prosecution denied that the detention had happened. None of the accounts of this event could be verified independently. The Ukrainian and the Crimean authorities provided conflicting reports of the event. The two casualties had a joint funeral attended by both Crimean and Ukrainian authorities. The event continues to be under investigation by both the Crimean authorities and the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian version =Storming of Ukrainian military facility= On March 18, 2014, at 3 p.m, 15 masked gunmen attired in Russian uniforms without insignia, stormed the 13th Photogrammetric Center of the Central Military-Topographic and Navigation Administration in Simferopol, Crimea.March 19, 2014. Ukraine cries 'robbery' as Russia annexes Crimea. CNN. (Retrieved March 19, 2014). The base was administered by Ukrainian soldiers and had been completely surrounded by pro-Russian and Crimean Self-Defense troops since 13 March. Pro-Russian forces demanded that the garrison surrender the base or otherwise they will take the center with force. Although it is unclear how the incident initially began, reports emerged of a pro-Russian self-defense member attempting to scale a wall into the base compound, and being told to get back by Ukrainian guards. The argument escalated into live gunfire being exchanged by both sides and the storming of the base itself. However, civilian testimonies indicated seeing self-defense troops and militiamen preparing for a possible storming of the base prior any confrontation. Soldier Serhiy Kokurin, a Ukrainian junior officer manning a watchtower overseeing a vehicle pool at the base, was fatally injured in the neck during the shoot-out. A second Ukrainian serviceman was shot in the neck and evacuated by several ambulances. The ambulances were granted entrance to the scene by self-defense troops, who sealed off the base to journalists. This death marked the first military fatality in the Russian takeover of Crimea. In addition to the officer, an ethnic Russian volunteer was reported killed per Crimean authorities, though it was unclear if he was killed by resisting Ukrainian troops or by accidental friendly fire (both were reported). The storming followed with the takeover of the park located within the base's compound and the Ukrainian command center. According to civilians and journalists at the scene, a total of 15 unmarked soldiers, armed with shotguns and AK-47s, participated in the assault, supported by two military vehicles bearing the Russian flag. A Ukrainian soldier on patrol at the park was beaten by self-defense soldiers with a pair of iron rods during the capture. The soldier's condition was reported as serious, according to military accounts. Shooting continued until the Ukrainian commander, Colonel Andriy Andryushyn, was captured. He was taken hostage, along with several other soldiers, in order to gain entry into the base's nautical building, where the remaining Ukrainian personnel had barricaded themselves on the second floor, refusing to surrender. The Ukrainian commander was interrogated by Russian troops, and allegedly declared his defection to the \\"People of Crimea\\" afterwards. Negotiations over the surrender of the nautical building, and the Ukrainian troops inside, continued until late Tuesday evening, when talks were met over their surrender. A total of 18 remaining Ukrainian soldiers were detained and placed under arrest by gunmen. The soldiers were placed in rows and had all identification marks, weapons, and money confiscated at the behest of Crimean police. By March 24, the remaining Ukrainian troops who had been captured during the altercation were freed, unharmed. = Government reactions = Ukrainian interim prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Russia of a war crime over the incident. \\"Today, Russian soldiers began shooting at Ukrainian servicemen and this is a war crime without any expiry under a statute of limitations.\\" Acting Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchynov suggested that the Russian annexation of Crimea was moving from a political phase to a military phase, following the announcement of the death of a servicemen. He issued orders on the night of 18 March, allowing Ukrainian soldiers to use their weapons to defend themselves. The Ukrainian government released a statement declaring that the steps Russia was reminiscent to those taken by Nazi Germany and its annexations of territories before the start of World War 2. The Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia was signed on the same day by Vladimir Putin and the self-declared Crimean republic, formally joining the independent Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation as two federal subjects - the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol.Treaty on Accession of the Republic of Crimea to Russia Agreement on the accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation signed kremlin.ru, accessed January 23, 2016 = International reactions = British prime minister David Cameron said: \\"The steps taken by President Putin today to attempt to annexe Crimea to Russia are in flagrant breach of international law and send a chilling message across the continent of Europe. Russia will face more serious consequences and I will push European leaders to agree further EU measures.\\" Russian version =Alleged Right Sector sniper= On March 19, 2014 Russian media, citing Crimean police, reported that authorities had detained a 17-year-old nationalist Right Sector marksman from Western Ukraine in connection to the killings. Sergey Aksyonov, de facto Head of Crimea, confirmed it in Twitter. Later, however, Crimean prosecutors denied detaining any gunmen, according to Interfax. \\"The information on the shooter's detention has not been confirmed. It is untrue. Unfortunately, no one has been detained yet,\\" Natalia Boyarkina, press officer for the Crimean prosecutors, told Interfax-Ukraine on March 20. Igor Strelkov participation Igor Strelkov, the commander of pro-Russian forces in the War in Donbass in 2014, admitted in his interview he gave on November 20, 2014, he was in charge of the Center's assault. Investigation by Crimean Prosecutor General The Crimean Prosecutor General Natalia Poklonskaya investigated the incident. =Initial statement of Crimean Prosecutor General= The day after the incident, Poklonskaya reported that pre-trial investigation services had determined the following: Several unarmed officials of the Russian Defense Ministry came to the Ukrainian military base to discuss cartography issues. This meeting had been agreed upon by both the base's Commander and Kyiv. While they were inside the base, Crimean self-defense forces were shot outside the base. A series of shots were fired both at Ukrainian soldiers and members of Crimean self-defence forces. There were victims on both sides: a Cossack self- defense soldier was killed, and another was injured. One Ukrainian soldier from the military base was killed and another was injured. At the time of Poklonskaya's initial statement, the exact position and number of shooters were unknown. The scene was examined by six investigation groups, including criminologists, detectives from the Crimean Republic attorney office, detectives from the main department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [of Ukraine or Russia?], and members of related departments. Poklonskaya stated that according to these experts, the incident was very similar to the snipers' attacks on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kyiv's central square, from February 18 to 21, 2014. Their goal was allegedly to provoke conflict between soldiers of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic. Several expert examinations were completed, including forensic medical examinations. Ballistic examinations were continuing, along with witness interviews. Casualties =Ukraine= * Ensign (Praporshchik) Serhiy Kokurin ‚Äì killed (shot while on patrol.

History The Bodleian Bowl may have been used by Rabbi Jehiel to collect funds for the academy in Acre. In around 1258, Rabbi Jehiel of Paris immigrated to the Kingdom of Jerusalem from Northern France with several hundred students, his son Joseph following soon later. The group settled in the Crusader stronghold of Acre, where Rabbi Jehiel founded a Talmudic academy which he named the Great Academy of Paris, after the original institution he had headed in Paris. The academy intended to continue the learning traditions of the Tosafists of Northern France. One report suggests that there were 300 students learning at the academy, although this may have included members of the local community, who devoted time for daily study. The renown of the new academy of the \\"Sages of Acre\\" was so great that Rabbi Shlomo ben Adret wrote in 1280: 'It is a custom among the sages of the Holy Land and of Babylon that if a question should be asked, nobody answers but they say: \\"Let us be guided by the Sages of Acre.\\"' Acre subsequently became a centre of religious authority for Middle Eastern Jews and the rulings of its rabbinical court were accepted by the communities of Palestine, Syria and Egypt. Its scholars were instrumental in preserving the communication network between the Jewish diaspora and Palestinian Jewry. It is probable that the Jews of Acre could not sustain the institution alone and that emissaries were sent to Europe to solicit funding. One such envoy, \\"Rabbi Jacob, the Messenger of the Yeshiva of Acre\\" (; c. 1258-1270), carried an \\"exhortatory treatise\\" which included an itinerary of the Holy Land listing the tombs and gravesites of biblical figures and talmudic sages ‚Äì possibly to be used as a fundraising aid.

She wrote for The Daytona Beach News-Journal as well as the Science Service among many publications. She won several journalism awards. Early life Before joining Science Service, Van de Water‚Äôs interests had vacillated between work in science and writing. When she was a teenager, a local newspaper accepted and printed her first news stories. Despite this early success, her interest in writing was initially ‚Äúeclipsed by a thirst for scientific work.‚Äù She worked for two years in the laboratories of the National Bureau of Standards and then at the National Research Council and U.S. Civil Service Commission, where she developed psychological tests and worked on related research projects about personality or intelligence. One project, for example, involved the creation of a standardized National Intelligence Test for school children. Eventually, Van de Water returned to writing, first through editorial work for an educational magazine and then as a free-lance writer. When she was hired as a full-time staff member at Science Service in November 1929, she found an opportunity to pursue both of her major interests. Contributions Van de Water attended nearly all meetings of the American Psychological Association from 1931 onward as well as many regional psychology conferences. She frequently reported on new developments in psychology, such as research on personality and the role of \\"social stimulation\\" in individual development. She also made efforts to raise awareness of the use of psychology knowledge, particularly in wartime. In this effort, she co-edited \\"Psychology for the Fighting Man (1943) and Psychology for the Returning Serviceman (1945). The circulation for Fighting Man was 500,000, a wartime best seller. During World War II, she wrote numerous daily press pieces on similar topics, spoke on the ‚ÄúAdventures in Science‚Äù radio program, and prepared a series of six feature articles on \\"morale protection,\\" arguing that such ‚Äúpsychological armor‚Äù was vital to national defense. Awards In 1959, the American Psychological Foundation (AFP) honored Van de Water with their Science Writer‚Äôs Prize ‚Äúfor her career of distinguished popular interpretation of science.‚Äù Noted in particular was her interpretation of psychology as it related to wartime issues.

Such hearts are of particular interest for therapy as well as research into heart disease. The first bioartificial hearts were created in 2008 using cadaveric rat hearts. In 2014, human-sized bioartificial pig hearts were constructed. Bioartificial hearts have not been developed yet for clinical use, although the recellularization of porcine hearts with human cells opens the door to xenotransplantation. Background Heart failure is one of the leading causes of death. In 2013, an estimate of 17.3 million deaths per year out of the 54 million total deaths was caused by cardiovascular diseases, meaning that 31.5% of the world's total death was caused by this. Often, the only viable treatment for end-stage heart failure is organ transplantation. Currently organ supply is insufficient to meet the demand, which presents a large limitation in an end-stage treatment plan. A theoretical alternative to traditional transplantation processes is the engineering of personalized bioartificial hearts. Researchers have had many successful advances in the engineering of cardiovascular tissue and have looked towards using decellularized and recellularized cadaveric hearts in order to create a functional organ. Decellularization-recellularization involves using a cadaveric heart, removing the cellular contents while maintaining the protein matrix (decellularization), and subsequently facilitating growth of appropriate cardiovascular tissue inside the remaining matrix (recellularization). Over the past years, researchers found cardiac stem cells that have been residing in the heart itself. This discovery sparked the idea of regenerating the heart cells by taking the stem cells inside the heart and reprogrammed them into cardiac tissues. The importance of these stem cells are: self-renewal, the ability to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth vascular muscle cells, and clonogenicity. These stem cells are capable of becoming myocytes, which are for stabilizing the topography of the intercellular components as well as to help control the size and shape of the heart, as well as vascular cells, which serves as a cell reservoir for the turnover and the maintenance of the mesenchymal tissues. Ebryotic stem cells are shown to be able to form into other types of cells, however no clinical studies has used this for myocardial regeneration yet to avoid the possibility of the formation of teratoma. at the moment, autologous cells are the most used in clinical trials, such as bone marrow, to avoid tissue rejection.  Methodology  The preferred method to remove all cellular components from a heart is perfusion decellularization. This technique involves perfusing the heart with SDS, distilled water and Triton X-100. The remaining ECM is composed of structural elements such as collagen, laminin, elastin and fibronectin. The ECM scaffold promotes proper cellular proliferation and differentiation, vascular development, as well as providing mechanical support for cellular growth. Because minimal DNA material remains after the decellularization process, the engineered organ is biocompatible with the transplant recipient, regardless of species. Unlike traditional transplant options, recellularized hearts are less immunogenic and have a decreased risk of rejection. Once the decellularized heart has been sterilized to remove any pathogens, the recellularization process can occur. These MCPs are then added to the decellularized heart and with additional exogenous growth factors, are stimulated to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells.  Recellularized heart functionality  The most promising results come from recellularized rat hearts. After only 8 days of maturation, the heart models were stimulated with an electrical signal to provide pacing. The heart models showed a unified contraction with a force equivalent to ~2% of a normal rat heart or ~25% of that of a 16-week-old human heart. Although far from use in a clinical setting, there have been great advances in the field of bioartificial heart generation. The use of decellularization and recellularization processes, has led to the production of a three dimensional matrix that promotes cellular growth; the repopulation of the matrix containing appropriate cell composition; and the bioengineering of organs demonstrating functionality (limited) and responsiveness to stimuli. This area shows immense promise and with future research may redefine treatment of end stage heart failure.

In 1947, she received the Garvan Medal, an award for women in chemistry. Early life and education  Sherrill was born in Salisbury, North Carolina on July 14, 1888, the daughter of Miles and Sarah (Bost) Sherrill. She was educated at public schools in North Carolina, before attending Randolph-Macon Women's College, where she received a B.A. in chemistry in 1909. Her interest in chemistry was stimulated by one of her freshmen year teachers, Fernando Wood Martin.  Learning and teaching Sherrill continued her education by combining teaching and study. She worked as an assistant in chemistry at Randolph-Macon while taking classes towards her M.A. degree in physics, which she earned in 1911. She continued to teach at Randolph-Macon until 1916. During the 1916-1917 academic year, Sherrill attended the University of Chicago Ph.D. program. From 1917 to 1920, she attended the University of Chicago during the summer, while teaching during the winter. She worked at Randolph-Macon in 1917-1918 and at North Carolina College for Women in 1918-1920\\\\. She was mentored by Julius Stieglitz. For her graduate research, she studied the synthesis of barbiturates, and methods of synthesizing esters of methylenedisalicylic acid. During the first world war, Stieglitz actively recruited chemists for the war effort. Sherrill worked full-time as a research associate for the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in 1920-1921\\\\. Her research involved the synthesis of a gas to cause sneezing, and she obtained a patent on its commercial production. After the war, Stieglitz recommended Sherrill to Emma Perry Carr, chair of the Mount Holyoke chemistry department. Sherrill worked as a research assistant there from 1921 to 1923, while finishing her Ph.D. thesis. She received her doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1923.  At home and at work at Mount Holyoke  Kathleen Zier, Anna Jane Harrison, Mary Sherrill, Marie Mercury (1947) Mary Lura Sherrill (1945) After completing her Ph.D., Sherrill was promoted to associate professor of chemistry (1924) and then to full professor (1931). She became department chair in 1946. She and Emma Perry Carr became devoted friends, living, working, and traveling together. Their colleague Lucy Weston Pickett was to recall: \\"She was very devoted to Miss Carr... and they worked very well together. She was a good teacher and a good scientist in her own right, but somehow we thought of them together.\\" The chemistry department at Mount Holyoke was organized as a research group, in which faculty, master's students and undergraduates worked together. Sherrill advocated the combination of teaching and active research investigation for its benefits to both teachers and students. The Mount Holyoke group investigated the ultraviolet spectroscopy of organic molecules. Mary Sherrill's contribution to the group was the synthesis and purification of organic compounds, in preparation for spectroscopic examination. This was essential work if the results of the analysis were to be meaningful. Sherrill worked initially with a Fery spectrograph, after 1926 with a Hilger quartz spectrograph, and after 1930 with a fluorite prism spectrograph. Later the lab obtained two Beckman spectrophotometers. In 1928-1929, Sherrill was awarded a fellowship to study new purification techniques being used overseas. She visited Jacques Errera in Brussels and Johannes Diderik van der Waals in Amsterdam. With Errera, she also studied the relationship between dipole moments and molecular structure. Mary Sherrill also visited in Europe in 1936, studying in Brussels, in Oxford, and at the University of Vienna. During World War II, it became difficult to obtain quinine for the treatment of malaria. Understanding the action of organic compounds and finding alternative treatments for malaria became an important area of work for the war effort. Sherrill and others including Emma Perry Carr, Mary Mercury Roth, Eleanor Anderson and Jean Crawford worked on the synthesis of antimalarial drugs for the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Mary Sherrill published on a variety of topics including preparation and identification of chemical derivatives, isomerism, ring compounds, dipole moments and molecular constitution, pentenes, heptenes, methylbutene and quinazoline derivatives. Her contributions were noted in the Annual Survey of American Chemistry (1930): \\"The preparation and purification of chlorides, bromides and iodides of normal heptane and the corresponding hydroxy- derivatives and the determinations of their dipole moments constitute valuable contributions\\". The Vassar Chronicle (1948) reported \\"A constant and active researcher, Professor Sherrill has contributed to the knowledge of the relation between physical properties and molecular structure, and has developed the application of physical methods to the study of organic compounds.\\" Awards and honors In recognition of both her teaching and research work, Mary Lura Sherrill was awarded the Garvan Medal for women in chemistry in 1947. She is one of three women from her research group at Mount Holyoke College who have independently won the prestigious award, the others being Emma Perry Carr (1937) and Lucy W. Pickett (1957). With Emma Perry Carr, she received the James Flack Norris Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Teaching of Chemistry from the Northeastern Section of the American Chemical Society in Spring 1957.. She retired from teaching at Mount Holyoke in 1954. Mary Lura Sherrill died on October 27, 1968, in High Point, North Carolina.
