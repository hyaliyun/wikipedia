The substance has been reported to inhibit two antibiotic resistance carbapenemase proteins in bacteria, New Delhi metallo- beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM-2), and make those antibiotic-resistant bacteria susceptible to antibiotics. Aspergillomarasmine A is toxic to leaves of barley and other plants, being termed as \\"Toxin C\\" when produced by Pyrenophora teres. The molecule is a tetracarboxylic acid with four -COOH groups. One section of the molecule is the amino acid aspartic acid. This has two alanine molecules attached. Aspergillomarasmine B differs in that the last alanine is replaced by glycine. The crystalline substance was first isolated in 1956, but its name was given until 1965. In addition to Aspergillus versicolor, aspergillomarasmine A is also produced by the ascomycete Pyrenophora teres where it acts as a toxin in the barley net-spot blotch disease. In P. teres, a biosynthetic precursor of aspergillomarasmine A, L,L-N-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-aspartic acid has also been isolated and found to contribute to the phytotoxic properties of this microbe. This precursor, aspergillomarasmine A itself, and a lactam form (anhydroaspergillomarasmine A) are together termed the marasmines. Other producers of aspergillomarasmine A include Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus oryzae, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Fusarium oxysporum. In mice the LD50 toxic dose of aspergillomarasmine A is 159.8 mg/kg. Properties Aspergillomarasmine A takes the form of colourless crystals. The chemical is insoluble in common organic solvents, but can dissolve in water under either basic or strongly acidic conditions. Anhydroaspergillomarasmine A, a lactam of aspergillomarasmine A, chemically called [1-(2-amino-2carboxyethyl)-6-carboxy-3-carboxymethyl-3-piperazinone], can also be found in Pyrenophora teres. The relative amount of these two toxins is dependent upon the pH of the growth medium, with lower pH favouring the lactam form. The lactam can be hydrolyzed to aspergillomarasmine A by treating it with trifluoroacetic acid. Aspergillomarasmine A functions as a chelating agent, sequestering Fe3+ ions. It can inhibit endothelin converting enzymes even in the live rat, probably by chelating metals required by metalloproteases. When heated, aspergillomarasmine A decomposes between 225¬∞ and 236 ¬∞C. Hydrolysis produces L-aspartic acid and racemic 2,3-diamino- propionic acid. [Œ±]20¬∞D at pH 7 is -48¬∞. With nitrous acid aspergillomarasmine A is deaminated, and isoserine with aspartic acid is formed. Titration reveals changes in ionisation at pK 3.5 and 4.5 due to carboxylic acid groups, and pK 9.5 and 10 due to amino groups. Treatment with ninhydrin shows a purple colour.

As the first presidential election after the end of Reconstruction, this election saw the first occurrence of the Democratic Party sweeping the Southern United States; the party would carry an overwhelming majority of Southern states well into the 20th century. In the Presidential election, Republican Representative James Garfield from Ohio defeated Democratic General Winfield Hancock. Though Garfield won a clear majority of electoral votes, he won the popular vote by the smallest margin in history. Incumbent one-term Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes declined to seek re-election. Garfield emerged as the dark horse Republican nominee following the 1880 Republican National Convention, prevailing on the 36th ballot over former President Ulysses S. Grant, Maine Senator James G. Blaine, and Ohio Senator John Sherman. Hancock took the nomination at the 1880 Democratic National Convention on the second ballot, defeating Delaware Senator Thomas F. Bayard and several other candidates. Garfield was the first sitting member of Congress to be elected president, and remains the only sitting member of the House to win a presidential election. Republicans picked up several seats in the House, taking a majority of the chamber for the first time since the 1874 elections. In the Senate, Republicans made small gains at the expense of the Democrats, but neither party had a majority due to the presence of an independent Senator and a Readjuster Senator. The two parties ultimately agreed to share power.

It served as the container for the two \\"Great Relics of Christ\\" (Gro√üen Reliquien Christi): the Holy Lance in its horizontal arms and the reliquary of the True Cross in the lower shaft. It is thus the original reliquary of the Imperial relics. The Imperial cross is kept in the Imperial Treasury in the Hofburg. It has been suggested that the cross was probably created some time around 1024‚Äì25 or 1030 in Lotharingia. A somewhat earlier creation as a commission of Conrad's predecessor Henry II (1002‚Äì1024) is also found in scholarly literature. An older base was replaced with the current gilt silver base of the cross in 1350 in Prague at the command of Charles IV. In addition he had new reliquaries made for the relics which had hitherto been stored inside the Imperial Cross.  Description  The cross has an oak core which is coated on the outside with gold leaf and with red leather on the inside. It measures 77 by 70 centimetres. The beams are 9 centimetres wide for most of their length and 12 cm wide at the ends of the beams. The front of the cross is decorated with pearls and gemstones in high mountings (Crux gemmata). The reverse, decorated in the niello technique, depicts the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) at the centre of the cross, surrounded by the twelve Apostles and the symbols of the Four Evangelists at the cross' four ends. Because it was created as a reliquary, several parts of the front side can lift off, which reveals openings through which the relics can be reached. The openings are lined with dark red material and are an exact fit for the Holy Lance and the reliquary of the True Cross. The dimensions of the cross result from these relics. There are other small, rectangular openings as well; whether these are for documents or other smaller relics is unknown. The following inscription runs around the sides: :ECCE : CRVCEM : DOMINI : FVGIAT : PARS : HOSTIS : INIQVI : ‚Ä† HINC : CHVONRADI : TIBI : CEDANT : OMNES : INIMICI : :Lo! May the hostile faction of evil flee the cross of the Lord ‚Ä† Thus may all of the evil ones surrender to you, Chuonrad. \\"Chuonrad\\" refers to Conrad II, in whose reign the cross was probably made. It is not known whether he commissioned the cross. Viewing the cross as a symbol of victory rather than an instrument of suffering is typical of the High Middle Ages and occurs often in Romanesque art. It is, therefore, also a symbol of the Imperial claim to universal rule. The base of the cross is a later addition, made of gilt silver with a wooden core and decorated with four enamelled coats of arms. The shields on the front and back show the single-headed, right-facing Imperial Eagle, while the silver Bohemian lion is shown on a red background on the two sides. This base is 17.3 cm high and 29.2 x 22 cm wide.  Bibliography  * Hermann Fillitz. Die Insignien und Kleinodien des Heiligen R√∂mischen Reiches.

Swanson attended Vanderbilt University, and played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores. The Arizona Diamondbacks selected him first overall in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft, and traded him to the Braves during the 2015‚Äì16 offseason. He made his MLB debut in 2016. Early life Swanson was born in Kennesaw, Georgia, to parents Cooter and Nancy (n√©e Dansby) Swanson. Swanson grew up in Marietta with two older siblings, sister Lindsey and brother Chase. Both his father and brother played college baseball, while his mother played collegiate basketball and tennis. Swanson's sister was a softball player. Amateur career Swanson attended Marietta High School, where he played basketball and baseball. As a child, Swanson became a fan of professional sports teams based in Atlanta, among them Major League Baseball's Braves, the National Football League's Falcons, and the National Basketball Association's Hawks. He was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 38th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign and attended Vanderbilt University. As a freshman, he played in only 11 games due to a broken bone in his foot and a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder. As a sophomore in 2014, he was named All-Southeastern Conference. After the Commodores beat the Virginia Cavaliers in the 2014 College World Series, he was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player. He was a finalist for the 2015 Golden Spikes Award, presented annually to the nation's top college player. Professional career =Arizona Diamondbacks= The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Swanson with the first overall selection of the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft. Swanson signed with the Diamondbacks, receiving a $6.5 million signing bonus. While batting in a simulated game against Yoan L√≥pez in July 2015, Swanson was hit in the face with a pitch. The injury delayed his professional debut, which took place on August 12, 2015, with the Hillsboro Hops of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. Swanson played in 22 games in his first professional season and finished with a .289 batting average, one home run, fourteen walks, and eleven RBIs. =Atlanta Braves= On December 9, 2015, the Diamondbacks traded Swanson, Ender Inciarte, and Aaron Blair to the Atlanta Braves for Shelby Miller and Gabe Speier. The Braves invited Swanson to spring training, and he was sent to the Carolina Mudcats of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League at the end of spring training. Swanson was promoted to the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League on April 30, 2016, after hitting .333/.441/.526 in 21 appearances at Carolina. On June 28, he was named to appear in the All-Star Futures Game, soon after having played the Southern League All-Star Game. On August 16, the Braves announced that Swanson would be promoted to the major leagues the next day. Upon his callup, Swanson was assigned jersey #2. On August 17, he went 2-4 in his MLB debut, including his first career hit off of Minnesota Twins pitcher Kyle Gibson. Swanson hit an inside-the-park home run against the Washington Nationals on September 6, his team's first such home run since 2001. With the hit, Swanson followed Paul Runge as only the second Braves player to ever make an inside-the-park home run with his first career big league home run. Swanson finished the year in the majors, recording a .302 batting average, .361 on- base percentage and a .803 on-base plus slugging percentage. Prior to the start of the 2017 season, Swanson announced that he would again wear his college uniform number, 7. He had been assigned 2 because Gordon Beckham was wearing 7 at the time of Swanson's call-up in August 2016. Beckham was later traded, leaving 7 available. Swanson struggled at the plate, recording a .185 batting average through May. Though he improved in June, Swanson had become the backup to Johan Camargo by the All-Star break. Swanson was subsequently sent down to the Gwinnett Braves on July 26, where he was expected to play every day. Swanson was recalled by the Braves on August 9 following an injury to Camargo. On May 4, 2018, Swanson was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a left wrist strain. He returned to action on May 19, in a game against the Miami Marlins. Swanson again struggled throughout much of the season. From June 1 to August 21, 2018, he hit .229 with a .671 OPS. Swanson widened his batting stance in August, and began hitting with increased power. His offensive production lessened in September. On September 26, Swanson was injured during an at-bat against New York Mets pitcher Noah Syndergaard. The next day, he was diagnosed with a torn ligament in his left hand. Swanson was left off the National League Division Series roster due to his injury. The torn ligament led to soreness between his left index finger and wrist. As a result, Swanson underwent surgery on his left wrist in November 2018. In 2019, Swanson had a productive first half, hitting .270 with 17 home runs before the All-Star break. However, he missed time due to a heel injury in the second half and struggled upon returning to the lineup, hitting only .204 with zero home runs over 142 second-half at- bats.https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/10234/splits/ For the season as a whole, he hit .251/.325/.422 with 17 home runs, 65 RBIs and 10 stolen bases. In his first taste of the postseason, Swanson posted a stellar .389 batting average and .977 OPS over 19 plate appearances in the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals. One of his hits was a game-tying double in the top of the ninth inning of Game 3 in St. Louis. The Braves won that game 3-1 but ultimately lost the series in five games. In a shortened 60 game 2020 season, he batted .274/.345/.464 with 49 runs, 10 home runs, and 35 RBIs. Personal life Since December 2017, Swanson has been dating Mallory Pugh of Sky Blue FC and the United States women's national soccer team. The couple met through Jace Peterson, who is Pugh‚Äôs brother-in-law and a former teammate of Swanson.

It connects the administrative capital of Garowe with the commercial hub of Bosaso, a distance of around 450 km (279.1 mi). Overview The Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway was constructed in 1988, after an Italian firm Merzario had been contracted to build the main trunk road, including its culverts and bridges. Its tarmac was later completed in 1990. Abdirizak Jurile was responsible administratively and operationally to build The Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway. In the Bari province, the highway starts from the Port of Bosaso and continues south as a single carriageway, up over the Al- Miskat hills and downwards toward Qardho. It continues from there around 205 km (127.6 mi) southwards to Garowe, whereafter the thoroughfare joins the Mogadishu‚ÄìBerbera highway. In June 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) began an upgrade and repair project on the large Garowe‚ÄìBosaso Highway. Additionally, plans are in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main thoroughfare. In June 2014, the PHA started a major rehabilitation project to repair parts of the road that had incurred structural damage during the previous year's cyclone. Scheduled repairs total around $389,498 USD, and include overall reinforcement of the culverts and concrete wing-walls, overall construction of the masonry works and gabion boxes, and construction of the check dam retain walls. Alongside Jidbali road, the Garowe-Bosaso highway is one of the main paths from the Nugaal to the north.Alasow, O. A. \\"Chapter Five.

Life The son of James Davison, of a Northumberland family, and the actress Maria Duncan, he was born in London 5 October 1813. He was educated at University College School and the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied the pianoforte under W. H. Holmes and composition under George Alexander Macfarren.. Critic Originally with ambitions to be a composer, Davison became first a music teacher, and then in the 1830s a music writer and critic. In 1842 he was a founder of the journal The Musical Examiner, and remained its editor (after it was merged with the Musical World) until his death. In 1846 he became principal music critic of The Times, where he remained until 1879, exercising substantial influence over British musical taste. He also wrote for other journals, including the Pall Mall Gazette and the Saturday Review.Warrack (2004). Davison's tastes were conservative and he was a strong advocate of the work of Felix Mendelssohn, Louis Spohr and William Sterndale Bennett, the latter of whom he had befriended at the Royal Academy. He joined Bennett on his first visit to Germany in 1836 where they met Mendelssohn, who had admired Bennett's work in London.Davison (1912), p. 24. Conversely Davison was strongly against the innovations of the composers of the New German School, including Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner, and even towards more conventional composers such as Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann, although he was an advocate of the work (and conducting) of Hector Berlioz,Davison (1912), p. vi whom he described as \\"a great musical thinker\\"Davison (1912), p. 501. and who dedicated to him his overture Le Corsaire (op. 21, H101) After the first performance in England of Robert Schumann's Paradise and the Peri he wrote: \\"Robert Schumann has had his innings, and been bowled out‚Äîlike Richard Wagner. Paradise and the Peri has gone to the tomb of the Lohengrins.\\" Visiting the Wagner Festival at Bayreuth in 1876 for the first production of Wagner's Ring cycle, he commented \\"Wagner...by crushing the buds of melody as they spring up, buds which might blossom into seemly flowers, cramps the manifold resources of expression which are the golden heritage of his art.\\"Davison (1912), p. 524. Davison's antagonism to Wagner was noted by musicologists of the Nazi regime in Germany, and (although he was not of Jewish descent) his name was included in the Nazi handbook Lexikon der Juden in der Musik (Dictionary of Jews in Music), published in 1940.Reprinted in Weissweiler (1999), p. 212. Composer Davison wrote orchestral works, one of which, an overture, was played at a concert of the Society of British Musicians. He also wrote and arranged pianoforte music for Bohn's Harmonist, and composed songs, among them settings of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The only book he published was a short work on Chopin, which appeared about 1849. Family In 1860 Davison married Arabella Goddard the pianist, who had been his music pupil. They had two sons, one of whom (Henry) edited Davison's papers into memoirs which were published in 1912. Davison died in Margate in 1885.

He is principally renowned for his poetry, but also wrote stories and plays. He wrote during the colonial period and is considered to have been the first Malagasy writer to weave political messages into his work. He wrote primarily in the Malagasy language. A contemporary of Jean- Joseph Rabearivelo, who is commonly cited as the first African poet to write according to Western conventions, Ramanantoanina was highly critical of the French colonial authority. He was a member of the secret nationalist organization Vy Vato Sakelika, and was exiled to Mayotte in the Comoros when the organization was banned by the French colonial authority in 1917. His writings were consequently banned and were not reprinted until the 1980s in Madagascar. As a result, his writings are relatively less well known in international literary circles than those of Rabearivelo. Ramanantoanina was born in 1891 in Ambatofotsy, a suburb of Antananarivo in central Madagascar, to a family that belonged to the former Merina aristocracy that had been dissolved upon French colonization in 1896. After completing his education in a private Protestant school, Ramanantoanina began writing and publishing his work in several local literary journals at the age of 16 under the pen name Ny Avana (rainbow). He gained popularity with his early publication Chant de fiancailles (Wedding Engagement Song) in 1907. Ramanantoanina was among the first generation of Malagasy poets to attempt to develop a structure and theory of Malagasy language poetry, who would be termed Ny Mpanoratra zokiny (The Elders) by later generations of Malagasy literary artists. His work drew upon the traditional Malagasy poetic form of hainteny, integrating standard characteristics the form such as embona (nostalgia) and hanina (longing) into his poems as a means to promote the unity of the Malagasy people and encourage a return to traditional values. After returning from exile in Comoros in 1922, he was excluded from opportunities for a lucrative career with the colonial government, and instead earned a modest living as a clerk in a book shop in the capital city. His works during this period became increasingly characterized by themes of disillusionment. He founded a literary movement called Mitady ny Very (Search for Lost Values), and on 5 August 1931 he launched a literary journal called Fandrosoam-baovao (New Progress) with fellow writers Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo and Charles Rajoelisolo. He died in 1940 in Antananarivo. After national independence in 1960, his writings were promoted nationally as evidence of the nationalist sentiment of the Malagasy elite in Antananarivo during colonization. There is a street named after him in Antananarivo.

The election took place during the Third Party System, shortly before the start of the Civil War. The Republican Party won control of the Presidency and both houses of Congress, making it the fifth party (following the Federalist Party, Democratic-Republican Party, Democratic Party, and Whig Party) to accomplish such a feat. The election is widely considered to be a realigning election. In the Presidential election, Republican former Representative Abraham Lincoln of Illinois defeated Democratic Vice President John C. Breckinridge (who became the first incumbent Vice President to lose a presidential election) and Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, as well as the Constitutional Union candidate, former Senator John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln swept the Northern states while Breckinridge carried much of the South, foreshadowing the political alignment of the country throughout the Third Party System. At the 1860 Republican National Convention, Lincoln won on the third ballot, defeating Senator William H. Seward of New York and several other candidates. The Democratic Party split its votes after three chaotic conventions. Douglas was nominated at the second Democratic convention, while the Southern Democrats nominated Breckinridge as their own candidate in a third convention. Bell ran on a platform of preserving the union regardless of the status of slavery. Lincoln's victory made him the first Republican President. Lincoln took just under 40 percent of the popular vote, a lower share of the popular vote than any other winning presidential candidate aside from John Quincy Adams's 1824 campaign. In the House, Republicans retained control of the chamber and won a majority for the first time after several states seceded. Democrats remained the largest minority, but several Congressmen also identified as unionists. In the Senate, Republicans made moderate gains, but Democrats initially retained a majority. They lost that majority shortly after the election when several Southern senators resigned. The Democrats would have the second-largest number of members in the Senate, although many senators identified as unionists rather than Democrats or Republicans.

He finished fourth in the 74-kg division at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and later took home a silver medal at the 2007 European Championships in Varna, Bulgaria. Before his wrestling career ended in 2009, Bucher trained as a member of the wrestling team for Ringerstaffel Freiamt in Aristau, under his personal coach Leonz K√ºng. A member of the Swiss wrestling squad, Bucher entered the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens as an underdog in the men's 74 kg class, after placing third and receiving a berth from the final Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. He opened his match by dominating Belarusian wrestler Aliaksandr Kikiniou with a 3‚Äì2 verdict, and then rallied for a 6‚Äì2 score over China's Sai Yinjiya in the prelim pool to move into the next round. Bucher edged past his Kazakh rival Danil Khalimov in the quarterfinals, before being tamed by eventual silver medalist Marko Yli- Hannuksela of Finland at 3‚Äì0, leaving him with an ankle injury. Fighting against Russia's Varteres Samurgashev for the bronze medal, Bucher could not endure a pain from his injury and easily lost the match to the Russian due to a 10‚Äì0 superiority limit. Bucher lost again to Yli-Hannuksela for the bronze medal in the same division at the 2005 World Wrestling Championships in Budapest, Hungary, until his medal drought culminated with a silver at the European Championships in 2007. He also sought to compete for his second Swiss team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, but missed out a spot from the Olympic trials. In 2009, Bucher announced his official retirement from the sport because of a right knee injury sustained from the Swiss championships.

The locality was first developed with the construction of the Great Ocean Road over the eponymous hill in 1920-21, when 100 returned soldiers were employed cutting a road through the area. The Great Ocean Road Trust opened up a subdivision of 140 allotments named the \\"Big Hill Estate\\" in 1924 to raise funding for the continued construction of the road; while these were sold, a township never developed. A guest house, \\"Iluka\\", was built on the new road, but burned down in 1926. Nationally renowned landscape designer Edna Walling bought 12 acres of the Big Hill Estate in the late 1940s with a view to creating a village there, but decided that it would spoil the location, and built a home, \\"East Point\\", there instead. Walling moved to Queensland in 1967, and the house burned down in a bushfire the same year; the ruins are listed on the Surf Coast Shire heritage inventory. Big Hill today is a little- developed stretch of the Great Ocean Road, with much of the locality being within the Great Otway National Park.

The current architecture of the street bears little resemblance to the original design of the street when first built in the early eighteenth century. Location Immediate vicinity of New Burlington Street The street runs east-west from Savile Row to Regent Street. History New Burlington Street was the last street to be built on the Burlington Estate, in c. 1735-9. The street was intended, like other streets on the estate, for occupation principally by people of high social status and its first houses, many now demolished, were similar to those on Savile Row. Also like Savile Row, the street included commercial premises as well; number 11, for instance, was first occupied by Robert Fisher, who ran Burlington Coffee House (or Fisher's Coffee House) from the building.\\"Cork Street and Savile Row Area: New Burlington Street\\", Survey of London, Volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2., 1963, pp. 490-495\\\\. british-history.ac.uk Retrieved 26 June 2014. According to Hughson's London, it was in New Burlington Street in 1763 that the practice of placing brass name-plates on doors first started. The idea then spread to Hanover Square and from there was generally adopted. In 1771, Sir Joseph Banks acquired a house in the street after his return from Captain James Cook's first great voyage (1768‚Äì1771), during which he visited Brazil, Tahiti, and Australia. Banks was President of the Royal Society for over 40 years. Number 5 was first occupied by the Dowager Viscountess Irwin, a member of the Howard family and daughter of the third Earl of Carlisle, in 1735 or 1736. Between 1848 and 1869 the house was the headquarters of the Royal Asiatic Society. Mary Boyle's \\"blue-stocking\\" parties Mary Boyle, Joshua Reynolds, c.1777‚Äì1778 Mary Boyle, Countess of Cork and legendary bluestocking, had a house in the street and died there in 1840. Her home was the site of numerous literary parties over more than fifty years, attended by figures such as Dr. Samuel Johnson, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, King George IV, British Prime Minister George Canning (who once practised his debating skills at the nearby Clifford Street Club), the actors Sarah Siddons and her brother John Kemble, and the poet Lord Byron. Her house was described as \\"most tastefully fitted for the reception of her illustrious guests: every part of it abounded in pretty things ‚Äî objets, as they are sometimes called, which her visitors were strictly forbidden to touch. Beyond her magnificent drawing-rooms appeared a boudoir, and beyond it a long rustic room, with a moss-covered floor, with plants and statues\\". Boyle's parties were of two kinds: \\"fine-lady parties, which she called pink; her blue- stocking parties, which she called blue; and, more frequently, a mixture of both. At the last, she would assemble two or three fine ladies, two or three wits or poets, two or three noblemen and distinguished members of the House of Commons, and one or two of her own family, seldom exceeding ten or twelve, at a round table\\". Listed buildings Numbers 1 and 2 New Burlington Street have been accorded Grade II listed building status by English Heritage. They comprise a pair of terraced houses, built in 1717-20, that were part of Lord Burlington's early development of the area. 10 New Burlington Street Number 10 is a new building, built by the Crown Estate and Examplar, and designed by the architects AHMM.

It stars Sharan, Aishwarya Devan, Disha Pandey and Ravishankar Gowda in the lead roles. The film is a remake of the Malayalam film Mayamohini (2012) with Dileep in the lead role and directed by Jose Thomas. Jai Lalitha released on 27 June 2014. Previously titled Smt. Jayalalitha, the film met with controversies over the name coinciding with the name of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalithaa. Later, it was renamed as Jai Lalitha. However, the director clarified that the name has no connection with the chief minister and instead signifies the strong embodiment of the 'woman-in-disguise' character that Sharan was supposed to play. Cast * Sharan as Jayaraj/Jai Lalitha * Ravishankar Gowda as Lawyer Lakshmikantha * Disha Pandey as Disha * Aishwarya Devan as Lalitha * T. S. Nagabharana as Srikantaiah * Harish Raj as Yogi * Sayaji Shinde as Raghav Production Pon Kumaran, who tasted success with Vishnuvardhana and Chaarulatha, planned to remake the Malayalam hit film Mayamohini in Kannada. He approached actor Sharan and narrated the story to him while on the sets of Kempegowda. Sharan was initially reluctant to appear in a female get-up. Later, he agreed upon the role and shed around 11 kilos in preparation. To get the external appearance right, he went through beauty treatments including facial, bleaching and threading. He stated that he lived like a woman for four months, trying to adopt feminine mannerisms by shutting himself at home and wearing his wife's clothes to practice. Jai Lalitha was shot in Bangalore, Mysore and other areas of Karnataka. Soundtrack The audio was launched on 26 May 2014 at hotel Citadel in Bangalore. Popular music director V. Harikrishna and director Dinakar Thoogudeep were present as the chief guest. Actor Upendra and director Yogaraj Bhat have recorded their voices for the soundtrack of the film. The music is composed by Sridhar V. Sambhram consisting of six tracks and all songs are written by Lokesh Krishna. Release The film released on 27 June 2014. The distribution rights were taken up by Thoogudeepa Productions of actor Darshan and his brother Dinakar. Jai Lalitha was given a U/A certificate by the Regional Censor Board. =Critical reception= The Times of India gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Director P Kumar has selected a good subject with a focus on comedy. Even the script too deserves a pat. But as story opens up, there are too many characters and sequences that give new twists to the story. Though it is appreciable as all of them form part of the script, it is difficult to follow the sequences suddenly too many turns to the story crop up. Once the movie ends, it takes sometime for the audience to recap the narration. But director has mainatined [sic] the comedy to some extent in all sequences with dialogues and Sharan at his best\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"P Kumar seems to have definitely done justice to this remake of the Malayalam comedy flick Mayamohini. Sure to tickle your funny bones, Jai Lalitha is a one-time watch\\". Deccan Chronicle wrote, \\"Though the hard work towards looking ‚Äòlike‚Äô a woman reflects well in the posters, it does not replicate much in terms of performance and makes it a painful watch for over two hours.

Specializing in the ecology and conservation of insects, particularly bumblebees, Goulson is the author of several books, including Bumblebees: Their Behaviour and Ecology (2003), and over 200 peer-reviewed articles. In 2006 he founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, a charity that aims to reverse the decline in the bumblebee population. Early life and education Goulson's upbringing was in rural Shropshire. He attended Adams Grammar School from 1977 to 1982, then New College, Telford from 1982to 1984. He studied biology at Brasenose College, Oxford, then completed a PhD in butterfly ecology at Oxford Brookes University under the supervision of Denis Owen. Goulson has said that when he was born in 1965, the British short-haired bumblebee was quite widespread, but he never managed to see one before they became extinct in the UK. In his book A Sting in the Tale (2013), he described a causal link between World War II and the decline of the bee as a result of intensive farming, pesticide use, and the resultant habitat loss, initially caused by a need to increase wartime food production. \\"The shorthaired bumblebee died out because its habitats were swept away,\\" he wrote. \\"It wasn't all that fussy, it just needed enough flowers to feed on: no flowers equals no bees.\\" Career Goulson started his academic career at Southampton University in 1995 as a lecturer in biology, where he began to research the life of bumblebees. In 2006 he transferred to the University of Stirling as Professor of Biological Sciences. He was awarded the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council BBSRC Social Innovator of the Year in 2010. In 2013 he moved to the University of Sussex as Professor of Biology (Evolution, Behaviour and Environment). In 2015 he was listed at No. 8 in BBC Wildlife magazine's list of the top 50 \\"Conservation Heroes\\". Bumblebee Conservation Trust In 2006 Goulson founded the charity the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. He was well aware that too much scientific research was read only by fellow scientists and that there was a need to engage the wider public: \\"You can publish experiments in high quality journals again and again but they are only read by a few dozen scientists who work in your field.

Sing OUT!\\", December 7, 2014 Anna Crusis Women's Choir, poster by Gale B. Russo for June 14, 1980 Concert The Anna Crusis Women's Choir is the oldest existing feminist choir in the United States, and is considered to be a founder of the North American LGBT choral movement. It was established by Catherine Roma in 1975 in Philadelphia, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Including both lesbian and straight women, Anna Crusis is the earliest formed of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses (GALA) and the first women's chorus to become a member of GALA. The choir is named, not for a person, but for anacrusis, a musical term for \\"the unaccented - or 'feminine' - upbeat that sets the stage for a downbeat.\\" The choir focuses on music by, for and about women, and has commissioned pieces from a variety of composers. It also recovers and performs historical pieces by women composers.  Politics and Process  Signer James Rowe applauds, December 7, 2014 Anna Crusis has a strong educational and social mission, performing music from all over the world and addressing issues of peace, justice and equality both on stage and off. They have a long history of supporting LGBT issues, frequently performing with other groups at events such as International Women's Day and Philly Pride. An amateur community choir, performing a cappella, Anna Crusis places a strong emphasis on inclusiveness, welcoming female singers of all ages and sexual orientations. The choir has included both physically impaired and hearing impaired singers, and traditionally includes a sign language interpreter at its concerts. Although singers must audition, the choir includes singers of all levels of musical training ranging from those who do not read music, to those with professional training.  Artistic Directors  = Catherine Roma, 1975-1983 = Catherine Roma was born in Philadelphia and attended Germantown Friends School, a Quaker School. Roma earned degrees in music (BA) and choral conducting (MM) at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and became involved in lesbian and feminist politics while studying there. While in Wisconsin she worked with historian Ann D. Gordon to identify music by and about women throughout history, creating the folk opera American Women: A Choral History for the United States Bicentennial. After returning to Philadelphia in 1975 to teach music at Abington Friends School, she formed the Anna Crusis Women's Choir, which performed American Women: A Choral History at a number of colleges throughout the northeast. By starting Anna Crusis, the first feminist women‚Äôs choir in the United States, Cathy Roma became one of the founding mothers of the women's choral movement. Her beliefs in feminism, social justice, and Quaker models of leadership fundamentally shaped the mission and direction of Anna Crusis. Decisions were often made through a process similar to Quaker consensus, in which all members had a voice. Cathy Roma left Anna in 1983 to pursue a graduate degree in music at the University of Cincinnati's College- Conservatory of Music, receiving her Doctor of Musical Arts Degree in 1989. In Cincinnati Roma founded MUSE (Cincinnati's Women's Choir). = Jane Hulting, 1983-2005, sabbatical 2003 = Jane Hulting, 2015 With the departure of Cathy Roma, the future of Anna Crusis became uncertain. However, the choir was able to connect with Jane Hulting, originally from Minnesota. A graduate of the Conservatory of Music in Kansas City, Hulting moved to Philadelphia in 1983 to attend the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. She became musical director of Anna Crusis in 1984. Under Hulting's direction, the choir's repertoire continued to be innovative, including a wide variety of languages and musical styles. = Jacqueline Coren, interim 2003, 2005-2011 = Jacqueline Coren's first involvement with the Anna Crusis Women's Choir was as a singer. When Jane Hulting went on sabbatical, Jackie stepped in as interim director. When Jane left, Coren auditioned for the choir's board of directors and was eventually selected as the new musical director of the choir. Jacqueline Coren holds both a master's degree in choral conducting from Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey and a master's degree in divinity from Quaker Earlham School of Religion. In addition to her work with Anna Crusis, she worked as choral director at the George School, a Quaker school in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and formed the Pendle Hill Chorus. Anna Crusis continued to perform a broad range of music, often reflecting political and social concerns of choir members of the choir who supported Anna Crusis' mission of social change through music. The choir continued to collaborate with other groups, including performing with Holly Near in a People's Music Network concert, participating in GALA's Equality Forum, and singing in a merged chorus with the Philadelphia Gay Men's Chorus and the Mendelssohn Club of Philadelphia. = Miriam Davidson, interim 2011, 2012- = Like Jackie Coren, Miriam Davidson's first connection to Anna Crusis was as a singer, in the 1980s. Beginning in 1995, she performed as part of the duo Wishing Chair. When Jackie Coren went on sabbatical, Miriam temporarily replaced her as interim director. When Jackie Coren retired as musical director, Miriam replaced her as the new musical director of the choir.

It is in its star's habitable zone and a big reason for its high rating is it receives the same amount of solar flux as the earth in the habitable exoplanets catalog. The planet has a mass of 5.2 Earth's masses and an estimated radius of >1.5 Earth radii. To date, it is the fifth- closest known potentially habitable exoplanet to Earth. The closest potentially habitable exoplanet is Proxima Centauri b at 4.2 light years. Second is Ross 128 b at 11 light years away, followed by Luyten b (and not counting the unconfirmed planets Tau Ceti e and f). Fourthly is Wolf 1061c at 13.8 light years from the sun. Characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= Gliese 832 c has a mass of approximately 5.2 times that of Earth. If it had the same density of Earth it would have a radius of around 1.75 or possibly the planet could have a higher density with a smaller radius. Its temperature is predicted to be relatively similar to Earth's, but is subject to significant swings as it orbits its star. The planet has a relatively high eccentricity, taking it very near to the predicted inner edge of the habitable zone. The planet's average equilibrium temperature is predicted to be , but is estimated to vary from at apoastron to at periastron. However, because of its large mass, it may have a dense atmosphere, which could make it much hotter and more like the planet Venus. =Host star= The planet orbits a (M-type) star named Gliese 832, orbited by a total of two known planets. The star has a mass of 0.45 and a radius of 0.48 . It has a temperature of 3620 K and is estimated to be about 9.54 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 10.19. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= The planet orbits its host star with about 3% of the Sun's luminosity approximately every 36 days and an orbital radius 0.16 times that of Earth (compared to Mercury's orbital distance of 0.38 AU). Habitability The orbit of GJ 832 c around its parent star, with the habitable zone boundaries shown. Its orbit is rather eccentric and takes it in and out of the range of the habitable zone at different parts of its orbit, possibly leading to extreme seasons. The planet is a super-Earth mass planet orbiting in its star's habitable zone. Although it orbits its star much closer than the Earth orbits the Sun, it orbits a red dwarf, receiving approximately as much energy from it as the Earth does from its star. It is not known whether Gliese 832 c transits its host star, something which would be required in order to detect any atmosphere the planet may have and determine its composition. Its host star (Gliese 832) has 45% of the Sun's mass, and as a result, stars like Gliese 832 have the ability to live up to 50‚Äì60 billion years, 5‚Äì6 times longer than the Sun will live. The planet is likely tidally locked, with one side of its hemisphere permanently facing towards the star, while the opposite side shrouded in eternal darkness. However, between these two intense areas, there would be a sliver of habitability ‚Äì called the terminator line, where the temperatures may be suitable (about ) for liquid water to exist. Additionally, a much larger portion of the planet may be habitable if it supports a thick enough atmosphere to transfer heat to the side facing away from the star. In the case that Gliese 832 c possess a Venusian-like atmosphere, which it could have due to its eccentric orbit (and the stellar flux reaching 1.45 S‚äï, high enough to boil any oceans on its surface), the planet would be inhospitable because of a runaway greenhouse effect on its surface. Any oceans on its surface would have boiled away due to the dense atmosphere, and as this occurred, the temperature would have risen to around . The water vapor would accumulate in the atmosphere to the point where the surface temperature would rise to around as the planet would have been overwhelmed by water vapor (which is a powerful greenhouse gas).http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/venus/greenhouse.html Little amounts of carbon dioxide would have been present, as Gliese 832 c was/is probably an ocean planet. The surface pressure would have also increased to around 100 times Earth's surface pressure (100 kilopascals, 100 atm.) because of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. The net result would be that Gliese 832 c being a desert planet, rather than an ocean planet. Discovery and impact Gliese 832 c was discovered by an international team of astronomers led by Robert A.

Neville played his junior football for the Sandringham Thirds in the Victorian Football Association thirds competition; quickly establishing himself as a quality full forward, Neville kicked 122 goals for the thirds in the 1973 season. He played one senior game for Sandringham in 1975, kicking 2.4 against Geelong West, but could not gain regular selection; at the time, the Sandringham senior team was already well served by full-forward Ian Cooper. At the end of 1975, Neville was cleared to the neighbouring Mordialloc Football Club, then playing in Division 2, and Neville immediately became its permanent full forward. In 1976, his first full season of senior football, Neville was the leading goalkicker in Division 2, kicking 134 goals. In 1977, he was part of Mordialloc's Division 2 premiership team, and kicked eight goals in the Grand Final. In 1979, he won the Division 2 goalkicking title for the second time with 132 goals, and 95 goals saw him placed third in 1980. Neville left Mordialloc in 1981, playing for Templestowe in the Diamond Valley Football League and Maffra in the Latrobe Valley Football League, before returning to Mordialloc in mid-1982. He was Division 2's leading goalkicker for the third time in 1983, kicking 135 goals. He left the club again in 1984, then returned in 1985, but retired after only two games after suffering an arm injury. Across his VFA career, Neville kicked 725 goals from only 127 games. He kicked an average of 5.70 goals per game, which is a record among VFA players with 600 or more career goals. His 723 goals for Mordialloc was a club record. Neville also played turf cricket for Hampton for more than forty years, where he was a four-time club champion and is a life member.

In 1993, Sharp co- founded CarMax, the largest used car retailer in the United States, which grew to more than 135 locations with revenue of $12.5 billion by 2013. He was also a founding investor and member of the board of directors of Crocs, a footwear company.  Early life and education  Sharp was born in Washington D.C. on April 12, 1947, and raised in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. He graduated from the former George Washington High School in Alexandria in 1965. Sharp attended the University of Virginia, where he studied electrical engineering during the middle of the 1960s. However, he dropped out to pursue computer science, a program which was not offered by the University of Virginia at the time. He later explained to the Richmond Times-Dispatch that he lost interest in the original major, \\"One semester, I went to class and I got B grades. The second semester, I had no interest.\\" Sharp initially spent much of his time playing pool and poker. He never completed a college degree, but did enroll in computer courses at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, from 1968 to 1970 and studied advanced management at Harvard University in 1985.  Career  Sharp founded a computer hardware and software business development company when he was just 27 years old. He was first hired by Circuit City as an executive vice president in 1982. He served as Circuit City's chief executive from 1986 to 2000. Under Sharp, Circuit City's annual revenue grew from $175 million to 10.6 billion during his fourteen-year tenure. The number of brick-and-mortar stores also increased from 69 in 1988 to more than 600 locations by 2000. Sharp also moved Circuit City from its core consumer electronics business into new ventures, such as home security. Critics have argued that the move into these new ventures caused Circuit City to lose focus amid growing competition. Sharp retired as Circuit City's CEO in 2000 and left the company's board in 2002. All Circuit City stores closed in 2009 due to competition from other retailers, such as Best Buy, and e-commerce. In a 2013 interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sharp criticized the choices made by the company's executives after he left the company, \\"It is a sad thing...They made some stupid decisions after I left.\\" Rick Sharp, the then chief executive of Circuit City, delivered a speech to a conference held by J. D. Power and Associates in the early 1990s. Following his speech, Sharp conceived of a potential Circuit City expansion into the automotive retail business. Sharp led a team of Circuit City executives who created a used car retailer focused on two main ideas: no haggling and a huge inventory. The team rejected several proposed names, including \\"Honest Rick‚Äôs Used Cars\\" and \\"Sharp Motors\\" before choosing CarMax. Co-founded by Sharp in 1993, CarMax grew to $12.5 billion in annual sales at approximately 135 locations by 2013. Sharp hired Thomas J. Folliard as one of CarMax's first employees. Folliard has served as the president and chief executive of CarMax since 2006. Sharp was a founding investor and member of the board of Crocs, which was founded in 2002. He also established an investment firm, V-Ten Capital Partners. In 2008, Sharp was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Diagnosed with early-onset posterior cortical atrophy, a rare form of Alzheimer's disease, in October 2010, Sharp was an advocate for research on the disease. His grandfather, father and uncle had also suffered from early-onset Alzheimer's. Sharp and his wife, Sherry, donated more than $5 million for Alzheimer's research since 1999, most of which went to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he was a member of its advisory board. Rick Sharp died from posterior cortical atrophy at his home in Goochland, Virginia, on June 24, 2014, at the age of 67. He was survived by his wife of forty-five years, Sherry Sharp, their two daughters, and four grandchildren.

It leads to Mountjoy Square, is crossed by Temple Street/Hill Street, and is part of Gardiner's Row. The area was largely a semi-rural area until the 1770s, when a number of townhouses were built for the landed gentry. The street was probably named after the sister of George III in 1775; Caroline Matilda had married the Danish king Christian VII in 1766, divorced in 1772 and died in 1775. Occupants Belvedere College Dillon Cosgrave mentions in his book North Dublin, City and County that there was once a private school situated at No. 2 which was run by Reverend George Wright and attended by Charles Lever, the novelist, and that the school were fierce competitors of another private school at Grenville Street. At No.3 was the home of the notorious judge John Toler, 1st Earl of Norbury, known as \\"The Hanging Judge\\". It is now the home of several art and cultural organisations such as Fishamble: The New Play Company and the Olivier Cornet Gallery The French New Wave. One of the most notable landmarks on the street is Belvedere House. It was built as a townhouse in 1775 for George Rochfort, 2nd Earl of Belvedere at a cost of ¬£24,000. In 1841 it became a Jesuit college, Belvedere College. It is allegedly haunted by the ghost of Rochfort's mother, Mary Molesworth, 1st Lady of Belvedere, who died there.

Eastern View was a remote coastal area prior to the construction of the Great Ocean Road, which was opened to Eastern View, albeit in the form of a narrow gravel track, in March 1922. Only four houses were located in the area in 1924; a fifth was later extended and granted a liquor license as the Eastern View Hotel in 1927. The hotel owners later leased land on the ocean side of the Great Ocean Road and built a tennis court. The Eastern View Hotel was a popular tourist destination for many years, but closed in 1957. The Great Ocean Road Trust developed a nine-hole golf course at Eastern View in 1936. It closed at the beginning of World War II, and did not reopen. Both the former hotel building and the remnants of the golf course were destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983. Eastern View Post Office opened on 1 July 1927, replacing a receiving office that had been open since 17 November 1924. It closed on 31 December 1967. A tollgate on the Great Ocean Road operated at Eastern View until the abolition of tolls when the Great Ocean Road Trust wound up and transferred control of the road to the state government in 1936. It was proposed in 1940 to rename the town \\"Herschell\\", in honour of the long- time chair of the former Trust, but this met with local resistance and did not occur. The Great Ocean Road Arch, which is located within the town, is a prominent landmark of the Great Ocean Road, and marks its official gateway. It was first opened in 1939, and has been rebuilt three times: in 1974, after the Country Roads Board found the original too low and narrow, in 1983, after it burned down in the Ash Wednesday bushfires, and again in the 1990s, after it was damaged by a mini-cyclone. The arch commemorates those who died in World War I. Grass Creek (formerly Grassy Creek) runs through the west of the town. The Black Stump Roadhouse and a caravan park were located there during the 1950s. The Christian Brothers later purchased 25 acres in the area, and established the Santa Monica Camp. The original camp was destroyed in the Ash Wednesday bushfires, but has since been rebuilt. A construction camp was built nearby at Point Castries (now Cinema Point) to accommodate workers building the Great Ocean Road. Eastern View today consists of a small strip of houses along the Great Ocean Road between the beach and the Great Otway National Park. The Cinema Point lookout is also located at Eastern View.

The reported number of tribal members varies between approximately 3,000 and 3,276, many of whom reside within the town of Zwolle, where the tribal offices are based; the villages of Converse and Noble, and the unincorporated communities of Ebarb, where the tribe has a pow- wow ground; Blue Lake, and Grady Hill. This area is east of the Toledo Bend Reservoir and covers approximately 15 square miles. History The Choctaw- Apache Tribe of Ebarb is an amalgamation of several distinct tribal groups which came together in the early 1700s, with some additions in the 19th centuries in western Louisiana. Their ancestors came together due to both ethnic cleansing and voluntary migration. Its origins can be traced to 13 families from the Adai mission who settled on the east bank of the Sabine River in the early 1700s. They were later joined by four Lipan Apache families who were former slaves. Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de Los Adaes Presidio was a fort in the area manned by Mestizo and Spanish soldiers. They married or had unions with local women of the Caddo, Adai, and Lipan Apache peoples living in the area. The resulting mixed-race children were generally reared primarily in their maternal Indian cultures. When the Spanish dissolved the fort in 1773 and ordered the soldiers to return to San Antonio, many remained behind with their families. They settled in the area of Zwolle and Ebarb. Following the Louisiana Purchase by the United States in 1803, bands of Choctaw began moving into this area in search of new hunting grounds. Additional Choctaw were moved into the area by US Indian Agent John Sibley, who sought to protect them from the competing Creek and Chickasaw neighbors. Twenty-one Choctaw families were listed in the 1870 Census for the area, and some of this classification likely included people of Apache descent, as they intermarried. In the 20th century, the people mostly worked in the timber and oil industries. They lived along the east bank of the Sabine River until the states of Texas and Louisiana created a project to dam it for flood control and power generation. The states claimed 180,000 acres of the ancestral land to create the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The tribe was forced to move.  Recognition  The Choctaw-Apache Tribe of Ebarb received recognition as a tribe by the state of Louisiana in 1978 by legislative action (also reported as 1977). They have also sought federal recognition but have so far been unsuccessful. Because their members come from so many backgrounds, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has considered them a remnant group rather than a tribe. Its seven criteria for recognition include documentation of an unbroken cultural and genealogical chain to a historic tribe at the time of sustained European contact. As an amalgamated tribe, the Choctaw-Apache Tribe of Ebarb have to prove a different kind of identity and continuity. The tribe has been in the federal recognition process since 1978, when it filed a letter of petition with the BIA. The BIA converted their application into a letter of intent to petition in 1981 to conform to the process. Since then, the tribe has been working with a contract anthropologist to document their history and genealogy of member families. Family names Many members of the Choctaw-Apache Tribe of Ebarb are descended from a handful of Spanish and Mestizo-fathered families who settled in the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Their surnames reflect this past and include Procella (Procell), DelRio (Rivers), Sanchez (Santos), Martinez, Bermea (Malmay), Ybarbo (Ebarb), Sharnack (Ezernack), Rameris (Remedies), Leone, Padillia (Paddie), Parria (Parrie), Sepeda (Sepulvado), Garcia (Garcie), Menchaca (Manshack), and Cartinez.

Sir Frederick Wills was a director of W D & H O Wills , founded by his forebears, a member of parliament and a staunch Liberal. His wife, Anne, who gave the Founder her maiden surname at baptism, was the daughter of Rev. James Hamilton, a noted Scottish cleric. The influence of both his parents and a close-knit family of two brothers and three sisters was strong as was the family home in Northmoor which inspired a passion for the English countryside. Educated briefly at Winchester and then at Clifton College, it was Magdalen College, Oxford, where Noel Wills studied English, that provided the inspiration to realise an educational vision as the Founder of Rendcomb College. His brother, Gilbert Wills (who became the first Lord Dulverton) and Canon Sewell (the first Chair of Governors) entertained the thought that 'if there had been no Magdalen, there would have been no Rendcomb'. Noel Wills' time at Oxford was marked by wide-ranging reading, a generous appreciation of the talents of those around him and in the words of Professor G S Gordon (who became President of the College) an 'unostentatious goodness'. Noel Wills also developed strong creative interests: painting, music (he was a noteworthy cellist and fine tenor), and design. In the English countryside he loved, Noel Wills rode, hunted, played polo and was a fisherman envied for his skill by peers. He also loved to write: creative and philosophical prose, criticism, verse, even an operetta performed at home in Miserden, as well as some practical advice on fishing and countless letters to friends, all crafted in a beautiful hand. He was always keen to nurture others. In 1909, he started a monthly magazine of poetry with Walter Jerrold. Short-lived though this publication was, as many such ventures of its type and time, contributions were received by Walter de la Mare, Quiller-Couch, Lady Margaret Sackville and Edward Thomas. Further inspiration came in 1912 when Noel Wills married Margery Hamilton Fraser, the eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Fraser of Stromeferry House, Ross-shire. Mrs Wills provided support, abiding encouragement and remained actively involved in his vision for the rest of her life. Noel Wills described himself as 'a dreamer' though his dreams were inspired by philosophical insight, sensitivity to others and a profound concern for the inequalities evident in the society in which he lived. With the advantage of privilege, he felt the need to empower those less fortunate and in doing so showed a foresight borne out by huge changes to the education system in the first half of the century and the genesis of grammar school education. In his words, 'When opportunity comes to the favoured few alone, how small an advance can be anticipated'. Of course, the Wills family was no stranger when it came to educational altruism; the Founder's Uncle and three of his cousins had founded and endowed buildings at Bristol University. It was perhaps destined that Noel Wills would also make his mark on the world of education. In 1918, the Founder bought Rendcomb Park with a view to forming a 'Transition School' to provide a free boarding education to about forty boys from the elementary schools of Gloucestershire and prepare them for entry to Public School. He envisaged that by giving them 'the best possible education, some would gain entry by scholarship to Public Schools and perhaps, a few ultimately to University. This initial vision was broad and generous, involving supplements from the endowment to subsidise scholarships and leaving scholarships for those who could not secure entry to Public Schools for 'assistance in beginning professions and trades'. This vision evolved in the next two years in part by the Christmas gift that Mrs Wills had given her husband in 1917: An Adventure in Education by J H Simpson. Simpson had been educated at Rugby School and Pembroke College, Cambridge where he studied Classics and History before teaching at Clifton College, Charterhouse School, Gresham's and Rugby. The Founder invited Simpson ('one of the men I most earnestly desire to consult') to Miserden in February 1919 and the conversation they had shaped the future of the vision. Instead of providing what was essentially a Preparatory School education, Rendcomb College would educate boys for five years to sixteen, or seven were the boys of University material. That Noel Wills was prepared to compromise his original intentions says much for his receptiveness to new ideas and the respect that he had for the educationalist; that Simpson was prepared to leave Rugby to take the founding Headship of Rendcomb rather than posts at Oundle or Leeds University says much for the respect that the educationalist had for the Founder. Simpson's attraction to Rendcomb would have been increased as he learnt more of the Founder's intentions in a series of letters between the two in the months after their meeting (the Founder being the excellent fisherman that he was!) outlining his intention to provide 'a social, moral and intellectual education rather than mere scholarship'. Simpson clearly saw the potential that such a brief provided. On 2 June 1920, Rendcomb College opened with twelve boys, Simpson at the helm and Noel Wills as Chair of Governors. The two men shaped the path of the School for a little over seven years and their relationship was founded on mutual respect and affection. In 1924, the Founder wrote an illuminating piece for The English Review which gives a fascinating insight into those early years and his progressive educational vision. ‚ÄòRemembering what he wanted us to be ‚Äì his pride in what has been done well, his indulgence for what has been done less well ‚Äì we must go forward, humbly, but confidently, in the work of making his vision a reality.‚Äô James Herbert Simpson, founding Headmaster of Rendcomb College Noel Wills died in the autumn of 1927 References *The Collected Prose and Verse of Noel Wills (1931), collected by his wife, Margery Hamilton Wills and printed for private circulation. *A History of Rendcomb College (1976), compiled by C H C Osborne, J C James and K L James  External links  *Rendcomb is a Wills School (Rendcomb College) ‚Äì released under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later, and under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribute Share-Alike Category:Founders of English schools and colleges Category:1887 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Dulverton ","title":"Frederick Noel Hamilton Wills"},{"id":"43150884","text":"The 2014 season is the 104th season of competitive football in Paraguay.

It links Rheineck station, in the municipality of Rheineck and the canton of St Gallen, with the village and health resort of Walzenhausen, in the canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden. Passenger service on the line now forms part of the St. Gallen S-Bahn, branded as the S26. The line is owned and operated by the Appenzell Railways company, which also operates several other railway lines in the two Appenzell cantons.  History  Share of the Drahtseilbahn-Gesellschaft Rheineck-Walzenhausen, issued 1. October 1897 Aktiensammler 05/10, p. 18, BDeh 1/2 1 after its 2014 overhaul, at its lower terminus The concession for the construction of a rail link between Rheineck and Walzenhausen was granted in 1889. The Drahtseilbahn-Gesellschaft Rheineck- Walzenhausen company started construction in 1895 and the line opened on 27 June 1896. As constructed, the line was a water operated funicular railway that linked the current upper station at Walzenhausen with a lower station at Ruderbach, some short of Rheineck station. In 1909, a connecting tram line was opened, initially operated by a gasolene powered tram and later electrified. The owning company would subsequently change its name to Bergbahn Rheineck- Walzenhausen AG. By the 1950s the funicular was showing from its age, and it was finally closed on 1 May 1958 as the result of a broken axle. That year work commenced on the conversion of the funicular to a rack railway, using the Riggenbach rack system but retaining the funicular track gauge of . The connecting tramway was regauged and connected to the new rack railway, although retaining its adhesion operation, and the resulting line was electrified at 600 V DC. To operate the new line, a single four-wheeled railcar, BDeh 1/2 1, was built in 1958. In 2006 the Bergbahn Rheineck- Walzenhausen AG company was merged into the Appenzell Railways. The 1958-built car remains the only rolling stock on the line, and in 2014 was given a full overhaul, returning to work in May of that year. During the overhaul period, the line was replaced by a bus service.  Operation  Car near Ruderbach stop and depot. Note the transition from the level adhesion section to the rack operated former funicular. The line is in length, has a track gauge of and is electrified using a supply at 600 V DC, supplied by overhead line. Approximately of the line is equipped with the Riggenbach rack system, whist the rest of the line operates using rail adhesion. The height difference between the terminal stations is , and the maximum gradient is 25%. The line starts from its own terminus, located on platform 1 of Rheineck's main line railway station. For about the first the line parallels the Swiss Federal Railway's Chur‚ÄìRorschach railway, before bearing right and crossing the road on a level crossing to reach the stop at Ruderbach. The station building here incorporates the line's single track depot, accessed via the line's only set of points. Here the line joins the route of its funicular predecessor, and engages rack operation. The remainder of the line climbs at a steep gradient in a straight line to Walzenhausen, passing first through a long tunnel, and then across a long iron bridge over the Hexenkirchlitobel ravine. Finally it enters the terminus through a long tunnel under the Kurhaus. The line operates one or two return journeys per hour, depending on the time of day, with a single journey time of 9 minutes. Service is provided by the line's single four-wheeled railcar, BDeh 1/2 1. If this is unavailable for any reason, a substitute bus service is provided. A bus service links Walzenhausen with the upper station of the Rorschach‚ÄìHeiden railway at Heiden, thus providing the opportunity for a round trip via both mountain railways. The final link between Rorschach and Rheineck can be achieved using the St. Margrethen‚ÄìRorschach line, or by ship on Lake Constance.

In February, the two remaining battalions were used to rebuild SS Volunteer Grenadier Regiment 80 of the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division.Battistelli & Crociani, p. 39; Nix & Georges, p. 281; Tessin & Kannapin, p. 606 Order of Battle * Supreme SS and Police Leader \\"Italien\\" - SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Wolff ** SS and Police Leader \\"Mitteitalien- Verona\\" - SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Harster *** 15th SS Police Regiment *** SS Police Regiment Bozen *** SS Police Regiment Brixen Citations Bibliography Tessin, Georg & Kannapin, Norbert (2000).

M. (2009). The progesterone metabolite isoallopregnanolone is a subunit-selective antagonist of the GABA-A receptor. Chicago It has been reported to act as a subunit- selective negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, and antagonizes in animals and humans some but not all of the GABAA receptor-mediated effects of allopregnanolone, such as anesthesia, sedation, and reduced saccadic eye movements, but not learning impairment. Isopregnanolone has no hormonal effects and appears to have no effect on the GABAA receptor by itself; it selectively antagonizes allopregnanolone and does not affect the effects of other types of GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Isopregnanolone is synthesized from progesterone in the body by the actions of the enzymes 5Œ±-reductase and 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (with 5Œ±-dihydroprogesterone as the intermediate in this two-step transformation) and can be reversibly metabolized into allopregnanolone by the enzyme 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Levels of isopregnanolone, progesterone, and allopregnanolone are highly correlated across the menstrual cycle and throughout pregnancy. The concentrations of isopregnanolone are significantly less than those of progesterone and allopregnanolone; about half of those of allopregnanolone, to be precise. Isopregnanolone has a relatively long serum elimination half-life of 14 hours in humans. Isopregnanolone (developmental code name UC-1010) is under development for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800036513 As of 2017, it is in phase II clinical trials for this indication.

The regiment was destroyed in January 1943 and its personnel was used to reconstitute it in Norway several months later from existing police units. The regiment was transferred to Italy in late 1943 and remained there for the rest of the war. Operational history The regiment was formed in July 1942 in Russia from Police Battalion 305, Police Battalion 306 and Police Battalion 310 which were redesignated as the regiment's first through third battalions, respectively.Arico, pp. 402, 405, 432; Tessin & Kanapin, pp. 621‚Äì22 Between 29 October and 1 November, 10 Company of the Third Battalion helped to liquidate the ghetto in Pinsk, Belarus,Desbois, Chapter 4 killing an estimated 20,000 Jews.Megargee, p. 1443 I Battalion was redesignated as III Battalion of the 16th Police Regiment later in the year and was later replaced by II Battalion of the 28th Police Regiment from Norway. The regiment was ordered to be rebuilt in Norway on 29 March 1943 with the survivors consolidated into I and II Battalions. III Battalion was intended to be the redesignated IV Battalion of the 27th SS Police Regiment, but I Battalion of the 27th Regiment was ultimately used instead. In July the headquarters and I Battalion were garrisoned in Sarpsborg, II Battalion was in Mysen and III Battalion was stationed in Bergen.Arico, pp. 402, 405, 432; Tessin & Kanapin, pp. 621‚Äì22 The regiment was transferred to Italy in late 1943 with the headquarters stationed in Vercelli, I Battalion in Turin, II Battalion garrisoned in Milan and III Battalion located in Trieste. It was later reinforced by an anti-tank company and a rocket-launcher battery.Tessin & Kanapin, p. 622 The unit controlled two ethnic SS Police units, the SS Police Regiment Bozen and the SS Police Regiment Brixen engaged in security warfare in Italy. War crimes The regiment has been implicated in twenty-six incidents of war crimes in Italy from December 1943 to February 1945 with almost 200 civilians killed. Notes References * Arico, Massimo.

A hooker, Ward has previously played for Sale Sharks, Northampton Saints, Bath Rugby and the Cornish Pirates. At international level he has represented the England under-18s, under-21s and Saxons.  Club career  Born in Bath, Ward joined his local club Bath Rugby as a six-year-old, progressing all the way through to the first team for whom he made his debut as a replacement in the Heineken Cup against Treviso in December 2004. His first start came a month later against Leinster Rugby and despite Bath losing, he was named as the Man of the Match. He made just six more appearances for the club over the next two years, and, after finding himself as fourth choice hooker, joined Northampton Saints on a two-year contract in 2007. He made six appearances for Saints in their 2007‚Äì08 promotion winning season, scoring four tries, but was released from his contract by the club a year early in October 2008. Days later he joined Sale Sharks, though he again failed to secure regular playing time, making just three appearances during the 2008‚Äì09 season. During his time with Sale the club received a one-point deduction after he came off the bench against Harlequins prior to being re-registered following a loan spell at Manchester. He time at Sale was hampered by injury and after only one season, Ward joined Championship club Cornish Pirates in Summer 2009. He turned down a part-time contract from Pertemps Bees alongside a sales job in favour of the Pirates and later revealed that he had contemplated retirement prior to the move. He made his competitive debut against Nottingham in September 2009 and went on to make 33 appearances in his first season. He was ever-present in the two following years, racking up 110 appearances in his three years at the club. In April 2012 he returned to the Premiership after signing a contract with Harlequins for the 2012‚Äì13 season. His first season at The Stoop followed a similar pattern to his spells with Bath, Saints and Sale, with Ward making only seven appearances, five of which came in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. His Premiership breakthrough came in 2013‚Äì14 at the age of 28 where, following injuries to regular hookers Joe Gray and Rob Buchanan, he made 31 appearances, including his first Premiership start for seven years. Over the course of the campaign he earned five Man of the Match awards and was voted the Players' Player of the Season.  International career  Ward first represented England at under-18 and under-21 level. In January 2014 he was rewarded for his club form with a call up to the England Saxons squad for two games against Scotland the Ireland Wolfhounds. He started the first game which ended in a 16‚Äì16 draw and came off the bench as the second ended in a 14‚Äì8 defeat. Four months later he was included in England's senior squad for the three Test summer tour of New Zealand. Though he was not included in the matchday 23 for any of the Tests, he was a second-half replacement in the tour game against the Crusaders which England won 38‚Äì7.

It was annexed as a visita of Nagcarlan until it became an independent parish with Father Miguel de San Lucas as first parish priest in 1605 by the Franciscan missionaries. The first church was built in wood in 1620. A stronger stone church was built from 1643 to 1646 and was partially destroyed during the 1880 Luzon earthquake.\\"American Journal of Science - Art.V. The earthquake of the Philippine Islands, July 1880\\", pp.52‚Äì57. It was reconstructed in 1885 and was partially burned on April 6, 1898.  Architecture  The church, which is designed in baroque style, is adorned with red bricks. = Fa√ßade = The most prominent and notable part of the church is the fa√ßade is made of striking red bricks and adobe.

Fr. Philip Atienza. At the center of the chapel is an image of San Buenaventura enclosed in a retablo with narra wood in the patio grounds as its material made by a local Paete carver,Peter Paraiso. A first class relic was also housed in the chapel. In 1664, the image of San Buenaventura wept and sweated blood, with Padre Juan Pastor and 120 witnesses. On the right side of the church's entrance is the adoration chapel of the church. It was originally the baptisterio of the church. The original marble baptismal font was intact and kept inside the parish museum. = Church Patio = The grounds outside the church have been developed to promote Christian teachings for pilgrims.

He graduated from Inner Mongolia University in 2010 where he majored in history, stumbled on his first job and became a journalist. He reported for the financial news magazine Caijing about the forceful demolition of artist Ai Weiwei's workshop in Shanghai. He also covered Zhao Lianhai, a father whose son was a victim of melamine-tainted milk formula, and other rights defenders. In April, 2011, he was interrogated by Beijing police for 24 hours, and his home ransacked, for tweeting \\"today on taxi the driver said that two third of taxi drivers in Beijing will stage a strike during the May First holidays.\\" He was subsequently given a 10-day administrative detention for \\"posting false information on an overseas website Twitter that was retweeted 37 times and caused disruption of social order.\\" The incident was listed as a \\"significant, particularly sensitive case‚Äù by the criminal detection squad of the public transportation unit of Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, and he was called by the Beijing police a \\"dangerous element\\" who \\"incited a strike online\\" and ‚Äúattempted to provoke disruptions and harm the capital city‚Äôs public transportation order.\\" On February 15, 2014, Zhang was invited to be one of four Chinese bloggers to meet with United States Secretary of State John Kerry during his China trip. At the 40-minute meeting on Feb. 15, Zhang asked Mr. Kerry \\"Will you get together with the Chinese who aspire for freedom\\" and help \\"tear down this Great Firewall that blocks the Internet\\". Zhang also asked Mr. Kerry to look into reports that American companies had helped the Chinese government establish controls over what websites Chinese citizens could access. Zhang said the situation for political and human rights activists has not improved. He was worried about \\"prisoners of conscience,\\" specifically Xu Zhiyong, a human-rights activist who was sentenced last month to four years in prison, and Liu Xiaobo, a writer and activist who was imprisoned after being charged with \\"inciting subversion of state power.\\" While in prison, Mr. Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. Zhang wanted to know if Mr. Kerry would visit Liu Xia, wife of Liu Xiaobo, who had been under house arrest since his Nobel Prize win and who, he had heard, was suffering from illnesses. The secretary of state said that the issue of Chinese political prisoners was brought up every time he met with the Chinese officials. Mr. Kerry did not directly respond to that appeal but noted he was only here for a day and a half. On February 16, the Chinese propaganda authorities ordered all web portals to delete reports about \\"the U.S. Secretary of State meeting with four Chinese social media big Vs to talk about 'Internet freedom'\\". Meanwhile, his name became a sensitive word on Tencent Weibo. Though he could still log in his Weibo account and post, but a search for his name would yield \\"search result cannot be displayed according to relevant laws, regulations and policies.\\" On February 17, the Global Times published an editorial titled \\"Asking the US Secretary of State for 'Freedom' Was a Pretty Cute Show,\\" criticizing Zhang Jialong without citing his name and the appeal he had made to Mr. Kerry about Chinese Internet freedom, and referring to him as a dissident. Known for inciting nationalist sentiment, the Global Times is an offshoot of the People's Daily, the communist party's mouthpiece. On February 19, upon invitation by the Foreign Policy website, Zhang wrote an article spelling out everything he would like to say to Mr. Kerry. He said, \\"Since 1949, Chinese dictators have robbed their people of their freedom, forcing the country‚Äôs citizens to live in fear. China's people are still unable to freely access the World Wide Web. For many years, Chinese who aspire to freedom have spilled their blood and sweat fighting for it. Chinese people will continue to try to push down every wall erected by their dictatorial government, but if the United States could help in the effort to tear down China‚Äôs notorious Great Firewall, it would help China realize internet freedom sooner.\\" He also called on the U.S. to implement visa sanctions on those who contributed to creating the GFW, such as Fang Binxing, the father of Great Firewall. On May 20, he was notified by the department head at Tencent that he was being suspended, citing radical expressions he made in his meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the propaganda directives he publicized online. He was told that he would receive a final decision after Tencent coordinated with the propaganda authorities. On May 23, Tencent‚Äôs HR department notified him of the termination of his labor contract for \\"leaking business secrets and other confidential and sensitive information.\\" On May 30, The U.S. has expressed deep concern about the reported firing of a Chinese blogger who had met with Secretary of State John Kerry and urged the U.S. to challenge China's Internet restrictions. The State Department said it would be very troubling if a private employee was fired for publicly expressing his views. The U.S. also voiced concern over China's \\"continuing crackdown\\" on free speech.

He lives with his wife Isabelle near Brussels. Initially, he studied mathematics, philosophy and theology (Ph.D.) and became a Catholic priest. He presented a doctorate in Rome (Pontifical Oriental Institute), in Russian and Greek theology, on Nikolai Berdyaev's early writings in Russian, since his discovery of Marxism until his conversion to orthodoxy\\" (Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome). After his marriage, he was for ten years (1990-1999), member of the Forward Studies Unit of the European Commission, created by Jacques Delors, where he focused on the meaning of European integration and created the programme The soul of Europe. He had the opportunity to travel a lot and meet worldwide government officials and advisors in Europe, the U.S., China, Japan, or in India. Some were aware of the shift of civilization in which we are engaged globally, but these visionaries were a minority. In the Forward Studies Unit he invited many thinkers such as US sociologist Paul H. Ray (cultural creatives), Edgar Morin (a leading French philosopher of the paradigm shift), Hazel Henderson (author of numerous books on the win-win economy and the new green sustainable economy), Rinaldo Brutoco (CEO of World Business Academy), Avon Mattison (founder of Pathways to Peace), Harlan Cleveland, (President of the World Academy of Art and Science), Prof. Ziauddin Sardar. He was Dean of the Cotrugli Business School in Zagreb and Belgrade (2005-2009). For 8 years he has also been a member of the Auroville International Advisory Council in South India. He is a Fellow of the World Business Academy, a member of the Club of Rome-EU, a member of the World Futures Studies Federation and is Honorary President of Eurotas, European Transpersonal Association.  Individual work  = A Congress in the European Commission in 1998: The transmodern Hypothesis: A new dialogue between cultures seems possible = In May 1998, the \\"Forward Studies Unit\\" organized with the World Academy of Art and Science a Congress on \\"Civilizations and Governance\\", in the Brussels headquarters of the European Commission. We were presenting the hypothesis of a worldwide shift to a transmodern world. This hypothesis has been published in \\"World Affairs\\", in the \\"Integral Review\\" and in \\"Futures\\". And this seems to be worldwide. There are indications that the same shift to a transmodern vision of religion and culture is happening around the world: inside the Muslim world (Ziauddin Sardar), in China (Nicanor Perlas), and in South America (Leonardo Boff). And in this transmodern vision, a new type of dialogue between religions and civilizations is increasingly coming up, from the bottom of our societies. The minutes of this International Congress can be found on \\"The Future of Religions\\" = Willis Harman: The tool change is the vision of consciousness = As a member of the Forward Studies Unit, I had the great honour to meet with a genius thinker in the Silicon Valley: Willis Harman. According to Willis Harman in the late Middle Ages, the civilization shifted to the Renaissance because Copernicus proposed a new way of conceiving the Earth and the sky. Similarly today, the culture shift is happening around a new definition of consciousness and matter. We are leaving metaphysics \\"M1\\", which says that matter exists and that consciousness emanates from matter and some quantic scientists are already in a new metaphysics \\"M3\\" who discovers that consciousness is first and allows the emergence of matter. According to Harman, this conceptual earthquake, transforms the scientific method itself. And the \\"new science\\" is increasingly similar to the latest developments in quantum physics. Harman considers that this transmodern science resembles the vision of Humanity‚Äôs Perennial Wisdom and that opposition between science and philosophy will disappear slowly. = A New Economic Paradigm: The European Commission White Book of 1993 = In 1993, The European Commission published a White Paper on ¬´ Growth, Competitiveness, employment: The challenges of the 21st century¬ª. The Forward Studies Unit coordinated this study. It was announcing a shift to a post-industrial information society and was proposing very daring reforms in taxation, education, and of the European development model itself. This new vision proposed by Jacques Delors himself, has been politely refused by the EU Head of State, in the European Council of December 1993. In 2000, seven years later, the Portuguese government proposed the EU leaders to launch the \\"Lisbon Strategy\\" aimed at bringing the EU in the new \\"knowledge society\\". Portuguese Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Guterres, and Prof Maria Joao Rodrigues warned the EU Heads of State that this new strategy was a new economic paradigm.[13] This ‚Äúparadigm shift‚Äù concept has been politely refused. Indeed knowledge is different from industrial objects, the more you share it, the more you receive back. The knowledge economy is an economy of sharing that modifies the basic axioms of the industrial logic. It is post- capitalist (Peter Drucker), because the means of production are no longer the factory, but the humans who create knowledge. The analysis of this shift to the kwoledge economy is also analyzed by Jeremy Rifkin in one of his latest books.

First, a few owners that resemble their dogs are shown before heading inside to take a closer look. At first, a really big woman comes in to find a seat. She pushes her way through the row but by the time she finds a seat, all of the guys have been forced to the ground. Then we get to have a closer look at all the dogs in another room, being judged and looked over. There's a bird dog, a doggy that whistles while sitting in his cage. We also see an Irish setter over looking its babies that hatched from eggs, A police dog yelling things, the spitz, and a St. Bernard Booze Hound that howls a song while hiccuping. The last dog is a hot dog. Now back on the show, a mysterious light is going over dog ads like asbestos dog biscuits, itching canine art galleries, K-9 kennel, and so on and so on. And then it is time for the show to begin. First to perform, The Scotties. Which are two Scottish dogs dancing a Scottish dance. Then the Russian Wolf Hounds, who also do a dance after showing how skinny/thin they are. At the end of their dance it reveals there are two little black dogs on their heads and all four run off stage. The next act, titled \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" involves a dog eating the Hot Dog from earlier. Next comes \\"Little Man You've Had A Busy Day\\", involving an adorable little puppy sitting there. The Prairie Dogs perform next but it turns out their not really dogs, not that they mind. They stand there and perform a song anyway. As they do, the drunk dog from earlier howls along until a muzzle is shoved on his face. While trying to yank it off, the booze hound accidentally falls into a box of skates and begins to skate around. He incidentally interrupts the Prairie dogs as they perform. Then the next act involves a very shy puppy that didn't want to perform the poem its owner gave it. It criticizes the poem but continues anyway despite the many distractions. Like the booze hound accidentally releasing a whole bunch of fleas on the poor puppy. The puppy continues reciting the poem, its voice much quicker and high-pitch until it runs off stage. Meanwhile, the booze hound is still recovering when he notices a bunch of flees have gotten into his alcohol, having drunk a whole bunch of it. A group of fleas sing while hiccuping every so often, then finally they all lay down as the cartoon ends. References External links * Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

In many cases, these movements seek to counter the mainstream public, claiming there is a wrong that should be righted.Tufekci, Zeynep. Online social movements have focused on a broad range on social and political issues in countries all around the world. While the first social movements occurred through protests and civil disobedience, the rise of the internet ushered in numerous online social movements, beginning in the late 20th century. Since then, online social movements gained momentum into the early 21st century and are now one of the most prevalent forms of social movement. The organizational structures and strategies behind social movements have changed as a result of the online world. Online communities on social media build off social movements, enabling the connection of persons worldwide to develop a base and gain awareness of issues. The internet supports the mobilization of a larger group of people within a shorter period of time. The ubiquity of online social movements has resulted in varying attitudes. Both proponents and critics have raised valid points about the potential and the shortcomings of online social movements, which have been increasing evident in the numerous examples around the world.  History of Online Social Movements  The earliest social movements were minimally related to the internet. For instance, Charles Tilly recognizes the first social movements in Britain and the US in the 1750s and 1760s, after the 7 Years War. John Wilkes led the \\"Wilkes and Liberty\\" movement to achieve legal and parliamentary reform. Across the Atlantic, the Boston merchants and the activists in the Sons of Liberty initiated the opposition to the British that eventually lead to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The mentality behind these was spurred on by sovereignty within British politics through the Reformation and informed John Wilkes and his followers about alternative societal rule. Thus, in 1768, members of the English lower class began to mobilize underneath Wilkes‚Äô movement against the sovereignty of the ruling class. On May 10, 1768, Wilkes‚Äô supporters and the king‚Äôs soldiers at St. George‚Äôs field began fighting, resulting in about six to eleven protesters dead. This event sparked speculation about where sovereignty lies. The rise of the Wilkes movement marked the beginning of a new phase in British politics where the notion of popular sovereignty became dominant. Wilkes and his followers consistently challenged the leading authority through actions taken outside of parliament and on the basis of contesting laws. They created something that was so new that it laid the groundwork for political struggles to come: social movements. These situations, while different in nature from social movements we experience today, started the idea of mass-gathering to contest an issue. Modern examples of social movements include the Movement of the Unemployed in the 1930s, the Free Speech and Civil Rights Movements in the 1960s, the lower- profile 1990s movements and the many digital movements in the 21st century. Equifax played a part in the development of online social movements in its early stages. Social movements have evolved to a more widespread and integral state than ever before, in part due to social movements presence on social media. The earliest online social movements began right after the Internet revolution. While the Arab Springs are commonly associated with the earliest online movements, in reality, social movements began through email. In 1990, software company Lotus and credit bureau Equifax gained access to names, addresses and purchasing behavior of 120 million Americans in CD-ROM format. In response, nearly 30,000 consumers organized through emails and message boards in protest, halting the release of the database by 1991. Since the late 2000s, there has been an increasing use of commercial social media platforms by social movements. According to Lopes, \\"Social Media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the various online blogs have arguably given a voice to individuals that otherwise would not be heard.\\" Many people have conflicting views on social media and its effectiveness when put to the task of activism. The Pew Research Center found that some 64% of Americans feel that the statement ‚Äòsocial media help give a voice to underrepresented groups‚Äô describes these sites very or somewhat well. But a larger share, 77%, say social networking sites distract people from issues that are truly important, and 71% agree with the assertion that ‚Äòsocial media makes people believe they‚Äôre making a difference even when they really are not really making change.' The debate on whether social media has added or retracted to the function of social movements as compared to historical precedence remains at the forefront of modern discussions on these issues. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced social movements to reinvent their protest strategies. Strict social distancing measures prevented traditional physical demonstrations in several countries, such as Italy, or limited the number of people that could gather, as in France and Germany. Many movements were forced to campaign online. Moreover, with the concept of people-less protests, first described by Yunus Berndt, a form of political activism at the intersection of online and offline spheres emerged.  Uses of the Internet in Social Movements  The use of the Internet in attempts to change society can be understood through different mechanisms, which have redefined traditional social movements. The Internet can be utilized through emails and social media, as well as online forums and petition platforms, which is unique in the context of traditional social movements. Improved Communication and Increased Public Awareness The Internet has supported the spread of information about movements through rapid dissemination so that there is greater traction and more individuals are exposed to the cause. The communication costs of the social movement also decline, allowing for cheaper and better communication with audiences. In addition, the Internet serves as a forum where people can openly discuss grievances and inequalities. Improved communication becomes important in creating rational understanding of social injustices and inequalities, which are typically critical to driving social movements . Quicker and Larger-scale Mobilization of People With better communication, the Internet facilitates the development of collective understandings that encourages wider participation in movements. Physical constraints, such as geography and resources, can be overcome through online organizing. Social networks have assembled individuals of different backgrounds to create social movements that are widespread and global. Collective identity can be emphasized through this gathering of geographically disparate people and the diffusion of a common narrative. For instance, Twitter hashtags, Facebook pages and Tumblr blogs have all played roles in organizing protests all around the world, with nearly 100,000 different hashtags related to the movement. There is also potential for cross- movement influence, where the Occupy Movement that begun in the United States enabled the sharing of ideas with the Occupy Gezi protests in Turkey through digital exchange. More Effective Coordination of Movements The presence of the Internet supports the coordination of movements and the recruitment of resources. Grievances and public awareness alone are insufficient in driving social movements, but in addition require extensive coordination and resources. The online world also helps improve the different levels of engagement possible, such as sharing opinions and engaging in forums, signing online petitions and participating in decision-making processes. To an extent, movements are able to establish legitimacy through content distributed through the Internet, without relying on mass media or in-person organization. More Efficient Resource Mobilization The Internet provides a means to raise funds for campaigns. The Tibet Fund was one of the more prominent online funding raising platforms in support of Tibetan independence. The website provided detailed information for potential donors, as well as clear indications of how the funds will be used. The low cost of access to communicate using the Internet also freed up financial resources for other activities, especially where the campaigns are operating under limited budgets. This strategy can also free up resources to supplement online movements with in person organization, making goals for expansion more tangible.  Examples of Online Movements  Online social movements advance their work primarily through media, traditional or digital. It is easier, less costly as well as less time- consuming to link collective behavior as real-time communication can occur vastly and simultaneously via social media. These movements exist in a range of different locales covering a wide breadth of topics, and the extent of their eventual offline action varies from case to case. = Political Movements = Burning bus, Iranian presidential election 2009 2009 Iranian presidential election protests: Protests against the highly controversial 2009 Iranian presidential election results in support of opposition candidates Mir- Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, occurred in major cities nationwide from 2009 into early 2010. The protests were titled Iranian Green Movement by its proponents, reflecting Mousavi's campaign theme, and Persian Awakening, Persian Spring or Green Revolution, reflecting the \\"Persian identity\\" of Iranians and the so-called \\"colour revolution\\" theme. Protests began the night of 12 June 2009, following the announcement that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won nearly 63% of the vote, despite several reported irregularities. Crowd of protestors holding signs during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution Egyptian revolution of 2011: The Egyptian revolution of 2011, also known as the January 25 Revolution, started on 25 January 2011 and spread across Egypt. The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with the annual Egyptian \\"Police holiday\\" as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last few years of Mubarak's presidency. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, non-violent civil resistance, acts of civil disobedience and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured. Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country. Arab Spring: The Arab Spring was a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions that spread across much of the Arab world in the early 2010s. It began in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living, starting with protests in Tunisia. The protests then spread to five other countries: Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain, where either the regime was toppled or major uprisings and social violence occurred, including riots, civil wars or insurgencies. Sustained street demonstrations took place in Morocco, Iraq, Algeria, Iranian Khuzestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan. Minor protests occurred in Djibouti, Mauritania, the Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia, and the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara. = Gender, Race and Sexuality Movements = 248x248px #BlackLivesMatter: Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an international activist movement, originating in the African-American community, that campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people. BLM regularly holds protests speaking out against police killings of black people, and broader issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and racial inequality in the United States criminal justice system. In 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin in February 2012. The movement became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans. In 2017, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged the use of the hashtag Time's Up movement official logo #MeToo: The Me Too (or #MeToo) movement, with a large variety of related local or international names, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. The phrase \\"Me Too\\" was initially used in this context on social media in 2006, on Myspace, by sexual harassment survivor and activist Tarana Burke. Similar to other social justice and empowerment movements based upon breaking silence, the purpose of \\"Me Too\\", as initially voiced by Burke as well as those who later adopted the tactic, is to empower women through empathy and strength in numbers, especially young and vulnerable women, by visibly demonstrating how many women have survived sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. Following the exposure of the widespread sexual-abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein in early October 2017, the movement began to spread virally as a hashtag on social media. The Time's Up movement is in part a supplemental movement to #MeToo focused on taking equitable action and organization against inequality and sexual harassment in professional settings. The movement was created in 2018 and consists of more than 300 prominent women in Hollywood, including Natalie Portman and Rashida Jones, and work with a legal fund to lobby and get protective laws passed. Time's Up is an example of how online movements can become a segway into more goal-oriented, action-forward work. = Other Movements = #MarchForOurLives: The March for Our Lives (MFOL) was a student- led demonstration in support of legislation to prevent gun violence in the United States. It took place in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018, with over 880 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world, and was planned by Never Again MSD in collaboration with the nonprofit organization. The event followed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting a month earlier, which was described by several media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Protesters urged for universal background checks on all gun sales, raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to 21, closing of the gun show loophole, a restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks in the United States. Turnout was estimated to be between 1.2 and 2 million people in the United States, making it one of the largest protests in American history.  Impacts of Online Social Movement  The impact of online movements has seen a lot of growth since the introduction of the internet. With the accessible medium of social media, internet activism has reached the forefront of the internet. Through the use of social networking sites such as Facebook and content-sharing sites as YouTube, the opportunity for wide-scale, online social participation has increased.Rotman, D., Preece, J., Vieweg, S., Shneiderman, B., Yardi, S., Pirolli, P., Chi, E.H., Glaisyer, T. (2011). From Slacktivism to Activism: Participatory Culture in the Age of Social Media = Benefits = Online social movements have been celebrated for their ability to amass large amounts of success. The online world provides the power to organize without any formal organisations, which speeds up the process of mobilization and allows for greater scale in rapid time frames. This can be understood as New Power, which supports informal leadership and radical transparency, conducive for large amounts of participation by people on social media. Previously, the dominant form of old power limited participation in movements and leadership to a small group. Rapid mobilization helps people overcome pluralistic ignorance, where individuals believe that they are the only person with a particular view. Instead, the online networked sphere helps reveal otherwise preferences to each other in order to discover common ground. The increased visibility of a movement on the internet supports a sense of camaraderie, setting and maintaining a cause, even if it is otherwise decentralized. Social media can overcome pluralistic ignorance, which is the belief that your opinions are not shared by others, when in reality, they tend to be. The online world enables the synchronization of opinions across disparate geographies, creating new norms of behavior and belief through regular repetition and affirmation of messages. In the political sphere, active online groups increase political participation by providing a framework for discussion, leading petitions, and collecting donations in order to further a political agenda. This alignment of values has often results in the potential to organize, such as fund raising in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that raised $100 million in just 30 days. Online movements are able to sustain attention across boundaries, physical and temporal. For instance, during the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Facebook‚Äôs event function allowed for people to organize protests, which would then be acted out upon in real-life. Similarly, the Occupy movement was able to gather an online following around the world through the Tumblr blog, titled ‚ÄúWe are the 99%‚Äù. The function of being able to post on a shared website supported the gathering of different narratives, unifying people. In fact, online social movements epitomizes the notion of ‚Äúmany yeses, one no‚Äù. This motto highlights how the online world brings together diverse voices against something they all feel strongly about by acting as integrating screens since people use these devices to connect with others, rather than to isolate themselves. In many ways, social media has created networks conducive for unification across different identities, supporting intersectional approaches to fighting injustice. People can inform themselves on the most equitable practices and gain insight on how best to accommodate everyone while fighting for a particular issue. For instance, the Zapatistas attempted to emphasize their inclusivity of the movement, which had begun as somewhat of a peasants revolt. The leader of the movement, Marcos, was famously presented in numerous identities, of different exploited and marginalized minorities who are saying ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù to their situation: > ‚ÄúYes, Marcos is gay. Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, > an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a > Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew > in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a > single woman on the subway at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in > the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a > Zapatista in the mountains. Marcos is all the exploited, marginalised, > oppressed minorities resisting and saying 'Enough.' He is every minority who > is now beginning to speak, and every majority that must shut up and listen. > He is every untolerated group searching for a way to speak. Everything that > makes power and the good consciences of those in power uncomfortable‚Äîthis is > Marcos.‚Äù -Subcommandant Marcos, from Social Justice E-Zine #27 Social media is also able to provide a creative milieu that is conducive for narrative building. Memes, in particular, have proven to be a useful tool when it comes to circulating certain ideas. They enter the public consciousness and are able to pique interest through a dual purpose of entertainment and awareness. In addition, the large numbers of people online allow for intentional overproduction. Amanda D. Lotz noted that this is a key strategy, where multiple shows and commercials are created in order to compete, so that the most effective version can succeed, while the others disappear. In online social movements, hashtag culture functions by having many people copy each other and come up with new permutations, allowing for the most successful version to spread. Ethan Zuckerman, the creator of the Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism Social media platforms are harder to censor than real-life organization of movements. Ethan Zuckerman advanced the Cute Cat Theory of Digital Activism, which explains the relative lack of censorship online. Zuckerman posits that the web is used primarily for innocuous purposes, such as connecting with families and friends and posting pictures of cats. While the affordances that social media provides activists nurtures a community that engages in political criticism, these activists are able to hide behind the largely mundane uses of the internet and cause censorship by governments to appear especially draconian. For instance, the Twitter ban in Turkey by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who intended to ‚Äúwipe out‚Äù the social media platform was met with furious outrage from the population, experts and the global community. Similarly when ex-Tunisian President Ben Ali attempted to ban Facebook in 2010, his move backfired because so many Tunisians used Facebook to connect with family, friends and acquaintances. = Detriments = There are numerous critiques posed against online social movements that populate the discourse. Most frequently, the limited capacity for tangible change is often raised. For social movements to be successful, there need to be network internalities, which are durable networks ideal for organised action. These networks are the result of long-term challenges that are collectively overcome, which supports trust building. This process requires the investment of time and energy in order for members of a social movement to learn how to cooperate to achieve their goals. Zeynep Tufekci is known for her theories about social media, technology, politics and culture, in particular her \\"Mount Everest\\" metaphor Zeynep Tufekci introduces the Mount Everest metaphor in her comparison of the Civil Rights Movement‚Äôs achievements with the Arab Spring‚Äôs relative limited scope of change, especially in Egypt. Zeynep draws a comparison between social media and Sherpas. Previously, climbing Mount Everest was a challenging task. However, with Sherpas, more people were capable of doing so, and this led to a spike in mountaineering tourism. These individuals remained unprepared for the reality of scaling the mountain, resulting in a spike in deaths. Similarly, social media has enabled more social movements to spread and enter the public sphere. However, there has not been long-term training and building of network internalities which is necessary to sustain these movements. The Civil Rights Movement had undergone strenuous planning and organisation, which has resulted in leaders who were able to represent the cause, such as Martin Luther King. In contrast, online social movements tend to be more short-lived. For instance, Kony 2012 brought attention to child soldiers being forced into Joseph Kony‚Äôs Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army. However, the small organization that directed the video, Invisible Children, was incapable of managing the sheer volume of attention received. The director Jason Russell thereafter had a major breakdown and the social movement dissipated, which can be owed to lack of strong organization and network internalities. Related to this is the theory of tactical adaptation by Doug McAdam, which can apply to movements with a lack of strong organizational power and cause opposing forces to easily adapt to tactics employed by social movements. If mobilizing action on social media is a sole or primary tactic of a social movement and no consistent tactical innovation poses a direct threat to government or institutions, the movement may have trouble gaining traction long-term. There is also the concern of a lack of clear leadership in online social movements. This means that there might be a challenge in finding representatives to negotiate within the movement and with adversaries. These individuals might have little in common beyond the initial movement. For instance, Tahrir Square protesters could not deviate tactically from their initial demand, which was to overthrow the Hosni Mubarak regime. Hence, there was a tactical freeze, where tactics could not be adjusted and new demands were not articulated by the social movement. Even the creator of ‚ÄúWe are All Khaled Said‚Äù, the main Facebook page of the Egyptian Revolution, Wael Ghonim was in no position to concede anything. Ghonim was neither an elected leader, nor an informal one, which denied him legitimacy to engage in negotiations. Similarly, in the Occupy movement, there was an attempt to empower all protestors to be leaders of the movement. However, as a ‚Äúleaderful‚Äù movement, there was a lack of ability to identify a clear representative to negotiate since there were too many perspectives. Online social movements, while effective in unifying people, might also amplify the tendency to tribalism. In particular, more people having access to social media might democratize the risk of promoting violence, especially where institutions are not stable and there can be large amounts of distrust and disinformation. For instance, while social media had helped Sri Lanka ease the path to its first democratic elections in 2015 after years of civil war, communal hatreds began to overrun the news feeds, which are the primary portal of news and information for many users. Some critiques, specific to online social media activism, have been raised about the power mechanisms and organisational structure. This transition highlighted asymmetrical relationships between the for-profit aims of social media and the copy-left values that drive many online movements. According to Fenton, \\"Claims for the extension and re-invention of activism need to be considered in the context of the material social and political world of inequality, injustice and corporate dominance.\\" For example, \\"in his analysis of the Purple Movement (Popolo Viola) in Italy and its extensive use of Facebook, Coretti (2014) demonstrates that, while the myth of the network as open and inclusive persists, it acts as a disguise for the communication protocols of commercial social networking platforms that may well enable large-scale mobilization but ultimately, through their very functionality, encourage organizational centralization and fragmentation in social movements\\". The proprietary nature of the design of platforms, such as Facebook pages, possibly fails to provide movements with the necessary instruments in a shared democratic management of their resources. Moreover, the inability to manage Facebook pages and groups according to commonly agreed values promotes vertical power structures within movements, contributing to a controversial management of Facebook pages and to internal divisions that significantly hinder the potential of protest.  The Future  Social movements have existed before the Internet, but the nature of social movements has been modified through the Internet. The online world's beneficial impacts are clear, but these impacts are accompanied with detriments. Online movements are able to scale up dramatically and more quickly, but these horizontalist movements come at the expense of weathering risks and responses from the government. In comparing past social movements to social movements today, it is clear that many of them have heavily utilized online social media platforms to advance their agendas. With the help of many open source media platforms, such as Creative Commons and P2P Foundation, the public can easily gain access to the essence of these social movements. The prevalence of these platforms also allows for an easier way to market, while simultaneously reaching a wider range of audience. While many more social media tools are available today and as a result granted faster and easier preparation of a movement, it is up to debate whether this change has been good for the success of current movements. It is essential to continue to monitor this shift in culture in social movements and understand the advantages and drawbacks of having access to social media as a means to advance a movement. With the continued rapid evolution of the internet, the future of online movements is hard to predict. Vanessa DiMauro, a community builder and researcher in decision-making, believes that the biggest trend concerning online communities is the formation of private online communities. While these large networks that we encounter and use on a daily basis have provided us with a productive and collaborative experience, they have also increased to unmanageable sizes. To become a learning environment, these groups need to be much smaller and manageable, which reflects DiMauro's belief. This is where the idea and trend of private online communities could potentially be the future of online communities. The traditional role of actors, such as social media organizations and governments, have also changed with online social movements. In these online communities, social movement organizations have been less necessary for online participation. While these organizations have continued to play a role in offline engagements, social media organizations have begun to find new avenues for their contribution to social change. Similarly, governments have found new ways to respond to online social movements. They have done this by developing new methods to adapt to social media threats, as well as by developing new methods of repression. As governments have evolved, dissidents have continued to adapt with the new technological affordances. In an online space, uncertain times continue to remain for social activists and governments.

The documentary follows a year in the life of an innovative, design-based high school program, culminating with the design and sixteen-week construction of a farmer's market pavilion, the only farmers market pavilion in the U.S. designed and built by high school students. The film's title is a truncated reference to the catchphrase \\"if you build it, he will come,\\" from the 1989 film, Field of Dreams. Synopsis In 2010, Superintendent of Public Schools for Bertie County, Chip Zullinger (1951-2014) had been hired to address the school district's serious shortcomings. After completing four large architectural projects with designer Emily Pilloton (author of the 2009 book Design Revolution) and architect Matt Miller, Zullinger invited the two to create a high school curriculum. Pilloton and Miller described the curriculum, ultimately named Studio H, as shop class for the 21st century, where the design process could address the community's problems and its own sense of possibility. Named after its focus on \\"humanity, habitats, health and happiness,\\" the curriculum \\"empowered young people to become creative problem solvers and at the same time encourage them to become more active citizens.\\" Variety quoted Pilloton, saying the project's purpose was to \\"plant small seeds in our students that years from now could result in a new kind of resource.\\" Pilloton and partner Miller, worked with 10 (initially 13) high school students at Bertie Early College High School through the year-long, full-scale design/build curriculum -- following six design rules: there is no design without critical action; we work 'with' not 'for;' we start locally and scale globally; create systems, not stuff; document, share and measure; and finally build. The students began the school year with constructing water purifiers from clay and cow pies. After designing, constructing and selling corn hole boards, the students follow with full-scale chicken coops of their own design and culminate the year with the design and construction of an open- air farmer's market, which subsequently became known as the Windsor Super Market (depicted on the movie poster above, right). :::See: Geolocation of the Windsor Super Market: The project team and the community had identified a new farmer's market as a viable and desirable community project, and under the leadership of Pilloton and Miller the students focused on developing design and construction skills: critical thinking, research (e.g., analyzing Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion House), sketching, and drafting, along with welding and real-world construction trades. Pilloton and Miller in turn completed construction documents and specifications, worked with a structural engineer and filed for construction permits -- while also preparing and conducting three hours of daily classroom instruction. The film backtracks to tell the story of Matt Miller and his thesis project from the Cranbrook Academy, where he designed and constructed along with classmate Thomas Gardner a 900 sf, two-story infill house. The house was ultimately abandoned, leading Miller to conclude the project failed because the end-user was insufficiently engaged and invested in process. The Windsor Farmer's Market, aka the Windsor Super Market Together the Project H team identified student Stevie Mizelle's preliminary concept model to develop further, subsequently completing construction of the farmer's market to approximately 75% before the school year ended. The design features a large wood platform for vendor booths with vertical wood trusses supporting a rectilinear roofed canopy with wood slats designed to filter and control solar glare; a main floor at the same height above grade as a pickup truck bed, allowing vendors to back up to the \\"loading dock\\" at each vendor stall and walk their goods directly off their truck into their booth; and a long ramp at the front to allow pedestrian accessibility and to provide a symbolic front porch for visitors. Early in the school year, Pilloton and Miller chose to continue with the project after Zullinger, their prime backer, was dismissed by the school board, and the board became unwilling to underwrite the curriculum and withdrew their offered salaries. Pilloton and Miller continued to work with the students and subsequently completed construction of the farmer's market after the school year ended. The Windsor Super Market opened in October 2011. Students featured in Studio H were Erick Bowen, Rodecoe Dunlow, Kerron Hayes, Anthony Johnson, Stevie Mizelle, Cameron Perry, Cj Robertson, Jamesha Thompson, Colin White and Alexia Williams. The film also features County Commissioner Ron Wesson as well as volunteer Eric Wandmacher (friend of Pilloton and Miller) and Superintendent of Public Schools, Chip Zullinger. Background Prior to one- year Studio H curriculum in Bertie County, Pilloton and Miller had completed four architectural projects with the school board, as backed by Superintendent Zullinger: four playgrounds, three computer labs, a weight room for the football team, and a county-wide graphic campaign. Friction on the school board developed with another Zullinger-backed project, \\"Connect Bertie,\\" a project to bring free county-wide internet connectivity by paying an outside entity, Century Link, to provide the internet services at a cost of $2 million annually. The tension culminated with Zullwinger's dismissal, followed a reversal of the dismissal and then acceptance of his resignation. Without his support and the offered salaries, Zullwinger's departure directly threatened the Studio H project. Other tensions arose, and in a 2013 interview, Pilloton identified a racially and politically charged context that surrounded the curriculum and the project -- describing Bertie County as a place where \\"hundreds of years of slavery and institutionalized racism is very much still alive and kicking.\\" On release of the film, Pilloton and Miller said \\"they said they still believe it was fear of change ‚Äì not lack of money in a budget that topped $30 million ‚Äì that ultimately led to the board's decision.\\" Pilloton had grown up near Mt. Tamalpais, California, attributing the German toy Quadro with inspiring her interest in design. She later studied at the College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley and the Art Institute of Chicago, during a period when there was no curriculum but when there was a 100,000 sf shop class. Matt Miller was born in West Virginia and has architecture degrees from the University of Tennessee and Cranbrook Academy of Art. He has taught architecture and design at the Rhode Island School of Design, the College of Creative Studies, and UC Berkeley -- and worked with Architecture for Humanity. Miller was the first student at the Cranbrook Academy to design and also build his thesis project (along with classmate Thomas Gardner): a 900 sf, two-story block infill house at 2126 Pierce Street in Poletown, Detroit. The house, ultimately abandoned, had a construction budget of $60,000 and used all-volunteer labor along with carefully selected materials (e.g., concrete block and rubber membrane roofing) to keep costs down. Reception As of mid-2014, the film had received a rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 78% favorable critic response based on 27 reviews, with an average score of 6.79/10. Architectural Record called the film \\"A document of America at its most vulnerable.\\" The New York Times reviewer Nicolas Rapold said \\"the movie's biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film people telling us what's going on rather than having us observe.\\" Follow up Pilloton and Miller, who had been a couple, split up some time after the period depicted in the documentary. Matthew Miller is now the lead design/build instructor at (co)studio, a public high school program in Carbondale, Colorado. Pilloton continues to direct Studio H, which is now in its fourth year, at the REALM Charter School in Berkeley, California. Studio H has grown to include more than 200 students, a staff of seven (paid) and 24 built projects around the country (as of mid 2014). In Bertie County as of 2012, the Studio H program had completed 15 architectural and design projects, worked with 26 students and (in addition to the farmer's market pavilion) constructed two roadside farmstands for important county intersections, and organized a town-managed association for local farmers. Students have worked on these projects for high school and college credits as well as stipends. Early in the film, student Stevie Mizelle -- whose preliminary design for the farmer's market was ultimately selected by the team for design development -- joked: \\"school, I hate it, my dad hated it, my granddaddy hated it. I'm carrying on a tradition.\\" He currently studies animal behavior at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, and made Dean's List his freshman year. He was the first male relative in his immediate family to graduate from high school, attributing his graduation to his work with Studio H. Chip Zullinger died suddenly in April 2014. Zullinger, widely described as ahead of his time, told Patrick Creadon, director of \\"If you Build it,\\" he had been fired at least eight times and wore that as a badge of honor. Creadon described Zullinger as a \\"renegade school superintendent, a great thinker and a steamroller when it came to getting kids the education they deserve.\\" References External links * If You Build It (2013) at IMDb * Official Site * Connect Bertie at YouTube * Article in the Roanoke Chowann New Herald about Connect Bertie Category:2013 films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2013 documentary films Category:Documentary films about architecture Category:Documentary films about high school in the United States Category:Films shot in North Carolina Category:Films directed by Patrick Creadon Category:Bertie County, North Carolina Category:Architectural education Category:Documentary films about North Carolina ","title":"If You Build It"},{"id":"43151380","text":"Mudhdhoo, is an island in the Baa Atoll in the Maldives.

Designed by Liebenberg and Kaplan, the theater was built by theater owners Bill and Sidney Volk in 1948. After building a subsequent theater in a new ultramodern style, the Volks returned to the Riverview in 1956 and had its lobby area heavily renovated and updated. The Riverview remains one of several surviving single-screen cinemas in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area and typically shows second-run films for $2 or $3, as well as other special programming. Since the early 2000s, it has been consistently recognized by City Pages as one of the best movie theaters in the area. History The Lithuania-born Volk brothers, Bill and Sidney, came to Minnesota in the early 1920s and got involved in the movie business by purchasing neighborhood theaters during the Great Depression. In 1946, the Volks initiated what the publication Greater Amusements called a \\"theater- building orgy\\" when they received a permit from the Minneapolis City Council to build the first new theater in Minneapolis in twelve years in spite of the protests of other theater managers. The Riverview was designed by architectural firm Liebenberg and Kaplan and built in 1948 in the Streamline Moderne style. It opened December 30, 1948, with a showing of June Bride. The single-screen theater utilized stadium seating, making it one of the earlier movie theaters to do so. alt=In a lit room, dark square panels line the pinkish wall in rows, while green seats fill the space; a gray screen is visible to the front. Three years later, the Volks again called on Liebenberg and Kaplan to construct the Terrace Theater in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, \\"one of the first ultramodern theaters in America\\", and considered by author Larry Millett to be \\"their masterpiece\\". Pleased with the results (and the industry- bucking receipts), the Volks turned back to the Riverview and had Liebenberg and Kaplan remodel it to reflect the successful Terrace model. This occurred in 1956, eight years after the theater's initial construction. The new lobby space was intended to reflect a living room and even included a separate TV lounge. Amenities were ample: \\"Dunbar tables, McCobb stools, Herman Miller divans and chairs, walnut panels imposed on light wood, graceful modern lamps, stunning draperies.\\" Inside the theater space, however, little changed about the proscenium stage and seating. The Riverview became one of the few remaining single-screen theaters in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul area; by the end of the 1980s, it was one of only six left, and after 1998, it was one of only four left, with the Uptown and Parkway Theaters and the Oak Street Cinema, although since 1998, several new single-screen theaters‚Äìthe Trylon Microcinema and the Heights Theater‚Äìhave opened. The owners installed new seats in 1999 that allowed for greater leg room and more space between patrons. Contemporary status alt=A bike sits parked before an indoor snack bar illuminated with blue neon lights. The Riverview is located in Minneapolis's Howe neighborhood and seats over 700 patrons. It typically shows second-run films for between $2‚Äì3 per ticket and its concessions are also \\"much cheaper than at the suburban multiplexes\\". Sometimes, other events are shown, including midnight movies, sporting events, film festivals, and political events such as Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009. Take Up Productions, operator of the nearby 100-seat Trylon Cinema, sometimes uses the Riverview for screenings too large for the Trylon to accommodate. The theater won City Pages Best Budget Movie Theater award in 2000, 2004, and 2005, and the Best Movie Theater award every year from 2006 to 2014 except 2011 and 2012. The Riverview's lobby remains largely unchanged from its 1956 renovation.

The regiment was reformed in August 1944 in Hungary from the headquarters of the Polizei-Regiment zbV (zur besonderen Verwendung). Its battalions were taken from other police regiments, notably II./SS Pol.Rgt. 12, II./SS Pol.Rgt. 20 and III./SS Pol.Rgt. 21 as its first through third battalions, respectively. The latter two battalions were redesignated as the first and second battalions of the 6th SS Police Regiment in October while the regiment's second battalion was replaced by the assignment and redesignation of the Police Half-Battalion Hungary (Polizei Halb-Batallion Ungarn). The regiment was ordered disbanded on 12 March 1945 and its personnel and equipment were absorbed by the SS and Police Grenadier Regiment 89 (SS und Polizei Grenadier Regiment 89) of the 35th SS and Police Grenadier Division.

Will Everard, as she was originally known, was commissioned as one of four steel barges; the largest ever built. She is a mulie, with a spritsail rigged mainmast, a topmast and a gaff-rigged mizzen. She has a flat bottom with leeboards as is customary for Thames sailing barges. As one of the last sailing cargo vessels to operate in UK waters she left trade in 1966. After a few years lying derelict, she was refitted and eventually entered into the service of P&O; (Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company) where she was used as a floating board room until 1999. This role in corporate hospitality continued and she now is fully engaged in private charter work. She currently operates out of the Pool of London from a base at Hermitage Community Moorings, Reeds Wharf and St Katherine Docks for cruises through London, the east coast and beyond.  Early life as an Everard barge  Will Everard, as she was originally known, was commissioned by F.T. Everard in 1925 as one of four steel-hulled sister ships. The vessels were to be the largest Thames sailing barges ever built and were coasters destined for ports up to Newcastle in the north-east and round to Poole in the southwest. The Barges were built to Mr F.T. Everard's exact specifications and named after four family members: Will, Ethel, Fred and Alf. According to long term skipper, Jim Uglow MBE, \\"four stouter built barges never put to sea.\\" Will Everard was finished in 1925 and worked for the firm for over 40 years. She was initially bound to a coal contract supplying the gasworks at Margate with coal from Keadby on the Humber but routinely fitted in other cargoes between voyages. She was designed to be sailed by a Master, a Mate and two boys, however, her large size meant in practice a man at Third Hand proved more capable than two boys. In the 1930s she parted cables while sitting though a storm off Eastbourne and was blown ashore and battered on the beach for hours before the storm passed. She was found buried in the shingle, damaged but intact (her bottom survived this damage for decades before it was finally replaced in 2006). She was towed out by horse and the rig was repaired within days. P&O; converted Wills cargo hold into a mahogany-panelled saloon Will in the Upper Pool of London with Tower Bridge  World War II  Will Everard was due to participate in the Dunkirk evacuation, but her cargo was not unloaded in time. Her sister ship, Ethel Everard was lost on the beaches and left aground. Will Everard continued her trade work throughout the war. She completed 147 coasting voyages and carried, in total, 38,345 tons of cargo that included grain, sugar beet, oil cake, fertilisers, flour, sugar and cement. In 1940, she was machine gunned twice in the River Medina and bombed in a daylight raid at Phoenix Wharf by the Luftwaffe. In the same year another Thames sailing barge, Britisher, was destroyed by depth charges only 300 yards away. In 1942 she was very nearly torpedoed off Harwich by a German motor torpedo boat and in the following year she was attacked by a Focke-Wulf that shot 1,000 holes through her mainsail. However, none her crew were injured and by this point her wheel house had been reinforced with steel to withstand aircraft mounted machine guns. Jim Uglow was awarded an MBE for his work becoming the only Barge Master to be honoured with such an achievement in this line of work.  A new life for an old barge?  Will Everard continued to trade after the war and was for a while the largest barge to remain trading under sail. However, the fleets were smaller and the sail trade was changing. An auxiliary engine was fitted in 1950 but the cost of running the barges was going up, many of the crews sought work elsewhere and shipping was changing with the introduction of containerization and a growing road network. She was sold out of trade in 1966 to Vernon Harvey for ¬£750 and was renamed Will. She lay as storage for a few years before being bought by a barge enthusiast, John Hobbins, who re-rigged her. In 1976 she was sold to Overseas Containers Ltd (OCL) where she had a major refit in Maldon and began her new life in corporate hospitality. In 1986, P&O; (Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company) shipping gained control of OCL and therefore Will as well. They painted her hull in P&O; blue and they began using her as a floating boardroom and dining room for entertaining. With her cargo hold now a mahogany panelled saloon, her conversion was complete. This new role of transporting and entertaining people continues to this day. In many ways this reflects the growing service sector in the wake of manufacturing decline in the latter 20th century and beyond. The P&O; insignia is still visible on her mainsail to this day. Her skipper of 17 years, Sue Harrison, bought her in 1999 before she was sold to Mark Tower and Topsail Events in 2004 to continue work in corporate hospitality. Her hull has had many colours, notably green under OCL and dark blue under P&O;, however, she was recently repainted in 2006 by the current owner into her original grey hull with gold sheer line. As of 2018, she in operated out of the Pool of London by a charter company called Thames Leisure. She is moored at the heart of Canary Wharf in the West India Docks where she cruises through London, the east coast and beyond. In 1996, Will was made a part of the National Historic Ships fleet in the UK as vessel number 234 showing her continuing importance for national maritime heritage.

In comparison, Canon's astrophotography DSLR's 20Da and 60Da HŒ± sensitivity was 2.5 times and 3 times (respectively) more than the standard 20D / 60D. The D810A additionally has 1.39 stops advantage due to the larger image sensor format resulting in better than 2 stops sensitivity advantage giving over four times faster exposure times compared to the Canon 20Da/60Da. Although the D810A can be used for normal photography, due to the deep red / near infrared sensitivity the in-camera white balance may fail in case of fluorescent light or difficult cases with very strong infrared light requiring an external infrared filter.

Rue Sergent Blandan, Nancy. An 1894 illustration of Blandan's death The statue of the Sergent in Lyon Sergent Blandan (9 February 1819 ‚Äì 12 April 1842) was a French soldier, Jean Pierre Hippolyte Blandan, known for his historic resistance on the battlefield at Boufarik in Algeria. He was posthumously made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. Career Blandan joined the French Army at the age of eighteen, and served in the conquest of Algeria. He left Lyon on 9 September 1837 for the city of Annaba (then called B√¥ne) in the province of Constantine in Algeria to fight the tribe led by Oued Radjett. He was appointed Corporal on 6 August 1839, and promoted to Sergent on 1 February 1842. Death On 11 April 1842, Blandan led a detachment of twenty men to carry mail from Boufarik to B√©ni Mered, some 8‚Äì9 km away. After about an hour of marching, his company was attacked by a group of 200‚Äì300 Arab horsemen. Blandan exhorted his men to fight, even though he was seriously wounded. He refused to surrender before the superior force, and cried \\"Courage mes amis, d√©fendez-vous jusqu'√† la mort!\\" (be brave my friends, fight to the death!) The noise of battle was heard in Boufarik and relief arrived under Joseph de Breteuil. They found only five soldiers still fighting, the others all being dead or wounded. Blandan died of his wounds that night in hospital in Boufarik, at the age of 23. Tributes In 1886 a public competition was run to create a statue of Blandan as a tribute to his heroism. The jury awarded the work to French sculptor Charles Gauthier who completed it in 1887 and the statue was placed in Boufarik. Following Algerian independence, however, it was moved to France in 1963, where it was placed in the courtyard of a barracks in Nancy. As part of the ceremony to mark the placement of the statue, Blandan's ashes were placed in the new monument's base. In 1990, it was moved again to Rue du Sergent Blandan, Nancy. In 1887, la rue Saint-Marcel, one of the oldest streets of Lyon, was renamed Rue du Sergent Blandan in his honour. Medals were struck in the name of Blandan.Arm√©e d'Afrique : lot de 4 m√©dailles, la L√©gion, sergent Blandan, les troupes africaines et Bournazel par Bouchard, les 4, coinarchives.com, 2014.

After much difficulty the Uparkot was taken, they massacred the garrison and Dyas was slain. When Dyas died, his son Navagahana was a child and was secretly raised.

Her work also appeared regularly in a number of magazines including Good Housekeeping, the Radio Times and The Listener. Early life Moore was born in London and attended school at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields before, at the age of fourteen, obtaining a scholarship to St Martin's School of Art. In 1933 she was awarded another scholarship which allowed her to remain at St. Martin's until she was nineteen. Moore then studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts where she learnt the techniques of lithography. She left the Central School in 1939 and the same summer married Tony Bentin, who had also been an art student. World War Two Land-girls Lunching in the Harvest Fields (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 1469) At the start of the Second World War, Tony Bentin served with the Royal Artillery on an anti-aircraft battery in England whilst Moore obtained work as an artist with the Pilgrim Trust on the Recording Britain scheme. Moore had connections in the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea, and was allowed to work there, painting landscapes for the project. After her first stay of two weeks on Gower, the Trust authorised her to return there and work on more landscapes. Moore arrived back in Swansea in March 1941, shortly after the city had suffered three days of bombing raids, known as the Swansea Blitz. Seeing the devastation of the city centre, she decided to stay in Swansea and record the bomb damage and the ongoing recovery work. One morning, returning to complete a picture started the previous day near Swansea Castle, Moore found the pile of rubble she been working on had been cordoned off as overnight an unexploded bomb had been detected beneath it. A photograph of Moore sketching at her easel on the rubble heap the previous day was printed on the front of the South Wales Evening Post on 18 March 1941. The Pilgrim Trust next gave Moore the task of recording construction work at a site in Norfolk, where a new airfield was being built. Despite having the correct permit to sketch at the location, the RAF arrested her and she was held in custody for several hours until interviewed by a local police inspector and released. Moore also painted street-scenes in Great Yarmouth for Recording Britain and in all, had twenty views of Wales and eight from Norfolk accepted for the project. In August 1941, the War Artists' Advisory Committee commissioned Moore to record the Women's Land Army working on the harvest in Essex. Moore completed a number of paintings on the subject and was paid 15 guineas for three of them by WAAC. Kenneth Clark, the director of the National Gallery privately commissioned Moore to go, in secret, to Blaenau Ffestiniog to the disused slate mine where the paintings from the Gallery had been evacuated during the Blitz. Later in life, Moore would recall the \\"remarkable experience\\" of entering the slate mine and seeing \\"priceless Rembrandts, Van Dycks and Turners, etc stacked in racks\\". Moore spent three weeks at Blaenau Ffestiniog and Clark later gave the drawings she produced there as \\"thank-you\\" presents to the staff who had engineered the evacuation of the collection. Moore's paintings from East Anglia were included in the June 1942 exhibition of the Queen's pictures held at the National Gallery in London. Also, during the war, in 1944, Moore produced 16 colour lithographs and the cover illustration for the book Sea Poems by Myfanwy Piper which were well reviewed. Moore's painting The Agony in the Garden won the ¬£200 first prize in a competition for religious images. Later life After the War, Moore worked regularly as an illustrator for the Radio Times, the Daily Express, Good Housekeeping and The Listener. Her work for the Radio Times included illustrations for broadcasts of The Cherry Orchard by Chekhov and They by Rudyard Kipling. In 1948 she produced two posters for the London Transport Executive, entitled London's Open Air, The Trees. She designed the jacket covers of Alan Sillitoe's first two books, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning in 1958 and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner the following year. Moore and her husband both became followers of the Subud spiritual movement and also both changed their names, eventually being known as Phillip and Deborah Bentin. In the 1960s, an eye infection which did not respond to treatment led to Moore becoming blind and ended her artistic career. Moore wrote an unpublished autobiography and gave oral history interviews to both the academic Gill Clarke and the Imperial War Museum. Paintings by Moore are held by the Imperial War Museum, IWM, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. Works by Moore were included in War Fields, the 2004 loan exhibition organized by the IWM at the Wolsey Art Gallery in Ipswich.

Originally, mule ramps were used in steep terrain in the open countryside. They usually have steps.  Use indoors  From road and track construction the principles of design found their way into building architecture. An interior mule ramp consisted of a spiral, curved or straight ramp within a building that had a gentle incline and non- slip floor. Such ramps may be continuous but more often have transverse steps at large intervals. These are found in churches, castles and other buildings. Later, the very similar equestrian staircases were built as showpieces in palaces, for riders to climb to the upper floors on horseback. The term mule ramp first appears in specialist literature in the 19th century. The name is probably derived from attempts to explain the name, Mule Tower (Eselsturm), for the northeast tower of Regensburg Cathedral (11th century). This tower had a continuous spiral ramp. The argument that it was specifically designed for pack mules does not bear scrutiny because its dimensions are much too small for such a purpose. On the other hand, neither the term mule ramp nor similar designations are known for ascents of this kind that have been used with certainty by pack and draught animals.

In the summer of 2010, Tetiana represented Ukraine at EXPO 2010 in China. Tetiana was interested in embroidery since childhood. Her favorite colors and themes tell the ancient history of Ukraine; she uses black and red ‚Äì the colors of the central region of Ukraine ‚Äì with traditional simple designs, and regular geometrical shapes. Tetiana designs clothes. She took sewing classes at school and then later in life started designing and sewing men's neckties. Her son proudly wore one of her neckties to school and came home with a smile on his face as he told his mother, \\"You have an order for more neckties.\\" Now Tetiana decorates sweaters, jackets, blouses, and shirts with Ukrainian ornaments. Tetiana Protcheva invented the 3D embroidery style, which entered the Book of Records of Ukraine and created a new direction entitled \\"Glowing Art.\\" Working under the Glow Gallery international project, she has come up with a unique collection of embroidered portraits of prominent personalities, such as Steve Jobs, Andy Warhol, Leonardo da Vinci, and Jesus Christ that glow in darkness, as if coming back to life, and produce an unforgettable emotional and cultural effect. In order to spread information about embroidery as the grand unifying symbol of Ukrainian nation and present a positive image of the country, Tetiana Pretcheva decided to create an embroidered map of Ukraine. Every oblast of Ukraine is embroidered on the map by artists of that oblast. According to the design, the symbols of the map reflect their respective ethnic regions. The project involved craftspeople to study, renovate, revive, preserve and demonstrate ancient multi-century heritage of spiritual culture, and to implement it harmoniously into the modern culture.

The Initiative also works with the Native Hawaiian community. The Initiative collaborates with the White House Office of Public Liaison and designated federal departments and agencies to increase AAPI participation in programs in economic development, commerce, business, education, health and human services, housing, environment, arts, agriculture, labor and employment, transportation, justice, veterans affairs, and community development. The Initiative seeks to highlight the tremendous unmet needs in AAPI communities and the dynamic community assets that can be leveraged to meet many of those needs. The Initiative focuses on cross-cutting priority areas that span all issue areas and agencies, including advancing disaggregated AAPI data collection and dissemination, workforce diversity, ensuring access (especially linguistic access and cultural competence) for limited English proficient individuals, and building capacity for the AAPI community. The Initiative also works to encourage AAPI involvement in public service and civic engagement opportunities.  Background and context  The AAPI community is the fastest-growing racial group in the country. The AAPI community grew 46 percent from 2000 to 2010 and will more than double to over 47 million by 2060. There are approximately 22 million AAPIs and Native Hawaiians residing in the United States (approximately 6% of the U.S. population), representing over 40 countries and ethnic groups that speak over 100 different languages and dialects. In 2018, AAPIs wield $1 trillion in purchasing power, fueled by an economic boom for the fast-growing segment of the US population. President Donald J. Trump wants to build on that economic empowerment. The soaring American economy of 2019 is benefitting a number of historically marginalized groups, such as African-Americans and Hispanics. The Asian-American community is no exception: Unemployment for this segment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded‚Äîan astonishing 2.1 percent in April 2019. President Donald Trump signs Executive Order 13872 to help broaden access to economic resources for the AAPI community on May 13, 2019. On May 13, 2019, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish the Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), along with a White House initiative to help broaden access to more employers and other economic resources for the AAPI community. ‚ÄúThe contributions of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent are firmly woven into the diverse fabric of our Nation,‚Äù President Trump said in a recent proclamation. ‚ÄúThese Americans bolster our economy as entrepreneurs, business owners, and employees who initiate and expand opportunities for their families, communities, and country.‚Äù Earlier in the Administration, President Trump re-established the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to continue until September 30, 2019.  Organization  When President Trump signed Executive Order 13872 on May 13, 2019, the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were established. Each entity will work to broaden access by AAPI employers and communities to economic resources and opportunities, thus empowering AAPIs to improve the quality of their lives, raise the standard of living of their families and communities, and more fully participate in our economy. Additionally, each will work to advance relevant evidence-based research, data collection, and analysis for AAPI populations, subpopulations, and businesses. = President‚Äôs Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders = President Trump established the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the Department of Commerce. The Commission shall consist of members appointed by the President who are United States citizens or nationals, or who are citizens of the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or the Federated States of Micronesia who are subject to an applicable compact of free association with the United States, and shall include individuals having a history of engagement and involvement with AAPI communities and enterprises. The President announced his intent to appoint key AAPI leaders across the country and US territories to be members of the Commission. The President shall designate one member of the Commission to serve as Chair. The Chair will convene regular meetings, determine the commission's goals, and coordinate the efforts of other members. Initiative staff work closely with commissioners throughout the year and meetings are held semi-annually to discuss the status of the Initiative's projects and policy goals. = White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders = President Trump established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Co-Chaired by the Secretaries of Commerce and Transportation. The Initiative shall work to broaden AAPI access to economic resources and opportunities and thus empower AAPIs to improve the quality of their lives, raise the standard of living of their families and communities, and more fully participate in our economy. The Initiative shall advise the Co- Chairs on the implementation and coordination of Federal programs as they relate to AAPI access to economic resources and opportunities.  Interagency Working Group  The inaugural IWG meeting under the Trump Administration was held on June 14, 2018 at the White House Eisenhower Executive Office Building The Interagency Working Group (IWG) is composed of senior officials appointed by each Cabinet member and Cabinet-level Secretary and White House Offices. The appointed senior officials serve as the agency or office's designee to oversee the work of the Initiative. Each appointed designee is tasked with preparing and implementing agency plans that, among other objectives, identify federal programs in which AAPIs may be underserved; foster research and data collection on AAPI populations and subpopulations; increase public and private sector community involvement in improving the health, environment, and opportunities for AAPIs; and identify ways to recruit and advance AAPIs in federal service. = Regional Network = regional network group The Regional Network (RN) institutionalizes the work of the IWG on a more local level across 10 federal regions. The RN facilitates the exchange of information across regional offices, coordinates community engagement efforts with other federal agencies, and collaborates with Initiative staff and IWG members in D.C. to potentially incorporate specific community recommendations into agency plans. Through regional roundtables, technical assistance programs, regular planning calls, resource-sharing, in- person convenings, and webinars, the RN works on the ground to respond to community needs. The RN is led by three co-chairs and is composed of more than 150 regional administrators, district directors, outreach specialists, and other staff representing more than 35 agencies. = Executive director = On November 13, 2017, Holly Ham was appointed as Executive Director of the Commission and the Initiative. Prior to this appointment, Ham served as Assistant Secretary for Management at the U.S. Department of Education, also in the Trump Administration.  History  President Bill Clinton signs Executive Order 13125 creating the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on June 7, 1999. = Clinton Administration = On June 7, 1999, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13125 to establish the first White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders \\"in order to improve the quality of life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders through increased participation in federal programs where they may be underserved (e.g., health, human services, education, housing, labor, transportation, and economic and community development).\\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1999-06-10/pdf/99-14901.pdf The Executive Order called on all federal departments to mobilize their resources to address the unmet needs of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Prior to the signing of Executive Order 13125, the last United States Presidential Executive Order related to AAPIs was Executive Order 9066, which led to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Under the Clinton Administration, the Executive Order housed the Initiative under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the Health Resources and Services Administration.  Executive director and commission  The first Initiative Executive Director Shamina Singh was appointed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala. Prior to her work at the Initiative, Singh served as special assistant to the Secretary at the U.S. Department of Labor and worked on specialized health care issues for the Service Employees International Union. Executive Director Shamina Singh meets with the inaugural members of the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The first President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders was chaired by former Congressman Norman Mineta. The 15-member President's Advisory Commission was seated through June 7, 2001.  Priorities  The Interagency Working Group under the Clinton Administration was chaired by then Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Kevin Thurm. The IWG was composed of leaders from 32 federal agencies and departments. As part of the Executive Order, each federal agency and department was required to draft an integrated agency plan including measurable objectives and implementation goals to better serve the AAPI community. The first commission report highlighted four key themes: * AAPIs have been ‚ÄúMIH‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúMissing In History‚Äù ‚Äì as taught in classrooms, as reflected in the media and the arts and as understood by government policymakers and program planners. In much of the data used by the federal government, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are invisible, relegated to a residual category of ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù * Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPIs) often remain a footnote or asterisk as part of the broad ‚ÄúAsian American and Pacific Islander‚Äù category, ignoring their importance and dignity as diverse, indigenous peoples. Barely ever noted is the manner in which the United States acquired Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa. *Asian Americans are stereotyped as a ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù: passive, compliant, overachieving and without problems or needs. *Asian Americans continue to be viewed as perpetual foreigners, forever ‚Äúaliens‚Äù whose loyalty and place in America is always questioned. The report left several recommendations, including that federal agencies improve data collection measures, ensure linguistic access in AAPI languages, protect civil rights and equal opportunity for AAPIs, strengthen community capacity, and recognize NHPIs in federal programs and services. = Bush Administration = President George W. Bush signs Executive Order 13339 to increase economic opportunities for and improve the quality of life AAPIs on June 6, 2001. On June 6, 2001, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13216, renewing the Initiative and changing the Order's title from: \\"Increasing Participation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Federal Programs\\" to \\"Increasing Opportunity and Improving Quality of Life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\\" At this time, Deputy Secretary Claude A. Allen of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was named Chair of the Interagency Working Group. On May 17, 2004, President Bush signed Executive Order 13339, superseding Executive Order 13125 and moving the Initiative from the Department of Health and Human Services to the U.S. Department of Commerce. President Bush signed Executive Order 13403 on May 12, 2006, once again reauthorizing the Initiative.  Executive director and commission  In 2001, John Quoc Duong was named Executive Director of the Initiative. Prior to assuming his appointment, Duong served as Vice President of Bridgecreek Group, Inc. and was Deputy Director of the Office of Community Relations for California Governor Pete Wilson. Under Duong's leadership, there were 4 staff members and 15 members on the Commission. In 2004, Eddy Badrina was appointed as Executive Director of the Initiative. Prior to joining the Initiative, Badrina was an appointee to the White House Liaison Office at the U.S. Department of State, working on the Bush Administration's transition efforts. In 2006, Jimmy D. Lee began his term as Executive Director for the Initiative. Before joining the Initiative as Executive Director, Lee was a Commissioner on the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and served as Executive Director of the Chicago Chinatown Chamber of Commerce and a Board Member for the Asian American Alliance. The Executive Order included new criteria for selecting Commissioners to serve on the President's Advisory Commission for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, including requirements that candidates \\"have a history of involvement with the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities; are from the business enterprise sector; are from civic associations representing one or more of the diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities; are from the fields of economic, social, and community development; or have such other experience as the President deems appropriate.\\"  Priorities  Under the Bush Administration economic development became the priority of the Initiative. Executive Order 13339 stated its purpose as \\"providing equal economic opportunities for full participation of Asian American and Pacific Islander businesses in our free market economy where they may be underserved and thus improving the quality of life for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\\" The President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islander and the Federal Interagency Working Group worked primarily on the following goals during this time: * Developed, monitored and coordinated federal efforts to improve Asian American and Pacific Islander participation in government programs; * Fostered research and data collection for Asian American and Pacific Islander businesses and communities; and * Increased their level of participation in the national economy and their economic and community development. = Obama Administration = On October 14, 2009, President Obama signed Executive Order 13515, reestablishing the Initiative and superseding Executive Orders 13125 and 13339. The Executive Order moved the Initiative from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Education. President Obama appointed then Secretary of Education Arne Duncan along with then Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke as heads of the Interagency Working Group. Amendments to the Executive Order include Executive Order 13585, Executive Order 13652, and Executive Order 13652 which all ensure the continuance of the Federal Advisory Committees.  Executive director and commission  Kiran Ahuja delivers opening remarks at the Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Opening Ceremony on May 6, 2014. Kiran Ahuja was appointed on December 14, 2009 to the position of Executive Director of the Initiative. Prior to her work at the Initiative, Ahuja served as founding Executive Director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF) and worked at the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. In 2015, Doua Thor became the Executive Director of the Initiative, following the departure of Ahuja. Prior to taking on the position, Thor had worked with the Initiative as a senior advisor and member of the President's Advisory Commission. A refugee herself, Thor is the former Executive Director of the Southeast Asian Resource Action Center (SEARAC). The commission now includes 20 members and is chaired by Dr. Tung Thanh Nguyen with Dr. Mary Ann Young Okada as Vice Chair. Other Commissioners include: Dr. Nina Ahmad; Michael Byun; Lt. Col. Ravi Chaudhary; Lian Cheun; Billy Dec; Jacob James Fitisemanu, Jr.; Bill Imada, Kathy Ko Chin, Daphne Kwok, Dee Jay Mailer, Diane Narasaki, Shekar Narasimhan, Maulik Pancholy, Linda X. Phan, Sanjita Pradhan, Lorna May Ho Randlett, Bo Thao-Urabe, and Dr. Paul Y. Watanabe. Past Administration co-chairs of the Initiative are Chris Lu, who served with Secretary Arne Duncan during his tenure as Cabinet Secretary and Assistant to President Obama, and Gary Locke during his term as Secretary of Commerce.  Priorities  Under the Obama Administration, the Initiative has worked to expand the outreach capacity of the Commission and IWG. The IWG created and implemented agency plans to increase the AAPI community's access to federal programs and services, housing four subcommittees that coincide with the initiative's four cross-cutting goal areas of research and data disaggregation, language access, workforce diversity, and capacity building. These subcommittees respond to the community, share best practices, and recommend strategic goals that can be incorporated into agency plans The Initiative also formed a regional IWG, called the Regional Network, of more than 250 regional administrators, district directors, and regional staff to help facilitate information sharing and coordinate community engagement with the AAPI community across the federal regional agencies. The Regional Network meets quarterly to share information and discuss ways in which regional offices can work together, convenes regional roundtables with local AAPI communities, builds partnerships between the federal regional offices, the commission, and the local and state commissions, and submits an annual progress report on its engagement efforts. The Initiative has also worked more extensively on data disaggregation, hosting a national symposium in partnership with National Commission on Asian American and Pacific Islander Research in Education to relay best practices for data collection, analysis, and dissemination. In addition, the Initiative has advised federal agencies on disaster response efforts after the Gulf Coast Oil Spill, released an AAPI women's record, developed educational tools and resources on the Affordable Care Act, and helped launch the Senior Executive Service (SES) Development Program. The initiative has also seen the creation of a Nail Salon Interagency Working Group, created a federal resources page with grants and training information, and worked with the Federal Asian Pacific American Council (FAPAC) on challenge issues for the community. Other key accomplishments and priorities of the Initiative under the Obama Administration include: * Organizing the first-ever White House Summit on AAPIs. Nearly 2,000 community members and federal officials from over 40 states and the Pacific Islands came together to share their experiences and gain tools to mobilize their communities to further expand opportunities for AAPIs through federal resources and programs. Six Cabinet Secretaries and multiple federal agency leaders joined the Summit and highlighted their work benefiting the AAPI community. * Advancing data collection, analysis, and dissemination on AAPI communities. The Initiative launched Data.gov/AAPI, the most comprehensive hub of government data on AAPIs. The Initiative also convened data experts during two iCount Symposiums and released a best practices report to promote innovative approaches and methodologies to further disaggregate race and ethnicity data within federal agencies. * Supporting Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. The Initiative led the Administration's first-ever regional summit in Guam to discuss specific needs of the community for grant programs, capacity building, and technical assistance. The Commission held its first-ever listening session in Hawaii to discuss Native Hawaiian needs and opportunities. In addition, the Initiative supported the Department of Interior in its engagements to create an administrative procedure for re-establishing a government-to-government relationship. * Promoting Public-Private Partnerships. During the first-ever National Philanthropic Briefing on AAPIs in 2012, the Ford Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and Kresge Foundation made a commitment of $1 million, the first-of-its-kind coordinated public and philanthropic investment in the AAPI community. * Engaging a new generation of young leaders in understanding the federal resources dedicated to college affordability, bullying prevention, mental health, pathways to public service, naturalization, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy through the E3! Ambassadors Program and annual White House AAPI Youth Forums. * Expanding healthcare access for AAPI communities. Nearly 2 million previously uninsured AAPIs became eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and the Initiative worked to get AAPIs covered under the ACA through collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services, community health centers, and ethnic media. * Welcoming and creating opportunity for immigrants and new Americans through the Stand Stronger Citizenship Awareness Campaign, in- language outreach around the DACA program, and roundtables with the Task Force on New Americans. * Forging educational equity for AAPI students through support of Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs). * Supporting AAPI-owned businesses. Through coordination with the Minority Business Development Agency and AAPI chambers of commerce, the Initiative works to ensure AAPI businesses are equipped with the knowledge to compete for grants and government contracts. * Protecting vulnerable AAPI workers. The Initiative participates in two interagency working groups addressing the needs of vulnerable workers in high-risk and low-wage industries and the myriad of health and safety issues affecting AAPI nail salon workers, who account for 40 percent of the national nail salon workforce. * Protecting the civil rights of AAPI communities. The Initiative launched the interagency AAPI Bullying Prevention Task Force to analyze data and formulate effective policies to better understand and address bullying. The Task Force hosted more than 25 listening sessions, and the Initiative launched the Act To Change national public awareness campaign with translated resources and a coalition of 50+ supporting organizations and influencers, including George Takei and Jeremy Lin, encouraging youth to take the pledge against bullying.  Publications  Twenty FY 2016-2017 federal Agency Plans incorporating a strategic outline for addressing AAPI needs are publicly available on the Initiative website. The Initiative also highlights the yearly progress federal departments and agencies have made in attaining agency plan benchmarks and goals. It has also released a report of its own accomplishments over the past four years. In September 2011, the Initiative produced a Guide to Federal Agency Resources. In May 2014, the Initiative published the Report from the President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders titled \\"Building the American Mosaic.\\" The report communicates the current role of commissioners and also offers recommendations to federal departments and agencies in building a stronger federal infrastructure for AAPIs.

Early years Mary Molesworth, Lady Belvedere, George's mother George Augustus Rochfort was born on 12 October 1738, son of Robert Rochfort, 1st Earl of Belvedere and Hon. Mary Molesworth. The Rochfort family, originally called De Rupe Forti, had settled in Ireland in 1243. Sir Maurice de Rochfort was Lord Justice of Ireland in 1302. Gerald Rochfort was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1339. George's great-grandfather was the prominent lawyer Robert Rochfort, Attorney General of Ireland and Speaker of the House of Commons in 1695, and Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1707. The family estate of Gaulstown lay on the shore of Lough Ennell in County Westmeath. George's father, Robert Rochfort, was a favourite courtier of King George II of Great Britain. He was made an Irish peer as Baron of Bellfield in 1737, and then Earl of Belvedere in 1756. He was estranged from his mother for his childhood, after his father locked her away after an alleged affair with George's uncle, Arthur. Politician From 1756 to 1774 George Rochfort was styled Viscount Belfield. He was Member of Parliament for Philipstown from 1758‚Äì61, and Member of Parliament for Westmeath from 1761‚Äì1774. The 1761 parliamentary election in County Westmeath followed the death of King George II of Great Britain. George Rochfort, the Right Honorable Lord Belfield, won the election. He was supported by The Honorable Captain Richard Rochfort, Esq. and opposed by Mr. George Rochfort and Gustavus Lambert. The election thus seems to have been very much a family affair. Mr. George Rochfort supported the \\"Patriots\\", who demanded that parliaments last only seven years before being dissolved, rather than for the lifetime of the king, as was the custom. In 1762 George Rochfort was Sheriff of County Westmeath, and from 1772 to 1814 Governor of County Westmeath. An anonymous writer named \\"Dymoke\\" published a Review of the House of Commons in the Freeman's Journal in 1774. The purpose was to \\"rouse the electors of Ireland to a due exertion of their lawful powers, and stimulate them to fix on proper men to maintain their rights and privileges in parliament.\\" He noted that Belfield, who was muster-master-general of Ireland and a Governor of the County of Westmeath, had voted for the stamp act. Dykmore declared that \\"The present members [Lord Belfield; Anthony Malone] for the County of WESTMEATH will never represent it again, if the Electors have either sense, honour, or remembrance\\". Irish peer George's older sister, Jane, Lady Lanesborough On 13 November 1774 Rochfort succeeded to the titles of Baron Belfield, Viscount Belfield and Earl of Belvedere after his father's death. He released his mother. She was prematurely aged, spoke in little more than a whisper but in a harsh, agitated and uneven manner, and was dressed in the style of thirty years earlier. From 1775‚Äì76 Rochfort was Grand Master of the Freemasons Grand Lodge of Ireland. On 20 August 1775 he married Dorothea Bloomfield, daughter of John Bloomfield and Jane Jocelyn. George Rochfort took his mother with him when he and his new wife visited the continent, but she found the travel too difficult. They left her to recuperate in a convent in France while they visited Italy for a few months, spending the winter in Florence. The next year the couple returned to London, where George's mother stayed with a friend in Kensington Palace for a year. She then returned to Ireland and lived first with George in Dublin and then with his sister, now Countess of Lanesborough, and her young family. She died a few years after her husband. Rochfort had Belvedere House built on Great Denmark Street, Dublin, at the great sum of ¬£24,000. The site had been owned by Nicholas Archdall. The building had been started by the first Earl, with Robert West as architect. Rochfort and his wife apparently did not plan to complete the work, and in 1777 offered it for sale. Later they decided to complete the house for their own use, and gave the job to Michael Stapleton. It was finally completed and occupied in 1786, and probably stood alone at first, since in 1787 Rochfort was recorded as living in North Great George's Street. George's mother is thought to have died there. During the struggle over the Acts of Union 1800, Rochfort's position on the union of the crowns of Britain and Ireland was uncertain. A letter of 25 January 1800 from Lord Altamont to the Earl of Lucan said \\"Ld Belvedere has touched Government cash & possibly may not exert all his influence to give value in return for it.\\" Rochfort's first wife died on 6 April 1803, and on 10 November 1803 he married Jane Mackay, daughter of Reverend James Mackay. They had one son, who died in infancy. George Augustus Rochfort died in Great Denmark Street, Dublin on 13 May 1814 at the age of 75. He is buried in St Sinian, Clonfad Parish Church, of the Church of Ireland. His tomb is adorned with a full-scale neoclassical sculptural group by John Bacon the younger. It represents the earl on his death bed, with his young wife weeping at the end. He is supported by Faith and an angelic figure is beckoning him to heaven. Rochfort had no surviving children, and his three peerages became extinct. On his death his sister Jane inherited the whole settled part of his great estate, since his brothers had died without children. He left his entire unsettled estate to his wife. This consisted of at least 2,500 Irish acres, bringing in a large income. The fortune was passed down to his wife's children by her second marriage to Abraham Boyd. The eldest son and heir was George Augustus Boyd-Rochfort, he assumed the arms and surname of Rochfort.

Feeling from Mountain and Water, produced in 1988, is said to be the last masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation film. Major works =Tadpoles Searching for Mother (1961)= The film is based on a children's story written by Fang Huizhen and Sheng Lude. A group of newly born tadpoles decide to seek their mother who they've never met before. On the way, they mistake golden fish, a crab, a tortoise and a fish for their mother, and they gather new clues about their mother's appearance through each encounter. This 14-minute film has been internationally recognized in many film festivals, including the Locarno International Film Festival in 1961, the 4th Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 1962, and the 3rd Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films in 1978.\\"Ê∞¥Â¢®Âä®Áîª‚Äî‚Äî‰∏≠ÂõΩÂøÉÁÅµ.\\" Retrieved June 12, 2014.

The boy falls asleep in a tree, and he dreams that he has lost his buffalo. It turns out that the buffalo is drawn to the beautiful scenery of a waterfall and refuses to return to the herding boy. The boy then plays the flute, and the melody helps bring the buffalo back to him. There is no dialogue in the film. Story is told through animation and the accompanying music, therefore the film is entirely accessible to a non-Chinese speaking audience. The flute melody was played by China's most famous bamboo flute soloist Lu Chunling. The film was awarded the Golden Prize at the Odense International Fairy Tale Film Festival in Denmark. Some deemed ink-wash animation the \\"fifth Chinese invention\\". =Feeling from Mountain and Water (1988)= Named after a phrase for landscape painting, Feeling from Mountain and Water became the last water- ink animation. The film tells the simple tale of an impoverished elderly zither musician and a young boy. The zither musician falls ill on his way back home. The boy kindly takes him to his house and takes care of the musician. To thank the boy, the musician begins to teach the boy the zither and becomes his mentor and friend. The film eschews dialogue, yet the animation and music make the film rich in emotion and philosophical ideas. The 18-minute film is regarded by many as the masterpiece of Chinese ink-wash animation.

He has also won awards for graphic design. Biography Ben Kelly grew up in the village of Appletreewick in North Yorkshire. Kelly trained at Lancaster College of Art, from 1964 to 1969 and graduated in Interior Design from the Royal College of Art in 1974. Kelly was awarded the title Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) in 2007. Kelly is an Honorary Doctor, and Professor of Interior Design at London's Kingston University. In 2018 Kelly was awarded an Honorary Fellowship from the Royal College of Art. He is cited by The Visual Dictionary of Interior Architecture and Design as a \\"hugely influential interior designer\\", and by Kingston University as \\"one of the UK's most influential interior designers\\". Historic England has listed the Kelly designed Ha√ßienda nightclub as one of the 100 Places that tell the remarkable story of England and its impact on the world. Studio In the 1974, manager Malcolm McLaren asked Kelly to refurbish a basement rehearsal room for The Sex Pistols in Denmark Street, London, which McLaren had bought from Badfinger. Kelly had designed the store-front for Vivien Westwood and Malcolm McLaren‚Äôs Seditionaries shop. In 1977 Kelly was also arrested with Westwood and McLaren when police raided The Sex Pistols' legendary Silver Jubilee cruise, organised by Richard Branson to launch the single \\"God Save the Queen\\". Kelly was also known at the time by his alter-ego \\"The Photo Kid\\", and he still uses the name on social-media. Kelly collaborated with Peter Saville on numerous projects who acknowledged basing much of his early work on Kelly's.Shadowplayers, pp. 92-93. \\"I thought I could just take things from Ben,\\" admits Saville, \\"like he was a reference book or something. He used to get really mad about it.\\" Kelly and Saville won a Designers and Art Directors Award for the sleeve of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1980 self-titled first album.Shadowplayers, p. 99. Ben Kelly is best known for his interior design of The Ha√ßienda in Manchester, which he converted from a yacht showroom in 1982, retaining its red brick facade, inner columns and large iron doors. Kelly was recommended to design The Ha√ßienda by Saville. Kelly also did much other work for Factory Records, including their 1990 company office in Charles Street, Manchester.Shadowplayers, pp. 368, 388, 401-402. In 1995 Kelly designed Peter Saville‚Äôs legendary Mayfair apartment in London that was also shared by Meir√© und Meir√©. The mood and mythologies of that space inspired and informed a shoot with Nick Knight for the July 2009 'Sex' issue of Wallpaper Magazine. Kelly has designed several gyms for Gymbox in London, and is also a furniture designer. Kelly has recently completed a number of collaborations with Virgil Abloh; Josephine Nightclub in Paris, and a DJ touring set that Abloh travels with and debuted at Art Basel Miami. =Influences= On arriving in London in 1971, Kelly was greatly influenced by Kenneth Anger's films and visiting the ‚ÄòWhen Attitudes Become Form‚Äô exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Kelly cites Andy Warhol and Marcel Duchamp as his two main influences. Kelly has acknowledged the bright colours, bold lines and disposable aesthetics of Max Clendinning designs, as well as Ralph Adron‚Äôs visualisations of Clendinning‚Äôs work. =Style= Kelly‚Äôs style can be summarised by his description of his dream interior being ‚ÄúA mash up between Andy Warhol's original Silver Studio, Kurt Schwitters‚Äô Merzbau, Adolf Loos‚Äô K√§rntner Bar in Vienna and Frank Gehry‚Äôs house in LA!‚Äù The design of The Hacienda has been described as post-industrial. Peter Saville observed at the time that Punk had levelled the ground and there was a strong feeling that it was a post-revolutionary moment. The colour International orange which he used in The Hacienda and many subsequent projects, is considered a Kelly signature. =Legacy= Kelly and Saville's work has been referenced numerous times by Raf Simons. As a tribute to both the anniversary of The Ha√ßienda and the grand opening of the UK‚Äôs first Yohji Yamamoto Y-3 exclusive store, a special Adidas FAC51-Y3 model was created in 2007. Manchester City and Puma's 2019/20 football jersey featured Kelly's signature black and yellow stripes. Virgil Abloh states, \\"the diagonal lines of my brand‚Äôs logo are very similar to the work of Ben Kelly. My whole thing is very much about urban credibility, I work with people I can share with my generation as it‚Äôs an access point for a young kid because the art world is so far off in the distance and protected from them.\\" The 2002 film 24 Hour Party People tells the stories that centred around The Ha√ßienda, with a reproduction of the club built for the movie. Vitra Design Museum and ADAM - Brussels Design Museum coproduced the 'Night Fever: Designing Club Culture' exhibition to explore how architecture and interior design merged with sound, light, fashion, graphics and visual effects to create epicentres of pop culture.

The coral reefs not only provide a sanctuary to a myriad of marine life but also play a key role in protecting the coastline from erosion. India has about 7517 km of coastline including islands but mainland coast is 6100 km. The Coral reefs in India are mainly restricted to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Gulf of Mannar, Gulf of Kutch, Palk Strait and the Lakshadweep islands. All of these reefs are Fringing reefs, except Lakshadweep which are Atolls. There are Patchy corals present along the inter- tidal areas of the central west coast like the intertidal regions of Ratnagiri, Gaveshani Bank etc. The Hermatypic corals are also present along the sea shore from Kollam in Kerala to Enayam Puthenthurai in Tamilnadu.  Research and Institutions The Major Institutions in India involved in the management, monitoring and research on Coral reefs are the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Zoological Survey of India, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Madurai Kamaraj University, Annamalai University, National Centre for Earth Science Studies, National Institute of Ocean Technology, National Institute of Oceanography, India etc. The Space Applications Centre in Ahmedabad is involved in the data collection of areas under Coral reefs using remote sensing. Laws and regulations The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change manages and guidelines for the protection of the Coral reefs in India. If the Coral reef region is under a protected area then it comes under the jurisdiction of the State Wild life department. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification of 1991 gives protection to all marine resources. All types of coral reefs are protected under the CRZ1 category. Its Section 7 (2) prohibits the construction of beach resorts or hotels on coral reefs. In Certain States, the quarrying and collecting of massive corals are banned except for scientific purposes.  List of Coral reefs  * Andaman and Nicobar Islands :Situated in the Bay of Bengal, exclusively fringing reefs of about 572 islands, most of these islands have a healthy biodiversity. * Gulf of Kutch :Exclusively consists of fringing reefs. The reefs are relatively less developed due to large range of temperature and high salinity. The harbours have less biodiversity. The entire Gulf of Kutch is also known as a marine national park. * Gulf of Mannar :Fringing reefs with a chain of 21 islands from Rameswaram in the north to Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) in the south. This part of the gulf forms part of the Gulf of Mannar biosphere reserve. * Lakshadweep :Exclusively coral atolls with 36 islands, of which 10 are inhabited. The islands range from less than to about in length, and do not exceed in width. * Others :Tarkarli in Malwan, Maharashtra is a smaller reef. There are some coral reefs around small inlets in the western part of the Gulf of Khambat. Angria Bank is a coral reef off Vijaydurg in Maharashtra. There is a coral reef in Netrani Island in Karnataka. Shell reef in Gulf of Kutch is a shell shaped reef made from bio rock and decorated with coral in the deep waters of Gulf of Kutch, off the coast of Gujarat. It helps Coral Polyps to get healed 20% faster than usual.There is a coral reef near the sea between Chandrabhaga coast and Ramachandi in the Konark area of Odisha.

The facility is used for cricket, rugby union, bowling (Crown Green and Flat Green) and junior football. The complex is one of two main sporting facilities in Wetherby, the other being the Ings. History Grange Park opened in its current form in 1988. It replaced a former cricket ground on the same location, which was closed after the second Wetherby by-pass (now the A1(M)) cut through its pitch. Prior to that the site was occupied by Wetherby Grange, a large stately home demolished in 1962. The rugby club relocated to the new ground from Loshpot Lane in Kirk Deighton. A new clubhouse opened shortly afterwards, which was later extended with the addition of a large home-side Rugby dressing room. Demolition of the first clubhouse began in 2012 with its larger replacement opened in 2013.http://www.grangeparksportsclub.co.uk/development-project Clubhouse The new clubhouse, seen the year it opened. The original clubhouse was similar in appearance to the current one and took a single-storey form. It originally opened with two bars (a club room and a best room with a bar counter that ran between the two), a kitchen, four dressing rooms (two cricket, two rugby) and players' showers. It was later extended to provide a third rugby dressing room, somewhat larger than the others. A veranda was added later. Despite several plans to modernise and extend it, it was demolished in 2012. The current clubhouse also takes a single storey form and is similar in layout and appearance to its predecessor. The bar area is larger than that of the former clubhouse (although compromises only one room, compared to the formers two), as are the dressing rooms. Unlike the former facilities, it offers separate dressing facilities for match officials. To the rear it has a recessed veranda, rather than the protruding one that was a later addition to the former clubhouse. The bowling club has a separate wooden pavilion adjacent to its greens, towards the opposite side of the car park from the main clubhouse. Sports facilities =Cricket= The cricket field with the clubhouse in the background. The sites single cricket pitch is situated to the rear of the main clubhouse, with the clubhouse acting as a pavilion. There are no stands around the pitch. Practice nets are situated close to the pitch. =Rugby= Grandstand by the first team rugby pitch There are currently four rugby pitches, situated to the south of the site. The alignment of the pitches was changed in the mid-1990s to a north‚Äìsouth alignment to minimise crosswind. There are no stands, although plans have been previously proposed. Two of the pitches are floodlit, although not to a standard which permits full playing. A small grandstand was added in the late 2010s. =Bowling= The bowling greens. In between the main clubhouse and the car park are the site's two bowling greens. Unlike the Cricket and Rugby who share a clubhouse, the bowling club has its own pavilion, thus the club has not participated in the funding of recent improvements. The two greens (one flat, one crown) are floodlit to a level which allows full night playing. The greens are the oldest continuous part of the site, having been laid in 1987; a year after the club formed.http://www.wetherbybowlingclub.co.uk/about-us Other facilities The site has a car park for around 100 vehicles, a childrens' playground and a catering unit close to the rugby pitches which are some distance from the clubhouse.

The lineup consists of Bill Anderson (guitar), Joe Doerr (vocals, harmonica), Adam Kahan (bass), Billysteve Korpi (guitar), and Eric Bohlke (drums).  Musical and Lyrical Style & Influence  Churchwood's musical influences are wide-ranging. The band's self-proclaimed \\"dystopic blues\\" style belies its reverence for the likes of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, and other blues masters; however, many critics suggest that musical risk-takers like Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, Tom Waits, and Nick Cave are of equal importance to Churchwood's sound. Much like his published poetry, Doerr's lyrics reflect an interest in French Symbolism, Literary Modernism, Surrealism, and Beat Poetry. His themes are largely existentialist in scope: absurdity, anxiety, alienation, passion, individuality, and authenticity are his primary concerns.  Band History  Churchwood formed in 2007 in Austin, Texas and signed with Saustex Records in 2010.

Fish  The lake was stocked in 1967 with muskellunge, largemouth bass, bluegill, and channel catfish. At present there are also black crappie, brown bullheads, pumpkinseeds and other varieties of sunfish. In about 2000 American gizzard shad appeared in the lake. Because of feeding patterns this resulted in bass getting bigger and bluegills getting smaller. White amurs (grass carp) have been introduced to control weeds and they have remove weed beds which were good places to fish for bass.

The United States Secretary of the Interior would be responsible for carrying this out. The bill passed both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. President Barack Obama signed into law on July 16, 2014, making it . Background The United States Department of the Interior provided the following background information about the situation when it testified about the bill before the Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs of the House Natural Resources Committee: \\"On December 16, 1916, the Secretary of the Interior purchased the 160-acre Shingle Springs Rancheria east of Sacramento in El Dorado County, California at the request of the Sacramento-Verona Band of Miwok Indians. Today's members of the Shingle Springs Rancheria are descendants of the Miwok and Maidu Indians who once lived in this region. Currently, there are approximately 500 enrolled members of the Tribe, with about 140 living on the Rancheria.The tribe has expressed an interest in expanding the Rancheria by adding adjacent BLM-managed lands for improved access and additional residential housing for the tribe.\\" Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 2388 would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians. The bill would describe that land as the approximately 40.852 acres of federal land under the administrative jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) identified as \\"Conveyance boundary\\" on the map titled \\"Shingle Springs Land Conveyance/Draft\\" and dated June 7, 2012, including improvements and appurtenances thereto. The bill would prohibit class II and III gaming on such lands. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on May 21, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2388 would take about 40 acres of federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians. Based on information provided by the United States Department of the Interior, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 2388 would have no significant effect on the federal budget because the cost of administering the lands would not change significantly. Enacting H.R. 2388 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2388 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. On August 29, 2013, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 2388 as ordered reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources on July 31, 2013. The two versions of the legislation are similar, and the CBO cost estimates are the same. Procedural history H.R. 2388 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 14, 2013 by Rep. Tom McClintock (R, CA-4). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources, the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation, and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs. The bill was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-195. The House voted on December 3, 2013 to pass the bill in a voice vote. The bill was received in the United States Senate on December 9, 2013 and referred to the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. The Senate had a hearing about the bill on May 21, 2014. The Senate voted on June 26, 2014 to pass the bill by unanimous consent. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on July 16, 2014.

It can be found in a variety of habitats, such as forests, shrublands, thickets, woodlands, and mountains. The orchid is considered globally secure, but it is considered rare or endangered in many northeastern states. Description One of the orchid's common names, lily-leaved twayblade, comes from the plant having two connected basal leaves. The leaves are light green, smooth, oval shaped, and have a partial mid-rib. Its delicate flowers are mauve or purple, arranged on a tall stem in a loose cluster, and total up to 31 flowers. The petals and sepals are long, thin, and often droop. Its flowers can be green, but it is a rare occurrence. Each flower has a labellum that is wide, flat, and nearly translucent. The labellum is pale purple and has darker veins. The fruit is smaller than the pedicels. Its seeds can only germinate and grow with a specific mycorrhizal fungus that can be found across its range. It has been debated over decades whether liliifolia should have a single or two consecutive i's, although the correct spelling has now been shown to be liliifolia by botanist Bernard Boivin. Habitat It is native to eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and the eastern United States. In the eastern United States, it is found in the Appalachians, Ozarks, the Great Lakes region, and the Ohio and Upper Mississippi Valleys, but not the southern coastal plains. The orchid's habitat is in forests, shrublands, thickets, woodlands, and mountains. The highest altitude that the plant can be found in mountains is . While the plant is considered globally secure, it is rare or endangered in many northeastern states due to declining populations. It can be commonly found throughout much of its range.Gleason, H.

Ecology The plant is pollinated by flies, potentially including the species Pegoplata juvenilis. It has been speculated that unspecialized insects have pollinated the orchid. The North American Orchid Center has stated that it is possible for insects with either long legs or mouthparts to pollinate its flowers.

Study for the head of Oedipus Oedipus and the Sphinx, Ingres, 1808. Oil on Canvas. Louvre, Paris. Oedipus and the Sphinx is an 1864 oil on canvas painting by Gustave Moreau that was first exhibited at the French Salon of 1864 where it was an immediate success. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The work was a fresh treatment of the established subject of the meeting between Oedipus and the Sphinx on the road to Delphi, notably portrayed at Sophocles' play Oedipus Rex. Subject matter The painting depicts Oedipus meeting the Sphinx at the crossroads on his journey between Thebes and Delphi. Oedipus must answer the Sphinx's riddle correctly in order to pass. Failure means his own death and that of the besieged Thebans. The riddle was: \\"What walks on four feet in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at night?\\". Oedipus answered: \\"Man: as an infant, he crawls on all fours; as an adult, he walks on two legs and; in old age, he uses a walking stick\\". Oedipus was the first to answer the riddle correctly and, having heard Oedipus' answer, the Sphinx was astounded and inexplicably killed herself by throwing herself into the sea. Oedipus thereby won the freedom of the Thebans, the kingdom of that city, and a wife Jocasta, who was later revealed to be his mother.Oedipus and the Sphinx The National Gallery, 2014. Retrieved 30 June 2014. Style and antecedents In this work Moreau deliberately rejects the realism and naturalism in vogue in mid nineteenth century France, instead adopting a deliberately archaic painting style and mythological subject matter. Moreau had sketched Ingres' 1808 Oedipus and the Sphinx in Paris and that is a likely source for his version of the story. Ingres also painted a later version (c. 1826) which is now in the National Gallery, London, but it is uncertain whether Moreau saw that work. The influence of Italian Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna has also been detected in Moreau's version. Unlike Ingres' version where Oedipus appears as the dominant figure with the Sphinx on the defensive and partly obscured, in Moreau's version the Sphinx is on the offensive, clawing at Oedipus whose victory in the encounter does not yet seem assured. Indeed, other works by Moreau often feature victorious sphinxes atop a mound of victims.\\"Gustave Moreau Through the Eyes of Succeeding Generations\\" by Jose Pierre in Jean Paladilhe and Jose Pierre (1972) Gustave Moreau. Translated by Bettina Wadia. London: Thames and Hudson, pp. 94-97. The Sphinx in the painting may be seen as a form of femme fatale, a common theme in late nineteenth century arts and particularly of Symbolist painting. Ragnar von Holten has argued that the subject depicts not only the battle between good and evil, but also between the sexes, and that the opening poem of Buch der Leider by Heinrich Heine was the source for the idea of the painting. In that poem the Sphinx triumphs over Oedipus. In a Freudian interpretation, it has been argued that the Sphinx represents the castrating effect of Moreau's mother that he has seeking to escape. At the time the painting was created, Moreau's father had recently died. By contrast, Henri Dorra has suggested that the poses of the sphinx and Oedipus are derived from the Greek etymological meaning of the word sphinx, which is to clutch, embrace, or cling to. Dorra notes that a paper on the subject by Michel Br√©al had been published in 1863, the year before the work was painted. Dorra also draws attention to the symbolic meaning of some of the elements in the picture, which could have autobiographical aspects, and the possible derivation of the treatment of the subject from the design of a Bithynian coin of Nicomedes II depicting Zeus leaning on a staff with an eagle on his right.Dorra, Henri. \\"The Guesser Guessed: Gustave Moreau's ≈ídipus.\\" Gazette des beaux-arts, 81 (March 1973), pp. 129‚Äì140.

One critic commented, \\"Mr. Gustave Moreau is the hero of this Exhibition and the grumblers proclaim that if the Salon of 1864 is retrieved from discredit, it is thanks to Oedipus and the Sphinx\\".Mathieu, Pierre-Louis. (1977) Gustave Moreau: Complete Edition of the Finished Paintings, Watercolours and Drawings. Translated by James Emmons. Oxford: Phaidon. pp. 83-84. The only serious criticism levelled at the work was that its figures might have been too inspired by the work of Mantegna. Critic Paul de Saint-Victor warned that Moreau should extricate himself from the \\"harsh embrace\\" of Mantegna in order to realise his full potential. Jules Claretie commented that it was drawn like a Mantegna but as poetic as a Leonardo da Vinci.\\"Salon de 1864: Le salon des refus√©s.\\" L'Artiste, 2 (30 June 1864), p. 4. Maxime du Camp, on the other hand, felt that it more resembled Vittore Carpaccio's St. George and the Dragon (1502), which Moreau had copied in Venice and which also contains the gory remains of conflict. Another critic observed that a Greek sphinx, half- woman and half-vulture, was shown, rather than an Egyptian seated sphinx, but felt that whereas Ingres had presented a modern Oedipus, Moreau had better interpreted the classical Oedipus.\\"Old Noll\\". \\"Des tendances de l'art contemporain, √† l'occasion de l'Exposition des beaux-arts de 1864.\\" Annales de la charit√© (Revue d'√©conomie chr√©tienne) 6 (May 1864), pp. 883‚Äì902.

According to a 1998 census of Pakistan, the religious breakdown of the city is as follows: Muslim (96.45%), Christian (2.42%), Hindu (0.86%), Ahmadis (0.17%) and other (0.10%). Other religious groups include Parsis, Sikhs, Bahai, Jews and Buddhists. Of the Muslims, approximately 95% are Sunnis and 5% are Shi'ites.

Mosque in Karachi Karachi was a small fishing village of Muslim Sindhi and Balochi people when Hindu merchants from Thatta established a trading port there in the early 18th century. When the British seized control of the offshore, strategically located island of Manora in 1839, Karachi had about 10,000 inhabitants, predominantly Muslim.Karachi in 1889 Thereafter, authorities of the British Raj embarked on a large-scale modernisation of the city in the 19th century with the intention of establishing a major and modern port which could serve as a gateway to Punjab, the western parts of British India, and Afghanistan. Britain's competition with imperial Russia during the Great Game also heightened the need for a modern port near Central Asia, and so Karachi prospered as a major centre of commerce and industry during the Raj, attracting communities of: Africans, Arabs, Armenians, Catholics from Goa, Jewish, Lebanese, Malays, Konkani people from Maharashtra, Kuchhi from Kuchh, Gujarat in India, and ZoroastriansThe Parsi Community in Karachi, Pakistan PRI's The World (also known as Parsees) - in addition to the large number of British businessmen and colonial administrators who established the city's poshest locales, such as Clifton. This mass migration changed the religious and cultural mosaic of Karachi. 104 years of British rule changed the demographic profile of Karachi from a Muslim town to a multicultural city. At the time of independence, nearly half the population of Karachi was non- Muslim. The independence of Pakistan in 1947 saw an influx of Muslim refugees from India fleeing from anti-Muslim pograms. Many of the Urdu-speaking and other non-Punjabi Muslim refugees that fled from various states of India settled in Karachi, giving the city a blend of predominantly Muslim culture. Swaminarayan Temple. Most Hindus and Sikhs of Karachi migrated to India from 1948 onwards - well after the establishment of Pakistan. Some 250,000 Hindus remain. Poor Hindus of Marwari and Rajasthani descent are concentrated particularly in Naraianpura and Lyari, while wealthier Sindhi Hindus live in Clifton and Saddar. Prominent temples include the Sri Swami Narayan temple on MA Jinnah Road, Daryalal Temple in Kharadar, and numerous temples in Narainpura including a Gujarati temple, a Marwari Temple, and a temple for the Karachi Sikh Sangat.

The film stars Torrey DeVitto, Caitlin Stasey, Harry Lennix, Svetlana Metkina, Dale Dickey, Radha Mitchell, and Stephen Moyer and was released by Bold Films on July 19, 2013. It follows two detectives on their investigation of a brutal massacre, with their only leads being recording devices found at the crime scene. Plot The film begins by showing the aftermath of the massacre in Kidwell, Nevada. Police are first seen going over the crime scene, showing the aftermath of everything that has happened. The story then moves to a press conference with reporters asking questions about the massacre to the lead Detective Burquez, who states that the police are looking into the matter. After the conference, a disheveled Detective Reese asks to be put on the case, to which Detective Burquez assents. They move to a situation room with a TV and multiple computers going over information from the case. Here we learn that there were four video cameras found at the crime scene and two survivors. They load up the first video camera and begin to watch. We see a woman practicing lines for a play, then the video jumps to a man playing guitar and a surprise party for the woman celebrating getting a part in a play. This is Leann, and her friend Rachel is behind the camera. The video shows Leann and her boyfriend Tyler at Leann's play, where he proposes; she declines and he walks off stage angry. The video shows the girls making a video to Tyler to apologize for the proposal and to continue with a trip that was previously planned. The three are shown getting onto a shuttle bus heading to Las Vegas, driven by Ben. Along the way we see people being picked up and we meet Vicki, a dancer, and Steven, a 16-year-old runaway. While watching the video the detectives notice another person on the bus, a woman. Zooming in, they notice that she is carrying a military duffle bag full of money. Focusing on the bag, they get the name Fleishman. While en route to Las Vegas, some of the passengers notice that they're not on any main roads, but dirt roads. Rachel is asking where they are going when the bus hits something and flips; they find that what they hit was barbed wire. Ben mentions he saw a truck repair shop a few miles back, and the group begin to walk back to the repair shop. At the shop where Ben looks around for a phone, and locates a damaged service phone. Back with the group, he asks Rachel if her camera has a light, since the sun will be going down, and Vicki opens a gift box with a small hand held camera, also with a light. Ben tells the women to gather everyone together. As Rachel goes looking for Leann in one of the buildings, the lights flicker on and Steven stumbles out of a room covered in blood. Chasing after him, the others find Steven and Rachel. Leann believes she sees someone and they all run into one of the buildings. The video pauses and we watch as the detectives contemplate Steven as the first victim. We also find out about the mystery woman on the bus, Katrina Fleishman. Katrina is married to a military man hospitalized with posttraumatic stress disorder. Katrina withdrew her husband's savings worth $90,000 in cash and left town. The detectives begin looking at camera number two, from Ben's perspective. He locates a fuse box and is able to get the electricity turned on; the camera shifts to another person in the group. A woman walks towards a bundle of debris, looking for a flare gun, but she is not able to reach it as she is grabbed from behind, and her face is smashed into the debris as she screams and fights; she has her arm burned off by a cutting torch and set on fire. Detective Reese sees a reflection in a pane of glass when the woman is grabbed. Using a computer to focus, a welding mask can be seen. Detective Burquez makes a connection to Katrina Fleishman's husband, a machinist in the military, and wants his picture publicised. Detective Reese continues to watch the remaining video. Back to camera one: Rachel is heard crying and everyone is frightened after Steven's death. Moving to one of the empty buildings they calm down, and discuss how to get out of the area. The video jumps to Rachel and Ben going to the bus for tools with Leann and Tyler looking out. Ben looks for tools to help fix the phone they found earlier and finds a flare gun. They hear a noise outside and Ben gets out and is presumably murdered by the killer, who tries to get to Rachel with his welding tool, but she runs back to the repair shop. Here she learns from Vicki that Leann and Tyler went looking for her and have not returned. Katrina tells the other women \\"He's here\\" and Rachel uses her camera's night vision to look outside. They see a person in a welding mask, who shoots the flare gun at them. hitting Katrina in the stomach. All the women run to a nearby building, where they find Leann, she explains that Tyler was taken and she doesn't know what happened to him. Rachel uses her camera's night vision again and sees the flare gun out in the yard. Vicki decides to make a run for the gun, Leann gives Vicki her ring for luck and Vicki leaves to get the gun. They watch as Vicki goes towards the gun but once there they watch as the killer murders Vicki. Leann and Rachel huddle together after watching Vicki die when they hear someone outside the building and Ben stumbles in. Ben was left to die but was able to make it back to the repair shop with the wires needed to fix the phone. Actress Torrey DeVitto portrayed the lead role of LeAnn Hookplat in the film The frame pauses and the technician tells Detective Reese he was able to find footage on Katrina's phone camera, Detective Burquez comes in with the news that Katrina's husband has been located in a Hollywood hotel and is going to be arrested. We then see what is on Katrina's camera. Katrina, looking in the camera, begins talking about how the police will be scrambling over the scene to find out what is happening. She makes a dying request to be with the one she loves, Gerry Fleishman, her husband, and asks to be buried in the plot next to his. She goes over some of her husband's mental and physical disabilities after he came back from war, about celebrities being famous for no reason, and she speaks of God; the camera then stalls and flickers to a new image of the killer, we watch as Katrina's neck is sliced and she is killed while her camera records. The detectives receive a call from a police officer in Hollywood, who explains to Detective Burquez that Gerald Fleishman has been dead for approximately a week, having shot himself and left only a note telling Katrina to withdraw their savings and go to Las Vegas to enjoy life. Now without a suspect, they attempt to figure out who the killer might be. On Katrina's phone footage they read something the killer wrote on a mirror, \\"Fear me like you fear God,\\" and realize that the crime was planned and staged for them to figure out, and that the murderer had killed before. They begin to focus on Ben, the bus driver, since the trip was non-stop and Ben had mentioned a stop while driving down the gravel road. The detectives begin watching Rachel's video again. We see Ben, Leann and Rachel move to another building, where Katrina is found dead. They move to a barn where Ben barricades the door, but while the women aren't looking, he disappears. Leann is grabbed and pulled from behind by someone unknown, and the camera goes dark as Rachel hides, turns the night vision on and sees Ben come towards her and fall. Taking the wire from him she attempts to re-connect the phone, but the killer appears with the welding torch. As she escapes from the barn it explodes, knocking her down; the killer catches her and sets her on fire with the cutting torch. The video freezes, as no more footage is left from this camera. Finally, Steven's cell phone camera shows the truck stopping. Steven begins talking to his mom about running away and scanning the scene in front of him, as he turns he sees Leann turn down Tyler's proposal; as Steven becomes angry and walks out, the video flickers out. The detectives turn to the technician, who tells them that the memory card in the phone is missing, Detective Reese notices the news on one of the screens and asks for the volume to be raised. The media have gotten the footage from the crime scene and released it to the public. Now they attempt to figure out how the footage was leaked and Burquez is called to her superior's office. Officer Jenson comes in with the background requested on the bus driver Ben, whose real name is William Gentry. It shows he had been convicted of attempting to rob a bank in the past. Reese has an idea while looking at the case photos and leaves to speak with one of the survivors. We watch through the interrogation room camera as Detective Reese begins speaking to Leann. Detective Reese begins to explain to Leann that Tyler is in the hospital and doctors are caring for him. They begin to discuss grief and Reese tells Leann his history with grief, how his daughter had been abducted and later found murdered. He explains that a serial killer kills for attention and sport; they like to play god. He begs Leann to try to remember the events from the crime. Reese begins to ask about Ben and Leann explains what happened just after Rachel, Ben and herself entered the barn to fix the damaged phone. She tells of being grabbed and later coming to and watching Rachel fight the killer, she was able to crawl out of the building before the explosion, and saw Steven choking on something and covered in his blood. Detective Reese realizes that the time line is mixed up, and tells Leann to go home and rest. At the morgue, Reese asks about the autopsies on the bodies, and specifically about Steven. Steven was still alive before the building exploded and had been dragged to the building to be burned when it exploded. Leann had mentioned him choking on something, and Reese finds the missing memory card lodged in his throat. The memory cards resolution is degraded but Reese clears the few frames they have and reveals Tyler wearing the welders mask. Detective Burquez releases his identity to the press as the killer. In the office, Detective Reese continues to watch the video from Rachel's camera, here he notices glitches in the video. While Burquez is speaking at the conference, the reporters begin receiving messages and Burquez is told of a new development. Reese realizes that the videos have been edited for the police to view, with the edits being released to the media. The video now shows Rachel and Leann carefully planning the massacre and framing Tyler for everything. We watch as both women murder each person and stage fake evidence for what they call their \\"first movie together\\". The police realize they have been duped and manipulated. In the last scene both women come on screen and tell the camera and audience \\"Remember the next time someone's filming you, you could be in the sequel.\\" Cast * Torrey DeVitto as LeAnn Hookplat * Caitlin Stasey as Rachel * Harry Lennix as Ben * Svetlana Metkina as Vicki * Dale Dickey as Katrina Fleishman * Radha Mitchell as Detective Burquez * Stephen Moyer as Detective Reese * Aml Ameen as Officer Jensen * Nolan Gerard Funk as Tyler Morris * Albert Kuo as Steven Reception The film received negative reviews by critics.

Biography George J. McNeil was born in Queens, New York, on February 22, 1908, the youngest child of an Irish Catholic working- class family. He attended Brooklyn Tech High School and the Pratt Institute, which he left before gaining his degree. He then copied works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and attended classes at the Art Students League, where he studied with Jan Matulka in 1931‚Äì32. From 1932 to 1936 he studied with Hans Hofmann, becoming Hofmann's monitor (assistant) and teaching a class in collage. In 1936 he became one of the founding members of the American Abstract Artists group and from 1935 worked in the Mural and Easel section of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. In 1936 he married fellow Hofmann student Dora Tamler, with whom he had two children, Helen and James. During the late 1930s he traveled to Mexico and in 1940‚Äì41 he visited Cuba. During World War II he served in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946. He also gained an Ed.D from Columbia University. From the late 1940s he was deeply involved with the abstract expressionist movement, also known as the New York School of painting. Apart from 1946‚Äì48, when he lived and taught in Laramie, Wyoming, and 1956‚Äì57 when he taught at the University of California, Berkeley, George McNeil lived from the late 1940s until his death in Brooklyn. From 1948 to 1962 he spent his summers in the art colony of Provincetown, MA. He died in New York on January 11, 1995. Paintings From the Cubist-influenced compositions of his earlier Hofmann student years, McNeil moved to full abstraction by 1936. His early 1950s paintings were \\"both abstract and expressionist\\"April Kingsley, The Turning Point: The Abstract Expressionists and the Transformation of American Art (Simon & Schuster, NY, 1992), p. 96. , with an active surface \\" very moving, full of feeling, emotional\\"Lillian Orlovsky, George McNeil: Bathers, Dancers, Abstracts: A Themed Retrospective, ed.

His paintings remained fully abstract until the early 1960s when figures and faces began to appear in the abstract field, particularly in the \\"Dancer\\" and \\"Bather\\" series. McNeil commented to art historian Irving Sandler in 1968: From 1980, dynamic situations such as discos, New York City, football, street life or graffiti activate his paintings. His work is characterized by profound attention to color and complex abstract volumes. In the 1980s his work enjoyed a renaissance of attention and influence.Irving Sandler, Art of the Post- Modern Era: From the Late 1960s to the Early 1990s (Icon Editions: Westview Press, 1997), , Chapter 8. From 1970 to 1991 McNeil made lithographs that he printed on his own press or at the Tamarind Institute, Albuquerque, NM, where he was invited four times in the 1980s. Participation and affiliations When George McNeil was a student with Hans Hofmann, he was friends with fellow students Giorgio Cavallon, Ray \\"Buddha\\" Kayser (Eames), Perle Fine, William Freed, Lee Krasner,Gail Levin, Lee Krasner: A Biography (New York: William Morrow, 2011), , p. 130. Mercedes Matter, John Opper and Lillian Orlowsky, sharing a studio with Krasner and her then partner Igor Pantuhoff; through Krasner he met Jackson Pollock.

Knopf, 2004), , pp. 102, 124-28, 130-31, 168, 175, 218, 219, 349. and Esteban Vicente. After serving as Hans Hofmann's monitor and translator (as Krasner recalled, \\"I really got George's version of what he thought Hofmann had said to me,\\"Lillian Olinsey Kiesler, Oral history interview, Archives of American Art 1990, also Levin, op cit. p 123.) McNeil broke with Hofmann over the question of the validity of full abstractionLillian Orlovsky, George McNeil: Bathers, Dancers, Abstracts, p. 21. and identified with the American Abstract Artists such as Rosalind Bengelsdorf, Giorgio Cavallon, Ibram Lassaw and others, exhibiting with them from 1936. His work for the Mural Section of the WPA was supervised by Burgoyne Diller and he was active in the Artists Union. At the New York World's Fair in 1939 he was one of five abstract artists who exhibited; Stuart Davis appointed him an alternate juror for the Committee of Selection. During the 1950s George McNeil was associated with the other artists who exhibited at the Egan Gallery such as Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov, with Kline a close friend. From 1950 he was a member of The Club, the contemporary artists' club at 39 East 8th Street, NY, founded in 1948.Philip Pavia, Club Without Walls: Selections from the Journals of Philip Pavia, ed. Natalie Edgar (Midmarch Arts Press, NY, 2007), , p. 140.

From the early 1960s \\" his transition to Figurative Expressionism ... made him an obvious precursor for the Neo-Expressionist movement of the 1980s.\\"Adam Zucker, Pioneers from Provincetown: The Roots of Figurative Expressionism (Provincetown Art Association and Museum, 2013). Exhibition catalogue, , p. 34. His highly successful exhibits at the Gruenebaum Gallery, 1981‚Äì87, brought his work together with that of many of his fellow gestural abstractionists and friends such as Janice Biala, James Brooks, Giorgio Cavallon, Elaine de Kooning, Sonia Gechtoff and Grace Hartigan. In 1968 McNeil was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. Honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1982, he was elected a member of the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1989.

Many sports teams in Poland have organised supporter groups who are actively in involved in either the ultras scene or the hooligan scene. All these groups in Poland have 4 types of relationships between each other which are subject to change over time: * friendships (zgody) - alliances between two groups of supporters, whereby fans frequently visit each other's matches. During matches between two such sides, there usually are no divisions between away and home fans but both sets of fans are in the same stand. * agreements (uk≈Çady) - provisional agreements of co-operation between two groups of fans. If they last, they usually become friendships later on. * enemies (kosy) - rival teams. A rival of a friend is also usually considered to be a rival. * neutral - there's no specific antipathy or sympathy towards each other. These relationships can be complicated. However, local derbies are usually pre-determined by historical and geographical factors and it is very rare for a local derby not to be considered a fierce rivalry. In some cases, the rivalries extend beyond sport and are general rivalries between cities or towns. Association football =Biggest inter-regional rivalries= Football Derby of Poland Any match where Legia Warsaw plays either Lech Pozna≈Ñ, Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ or Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. All four clubs are among the most supported in the country and usually are or were among the title contenders. The animosity towards Legia stems from the fact that Warsaw is the capital city and is perceived to be favoured by the authorities. Silesia vs. The capital G√≥rnik Zabrze, Ruch Chorz√≥w or Polonia Bytom vs. Legia Warsaw - the rivalry is not limited to those clubs, as such a derby can refer to any team from the capital, Legia, Polonia or even Hutnik or smaller teams, against any Upper Silesian club such as: GKS Tychy, GKS Jastrzƒôbie, G√≥rnik Zabrze, Odra Wodzis≈Çaw, Piast Gliwice, Polonia Bytom, ROW Rybnik, Ruch Chorz√≥w, Ruch Radzionk√≥w, Szczakowianka Jaworzno, Szombierki Bytom, Victoria Jaworzno with the exception of the DƒÖbrowa Basin clubs (which are nicknamed \\"gorole\\" - \\"non-Silesians\\" by Silesian fans). The region of Silesia has always been hostile towards the capital city, Warsaw, a rivalry that is mirrored outside of sport as well. This is partly due to quasi- colonial exploitation of the region after 1945 by the central government (or at least perceived as such in the region), partly due to Warsaw strongly opposing any attempt for greater autonomy for Silesia, and the hostility of the mining communities (Upper Silesia being a predominantly mining region) towards the ruling capital. The two most successful clubs, G√≥rnik Zabrze and Ruch Chorz√≥w, frequently contested the championship title with Legia Warsaw and therefore, those matches are especially heated. Polonia Bytom, having spent many years in the top flight, has also developed an intense rivalry. That said, the rivalry is not limited to those clubs, as such a derby can refer to any team from the capital, against any Upper Silesian club, the exception are those clubs from the DƒÖbrowa Basin (e.g. Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec) as they're not seen as Silesian by others in the region, but as \\"gorole\\" (a silesian word meaning: \\"non-Silesian\\"; the word \\"gorole\\" should not to be confused with \\"g√≥rale\\" - \\"gorals\\"). \\"The Great Triad\\" vs. \\"The Three Kings of Big Cities\\" The Great Triad (Arka Gdynia, Cracovia & Lech Pozna≈Ñ) vs. The Three Kings of Big Cities (Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw & Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w) - Fans of Arka, Cracovia and Lech share a friendship, known as \\"The Great Triad\\" (Wielka Triada). Fans of Lechia, ≈ölƒÖsk and Wis≈Ça also shared a friendship called Trzej Kr√≥lowie Wielkich Miast and any match between the two groups was considered a big rivalry.http://tematy.gazeta.pl/W/2222,Wielka-Triada Wis≈Ça then broke away from the alliance and joined Elana Toru≈Ñ, Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Ruch Chorz√≥w fans, causing a massive rift in the Polish supporter world. Other derbies between coalitions Whilst most fans have their own alliances and friendships specific between their two clubs, there are instances of three or even four-way friendships. There are other long-term major coalitions in addition to the \\"Great Triad\\" and the \\"Three Kings of Big Cities\\". The most notable ones include: \\\\- Legia Warsaw, Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec, Olimpia ElblƒÖg \\\\- ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Zawisza Bydgoszcz and GKS Tychy \\\\- Arka Gdynia, Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin and Polonia Bytomhttp://www.arkowcy.pl/artykul/1369/zgody.html http://www.polonia.bytom.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=68&limitstart;=1http://mkszaglebie.pl/index.php/2015/06/18/zgody- zaglebia/ \\\\- Arka Gdynia, KSZO Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski and Lech Pozna≈Ñ \\\\- G√≥rnik Zabrze, ROW Rybnik, Concordia Knur√≥w and Wis≈Çoka Dƒôbica \\\\- Ruch Chorz√≥w, Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Elana Toru≈Ñ and Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w http://www.niebiescy.pl/przyjaciele.phphttp://www.stadionowioprawcy.net/news/3356-awantura_z_udzialem_nowej_koalicji_w_marsylii.html \\\\- Motor Lublin, G√≥rnik ≈Åƒôczna, Che≈Çmianka Che≈Çm, sometimes collectively called the \\"Eastern Horde\\" (Wschodnia Horda) or the Eastern coalition as the three clubs are one of the furthest towards the east of the countryhttp://lublin.wyborcza.pl/lublin/1,48724,17853604,Pseudokibic_ujawnia_tajemnice_fanatykow__Czym_jest.html?disableRedirects=truehttp://www.kurierlubelski.pl/sport/motor- lublin/a/wschodnia-horda-kontra-stal-stalowa-wola-nie-zyje-jeden-z-fanatykow- co-dalej,10068700/ \\\\- Zawisza Bydgoszcz, G√≥rnik Wa≈Çbrzych and GKS Tychy \\\\- Hetman W≈Çoszczowa, Alit O≈ºar√≥w and Orlicz Suchedni√≥w \\\\- Stal Mielec, Sandecja Nowy SƒÖcz and Czarni Jas≈Çohttp://www.sandecja.cba.pl/zgody.htm \\\\- GKS Tychy, Cracovia, Sandecja Nowy SƒÖcz \\\\- Stomil Olsztyn, Hutnik Krak√≥w, Wis≈Ça P≈Çock These coalitions mean that although each club has its own rivalries and derbies, on the basis of \\"my friend's friend is my friend too\\" and \\"my friend's enemy is my enemy too\\", they add a lot of rivalries and derbies as very often, fans from all of the coalition clubs are present at a certain team's matches. =Most popular local derbies= G√≥rnik Zabrze fans during the Great Silesian Derby in 2009 * The Holy War (Krak√≥w) (≈öwiƒôta Wojna) is a match between Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w and Cracovia - multiple Polish champions, the two biggest clubs in Krak√≥w and reportedly the oldest existing ones in Poland, both founded in 1906. The term \\"Holy War\\" was coined by the defender from KS Cracovia, Ludwik Gintel. The \\"Holy War\\" is one of the oldest (first friendly in 1908, first official game in 1913) and most played Polish derbies (over 100 official games). The rivalry is also considered the fiercest in Poland and one of the most intense in Central Europe. It is also the theme of a song devoted to their never-ending shenanigans, played by Andrusy. * Great Silesian Derby (Wielkie Derby ≈ölƒÖska) is a derby between the two most successful Polish teams, 14-time national champions, both based in the Upper Silesian urban area: G√≥rnik Zabrze and Ruch Chorzow. It is the most contested Polish derby (120 official games). Polonia Warsaw fans during the Warsaw Derby in 2011 * Warsaw Derby between the most successful teams from Poland's capital: Legia Warsaw and Polonia Warsaw. It dates back to 1921 and currently both teams have won 29 times. * ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Derby between ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ \\\\- one of the fiercest derbies, first played in 1926. * Tricity Derby between Arka Gdynia and Lechia Gda≈Ñsk \\\\- the most successful clubs from Tricity. It is the biggest derby of northern Poland. In the past, matches between Lechia Gda≈Ñsk and Ba≈Çtyk Gdynia were also considered the Tricity Derby. * Great Lw√≥w Derby played between the oldest Polish clubs Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w and Czarni Lw√≥w. It was one of the most contested and prestigious derbies of Poland prior to World War II. Also considered to be one of the oldest Polish derbies (first friendly in 1907, first official game in 1912). * Rzesz√≥w Derby between Resovia and Stal Rzesz√≥w is one of the most contested Polish derbies (80+ official games). Even though it was never played in the highest division, it is considered a very intense rivalry. =Other derbies held in the top division= *Gdynia Derby between Arka Gdynia and Ba≈Çtyk Gdynia is the oldest Tricity rivalry dating back to 1931 (first friendly match). *Bydgoszcz Derby between Polonia Bydgoszcz and Zawisza Bydgoszcz is a fierce rivalry between two Bydgoszcz teams, dating back to 1948 (first official match). *Pozna≈Ñ Derby between Lech Pozna≈Ñ and Warta Pozna≈Ñ.http://www.gloswielkopolski.pl/artykul/3864609,derby- poznania-warta-poznan-pokonala-lecha-ii- poznan-10-zdjecia,id,t.htmlhttp://sport.trojmiasto.pl/Derby-Lechia-Arka-mecz- ekstraligi-tez-w-Sopocie-n91055.html Unusual in the fact that the cross-city rivalry does not provoke any tensions between the two groups of supporters due to historical differences in performance and the fact that many locals would watch both teams. Warta's golden years were the 1920s and the club won its last national championship in 1947, while Lech made its first Ekstraklasa appearance in 1948 and won its first ever championship in 1983. *Lower Silesian Derby between ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw and Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin \\\\- the two largest teams in Lower Silesia, both Polish champions. G√≥rnik Zabrze fans during a match against Odra Wodzis≈Çaw in 2007 *Upper Silesian derbies - Upper Silesia has a large number of professional teams and any match between the following teams can be considered to be an \\"Upper Silesian Derby\\": GKS Katowice, GKS Tychy, GKS Jastrzƒôbie, G√≥rnik Zabrze, Odra Wodzis≈Çaw, Piast Gliwice, Polonia Bytom, ROW Rybnik, Ruch Chorz√≥w, Ruch Radzionk√≥w, Szombierki Bytom. The most significant derbies include: **Bytom Derby between Polonia Bytom and Szombierki Bytom (and Ruch Radzionk√≥w in the past)http://www.mmsilesia.pl/409840/2012/4/16/burdy-podczas-meczu-ruch- radzionkow--polonia-bytom-zdjecia?category=naSygnale \\\\- traditionally between Polonia and Szombierki, the two championship-winning Bytom teams, however Radzionk√≥w used to be a part of Bytom and part of Polonia's fanbase is located in Radzionk√≥w. **Chorz√≥w Derby or Silesian Holy War between Ruch Chorz√≥w and AKS Chorz√≥w - a historic derby which used to be one of the fiercest rivalries in pre-war PolandEncyklopedia pi≈Çkarska FUJI, kolekcja klub√≥w, tom I: Ruch Chorz√≥w, Andrzej Gowarzewski, Katowice 1995; str 19 **Old Silesian Derby between Polonia Bytom and Ruch Chorz√≥w \\\\- both teams are amongst the oldest in Upper Silesia and they are also the two first Silesian teams to win the Polish championship (Ruch in 1933, Polonia in 1954). Bytom and Chorz√≥w are neighboring cities in the central part of the Upper Silesian urban area. At 80 official games, it is also the second most contested Silesian derby after the Great Silesian Derby. **The Silesian Classic (≈ölƒÖski Klasyk) between G√≥rnik Zabrze and GKS Katowice, with over 70 official matches played since the 1960s, is a popular rivalry since the 1980s, when both teams competed for the highest domestic trophies. It does not invoke the same levels of tension as the other Silesian derbies.http://sportowefakty.wp.pl/pilka-nozna/36611/pp-slaski- klasyk-swietem-slaskiej-pilki-zapowiedz-meczu-gks- Both teams share a very intense rivalry against Ruch Chorz√≥w. **GKS Katowice vs. Ruch Chorz√≥w - a very fierce rivalry between clubs based in the neighboring cities of Katowice and Chorz√≥w. **Gliwice-Zabrze derby between Piast Gliwice and G√≥rnik Zabrze \\\\- Gliwice and Zabrze are neighboring cities in the western part of the Upper Silesian urban area. **GieKSa Derby between GKS Katowice and GKS Tychy is a local derby between two sides who use the nickname GieKSa, which refers to the prefix \\"GKS\\" which stands for \\"Mining Sports Club\\" (G√≥rniczy Klub Sportowy). *Hanysy vs. Gorole (Silesian: Hanysy - \\"Silesians\\", Gorole - \\"non-Silesians\\") between any club with Silesian identity vs. any club from the DƒÖbrowa Basin which itself is part of the Upper Silesian urban area but is historically considered a part of Lesser Poland. Teams, who identify themselves as Silesians include GKS Katowice, GKS Tychy, GKS Jastrzƒôbie, G√≥rnik Zabrze, Odra Wodzis≈Çaw, Piast Gliwice, Polonia Bytom, ROW Rybnik, Ruch Chorz√≥w, Ruch Radzionk√≥w, and Szombierki Bytom while the Gorole clubs include Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec, Szczakowianka Jaworzno and Victoria Jaworzno. Clubs from southernmost parts of the Silesian Voivodeship, such as G√≥ral ≈ªywiec, and the two Bielsko-Bia≈Ça clubs, Podbeskidzie and BKS Stal, are also not seen as Silesian by others in the region. Furthermore, BKS Stal and Zag≈Çƒôbie Sosnowiec have a mutual friendship with the deeply unpopular among Silesians Legia Warsaw, as well as each other. *Minor Krakow Derbies - Hutnik Nowa Huta vs. Cracovia or Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w vs. Garbarnia Krak√≥w - apart from the \\"Holy War\\", matches between Hutnik and the other two sides are also considered Krak√≥w derbies and are fierce rivalries. Due to Garbarnia's lack of sporting success and a small supporter presence, the derby is considered to be mostly of a historical nature. *Szczecin Derby - a now historic derby between Pogo≈Ñ Szczecin and Arkonia Szczecin, last played in 1981. *Greater Poland Derby - a now historic derby between Lech Pozna≈Ñ and Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski.http://epoznan.pl/sport-news-1644-W_sobote_derby_Lech- Groclinhttp://www.sport.pl/sport/1,65025,1622968.html Amica Wronki also used to contest this derby until the latter two clubs were disbanded. =Other derbies by region= Northern Poland: Pomerania and Cuiavia *Cuiavian- Pomeranian Derby - Elana Toru≈Ñ vs. Polonia Bydgoszcz or Zawisza Bydgoszcz \\\\- Bydgoszcz and Toru≈Ñ share a rivalry which goes even beyond sporting competition *Gda≈Ñsk Derby - Lechia Gda≈Ñsk vs. Gedania Gda≈Ñsk vs. Stoczniowiec Gda≈Ñsk *Great Pomeranian Football Derby - Gwardia Koszalin vs. Gryf S≈Çupsk vs. Kotwica Ko≈Çobrzeg *Kaszubian Derby - Kaszubia Ko≈õcierzyna vs. Cartusia Kartuzyhttp://www.sportnakaszubach.pl/pilka-nozna/derby-cartusia-kaszubia- chwaszczyno-ze-switem-i-inne-pilkarskie-mecze-tego-weekendu- id1742.htmlhttp://expresskaszubski.pl/sport/2009/04/kartuzy-pilkarska-stolica- kaszub-cartusia-kaszubia-2-1 *Koszalin Derby - Ba≈Çtyk Koszalin vs. Gwardia Koszalinhttp://www.gk24.pl/sport/pilka-nozna/art/4570313,w-sobote-derby- koszalina-to-nie-jest-zwykly- mecz,id,t.htmlhttp://koszalin.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/pilkarskie-derby-gwardia- koszalin-baltyk- koszalin,3727407,art,t,id,tm.html?sesja_gratka=65d27e9b5dd185bfc382d6b56e58daf7 *S≈Çupsk Voivodeship Derby - Gryf S≈Çupsk vs. Pogo≈Ñ Lƒôbork *Szczecinek Derby - Darzb√≥r Szczecinek vs. Wielim Szczecinek *Tczew Derby - Unia Tczew vs. Wis≈Ça Tczewhttp://www.unia.tczew.pl/opisy.htm *W≈Çoc≈Çawek Derby - Kujawiak W≈Çoc≈Çawek vs. W≈Çoc≈Çavia W≈Çoc≈Çawekhttp://www.pomorska.pl/artykuly- archiwalne/gal/7449645,memorial-miroslawa-morkowskiego-derby- wloclaviakujawiak,11828627,id,t,zid.html Central Poland: Greater Poland, Mazovia, Lubusz Voivodeship, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship *The Great Derby of Greater Poland - KKS Kalisz vs. G√≥rnik Konin or Ostrovia Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski \\\\- fans from Kalisz do not consider themselves to belong to Greater Poland causing tension with nearby fans from Konin and Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski. *Greater Poland Derby between Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski and B≈Çƒôkitni Wronki - before the reactivation of the football side by Amica, this derby used to be a high- profile game for the fans in Wronki.

PUR gum and mints are manufactured in Switzerland, distributed in Canada, and sold in over 25 countries worldwide. PUR gum and mints are also sold through online outlets such as Amazon. The PUR Company Inc. uses the slogan \\"Kick Aspartame\\" to promote their sugar-free and aspartame-free products.  History  In 2010, entrepreneur Jay Klein aimed to create a chewing gum that was vegan, gluten- free, nut/soy-free, allergen-free, and aspartame-free. The result was naturally sweetened PUR Gum that contains no additives or chemicals and is non-GMO. Klein decided to sweeten the chewing gum with xylitol so it would be a healthy choice for diabetics, pregnant women, people with dietary sensitivities, and any person seeking to avoid chemicals. Klein marketed his product first in the Greater Toronto Area by starting small and going door-to door, \\"running for mayor\\". Then they expanded to the rest of Canada and major U.S. metropolitan areas, where ‚Äúhealth hubs‚Äù ‚Äì areas with significant markets for health food products ‚Äì could be found. However, PUR's popularity started to take off after a chain of airport duty-free shops started carrying the product, which made the brand gain international popularity that spread virally through airports and other channels. The number of international markets grew from three, to six, to ten, and then over 25. In 2014, PUR Gum made an appearance on CBC's Dragon's Den, asking for $1 million in exchange for a 10% equity stake, valuing the company at $10 million. Three Dragons made offers and Jay Klein accepted an on-air deal with Jim Treliving and Arlene Dickinson. In 2016, The PUR Company became Canada's 10th Fastest-Growing Company and Toronto's 4th Fastest-Growing Company with 5-year revenue growth of 5,496 percent. On the Profit 500 2016 list, The PUR Company ranked #10 overall and #1 in the Manufacturing and Distributing Category.

After the declaration of a united Kingdom of Italy, Cavour took office as the first Prime Minister of Italy; he died after only three months in office, and thus did not live to see Venetia or Rome added to the new Italian nation. Cavour put forth several economic reforms in his native region of Piedmont in his earlier years, and founded the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. After being elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he quickly rose in rank through the Piedmontese government, coming to dominate the Chamber of Deputies through a union of center-left and center-right politicians. After a large rail system expansion program, Cavour became prime minister in 1852. As prime minister, Cavour successfully negotiated Piedmont's way through the Crimean War, the Second Italian War of Independence, and Garibaldi's expeditions, managing to maneuver Piedmont diplomatically to become a new great power in Europe, controlling a nearly united Italy that was five times as large as Piedmont had been before he came to power. Cavour was a freemason of the Italian Symbolic Rite. English historian Denis Mack Smith says Cavour was the most successful parliamentarian in Italian history but he was not especially democratic. Cavour was often dictatorial, ignored his ministerial colleagues and parliament, and interfered in parliamentary elections. He also practiced trasformismo and other policies which were carried over into post-Risorgimento Italy.Denis Mack Smith, \\"Cavour and Parliament\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 13#1 (1957): 37‚Äì57Denis Mack Smith, Cavour (1985). Biography =Early life= Camillo Benso was born in Turin during Napoleonic rule, into a family that had gained a fair amount of land during the French occupation. He was the second of two sons of Michele Giuseppe Francesco Antonio Benso, 4th Marquess of Cavour and Count of Isolabella and Leri, Lord of Corveglia, Dusino, Mondonio, Ottiglio and Ponticelli, Co-Lord of Castagnole, Cellarengo and Menabi, Cereaglio, Chieri, San Salvatore Monferrato, Santena and Valfenera, 1st Baron of the French Empire (1781‚Äì1850) and his wife (1805) Ad√©la√Øde (Ad√®le) Suzanne, Marchioness of Sellon (1780‚Äì1846), herself of French origin. His godparents were Napoleon's sister Pauline, and her husband, Prince Camillo Borghese, after whom Camillo was named.Coppa, Frank J., \\"Cavour, Count Camillo Benso di (1810‚Äì1861)\\", Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions, Ohio University, 1998 Camillo and his older brother Gustavo were initially educated at home. He was sent to the Turin Military Academy when he was only ten years old. In July 1824 he was named a page to Charles Albert, the king of Piedmont (1831‚Äì1849). Cavour frequently ran afoul of the authorities in the academy, as he was too headstrong to deal with the rigid military discipline. He was once forced to live three days on bread and water because he had been caught with books that the academy had banned. He was found to be apt at the mathematical disciplines, and was therefore enlisted in the Engineer Corps in the Piedmontese-Sardinian army in 1827. While in the army, he studied the English language as well as the works of Jeremy Bentham and Benjamin Constant, developing liberal tendencies which made him suspect to police forces at the time.Beales and Biagini, The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy, p. 106. He resigned his commission in the army in November 1831, both because of boredom with military life and because of his dislike of the reactionary policies of King Charles Albert. He administered the family estate at Grinzane, some forty kilometers outside the capital, serving as mayor there from 1832 to the revolutionary upheaval of 1848. Coat of arms of the Count of Cavour: Argent on a chief gules three scallop shells or. Cavour then lived for a time in Switzerland, with his Protestant relatives in Geneva. He grew acquainted with Calvinist teachings, and for a short while he converted from a form of unorthodox Catholicism, only to go back later. A Reformed pastor, Alexandre Vinet, impressed upon Cavour the need for the separation of church and state, a doctrine Cavour followed for the remainder of his life. He then traveled to Paris where he was impressed by parliamentary debates, especially those of Fran√ßois Guizot and Adolphe Thiers, confirming his devotion to a political career. He next went to London, where he was much more disappointed by British politics, and toured the country, visiting Oxford, Liverpool, Birmingham, Chester, Nottingham, and Manchester. A quick tour through the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland (the German part and the Lake Geneva area) eventually landed him back in Turin. Cavour believed that economic progress had to precede political change, and stressed the advantages of railroad construction in the peninsula. He was a strong supporter of transportation by steam engine, sponsoring the building of many railroads and canals. Between 1838 and 1842 Cavour began several initiatives in attempts to solve economic problems in his area. He experimented with different agricultural techniques on his estate, such as growing sugar beets, and was one of the first Italian landowners to use chemical fertilizers.Beales & Biagini, The Risorgimento and the Unification of Italy, p. 108. He also founded the Piedmontese Agricultural Society. In his spare time, he again traveled extensively, mostly in France and the United Kingdom. =Early political career= An early portrait of Cavour. The first apparently \\"liberal\\" moves of Pope Pius IX and the political upheavals of 1848 spawned a new movement of Italian liberalism, allowing Cavour to enter the political arena, no longer in fear of the police. He then gave a speech in front of numerous journalists in favor of a constitution for Piedmont, which was eventually granted. Cavour, unlike several other political thinkers, was not at first offered a position in the new Chamber of Deputies, as he was still a somewhat suspicious character to the nation.Denis Mack Smith, Cavour (1985). Cavour never planned for the establishment of a united country, and even later during his Premiership his objective was to expand Piedmont with the annexation of Lombardy and Venetia, rather than a unified Italy. For example, during the conservative period, he gained a reputation as a non-revolutionary progressive. He was a poor public speaker. Cavour then lost the next election, while the Piedmontese army was destroyed at the Battle of Novara, leading Charles Albert to abdicate, passing the throne to his son, Victor Emmanuel II. Cavour was then brought back into Parliament by the voters, where he was much more successful. His knowledge of European markets and modern economics earned him the positions of Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Commerce, and Minister of the Navy in 1850. Cavour soon came to dominate the cabinet of Prime Minister Massimo d'Azeglio. Cavour united the Right Center and the Left Center in the chamber to show dominance there as well. In 1851, Cavour gained a Cabinet promotion to Minister of Finance by working against his colleague from inside the Cabinet in a somewhat disreputable takeover, although this was to Piedmont's advantage because of his many economic reforms. It allowed Cavour to begin his railway expansion program, giving Piedmont 800 kilometres of track by the year 1860, one third of the railways in Italy at the time. He took the lead in legislation weakening the powers of the Church to own land, control the schools and supervise marriage laws. When the bishops protested, they were punished or exiled, making Cavour the hero of liberal anticlerical elements across Italy.Harry Hearder, Cavour (1994) pp. 62‚Äì63, 111‚Äì12. =Prime minister of Piedmont‚ÄìSardinia= Official portrait of Camillo Benso in 1852. Cavour formed a coalition with Urbano Rattazzi known as the Connubio (\\"union\\"), uniting the moderate men of the Right and of the Left, and brought about the fall of the d'Azeglio cabinet in November 1852. The King reluctantly accepted Cavour as prime minister, the most conservative possible choice, but their relationship was never an easy one.Mack Smith, Cavour, pp. 61‚Äì67. Cavour was generally liberal and believed in free trade, freedom of opinion, and secular rule, but he was an enemy of republicans and revolutionaries, whom he feared as disorganized radicals who would upset the social order. Cavour dominated debate in Parliament but is criticized for the controversial methods he used while Prime Minister, including excessive use of emergency powers, employing friends, bribing some newspapers while suppressing others, and rigging elections, though these were fairly common practices for the time. The national debt soared by a factor of six because of his heavy spending on modernizing projects, especially railways, and building up the army and the Royal Sardinian Navy. When he became Prime Minister Piedmont had just suffered a major defeat by Austria, but when he died, Victor Emmanuel II ruled a state five times as large, which dominated Italy and ranked among Europe's great powers. The allied powers of Britain and France asked Piedmont to enter the Crimean War, partially to encourage Austria to enter, which it would not do unless it was certain that Piedmontese troops were not available to attack Austrian positions in Italy. Cavour, who hoped that the allies would support Piedmont's expansion in Italy, agreed as soon as his colleagues' support would allow and entered the war on 10 January 1855. This was too late to truly distinguish themselves militarily, but the 18,000 man contingent earned Piedmont a position at the Congress of Paris that ended the war. In January 1858, the Italian Felice Orsini's attempted assassination of Napoleon III paradoxically opened an avenue of diplomacy between France and Piedmont. While in jail awaiting trial, Orsini wrote a public letter to the Emperor of the French, ending with, \\"Remember that, so long as Italy is not independent, the peace of Europe and Your Majesty is but an empty dream... Set my country free, and the blessings of twenty-five million people will follow you everywhere and forever.\\"Norwich, The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean, p. 523. Orsini was still executed, but Napoleon III began to explore the possibility of joint operation with Piedmont against Austria. Cavour and Napoleon met in July 1858 at Plombi√®res-les-Bains, and the two agreed that Piedmont would attempt to provoke war with the Duchy of Modena, obliging Austria to enter, and France would then aid Piedmont. In return, Cavour reluctantly agreed to cede Savoy (the seat of the Piedmontese royal family) and the County of Nice to France, and also arranged a royal marriage between Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy and Prince Napol√©on Bonaparte, surprisingly without Victor Emmanuel's consent.Norwich, The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean, p. 524. In the same year, Cavour sent his cousin, the famous beauty, photographic artist, and secret agent Virginia Oldo√Øni, to further the interests of Italian unification with the emperor by whatever means possible, and by all accounts she succeeded, famously becoming the mistress of Napoleon. Cavour as Prime Minister (1850s). Both France and Piedmont began to prepare for war, but diplomatic support diminished rapidly. Napoleon III quickly soured on the plot, and Britain, Prussia, and Russia proposed an international congress, with one likely goal the disarmament of Piedmont. Piedmont was saved by Austria's sending an ultimatum on 23 April, demanding that Piedmont disarm itself, thus casting Austria as an aggressor. France mobilised and slowly began to enter Italy, but Piedmont needed to defend itself for a short period. Fortunately, rainstorms and Austrian indecision under Ferencz Graf Gyulai gave time for France to arrive in force. Cavour's desk in the Ch√¢teau de Thorens, Savoy. The battles of Magenta and Solferino left Franco-Piedmontese forces in control of Lombardy, but the Austrians remained confident of defending their \\"fortress quadrilateral\\" area, with four fortresses in Verona, Legnago, Peschiera, and Mantua. These defenses, the horrors of the Battle of Solferino, the possibility of Prussian entry into the war, and the potential for an over- strong Piedmontese state convinced Napoleon to sign a separate peace with Austria in the Treaty of Villafranca on 11 July 1859, ending the Second Italian War of Independence. Victor Emmanuel accepted the peace, but Cavour was so infuriated after reading the terms of the treaty that he tendered his resignation. He soon regained his optimism, however, as several of the terms, such as the restoration to power of the rulers of Tuscany and Modena, and the establishment of an Italian Confederation including Austria, were not actually carried out. General La Marmora succeeded to Cavour's post and insisted on following the treaty terms, even sending a letter to Tuscany asking that they restore their Grand Duke. (Bettino Ricasoli, virtual dictator of Tuscany at the time, wrote about this appeal to his brother, saying \\"Tell General La Marmora that I have torn his letter into a thousand pieces.\\"Holt, The Making of Italy: 1815‚Äì1870, p. 221.) France continued direct talks with Piedmont on the destiny of the central Italian states, all of whose autocrats supported unification with Piedmont but were restrained by the treaty, which called for the restoration of their old governments. Cavour had retired to his estate at Leri, out of politics but concerned about the King‚Äôs alliance with Garibaldi‚Äôs revolutionaries and his desire to renew the war with Austria without allied support.Mack Smith, Cavour, pp. 180‚Äì83. When the weak La Marmora cabinet resigned, Victor Emmanuel was reluctant to have Cavour as premier again due both to their quarrel over the treaty of Villafranca and Cavour's success in preventing the king from marrying his mistress after the queen's death. But Cavour was sent for on 20 January 1860. Garibaldi and Cavour making Italy in a satirical cartoon of 1861; the boot is a well-known reference to the shape of the Italian Peninsula. Cavour agreed with Napoleon to cede Savoy and Nice to France, in order to annex Tuscany and Emilia to Piedmont. Plebiscites were arranged with huge majorities in all these provinces to approve the changes.Mack Smith, Cavour, pp. 203, 206. Cavour managed to convince most that uniting Italy would make up for these territorial losses. With this, the first stage of unification was completed. It was now up to Garibaldi to overthrow the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and bring southern Italy into Piedmont's control. Garibaldi was furious that his birthplace, Nice, had been ceded to France, and wished to recapture the city, but a popular insurrection in Palermo on 4 April 1860 diverted him southward. He requested a brigade of Piedmontese to take Sicily, but Cavour refused. So instead, Garibaldi raised a force of a thousand (I Mille) redshirt volunteers. They landed at Marsala in Sicily on 11 May and won the battles of Calatafimi and Milazzo, gaining control of Sicily. Cavour attempted to annex Sicily to Piedmont, but Garibaldi and his comrade Francesco Crispi would not allow it. Cavour persuaded Victor Emmanuel to write a letter to Garibaldi, requesting that he not invade the mainland; the letter was indeed sent, but the King secretly wished Garibaldi to invade. He wrote another letter asking him to go ahead, but this was apparently never sent.Norwich, The Middle Sea: A History of the Mediterranean, p. 530; The letter was allegedly still sealed when found. Cavour meanwhile attempted to stir up a liberal revolution in Naples, but the populace was unreceptive. Garibaldi invaded, attempting to reach Naples quickly before Cavour found a way to stop him. On 7 September he entered Naples, at that time the largest city in Italy, and unilaterally declared Victor Emmanuel the King of Italy.Mack Smith, Cavour, p. 222. Garibaldi was now military dictator of southern Italy and Sicily, and he imposed the Piedmontese constitution but publicly demanded that Cavour be removed, which alienated him slightly from Victor Emmanuel. Garibaldi was unwilling to stop at this point, and planned an immediate invasion of the Papal States. Cavour feared France in that case would declare war to defend the Pope and successfully stopped Garibaldi from initiating his attack. Garibaldi had been weakened by the Battle of Volturno, so Cavour quickly invaded the Papal regions of Umbria and Marche. This linked the territories conquered by Piedmont with those taken by Garibaldi. The King met with Garibaldi, who handed over control of southern Italy and Sicily, thus uniting Italy. The relationship between Cavour and Garibaldi was always fractious: Cavour likened Garibaldi to \\"a savage\\" while Garibaldi memorably called Cavour \\"a low intriguer\\". =Prime Minister of Italy= In 1861, Victor Emmanuel II declared the Kingdom of Italy, making Cavour Prime Minister of Italy. Cavour had many difficult issues to consider, including how to create a national military, which legal institutions should be retained in what locations, and especially the future of Rome. Most Italians thought Rome must be capital of a united Italy, but this conflicted with the temporal power of the Pope and also the independence of the Church. Cavour believed that Rome should remain the seat of \\"a free church in a free state\\", which would maintain its independence but give up temporal power.Holt, The Making of Italy: 1815‚Äì1870, p. 266; Beales & Biagini, The Risorgimento and Unification of Italy, p. 154. These issues would become known as the \\"Roman Question\\". Still Austrian Venetia was also a problem. Cavour recognized that Venice must be an integral part of Italy but refused to take a stance on how to achieve it, saying \\"Will the deliverance of Venice come by arms or diplomacy? I do not know. It is the secret of Providence.\\"Holt, The Making of Italy: 1815‚Äì1870, p. 265. A motion approving of his foreign policy passed by a huge majority, basically only opposed by left-wing and right-wing extremist groups. Creating Italy was no easy task, but ruling it proved a worse strain on the Prime Minister. In 1861, at the peak of his career, months of long days coupled with insomnia and constant worry took their toll on Cavour. He fell ill, presumably of malaria, and to make matters worse insisted upon being bled. His regular doctor would have refused, but he was not available; so Cavour was bled several times until it was nearly impossible to draw any blood from him. He was buried in Santena, near Turin. After his death, Italy would gain Venice in 1866 in the course of the Third Italian War of Independence, connected to the Austro-Prussian War. The Capture of Rome completed the unification of Italy (aside from Trentino and Trieste) in 1870. Legacy Garibaldi. Today, many Italian cities, including Turin, Trieste, Rome, Florence, and Naples, have important streets, squares, piazzas, and metro stations named after Cavour, as well as Mazzini and Garibaldi.Trevor James, \\"Out and About with Garibaldi.\\" Historian #123 (2014): 42‚Äì43. The clipper ship, Camille Cavour, the battleship Conte di Cavour, which fought both in World War I and World War II, and the new Marina Militare aircraft carrier Cavour is also named in his honor. In 1865, the Collegio dei Nobili, the oldest high school in Turin (founded 1568), and among the oldest and most prominent ones in Italy, was renamed the Liceo Ginnasio statale \\"Camillo Benso di Cavour\\" (Liceo classico Cavour).

Lisa is one of the most ardent proponents of the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique as can be seen in her lifelong dedication to sharing her knowledge about Michael Chekhov and his approach to acting. Career Lisa's professional career began in New York as one of the founding members of the Bond Street Theatre. Aside from acting, she also performed stunts while in New York, doubling for popular artists like Madonna and Cher, until she suffered a debilitating back injury in 1989. Notable film acting credits include ER, Carnivale, Inspector Mom, Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, and Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon. In 2011, she toured a solo performance of Anton Chekhov's The Darling, adapted and directed by Victor S. Tkachenko's, at the New York Fringe Festival after first premiering in Fort Worth, TX at the Pantagleize Theatre. Michael Chekhov Acting Technique During her time in New York Lisa trained with Ted Pugh who led her and a small group of actors in an exploration of the Michael Chekhov Acting Technique. These meetings eventually led to Ted's creation of The Actor‚Äôs Ensemble, a New York-based theatre company that still operates today. Under Ted's tutelage, Lisa was exposed to the first generation of Chekhov students through Beatrice Straight's Michael Chekhov Studio. It was during these training sessions that Lisa was introduced to Mala Powers, the Chekhov Estate Executrix. In the late 1980s Lisa moved to Los Angeles and began teaching the Michael Chekhov Technique with Mala Powers. During this time she studied under Michael Chekhov proteges George Shdanoff and Jack Colvin and met future NMCA co-founder, Wil Kilroy, a professor at University of Southern Maine. In 1993, Mala Powers, Lisa Dalton, and Wil Kilroy presented workshops on the Michael Chekhov Technique at the Association for Theatre in Higher Education (ATHE). This experience led the team to establish a formal association that could provide training in the Michael Chekhov Technique. In 1994 the National Michael Chekhov Association (NMCA) held its first official summer intensive during the University of Southern Maine's Summer Sessions. The program continued to grow in credibility, leading to its full accreditation from the State of Maine educational system for both Graduate and Undergraduate studies. =Proliferation of the Michael Chekhov Technique= Lisa has taken the Michael Chekhov Technique to theatre and acting conferences around the globe, teaching in the UK, Berlin, Brussels, Paris, the Caribbean, and around the US at various other Theatre Festivals, professional acting companies and colleges; she has shot and produced several hundred hours of video on the subject of Michael Chekhov, including interviews with some of his famous students and segments from Chekhov classes taught in Russia, Berlin, England, and the US; and her extensive writing on acting has been published in both online and print media. Conferences and Festivals Lisa has taken the technique to the South Eastern Theatre Conference (SETC). She was the Co-chair of the Screen Actors Guild Conservatory Actor‚Äôs Evenings at the American Film Institute in Hollywood from 1988-2006, the Central Region workshop leader for the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) for their Professional Actors Training program, 2006-2010, leading sessions in the Chekhov Technique, and is now an elected SAG-AFTRA board member for Dallas/Fort Worth, TX as of 2013. For 4 years she participated as a faculty member and judge for the Donna Reed Festival; 5 years for the International & State Thespian Conference; and 9 years at the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival, Regions 1,4,6,8, at each sharing her knowledge of the Michael Chekhov Technique to participants. =Chekhov Specific Conferences and Workshops= Lisa was the Creator/Artistic Director of the first two International Michael Chekhov Workshops in the United States at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Connecticut, 1998-1999. She participated as a faculty member at the Michael Chekhov International Workshop (MCIW) in Berlin, Russia, and London, 1992-1995.
