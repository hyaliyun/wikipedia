Bilateral relationships between the countries, which share a border, are very strong and Kyrgyz and Kazakh are very close in terms of language, culture and religion. Kyrgyz-Kazakh relationships have always been at very high level and economic and other formal unification of two countries have been greeted with strong appreciation by both nations since the two share a lot in common. Background Flag of Kazakhstan. Flag of Kirghizia. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were previously the republics of the Soviet Union. They began its existence as autonomous republics within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic before 1936 when it was split into Soviet republics of Kazakhstan and Kirghizia. During Joseph Stalin's rule, between 1930 to 1944, there were a number of ethnic groups such as the Kurds, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush or Balkars were sent to Kazakhstan or Kirghzia while nomadic Kazakhs were then deported from Kazakhstan. While the cultures and traditions were maintained, the nationalism rose during the late 1980s under Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika. In March 1991, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia participated in a referendum in an attempt to preserve the Union as a renewed federation of sovereign states. During the failed coup that happened in Moscow in August 1991, Askar Akayev and Nursultan Nazarbayev condemned the communist hardliners. Shortly after the events of the aborted coup, Kirghizia (renamed to Kyrgyzstan) and Kazakhstan declared their independence on August 31 and December 16 respectively before the final dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991 when it ceased to exist. Relations between the two countries began in 1992. Modern era On April 26, 2007 the presidents of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan signed an agreement to create an \\"International Supreme Council\\" between the two states. This historic event took place during an official visit of the Kazakh president to the Kyrgyzstan capital, Bishkek. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.

For some period in the mid-1990s, the virtual closure of Manas Airport at Bishkek made Kazakhstan's capital, Almaty, the principal point of entry to Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan's northwestern city of Talas receives nearly all of its services through the city of Taraz, across the border in Kazakhstan. Kyrgyz election of 2017 Almazbek Atambayev with Nursultan Nazarbayev. During the 2017 Kyrgyz presidential election, on October 7, 2017, president Almazbek Atambayev accused Kazakhstan of sponsoring and backing one of the presidential candidates. He also accused Kazakhstan officials for being corrupt by looting the pensioners income. Upon his disapproval, on October 9, Atambayev's office also announced that he was cancelling his attendance at an upcoming CIS heads of state summit in the Russian city of Sochi. An event that would have required the Kyrgyz leader to meet president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Due to the outlash, Kazakhstan border officials imposed a high-security regime at 6 pm on October 10, massively slowing down the passage of travelers and dispatched several truckloads of troops to the border and erected checkpoints. The troops are reportedly set to remain there until after Kyrgyzstan's elections are over. The Kyrgyz border service then replied with its own high-security regime two hours later.http://www.eurasianet.org/node/85511 In response to the allegations from Atambayev, the Kazakh Central Election Commission (OSK) declined an invitation to monitor the elections. Relations under Sooronbay Jeenbekov Relations under President Sooronbay Jeenbekov in the military sphere reached a new level, with Kazakh Defense Minister Saken Zhasuzakov becoming the first Kazakh military leader to visit Bishkek in July 2018.Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan to ink agreement in military intelligence sphere Economic relations Kazakhstan's direct investment in the Kyrgyz economy has been rapidly gaining pace since the early 2000s. Today Kazakhstan's economic presence is felt throughout northern Kyrgyzstan, from banks to small businesses, cars with Kazakh plates and numerous tourists. For the most, the Kyrgyz are welcoming these trends as both countries share a similar culture and traditions. During the last five years Kazakhstan invested about 400 million dollars in Kyrgyzstan and is considered the largest investor. Thirty- three percent of the total Kyrgyzstan bank's equity belongs to Kazakh investors. There are about 2,000 enterprises functioning in Kyrgyzstan, and 500 belong to Kazakh entrepreneurs. Kazakh-Kyrgyz unification is in the economic interests of both countries. \\"I do not see any problem in unification with another country. In the future we should unite with this or another state, anyway. Unification with Kazakhstan will be a good accelerator for our economic development,\\" said lawmaker Juraev. In 2007 the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev suggested the creation of a fund to facilitate Kyrgyzstan's economic development. However, the sides started implementing this project only in 2011. KKIF was created with a capital of US$100 million, fully funded by Kazakhstan. Its main objective is to render financial assistance to Kyrgyzstan's economy through implementation of the priority projects on its territory and effective development of small and medium businesses in Kyrgyzstan. In 2014, Deputy Secretary General of the Turkic- speaking states Cooperation Council (Turk-ssCC) Adakhan Madumarov spoke about the Great Silk Way project that would bring tourism to both Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

Askar Akayev later joined presidents Islam Karimov and Nursultan Nazarbayev in sending a joint intervention force to support Tajikistan's president Emomalii Rahmon against insurgents, but the Kyrgyzstani parliament delayed the mission of its small contingent for several months until late spring 1993. In mid-1995 Kyrgyzstani forces had the responsibility of sealing a small portion of the Tajikistan border near Panj from Tajikistani rebel forces. The greater risk to Kyrgyzstan from Tajikistan is the general destabilization that the protracted civil war has brought to the region. In particular, the Khorugh-Osh road, the so-called \\"highway above the clouds,\\" has become a major conduit of contraband of all sorts, including weapons and drugs. A meeting of the heads of the state security agencies of Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, held in Osh in the spring of 1995, also drew the conclusion that ethnic, social, and economic conditions in Osh were increasingly similar to those in Tajikistan in the late 1980s, thus recognizing the contagion of Tajikistan's instability.  Conflicts with Uzbekistan  Due to having conflicts with neighbor Uzbekistan, both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan raise supports for each others. During the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyzs, Tajikistan demanded Uzbek minority \\"to show respects on Kyrgyz laws\\".

Though it was issued as a full-priced album, many consider it not an original album as at the time it only contained two brand-new tracks alongside previously released material. It was issued on CD format for the first time in 2005 by EMI and contained several bonus tracks (see below). Track listing and song information Side One Side Two Side one of the Puppet on a String album begins with the title track, written by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter. They admitted to having written the song deliberately in the style of oompah band music in an attempt to curry favour in Continental Europe; for some time thereafter, British Eurovision entries would seem to be written in the style of continental European MOR or Schlager rather than other British MOR which was more similar to American MOR. Shaw had originally performed the song as one of five prospective numbers to represent the United Kingdom in the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest on The Rolf Harris Show. She had never been taken with the idea of taking part in the contest but her discoverer, Adam Faith had talked her into it, saying it would keep her manager Eve Taylor happy. Taylor was wanting to give Shaw a more cabaret appeal and felt that this was the right move - and also felt that it would get Shaw back in the public's good books as she had recently been involved in a divorce scandal. Of the five songs performed, \\"Puppet on a String\\" was Shaw's least favourite. In her own words \\"I hated it from the very first oompah to the final bang on the big bass drum. I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune.\\" She was disappointed when it was selected as the song she would use to represent the country. Shaw won the contest hands down, though it has always been felt that this was partly down to her existing popularity on the continent (she had recorded most of her hit singles in French, Italian, German and Spanish). As a result, \\"Puppet on a String\\" became her third Number One hit in the UK, (a record for a female at the time) and was a big worldwide smash (the biggest selling single of the year in Germany). An EP was later released in the UK entitled \\"Tell The Boys\\" containing the other four prospective Eurovision songs after fans expressed demands for them (though the title track had been used as the B-side to the \\"Puppet on a String\\" single). The second song on the Puppet on a String album was the ballad \\"Think Sometimes About Me,\\" written by Chris Andrews who to date had written all of Shaw's singles with the exception of \\"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me,\\" \\"I Don't Need Anything\\" and \\"Puppet on a String\\". \\"Think Sometimes About Me\\" had been released as a single in late 1966 but had only made Number 32 on the UK Singles Chart, her lowest position since her breakthrough. Song number three on side one was a new Andrews composition entitled \\"I Don't Think You Want Me Anymore,\\" and was followed by two more of his previously released numbers - \\"Keep In Touch\\" and \\"Stop Before You Start,\\" which had been B-sides to the singles \\"I Don't Need Anything\\" and the Top 20 \\"Nothing Comes Easy\\" respectively. \\"Keep In Touch\\" was released as a single in some territories, and reached Number 1 in Singapore in March 1967. Side one finished with \\"Hide All Emotion\\" (originally the B-side to \\"Think Sometimes About Me\\"), written by Marty Wilde. The opening song on side two is entitled \\"Tell The Boys\\" and was one of the five songs performed on The Rolf Harris show as a prospective Eurovision Song Contest representative. Shaw has since confessed that this was the song she most wanted to win. Written by Peter Callander and Mitch Murray, it was also used as the B-side to \\"Puppet on a String.\\" The rest of the album consists of Andrews-written songs, firstly \\"Don't You Count On It,\\" the B-side to the 1965 Top 10 hit \\"Message Understood,\\" and then a new song entitled \\"No Moon.\\" Next comes \\"Long Walk Home\\" (previously used as the B-side to the 1966 single \\"Run\\"), and then a brand new recording of \\"I'd Be Far Better Off Without You,\\" the original version of which had been an A-side for a short time in 1964 before being switched to B-side in favour of \\"Girl Don't Come.\\" The Puppet on a String album finishes with \\"Had A Dream Last Night,\\" the only Andrews song performed on The Rolf Harris show as a prospective Eurovision number. Though she liked \\"Tell The Boys\\" best of the five, Shaw felt that musically this was the best song. The Hives sing a different version on The Black and White Album. In 2006, \\"Puppet on a String\\" was used as a sample in the Lily Allen song \\"Alfie\\". 2005 bonus tracks * \\"I Don't Need Anything\\" * \\"Don't You Know\\" * \\"I'll Cry Myself to Sleep\\" * \\"Ask Any Woman\\" * \\"Quel Po' Che Mi Da\\" * \\"Nothing Comes Easy\\" * \\"So This is Love\\" * \\"If Ever You Need Me\\" As previously mentioned the Puppet on a String album was re-issued in 2005 by EMI after Shaw licensed her recording catalogue to them. Several of her other original albums were also issued around this time and all contained bonus tracks, though in some cases this merely consisted of a couple of foreign- language versions of a couple of the songs. Puppet on a String however contained many original songs as bonus tracks, firstly \\"I Don't Need Anything,\\" a 1967 single written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss (her first not to be written by Andrews since her breakthrough single \\"(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\\" in 1964, and coincidentally her biggest flop since then (it only made Number 50 on the UK Singles Chart). Next on the re- issue comes \\"Don't You Know,\\" an Andrews ballad, originally used back in 1964 as the B-side to the aforementioned breakthrough single. This is followed by the other two prospective Eurovision songs not found on the \\"main\\" album - \\"I'll Cry Myself To Sleep\\" written by Roger Webb and \\"Ask Any Woman\\" by James Stewart and Gerry Langley. The fifth bonus track is an Italian version of Andrews' \\"Don't Make Me Cry\\" (the B-side to the 1967 Top 20 single \\"You've Not Changed\\") entitled \\"Quel Po' Che Mi Da.\\" Bonus track six is the hit single \\"Nothing Comes Easy,\\" also written by Andrews which made Number 14 in 1966. Penultimate track is \\"So This Is Love,\\" another exclusive song by Andrews that was recorded in late 1967 but remained unreleased until the Nothing Comes Easy box set was released in 2004. The new version of the album ends with another Andrews penned song, \\"If Ever You Need Me,\\" originally the B-side to \\"How Can You Tell\\" in 1965.

Rubicon operate the first skateboard school in the United Kingdom and are the biggest and most active provider of skateboard lessons in the country. Based out of Winchester, Rubicon have regional instructors around the country including the likes of Tony Da Silva (Harmony Skateboards, DC Shoes, Note Skateshop). Other professional UK skateboarders who have worked with Rubicon include Greg Nowik and Callum Bowran (UK Freestyle Champion). Work Rubicon work primarily with children aged 6 to 18 through primary and secondary schools but have also established working relationships with dozens of county councils. They are unique to the UK not just for the size of their operations but also in the fact that they always travel to whoever wants to learn as opposed to being limited to working out of a single skatepark. A good reputation means they have worked with companies such as BSkyB (doing a Living for Sport programme to help children who feel disconnected from education get involved again through sport), the BBC (as part of their Blast Tour programme to engage children in creative pursuits) and the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme (skateboarding is now on the options syllabus and monitored by Rubicon). In total, the Rubicon team has provided over 500 lessons and demo's to circa 4000 children. Camps Rubicon Skateboards were also the first company to bring skateboarding-specific residential week long camps to the UK. Previously skateboarding had been included within other general sports weeks. Camps involve trips to a number of large parks and include daily tuition from the instructors. The 2008 camps are based near Coventry and will visit the Stoke on Trent Plaza and the Works Skate Park in Leeds. Sponsorship Rubicon sponsored the first ever Girls Skate Comp at NASS08. The National Adventure Sports Show is Europe's biggest action sports and music festival. Results were: Helena Long 1st, Sam Bruce 2nd, Lois Pendlebury 3rd with Sam picking up Best Trick with a frontside boardslide down the rail over the G gap into the bank. Rubicon sponsored the Winchester City Skate Jam on 7 June 2008. Recent news Rubicon Skateboards appeared in a wide selection of national press recently for their work with the Hampshire Police Force.

They were the reserve team of MSV Duisburg. History The reserve team was founded in 1958 by the club direction of Meidericher SV which was the name of MSV Duisburg before the city name \\"Duisburg\\" was supplemented in 1967. The intention was the possibility to keep and develop talented players who were not yet on the right level for the first team. In the first year, the reserve team could only take part in friendly games. Its official launch was the beginning of the season 1959‚Äì60. They started in the lowest league but were regularly promoted during the following years. An important person was the former player Wilhelm Schmidt who managed the team at this time. In 1968, the team was promoted to Verbandsliga Niederrhein which was the third highest division in the 1960s. This success was followed by the relegation in 1970. The time between 1968 and 1970 was the only period in which the team was on the third highest level of the current league system. Around 1970, MSV Duisburg played in the Bundesliga and was in a struggle with financial problems which was a reason for severe cuts in the budget of the reserve team. This resulted in a decrease into one of the lowest leagues and was followed by a slight stabilization in the mid-1970s. The team remained however in a local league until there was a new upswing starting in 1985. Under the direction of club president Dieter Fischdick who was elected in 1988 the reserve team regained an important role in the strategy of the club. An example for this is the installation of the first team player Ewald Lienen as coach of the reserve team in 1989. Lienen thereby started a successful coaching career. In 1992, they returned to Verbandsliga Niederrhein which had been degraded to the fourth level and then became the fifth level in 1994. The team changed between fourth and fifth level in the next years and had former European champion Bernard Dietz as a very prominent coach between 2002 and 2006. With the beginning of the season 2005‚Äì06 the name was officially modified from MSV Duisburg Amateure into MSV Duisburg II.Geschichte , msv- amateure.de.

It is spoken by a minority of the Danagla in the Nile Valley, from roughly the 3rd cataract (south of Kerma) upstream to the bend in the Nile near ed Debba. With population displacement due to the Aswan High Dam there are communities of speakers in eastern Sudan (Khashm el Girba). Dongolawi is an Arabic term based on the town of Old Dongola, the centre of the historic Christian kingdom of Makuria (6th to 14th century).

Nearly all Dongolawi speakers are also speakers of Sudanese Arabic, the lingua franca of Sudan. Arabic-Dongolawi bilingualism is replacive in the sense that Dongolawi is threatened by complete replacement by Arabic (Jakobi 2008). Dongolawi is closely related to Kenzi (Mattokki), spoken in southern Egypt. They were once considered dialects of a single language, Kenzi-Dongolawi.

He was the Constable of the Tower of London during much of the reign of Henry VIII. Among the notable prisoners he was responsible for were Queen Anne Boleyn, as well as the men accused of adultery with her. He was MP for Gloucestershire in 1529 and 1539. Life He was of a Gloucestershire family, settled at Painswick. William appears to have been a yeoman of the guard before June 1509. In 1512 he was an under-marshal in the army; went to the Spanish coast; was with Dr. William Knight in October of that year at San Sebasti√°n, and discussed with him the course to be pursued with the disheartened English forces who had come to Spain under Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. He fought at the battle of Flodden, was knighted in 1513, became sewer to the king, and later (1521) was carver. He was appointed High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1514‚Äì15. He seems to have been with Sir Richard Wingfield, the ambassador, at the French court early in 1520, for Wingfield wrote to Henry VIII (20 April) that the Dauphin took a shine to him. Kingston took part in the tilting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and was at the meeting with the Emperor Charles V in July. Henry seems to have liked him, and presented him with a valuable horse . For the next year or two he was a diligent country magistrate and courtier, levying men for the king's service in the west, and living when in London with the Black Friars. In April 1523 Kingston joined Dacre on the disturbed northern frontier, and with Sir Ralph Ellerker had the most dangerous posts assigned him; he was present at the capture of Cessford Castle, the stronghold of the Kers, on 18 May. He returned rather suddenly to London, and was made knight of the king's body and captain of the guard. On 30 August 1523 he landed at Calais in the army of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Surrey wrote from the north lamenting his absence. On 28 May 1524 he became constable of the Tower at a salary of ¬£100. He signed the petition to Pope Clement VII for the hastening of the king's divorce, 13 July 1530. In November 1530 Kingston went down to Sheffield Park, home of the Earl of Shrewsbury, to take charge of Thomas Wolsey. The cardinal is said to have been alarmed at his coming because it had been foretold that he should meet his death at Kingston. Kingston tried to reassure him, and was with him at the time of his death, riding to London to acquaint the king with the circumstances. On 11 October 1532 he landed at Calais with Henry on the way to the second interview with Francis I of France at Boulogne, and on 29 May 1533 he took an official part in the coronation of Anne Boleyn. He was elected MP for Gloucestershire in 1529 and 1539. He seems to have become prematurely aged, but continued to be constable. He received Anne Boleyn 2 May 1536, when committed a prisoner to the Tower, and with his wife, Mary, took charge of her and reported her conversations to Thomas Cromwell. To him Anne made sardonic jokes. The information he passed on to the King helped seal the fate of the Queen and the five men accused with her.p. 374, Eric Ives, Anne Boleyn Kingston's dispatches are today held as being one of the most important pieces of proof that Anne was entirely innocent, as were those who died with her. Kingston was made controller of the household 9 March 1539, and knight of the Garter 24 April following. He had many small grants, and on the dissolution of monasteries received the site of the Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire. He died at Painswick, Gloucestershire, on 14 September 1540. He was buried in the chantry chapel in a tomb of Purbeck marble. There were formerly monumental brasses to him and his wife, Elizabeth. Marriages and issue Kingston's first two marriages were to a wife named Elizabeth whose surname is unknown, and to Anne (n√©e Berkeley), the widow of Sir John Gyse or Guise (d. 30 September 1501), and daughter of Sir William Berkeley (d. 1501) of Weoley (in Northfield), Worcestershire, by Anne Stafford, daughter of Sir Humphrey Stafford of Grafton, Worcestershire, slain by Jack Cade 7 June 1450. By his first two wives Kingston had a son and daughter: *Bridget Kingston, who married Sir George Baynham (d. 6 May 1546) of Clearwell, Gloucestershire, son and heir of Sir Christopher Baynham (d. 6 October 1557). After the death of Bridget (n√©e Kingston), George Baynham married Cecilia Gage, the daughter of Sir John Gage (1479‚Äì1556) of Firle. *Sir Anthony Kingston, who married firstly, before October 1524, Dorothy Harpur, the daughter of Robert Harpur, and secondly, by 1537, Mary Gainsford, widow of Sir William Courtenay (d. 1535) of Powderham, and daughter of Sir John Gainsford of Crowhurst, Surrey. He had no issue by either marriage, but by a mistress had two illegitimate sons, Anthony and Edmund. He married thirdly, Mary (n√©e Scrope) (d. 25 August 1548), the widow of Edward Jerningham (d. 6 January 1515), and one of the nine daughters of Richard Scrope (d. 1485) of Upsall, Yorkshire, second son of Henry Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Bolton (4 June 1418 ‚Äì 14 January 1459). She was the sister of Elizabeth Scrope (d. 1537), who married firstly William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont, and secondly, John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, and of Margaret Scrope (d. 1515), who married Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk.A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: Sa-Sn , compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth- Century England (1984) Retrieved 26 May 2013.

It lies East of Suez and also the oldest British building in India. The church is popularly known as 'Westminster Abbey of the East'. History From 1639, when Madras was founded, until 1678, when Streynsham Master was appointed the English East India Company's Agent at Madras, religious services were conducted in the dining-room of the Factory House. It was at Master's initiative, and without the sanction of the Directors of the Company, that a subscription was started for the construction of the church. The sum collected amounted to 805 pagodas with the Governor and other officers contributing. Construction was started on 25 March 1678 - Lady Day, whereby the church acquired its name. The church was rendered the only bomb-proof building at the time, in the Fort, on account of a peculiarly designed roof, details of which are provided under Architecture. Construction was completed in the course of two years and the church was consecrated on 28 October 1680 by the chaplain Rev. Richard Portman. The ceremony was marked by the firing of small arms and cannon by the fort's garrison. On account of its peculiar roof-structure, the church was used as a barrack and granary between December, 1758 and January, 1759 during the Second Carnatic War, when the French besieged Madras and again when Hyder Ali invaded the town in the late 18th century. Architecture The architect of the church was either Edward Foule, Master-Gunner of Fort St. George, or William Dixon, Chief Gunner of the Fort, in 1678. The building consists of a nave and two aisles, with the nave protruding about 12 feet further than the aisles, thus forming the sanctuary. This extension was carried out in 1884 to house the choir. At the west end of the nave is a spacious gallery, resting on carved Burma teak pillars, which originally housed the seat for the Governor. In 1761, this was considerably enlarged to incorporate an organ, and provided with the two curved staircases, which still exist, to access the gallery from outside. In the nineteenth century, the gallery was reduced to its present size, and the organ removed later, in 1884, coincident with the building of the new sanctuary. Though it now has a tower to the west of the nave, this was not part of the original design but was rather added at the end of the seventeenth century on the orders of Sir John Goldsborough. The spire was added at the beginning of the eighteenth century and some old prints show the tower without the spire. The tower originally stood free of the church and was linked up with the main building much later. Two vestries at the east end of each of the aisles were built in the nineteenth century. St. Mary's Church, c. 1905 The internal dimensions of the building are 86 feet by 56 feet, with the outside walls 4 feet thick and the walls separating the nave from the aisles, 3 feet thick. The extraordinary thickness of the walls was to protect the building from attack and damage during storms. One of the unique and cunning features that was incorporated in its design was a bomb-proof roof approximately four feet thick and rounded in the manner of a wagon's roof, so as to cause cannonballs to ricochet. However, it must be kept in mind that the bombs it was designed to withstand were seventeenth century cannonballs. Also, wood was avoided as much as possible in the original design to obviate fires. Altar piece The altar of the church The altar piece, a depiction of the Last Supper, is unsigned but is said to betray obvious signs of the Raphaelite school, and it is supposed that Raphael himself painted the central figures. The altar piece was brought to Madras as part of the spoils of war by the British troops who stormed Pondicherry in 1761. Church-Yard Originally, no church-yard existed and all those who died in the fort were buried in the Guava Garden, that adjoined the Governor's House in the 17th and early 18th centuries. This grove was located where the High Court of Judicature, now stands. During the second siege of Madras by the French, in 1758-'59, the British were put to great difficulties by the fact that the French were afforded shelter from bullets and shells by the tombs. Therefore, on the petition to the Select Committee of Sir John Call, the Chief Engineer of the fort, the cemetery was re-located to the north-west of the island, while the tomb-stones were brought and placed around the church. Some of them were again removed during the investiture of the fort by Hyder Ali, when they were used as gun-platforms. It was not until 1807 that they were re-collected and restored to their former position around the church. When the Capuchin Church of St. Andrew was demolished subsequent to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, many of the tomb-stones were brought here, thus explaining the large numbers of Roman Catholic grave-stones, inscribed in Latin and Portuguese. Important ceremonies and burials List of notable people buried at the Church This ancient prayer house solemnized the marriages of both Robert Clive and Elihu Yale. He was a governor of Fort St. George, and a vestryman and treasurer of St Marys Church. His later gift of money to Cotton Mather helped in the foundation of Yale University in the United States of America. On 6 October 1968, the 250th anniversary of the naming of Yale College for Elihu Yale, the classmates of Chester Bowles, then the American ambassador to India, donated money for lasting improvements to the church and erected a plaque to commemorate the occasion. Among those interred within the walls of the church are four other governors of Fort St. George ‚Äì Sir Thomas Munro, Bt., George, Lord Pigot, the Rt. Hon. Vere Henry, Lord Hobart and Sir Henry George Ward. Numerous memorial-plaques and monuments exist within the church of which two, that of Sir Barry Close, who was Adjutant General to Gen. George Harris at the Siege of Seringapatam, and gave his name to Closepet, and that of Lt. Col. Joseph Moorhouse, who was killed at the Siege of Bangalore, in the Third Anglo-Mysore War, would be of particular interest to the historian. Bird artist Elizabeth Gwillim (d. 1807) is also buried here.

She has been noted for a flourishing popular music career under Communism, and evolved from teen pop to rock music. Career Zalatnay was born with the name Charlotte Sacher; her family later adopted Hungarian naming conventions and her official name became Zalatnay Sarolta. She appeared on stage for the first time in 1963, using the nickname Cini. In 1966, at age 18, she finished in second place in the Hungarian Television song contest T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l, with the song \\"Hol j√°r az eszem?\\" (\\"Where is My Mind Running?\\"). During this period she worked with the backing bands Bergendy Egy√ºttes and Metr√≥. In 1967 she appeared in the contest again and finished in first place with the song \\"Nem v√°rok holnapig\\" (\\"I Am Not Waiting Till Tomorrow\\"), on which she was accompanied by the Hungarian rock group Omega. Thanks to the relatively lenient travel restrictions managed by the Communist-era Hungarian government, Zalatnay was able to tour England in 1968‚Äì69. While there she became acquainted with the Bee Gees, and had a brief personal relationship with Maurice Gibb. She again won the first prize in the T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l contest in 1971 with \\"F√°k, vir√°gok, f√©n\\" (\\"Trees, Flowers, Light\\"). By this time she had moved into rock music, with a singing style that has been compared to that of Janis Joplin; Zalatnay is known to have attended a musical festival featuring Joplin during this period. Furthermore, a vocal cord operation during this period changed the tone of Zalatnay's voice, allowing her to tackle grittier rock songs. She later worked frequently with Metr√≥ member K√°roly Frenreisz, who assisted with songwriting and production. Frenreisz's hard rock-oriented bands Locomotiv GT and Skorpio provided backing for Zalatnay's albums in the early 1970s. Zalatnay's first full-length album, Ha Fi√∫ Lehetn√©k (If I Could Be a Boy), was released in 1970 and featured a cover on which Zalatnay transformed from a teen pop star to an adult rock singer. Her frequent changes of image and attitude during her rock music period have been compared to the similar strategy used later by Madonna. Her 1973 album Hadd Mondjam El (Let Me Tell You) received attention from international rock critics. During her most successful musical period, she also performed small roles in several Hungarian films. Later critics and journalists speculated that Zalatnay could have achieved international stardom were it not for the Communist-era restrictions on popular music, notwithstanding the relatively lenient strictures of her native Hungary. Zalatnay's music career slowed down in the 1980s when Hungarian fans moved on to new genres of Western music. She released the autobiography New vagyok en apaca (I‚Äôm No Nun) during this period. By the 1990s, she had become a post- Communist political activist in Hungary, as a board member of the Felicity Party and chairman of the Hungarian Animal Protection and Nature Federation. Zalatnay's music remained relatively unknown outside of Hungary until the release of a self-titled compilation in 2007. The compilation gained the notice of Western rock critics, who were inspired to evaluate Zalatnay's place in rock and pop history. One such reviewer called Zalatnay one of the most important entertainers of her nation and era, noting that her music was impressively varied and often ahead of its time. Another reviewer stated that Zalatnay adapted typical American rock music into the Hungarian milieu, with an acid rock/blues sound and particularly powerful vocals. By this time, Zalatnay's musical career had been largely forgotten in Hungary, and her personal life and appearances on Hungarian reality TV were mostly of interest to local tabloids. The 2007 compilation revived interest in her music and she resumed live performing. In 2017, she returned to the Erkel Theatre in Budapest, the site of her early performances for T√°ncdalfesztiv√°l, for a seventieth birthday concert. Personal life Zalatnay in 1978. In 1968 Zalatnay had a short relationship with Maurice Gibb. In 1974 she married S√°ndor R√©v√©sz of the Hungarian rock band Piramis but they later divorced. Her second marriage was to L√°szl√≥ Benedek in 1987, and they had a daughter in 1989. In 1995 she married for the third time, to pornography director M√°rton Csaba. Csaba persuaded her to pose nude in Playboy at age 53 in 2001. In 2004, she was sentenced to three years in prison for tax fraud. She served 16 months, and was released on parole in 2006.

Often accompanied by Navy Underwater Demolition Teams and the early division recon companies, these amphib recon platoons performed more reconnaissance missions (over 150) than any other single recon unit during the Pacific campaigns.Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942‚Äì1945, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). They are amongst the patriarch lineage of the Force Reconnaissance companies which still continue providing force-level reconnaissance for the latter Fleet Marine Force. Their countless efforts have contributed to the success of the joint-Marines/Army maritime landing forces assigned under the Navy fleet commanders during the island-hopping campaigns of the numerous atolls in the Pacific. Their trademark of amphibious techniques utilized insertion methods under the cover of darkness by rubber boats, patrol torpedo boats, Catalina flying boats, converted high speed destroyer transport ships, or APDs, and submarines for troop transports.Chief of Naval Operations, Dictionary of American Fighting Ships, Vols 1‚Äì7 (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1968). These Marines applied skills in topographic and hydrographic surveys by charting and measuring water depths, submerged coral heads, and terrain inland; taking photographs and soil samples for permeability for amphibious tractors and landing craft parties. Their assignments included scouting or reconnoitering a planned, or potential landing site, and intelligence-gathering missions. These teams also evaluated the beaches looking for exits off the hostile beaches inland, for contingency measures if the Marine landing force were to necessitate a retreat. Most importantly, they compromised the locations of enemy forces, their strengths and weakness, and other importance in the follow-up of an amphibious assault. Early history The United States' earliest doctrine in amphibious reconnaissance was introduced by naval intelligence officer Major Dion Williams, who divided preliminary reconnaissance between those concerned with the sea to the shoreline to be conducted by the naval beach demolition units, and those concerned with the beach and adjacent land, the recon Marines. Technical expertise was required in surveying, cartography, and recording observations, as well the ability to interpret various types of hydrographic and topological data from previous surveys. Dion Williams stated‚Äî :\\"In order to prepare intelligent plans for the attack or defense of a harbor or bay, it is necessary to have at hand a comprehensive description of the hydrographic features and accurate charts showing the depths of water at all points, the reefs, rocks, shoals, and peculiar currents which constitute dangers to navigation, and the tributary streams and channels which may form avenues of attack or furnish anchorages for a portion of the floating defenses or auxiliaries of the defenders.\\"Dion Williams, USMC, Naval Reconnaissance, Instructions for the Reconnaissance of Bays, Harbors and Adjacent Country, (Wash, D.C.: GPO (1906). American naval doctrine of 1927 continued to emphasize reconnaissance for planning as well as reconnaissance to verify the soundness of formulated plans and reconnaissance during the last phases.The Joint Board, Joint Action of the Army and the Navy, F.T.P. 155 dtd 1927, (Wash, D.C.: GPO, 1936). This three-stage concept of intelligence gathering remained in effect throughout World War II when the V Amphibious Corps directive listed the following phases of reconnaissance: #Prior to the completion of operation plans for landing, information is sought for preparation of plans in sufficient time prior to the operation to avoid the loss of secrecy which may be incurred by reconnaissance executed shortly prior to an attack. #Between completion of plans for the landing and the actual embarkation of a landing force, further information necessary for the execution of the plan is collected such as late data on the enemy's strength arid dispositions. #During the last days prior to Zero-D-Day or further information is sought of the enemy's dispositions and strength as well as movement of his reserves.V Amphibious Corps, Corps Training Memorandum Number 26-44, Reconnaissance in Amphibious Operations, dtd March 28, 1944; HistDiv, HQMC, Archives 62A-2086, Carton 20, File \\"Reconnaissance.\\" Early reconnaissance activities were generally confined to surveys of various ports, uncharted islands and contiguous waters performed by officers qualified in survey technique. Some nautical charts to this date of infrequently encountered areas and islands still bear annotations indicating they were compiled by officers of various American ships. The duty of an intelligence officer aboard American ships was usually filled by the senior Marine Corps officer aboard. The most profound war prophet that lived was perhaps Lt. Colonel Earl H. Ellis. Ellis was a United States Marine Corps Intelligence Officer, and author of Operations Plan 712: Advanced Base Operations in Micronesia, which became the basis for the American campaign of amphibious assault that defeated the Japanese in World War II. Ellis' prophetic study helped establish his reputation among the forefront of naval theorists and strategists of the era in amphibious warfare, foreseeing the eminent attack from Japan leading to the island-hopping campaigns in Central Pacific twenty years before the United States entered World War II. He is sometimes credited in being the 'first' recon Marine in the United States due to a secretive spy mission in the Pacific, reporting the build-up of Japanese naval forces. Fleet Landing Exercises During the Fleet Landing Exercises in the Caribbean in the late 1920s, Marines aboard the Navy vessels and submarines developed the joint-Navy/Marines' amphibious tactics. Most of the practiced beachhead landings amalgamated into what is known today as the Fleet Marine Force from the different types of units that became necessary for the Marine Corps to project itself to shore for the seizure of littoral areas of the world. Prior to the establishment of the United States Marine Corps' first division-sized organization, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet approved the training plan for the Fleet Marine Force in 1934 along the shores of Culebra, Vieques and Puerto Rico in a series of Fleet Landing Exercises, or FLEXs. Initially in the beginning of the exercises, the Marines and their equipment were transported by two US Navy battleships, the and Wyoming (BB-32), and one Navy transport ship, the . They made their beach landings from fifty-foot whaleboats, climbing down cargo nets hung over the sides while biplanes provided smoke screens. A-frames were built to lower cargo and heavy equipment into the whaleboats, such as artillery pieces and tactical vehicles. As each year, the FLEX has made improvements and modifications, the Fleet Marine Force Headquarters were moved to San Diego, California, in 1936. By 1938, submarines from Submarine Squadron 11 were used for practice in covertly disembarking small, recon landing teams of Marines onto the beaches, providing intelligence of their opposing team during the exercises. By movement under darkness of the night, they paddled their aircraft-type rubber boats, deflating them once on shore and re-inflating them to rendezvous back to the submarine at an appointed location.W.H. McKelvy, Jr., CO Company F, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines, \\"Report of Operations during Puerto Rico Campaign, 2‚Äì3 March 1938. The Navy converted 'four-stacker' destroyer ships by removing two of the stacks and its boilers to provide spacious room for the Marines and their equipment. These modified ships were vintage old destroyers from the early 1920s, reclassified as high speed destroyer-transports, or APDs. By early World War II, the newer, faster and more modern class of destroyer escorts were substituted as an updated version class of APDs, which were later used extensively by the recon Marines and the Underwater Demolition Teams. Initially the recon teams paddled to shore until later, outboard motors were added. Plus, \\"Higgins Boats\\" and other modified landing crafts were introduced, towing the rubber crafts closer to shore. Due to all the trial and error from the FLEXs, the 'Fleet Training Publication 167' was adopted as a proven doctrine for landing operations. Amphibious reconnaissance was expanded to include location of enemy defenses and their positions, its troops' strengths, weapons and obstacles. It also covered topography, hydrography and the ever-so important beach exits to permit the landing crafts to get off the beaches. Most of the material in the FTP 167 were also introduced and included in the 'Landing Force Manual': :\\"... directed effort by personnel landed from seaward by any means to collect the information on a coastal area required for the planning and conduct of amphibious operations... a landing conducted by minor elements, involving stealth rather than force of arms for the purpose of securing information, followed by a planned withdrawal.\\" Organization Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet In December 1941, a joint-Army/Marine unit, the Observer Group, was formed as a specialized small-scale amphibious raiding party to conduct reconnaissance of the beachheads of Europe and North Africa, with Captain James Logan Jones as the commanding officer of the Observer Group. Jones's Group (Observer Group) was the first unit to be specifically trained as an amphibious reconnaissance asset in the United States military. By January 7, 1943, the Commanding General of Amphibious Corps, Major General Holland M. Smith disbanded the Observer Group and activated the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, Expeditionary (Corps) Troops, Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF), at Camp Elliott in California. The new structure, however, still remained small as a company-size element as it consisted of a headquarters and service platoon and four reconnaissance platoons. Each of the recon platoons were commanded by a lieutenant and consisted of two six-man squads. These platoons were tailored with appropriate military attire and equipment for the amphibious patrol, which included light- weight armament, tennis shoes or other noiseless shoes, and no insignia worn on clothing. Other mission-essential equipment were knives, rope, and adhesive tape. The Table of Equipment (T/E) was only that which was essential and can be easily disposed. The total Company consisted of six officers and 92 enlisted Marines.Table of Organization, D-817, promulgated by Commandant of the Marine Corps ltr 2385-60, AO-246-vah, 21 December 1942. 2nd Lieutenant Merwin H. Silverthorn, Jr.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/mhsilverthornjr.htm joined the Company in February 1943 as the assistant intelligence officer of ACPF Amphibious Reconnaissance Company. He served simultaneously as the Company's executive officer (XO), Officer In-Charge (OIC) of Plans and Training (G-3) and as a platoon commander. One of the training areas used by the Company included the northernmost section of Camp Pendleton, Tent Camp 3, an area which not only provided excellent terrain for training, but a messing facility as well. This illegally constructed mess hall had been erected by the previous ACPF's XO, Jimmy Roosevelt (the son of the late president Franklin D. Roosevelt). When discovered by the higher echelon later, it almost cost James Jones a court-martial until it was disclosed that Jimmy Roosevelt had built it and the charges were dropped. For the next nine months the Company trained in the United States to perfect their new techniques as well as training and assisting in special duty with two United States Army units for amphibious reconnaissance missions, the Alaskan Scouts which was later cited for its performance in the campaigns of Attu and Kwajalein, and Alamo Scouts, which was employed at the landing of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands. For this purpose, the Company departed in July for special duty in Adak, Alaska, and Kiska, 01‚Äì23 August 1943, resuming regular duty back at Camp Elliott on 25 August 1943. Fifth Amphibious Corps By late 1943, so many Marines had poured into the Pacific campaign that on August 25, 1943, Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner arrived in Pearl Harbor re-designated the \\"Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet,\\" to the V [Fifth] Amphibious Corps, or VAC, with General Holland Smith acting as the Commanding General. Subsequently, the amphib recon Marines of \\"ACPF Amphib Recon Company\\" made their new organizational titular change to \\"Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, VAC\\", or dubbed VAC Amphib Recon Company. General Holland Smith, however, only assumed command of the VAC for only one month before being reassigned to Task Force 56 (Expeditionary Force / Troops) of the United States Fifth Fleet. Thereafter, General Smith only acted as adviser to Jones's Amphib Recon Company, under authority of the Marine Commandant and Admiral Turner. The newly reorganized \\"VAC Amphib Recon Company\\" added one additional reconnaissance platoon (for a total of five) before being relocated to their new-wartime quarters from Camp Elliot, CA to Camp Catlin in Oahu, Hawaii, to prepare for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. During Operation Galvanic the submarine landed a force of 78 Marines of the amphib recon company to seize the island of Abemama on 21 November 1943. On the morning of 25 November, a native reported to the Marines that the remaining Japanese committed seppuku.p.30 Rottman, Gordon L. US Special Warfare Units in the Pacific Theatre 1941-1945 Osprey Publishing 2005 Fleet Marine Force, Pacific Departing the Mariana Islands after the Battle of Tinian on August 9, 1944, VAC Amphib Recon Battalion returned to Hawaii on August 20 and was redesignated as FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion, the Fifth Amphibious Corps (VAC) shifted its parent command under Fleet Marine Force, Pacific (FMFPac). The Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion made its title change into the \\"Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, VAC, FMFPac\\" on August 26, 1944. =Company to battalion= After the events of the operation in the Gilberts and Marshall Islands, the VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company was infused with new replacements and took advantage of lessons learned in recent combat. On January 3, 1944, the Company reported their actual on-board personnel organization a strength of seven officers, 101 enlisted Marines, and two Navy Corpsmen; slightly over the intended strength due to the attached mortar section of 2nd Lt. Boyce L. Lassiter, and twenty-two of his enlisted mortarmen. While Jones's Amphib Recon Company was the sole company involved in recon missions at the 'Amphibious Corps-level' [force-level], the staff of the V Amphibious Corps was aware of their limited availability due to their size of personnel, organization and equipment. Lt. General Holland Smith recommended to Marine Commandant A. A. Vandegrift that he expand the recon company to a battalion; thus allowing additional flexibility and continuity for assignment of missions. Less than a week after the return from the Marshalls, the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, Amphibious Corp, Pacific Fleet (ACPF), was expanded and reorganized into VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, ACPF, being activated in Hawaii April 14, 1944. The two recon- company battalion Table of Organization (T/O) was approved and authorized on April 28, 1944, recommending the Battalion be commanded by a major, which promoted commanding officer James L. Jones Sr. from captain to the rank of major. In general, the battalion consisted of two companies, Company A (ALPHA) and B (BRAVO). The two companies comprised a weapons platoon made up a mix of twenty mortarmen and machine-gunners, and a headquarters company of six officers, forty-two EMs and thirteen Navy corpmen; making 303 men in all. Lieutenant Merwyn Silverthorn remained as the company XO shortly until being replaced by a more senior Capt. Earl Marquardt. Silverthorn then assumed command of Alpha Company; 1st Lt. Russell Corey took command of Bravo Company. 1st Lt. Leo B. Shinn moved into the battalion's small headquarters. In June 1944, two staff non-commissioned officers were recommended for field promotion to second lieutenant and were acting as platoon leaders in lieu of the two officers' vacancy billets. Additional communicators and radios increased the communications sections, plus additional mission-essential gear were scrutinized to obviate the prior necessity of \\"scrounging for gear\\" to get ready for their next operation. By June 30, the battalion was fully trained, equipped and in the field. The battalion headquarters detachment had a projected operational date of 15 July 1944. Captain Jones was temporarily assigned duty in May 1944, with 1st Battalion 2nd Marines, 2nd Marine Division, aboard en route to Saipan where he participated in the action against the enemy 16‚Äì19 May 1944. After a brief return to Pearl Harbor, he returned to Saipan 16‚Äì30 June 1944. World War II-era Three days after the attack of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese occupied the Gilbert Islands, and built a seaplane base on Makin that provided a token defense of Tarawa. They left a small number of Japanese Coastwatchers on Apamama, along with a few other atolls, to observe Allied forces in the South Pacific. It was after Carlson's Raiders that attacked Makin in August 1942 when the Japanese began to fortify and reinforce Tarawa, the largest and most strategically important atoll of the Gilberts. General Holland Smith mordantly blamed the Carlson raid for the rapid Japanese buildup and allegiantly felt, even after his retirement, that instead of subjecting heavy Marine casualties during the horrific and bloody seizure, Tarawa should have been avoided. The joint amphibious force commander, Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, who was an effectual amphibious tactician, wrote a staunch dissertation over the mistakes during the Battle of Tarawa. Preeminent among the lessons scrutinized were that more and better aerial reconnaissance, more ships, landing crafts, amphibious tractors (or LVTs), and LCI Gunboats were needed. Three times the bombardment used at Tarawa in addition to increased pre-D-Day attacks by aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers was extremely necessary. But above all, more use of submarine (periscope) reconnaissance was vital to pre-D-Day landings. Aerial photography, submarine periscope photography and hydrographic reconnaissance by recon Marines and Navy UDT teams became part of the array of intelligence assets that were worked into the operation plan for the invasion. At the time, periscope photography was still new. Only a few ship captains had made single shots of sinkings, but Admiral Turner and General Smith were in need of more detailed and definitively located photographs of the beaches arranged in precise panoramic sequence. These would show enemy machine-gun and anti-boat gun emplacements as well as the locations of topographic features. Aerial photographs would be used in conjunction to provide a detailed photo interpretation. Undoubtedly the most significant employment of reconnaissance in World War II occurred at Tinian. Far more important than the reputations which hung in the balance among the very top planners, were the thousands of lives undoubtedly saved as a direct result of reconnaissance efforts. Pre-D-Day reconnaissance was limited because of Vice Admiral Turner. He was cautious about acknowledging Saipan as the main initial target. Also, he had also declined all pre-D-Day amphibious reconnaissance at Tarawa, which in hindsight, led to the controversial topic of whether his lack of prepared pre-D-day amphibious reconnaissance contributed to the high casualty rate of Marines. The seizure of the Ogasawara archipelago and the Volcano Islands were outlined in the OCTAGON Conference in September 1944 between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the Combined Joint Chiefs of Staff. Due to General Douglas MacArthur's landing on Leyte, it made modifications to the Combined JCS initial directive for General MacArthur to further seize Luzon on the targeted date of December 1944 and Admiral Chester Nimitz to provide cover and naval support by seizing the Bonin Islands, or the lesser Volcano Islands, on or about January 20, 1945 and Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands on or about March 1, 1945. Both the islands of Formosa and Amoy were to be bypassed due to their physical size, close proximity to Japanese air strikes and the large, substantial numbers of the Japanese Marines that were heavily fortified in the area.George W. Garand and Truman R. Strobridge, History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II; Vol. IV: Western Pacific Operations (Historical Branch, G-3 Division, HQMC: 1971). Admiral Nimitz chose Iwo Jima instead of ChiChi Jima for seizure, the largest islet in the Volcano Islands. He acknowledged that it would provide airfields for the P-51 Mustangs, to escort the B-29 Bombers for bombing Tokyo on mainland Japan, traveling north from the newly acquired airbases on the islands of Saipan and Tinian. The operation of Iwo Jima, codenamed DETACHMENT, was given to Admiral Spruance and RAdm Hill by Admiral Nimitz. Iwo Jima was going to be the only major battle for 5th Marine Division, Task Force 56 (Expeditionary Troops) as a division-in-whole during World War II; however, half of the new 5th Division was formed by the enlisted Marines from prior engagements from other units. Iwo Jima was the most heavily fortified island in the Japanese defenses, making it the bloodiest and costliest campaign in Marine Corps history. With news that the United States was delayed in the Iwo Jima operation, due to the support of Luzon and the campaigns in the Marianas, the Japanese took advantage of the opportunity in reinforcing their strength by attaching the 109th Infantry Division and adding heavier beach-defense weapons, artillery and tanks. Emperor Hirohito himself selected Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a brilliant battle-hardened cavalry officer, as its commander. The mission for Okinawa was given the codename ICEBERG. Operation ICEBERG was clarified when Admirals Ernest King and Chester Nimitz, Army's LtGen. Simon Buckner, commander of landing forces and LtGen. Millard \\"Miff\\" Harmom of the Army Air Corps met in San Francisco, CA, for finalization of the invasion plans. L-Day was set for April 1, 1945. The United States' Field Army, commanded by LtGen Buckner, divided it into two corps, the III Amphibious Corps consisting of 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions; and the Army's XXIV Corps consisting of the 7th, 77th and 96th Infantry Divisions. Although the conflicts on Okinawa only lasted for three-plus months vice the five months for Guadalcanal, it proved to be one of the longest and most costly operations in the Central and South Pacific, involving six divisions and almost six times the naval shipping of Guadalcanal.Bevan G. Cass, History of the Sixth Marine Division, (Wash., D.C.: Infantry Journal Press, 1948). The US Navy lost on average of one-and-a-half ships daily, also making it the costliest naval involvement in the history of sea warfare.Joseph H. Alexander, Storm Landings: Epic Amphibious Battles in the Central Pacific, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1997). Night offensive action by the amphib recon Marines, not the normal practice during the earlier actions of World War II, was emphasized during the Okinawan campaign as the Marines conducted 21 night patrols and attacks, 13 of which were by the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion. For its last actions on Okinawa, the FMF Amphib Recon Battalion returned to Pearl Harbor on September 12. Five days later, the battalion was disbanded and the bulk of its troops were sent to the replacement battalion at Pearl Harbor. The majority of them left for the United States aboard the LST 761.Nelson Donley, 'Unpublished chronology of his diary #2, Operations of Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, VAC, III AC, FMFPac. The Gilbert Islands On September 13, 1943, when Jones arrived to VAC in Hawaii, he was handed further orders stamped CONFIDENTIAL to report to the large, mine-laying submarine for temporary duty on September 15, 1943: :\\"Pursuant to authority which may not be quoted herein, you will stand detached from Marine Barracks, Camp Elliott... on September 10, 1943... reporting upon arrival to the Commanding General, Fifth Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, for permanent duty beyond the seas.\\"'In personal papers of Col.

Jones Jones and Army Captain D. L. Newman reported to the commanding officer of the submarine , Commander William D. Irwin, on September 16, 1943, at the submarine base in Pearl Harbor during their Sixth War Patrol ‚Äì under the orders of Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, who was commanding the amphibious assault, and wanted them to conduct periscope reconnaissance and produce panoramic photographs of all the beachheads of Tarawa, Kuma, Butaritari, Apamama and Makin. They became so proficient that the submarine's commanding officer purchased Submarine Combat Patrol insignias for Jones and Newman. They were not, however, presented, but retained by Commander, Submarine Squadron Four, Charles B. Momsen, since the policy of the Bureau of Naval Personnel was to award the insignia only to Navy personnel. William U. Irwin wrote to Captain Jones: :\\"It is regretted that this award cannot be made to you as it is felt that you gave of your fund of knowledge of the military aspects of the mission and participated in its successful completion.\\"Charles Momsen, ComSubRon FOUR: Ser. 263, February 17, 1944, SUBJ: Submarine Combat Insignia, FC5-4/Pl5).‚ÄîCharles Momsen, letter to Chief of Naval Personnel On October 16, 1943, USS Nautilus returned to Pearl Harbor after eighteen days of periscope photography and briefings were begun to prepare the Company for their first mission in the Apamama Atoll (codename BOXCLOTH), becoming the first recon unit to perform amphibious reconnaissance in the Gilbert Islands. A message was received indicating probable Japanese troop buildup on Apamama. General Holland M. Smith conceived the concept of operations, reasoning that it would be best to land scouts on the main island of the Apamama Atoll by submarine to reconnoiter enemy positions before committing any sizable force. Jones's VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, along with three recon platoons, re-embarked USS Nautilus, except the 4th Platoon which had set out on a separate mission detached to the 27th Infantry Division for the raid on Makin Island. Several additional officers were attached to the company, including supernumeraries reporting to Jones, Lieutenant George Hand, an Australian from the Ocean Island Defense Force, as guide and interpreter. Lt. Hand had lived many years in the South Sea Islands and knew how to speak the native language, Gilbertese. Lieutenant E. F. Crosby, nicknamed \\"Bing\\", who was a Navy Civil Engineering Corps officer from the 95th Naval Construction Battalion assigned to make preparatory surveys, was to determine the location and suitability of an airfield. And Major Wilson Hunt from the 8th Base Defense Battalion was assigned to select gun positions on the atoll for the occupying force that was scheduled to come from Tarawa in a few days. Jones' Company departed Pearl Harbor, November 8, 1943, or D-Day 12, for Apamama. By the next day, November 9, 1943, shakedown was completed and a shipboard routine prescribed for the troops and to the galley, as well as cleaning the compartments. Two troop lookouts supplemented the lookouts from the ship's company, enabling each Marine enlistedman and officer to be topside approximately once every 36 hours. However, due to the proximity of enemy air bases, the routine arrangement was discontinued on November 16. Also, it was necessary that personnel on the bridge be limited, should an emergency dive be required. Each day while at sea, the entire crew of the Nautilus and the embarked Marines assembled onto the deck for briefings of their mission in the Gilbert Islands. The officers distributed small, scaled charts of the Central Pacific, and operational maps of Apamama were being discussed in detail with questions by the troops concerning the mission. A coding board was formed by the troop's officers to assist the ship's communications officer in decoding the rather heavy traffic received each night. A course in the Gilbertese language and customs of the natives was being instructed by Lt. George Hard. Although the Marines had some difficulty in learning the language, the instructions in customs later proved to have been of great value: :\\"... the advice given by Lt Hand as to the treatment of the natives, being carefully followed by the troops, resulted in not one case of friction developing between the troops and the natives during the six days the company was on the atoll.\\"Col. James Jones, Commanding Officer, Recon Co., VAC, Action Report, GALVANIC, Encl. (H), HistDiv, HQMC, 6514-4559, Box 9, Folder A6-9. ‚ÄîInterview of James L. Jones, Commanding Officer, VAC AmphibRecon Co., 8 June 1975. The Nautilus arrived onto Johnston Atoll on November 11, 1943, for emergency repairs. This gave a chance for the Marines to exercise for 45 minutes, which momentarily provided them some aid of comfort due to extensive time being in small, cramped submarine compartments. They arrived at Tarawa on 18 ‚Äì November 19. During a reconnaissance patrol, they discovered an eleven-degree compass error in the old British charts for the entrance into the Tarawa Atoll. Quickly, their Command Ship produced modified charts. This navigational correction, unbeknownst to the future task force in occupation of Tarawa, would serve crucial in their survival. While they were periscope reconnoitering Tarawa, Nautilus received an order for a rescue mission, to observe the waters for any downed naval aviators that were shot down during the bombardment of the island. As the Marines were monitoring the surf while the submarine crew was searching the waters for any pilots, a Japanese shore battery fired upon Nautilus and forced her to dive. The submarine approached the island while remaining submerged and observed the island from less than 1,000 yards by periscope. A strong current made it impossible for the Nautilus to remain underwater and had to resurface, while the shore battery was still intact. No further incidents occurred with the shore battery, however, and by 1930, the strong current dissipated to allow Nautilus to re-submerge. Meanwhile, the rescue mission was canceled and Nautilus continued to proceed south to Apamama. Commander Irwin was maneuvering on the ocean surface to avoid the reefs and ensure clearance, clearing the passage between Betio and the atolls to the south, until radar contact was made with an 'unidentified contact' approaching at 25 knots. He assumed it would not likely be any Japanese Naval forces; and since both his battery and air supply were low and the reef was shallow, Irwin decided not to submerge as precaution. As he readied his recognition signals, the 'contact' opened fire, which were the cruiser and destroyer , a nearby American naval task force, Task Force 53 led by Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill. They both picked up Nautilus on radar and due to low visibility, they feared it to be a Japanese patrol vessel and Hill gave orders to open fire. Unfortunately, the canceled recovery mission for the downed pilot hadn't been passed on to other ships in the vicinity, including Rear Admiral Hill's Southern Attack [Task] Force. Despite the precise marksmanship, the minatory projectile fortunately failed to explode. Mixed reviews have been made on whether or struck Nautilus. In the account of historian Samuel Eliot Morison, he claims that a five-inch shell from Ringgold struck Nautilus. According to the Marines on board the submarine, they clarified that it was a six-inch shell after examining it while they were back at Pearl Harbor. Thus it had to be from the main battery of the Santa Fe.Capt. Charles E. Patrick, original member of Observer Group, interviews with Bruce F. Meyers; Force Reconnaissance Association Reunions, San Antonio, TX, 24 September 1999 and Louisville, KY, 21 September 2001. Nonetheless, water deluged down into the conning tower hatch, the gyroscope ceased to function, the main induction was flooded, and only immediate application of efficient damage control averted serious trouble. The submarine dove to 300 feet to make necessary repairs, although there was no place itself to hide from the averted dangers from the two ships' friendly fire. It didn't severely hinder the submarine; Nautilus continued southbound through the night en route to Apamama, the company's first combat reconnaissance mission. Apamama became perhaps the only atoll in history to be captured from a submarine. =Tarawa, November 1943= On November 20, the D-Day for Tarawa (codename HELEN), First Lieutenant William D. Hawkins's 2nd Marine's Scout-Sniper Platoon, a recon- type unit, was the first to land at Betio of South Tarawa. In an assault scouting role, they secured the island. Other than the periscope photography made by Captains James Jones and D. L. Newman, there had been no prior amphibious reconnaissance landings on Tarawa. Although Jones's Amphibious Reconnaissance Company hadn't participated in the reconnaissance of the Tarawa Atolls, Jones's and Newman's photographs became paramount and made a success of the beach landings for the Marines in the assault on Tarawa. In addition, the adjacent atolls of Abaiang, Marakei and Maiana were landed on to inspect for fortifications, supplies or recent occupation. =Makin, November 1943= The D-Day for atolls of Makin was the same day of Tarawa on November 20. 4th Platoon of VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company detached with 27th Infantry Division for the Makin Operation. First Lieutenant Harvey C. Weeks, a practicing attorney and Yale graduate from Kansas City (before the war), commanded the platoon. Being his first combat operation, his platoon was augmented with a rifle platoon and a machine-gun squad from the United States Army's 165th Infantry Regiment. The combined force occupied Kotabu, a reef- infringed islet guarding the entrance to Makin Atoll's lagoon. They landed unopposed and it later denied its use to the Japanese during the United States Army's assault of Makin Island. The 4th Platoon later assisted the 165th Infantry in the mop-up on Butaritari. By November 23, 1943, Makin was formally declared secure. Lt. Weeks arrived back to Pearl Harbor and joined up with the rest of Jones's company, which too had come back from a mission in the Apamamas. =Apamama, November 1943= Operation Boxcloth, the reconnaissance beachhead landing on the Apamama Atolls, or Apamama was the first initial amphibious reconnaissance conducted by the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company. The Apamama recon and seizure of this atoll is considered the 'classic' example of a submarine recon, initially stealth, which evolved into a very successful reconnaissance-in-force. In the late afternoon of November 20, 1943, the submarine USS Nautilus arrived off the coast of Apamama. Remaining submerged, the submarine circumnavigated the atoll examining the islands through the periscope, noting the entrance to the lagoon that was ringed by Entrance Island to the south and Abatiku on the north. Apamama Atoll was chosen for part of Operation Galvanic because of its large lagoon which could provide a base for logistic support to facilitate the western movement of the Pacific Fleet from Pearl Harbor.George C. Dyer, The Amphibians Came to Conquer: The Story of Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, (Wash, D.C.: GPO 1971) Codenames were given by the planners for the seizure of Apamama, each a word for the six islets. STEVE for main Apamama Island, forming the northern and most northeastern part of the atoll, and going clockwise; OSCAR, OTTO, ORSON, JOHN, and lastly JOE, which was adjacent to the mouth of the lagoon where Entrance Island is located. Their orders were to scout out the islands by using the cover of darkness; to determine the strength of the defending Japanese forces and select potential beaches for a planned landing for an occupying American force which was following in a few days. The unit was accompanied by Australian Army Lt George Hand formerly of the Ocean Island Defence Force acting as an interpreter. They reached JOHN at approximately 1400 on November 20 and Jones and his officers had taken the opportunity to observe the preferred beach landing through the periscope. The plan was to have Jones's company to land onto JOHN at its southern tip of the atoll. Commander Irwin committed the submarine to remain submerged until 1930, and as the battery power was almost depleted from the day-long dive, it was necessary for her to run to the south while charging her batteries so that she would be able to dive if forced down by enemy action. It became apparent that it was desired to hit the reef near half tide, and as high tide was at 2353, this made it necessary to choose the time of midnight to 0030, November 21, for disembarkation. Captain Jones, Lt. Hand and Lt. Crosby (the Navy CEC Engineers), and Major Hunt, along with rest of the company of sixty-eight Marines, ten Army bomb disposal combat engineers, minus Lt. Weeks's 4th Platoon (which was on a mission in the Makin Islands), inflated six ten-man sized rubber boats, or LCRLs, and loaded their equipment and wet-docked off the submarine.Capt. James R. Stockman, The Battle for Tarawa, Historical monograph. Wash., DC.: Historical Division, HQMC, 1947. Each man was handed three K-rations, one D-ration, and two fragmentation grenades. There were 45 rounds for each M1 carbine, 48 rounds for each M1 Garand rifle, 260 rounds for the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (or BAR), and 2000 rounds for each M1919 Browning machine gun as well as eight 511 SCR radio sets, two TBX-8 radio sets (that were similarly used by the Navajo Code Talkers), two blinder guns, six sets of semaphore flags and four 14\\" x 26\\" panels. Only able to start four outboard motors out of the six, they cruised towards JOHN. About halfway, two more outboard motors had quit and the Marines ended up towing and paddling the others to shore. Running into squalls and fierce currents, two boats of Marines disappeared into the darkness while Marines on the others frantically paddled to avoid the razor sharp coral reef. The wind subsided about an hour later and the two missing boats joined the column as they rendezvoused 400 yards off the reef. At 0330 they landed; by then the men were already exhausted and torn up by the coral. Prior to the main landing, 1st Lieutenant Leo B. Shinn, the Platoon Leader of 1st Platoon, proceeded with Lieutenant Harry C. Minnear, Platoon Leader of 2nd Platoon with eighteen men as an advance party toward the beach in two boats. Since the reef was too shallow for navigation, the boats halted, men fixed their bayonets, and Lieutenants Shinn and Minnear went ashore on a hasty reconnaissance to determine whether the beach was defended. After establishing a hasty semi-circular defense on the beach, one two-man patrol was dispatched to the right while Lt. Minnear remained in charge at the landing point and Lt. Shinn sent one man to the north to determine where they had landed. It was then apparent the current had diverted the Marines from their primary objective, JOHN, and had landed off the southwest corner of JOE instead. Recon of Apamama Atolls, VAC AmphibRecon Company, 21‚Äì26 November 1943. With no enemy in sight, at 0440, the remainder of the advance party was called in by runners and signals. 1st Lieutenant Merwyn H. Silverthorn, the Company's Executive Officer, along with ten army engineers and a light machine gun section, established the beachhead and command post (CP). Machine guns were emplaced with interlocking fire, the squad of engineers established a semi-circular defense, fields of fire were cut, and hasty field fortifications were built. Boats and equipment were brought off the beach and reef and camouflaged.lstLt M. E. Silverthorn, Jr., War Department, Action Report, GALVANIC. Encl. (H), HistDiv, HQMC, 6514-4559, Box 9, Folder A6-9. While the beachhead was being secured and coded panels emplaced to communicate to the submarine, Captain Jones immediately sent three platoons out at 0530 as a reconnaissance-in-force around the west end of JOE Island. Lieutenant Corey went north to the lagoon shore with his 4th Platoon. Lt. Minnear took his 2nd Platoon west towards the western end of the small island. Shinn's platoon went north and east towards reaching the northeast corner of the island at 0700. A camouflaged seagoing Japanese landing barge, diesel-powered and fully fueled was discovered moored in the channel between JOE and JOHN. Immediately after, Shinn's Marines spotted two Gilbertese natives crossing the channel from JOHN. Concealed and observing, they noticed two natives coming down a trail. Not knowing whether they were friendly, the recon Marines crouched and waited until they were practically on top of them. Lt Hand (who was in Shinn's patrol) sprang up and greeted the natives in their own language. Using their best Oxford \\"missionary\\" English, the grinning natives replied, :\\"Why Mr. Hand. My word! I am glad to see you, but were you wise to visit us just now, Mr. Hand? The Sapanese are here!\\" [Gilbertese pronounced js like ss in English]. The two natives informed Hand that the Japanese were entrenched in force around a radio station on OTTO, one islet away. They described the Japanese defenses as being reinforced positions using coconut logs and reported that their weapons included two light machine guns, one heavy machine gun, rifles, bayonets, pistols and hand grenades. Also, there were twenty-five Japanese Marines, fewer than the number of the United States Marines, but were well dug in and \\"had plenty of ammunition\\". Three Japanese had been at the boat at 0600 that morning. They had radio equipment and were headquartered on OTTO Island. The Japanese were a coast-watching detachment left behind when the original Japanese occupying force of about 300 which had landed in September 1942, departed about a month later. The natives weren't reluctant in giving information as the Japanese had made extensive use of native labor with little or no compassion and had been generally oppressive toward them.lstLt Leo B. Shinn, War Department, Action Report, GALVANIC. Encl. (H), HistDiv, HQMC, 6514-4559, Box 9, Folder A6-9. Also, they also informed Lt. Hand that the Japanese knew they [Americans] were on the island and were in preparation. They remained in the vicinity of the boat to keep it under surveillance; the patrol divided, the second and third platoons moving south along the reef passage to the southeast tip of JOE Island. Shinn returned to the CP and reported his findings. Jones dispatched 1st Lt. Russell Corey's 3rd Platoon at noon to put the Japanese barge out of commission without permanently disabling it by removing the spark plugs from the engine and made accelerator adjustments. The barge was the only means for the Japanese to escape to the north. The Marines moved out along the road to the boat in a staggered squad column with point and flankers. About two hundred yards away, a Japanese patrol of three men were encountered who were already at the barge. Under fire, Corey's BAR man, Pvt Homer J. Powers, killed one with an offhand shot while the other two escaped into a nearby grove. Back at the command post (CP), a new word came in from the natives that the Japanese had gathered all their weapons and were moving rapidly to the barge site. At 1300, Captain Jones with all available Marines, First and Second Platoons, moved out to join Lt. Corey and the light machine gun section (who had just put the boat out of commission) at the road junction just west of Kabangak Village, to interdict the Japanese at the barge. Corey's 3rd Platoon joined Jones with the 1st and 2nd Platoons at 1400. The Japanese obviously passed through Kabangak village on JOHN, learned of Jones's presence, turned around and returned to OTTO to reoccupy their prepared defensive positions. Captain Jones began a reconnaissance-in-force, moving across ORSON, the island just south of OTTO, occupied by the Japanese. While en route contact was made with large numbers of natives leaving their villages for the groves. A Catholic Mission was reached by 1550 and the five white missionaries, three French Roman Catholic priests and two Australian nuns, verified the natives' information concerning the Japanese positions and strength. The Apamama natives informed Jones of a sandspit at the tip of OTTO opposite the mission, running northwest from ORSON, from which the Marines would be able to observe the lagoon (western) flank of the Japanese defenders, and to avoid crossing the bridge that connected the two islands, OTTO and ORSON. As Jones moved his entire company of Marines across the reef to the tip of the sandspit on ORSON, Japanese rose from higher terrain to the north of the advancing Marines and opened fire with light machine guns. One Marine killed one of the defenders at one hundred yards. When the lead elements of the company had advanced 250 yards up the sandspit, the company came under a barrage of fire from a nest of light machine guns emplaced from their eastern (right) flank, the coconut log positions on the south end of OTTO. The Marines found themselves in an unfavorable position for an attack and could not locate the position of the machine gun, while under fire with only one hour of daylight left and facing a rising tide, which was due to come in another hour. It would force the Marines to remain on the sand spit all night from where it would have been impossible to contact the submarine. Jones broke off contact and withdrew his company to the northern beach of ORSON. While en route back to their beachhead, Jones paused in Kabangak village and questioned the Catholic Mission. By midnight, his Marines were exhausted; they had not slept for 48 hours and were in a state of extreme fatigue, especially having endured the events aboard the Nautilus prior to the landing, the heavy surf, and the reconnaissance through very heavy brush. Furthermore, they made several attempts to communicate with the Nautilus but to no avail since it had submerged earlier after making a radar contact with a Japanese submarine 3500 yards away; the Marines were unable to communicate results of the first day of their reconnaissance. They decided to rest and set up defensive positions and bought additional supplies from the natives. Also, they had learned that one of the Gilbertese natives was a pilot and obliged to guide arriving troops on JOHN or through the lagoon, but only once they were able to contact Nautilus, until then, they waited while under vigilance for any unsuspecting Japanese forces. At 0300, the Marines spotted lights out at sea and disappeared, believing it to be a Japanese submarine trying to contact the Japanese defenders, but with no attempt to evacuate them from the atoll. By the next morning on November 22, 1943, the Marines had control of JOE and JOHN and were able to prevent the Japanese from escaping from the atoll. Lieutenants Hand and Crosby and Major Hunt made their own recon to the south end of ORSON and located an abandoned Japanese truck. This permitted them to rapidly reinforce anywhere along OTTO's beaches. Their rubber boats were heavily damaged in crossing the coral reef from their initial landing a few days back; they were in no shape to be used to envelop their movement by sea to out-flank the Japanese machine gun defense. Gunnery Sergeant Charles Patrick took a small patrol up the seaward side of ORSON to see if they could flank the Japanese from the other side, but in the process, one of his Marines came under fire and was wounded. The Japanese had powerful 31\\" glasses and could observe all movement and also had accessible motor transport, enabling them to move along to any point on ORSON or STEVE, making a landing behind their position by rubber boats not advisable. This determined that crossing the channel between ORSON and OTTO, they would suffer a great number of casualties. They decided that additional firepower would suffice as it would be required to move troops across the open reef. By 0700, the 1st and 3rd Platoons furnished camp security and cleaned weapons. Jones then gave the 1st and 3rd Platoon a mission to investigate the Japanese barge to determine whether it had been tampered by the enemy since they last were there; and also to reconnoiter-in-force along the road to the vicinity of the mission and the area across the reef passage from the main Japanese defenses. Meantime, the 2nd Platoon transported all the Company's equipment and supplies from their old to their new beachhead, completing their movement at 1245. The 3rd Platoon led off at 1330 to complete Jones's objectives but was terminated to join the 1st Platoon as they moved in to establish a defense. A squad was dispatched to investigate the Japanese boat and returned at 1430 to report that all was secure. The Marines believed they had been spotting a ship off from NICK, presuming it to be Japanese. The 2nd Platoon and the Machine Gun section were prepared for a bombardment and to repel any enemy landing. It was later identified as a United States salvage tug.lstLt Harry C. Minnear, Action Report, GALVANIC. Encl. (H), HistDiv, HQMC, 6514-4559, Box 9, Folder A6-9. Also in the excitement, Lieutenants Corey and Shinn marched to the lagoon and surveyed the horizon with binoculars and spotted several objects which appeared and resembled ships. Due to the changing conditions of the visibility of atmospheric changes, they seemed to disappear and reappear. Corey and Shinn radioed the information to Captain Jones. Jones and his Marines standing by were convinced; after careful and lengthy observance, a native was called over and interrogated and it was learned that the objects were a beacon and several lone palm trees on the islets on the opposite side of the lagoon. At 2030, Captain Jones finally made radio contact with Nautilus and conferred with Commander William D. Irwin, the ship's captain, providing him with the results of the day's reconnaissance; requesting him to relay the situation with the arrangement of new supplies so the reconnaissance force could remain ashore 15 more days. Together they devised a plan of shell bombardment with the submarine's six-inch guns on the enemy position the next day. They were able to ferry fifteen days' worth of provisions and ammunition to the beach, brought in by using the ship's motor whale boat and four LCR-l0s. The landing of supplies was completed by midnight. Between 0100 and 0900, on several occasions, blinker lights were observed at sea, assumed to be from the Japanese submarine endeavoring to contact their garrison force ashore. On November 23, the third day since the initial reconnaissance landing, the 1st and 3rd Platoons reconnoitered JOHN and STEVE from 0700 to 1615. The Marines enjoyed their first hot meal at noon as stew made from dehydrated carrots, potatoes, onions, and roast beef. Once the two platoons returned from recon patrol, Jones and his entire company marched forward to the channel between the islands 150 yards from the Japanese fortifications. 1st Lieutenant Silverthorn and four Marine from 2nd Platoon took Major Hunt and Lieutenant Crosby with ten Army engineers and made a hasty beach reconnaissance, to reestablish a beachhead on the south side of the channel. Crosby made a soil test and examined the coral mud on the lagoon-side of the island, checking soil permeability for a feasible airstrip. The recon Marines emplaced machine guns in the center of their line and at 0800, they laid a base of fire onto the Japanese positions. They radioed Nautilus and request naval gunfire support from their six-inch deck gun. Jones returned to his Marines and issued the orders for the attack. Prior to their disembarkation, Nautilus and the recon Marines developed a coded display system in the event of radio communication problems by using four twelve-by- sixteen-foot navy mattress covers to double as signal panels. One configuration would indicate \\"situation in hand,\\" while others would advise specific needs, i.e., \\"ammo\\", \\"water\\", and other necessities. Usually front lines were marked by colored air panels or painted oars. But on Apamama, the four mattress covers were significantly used as banners and later provided the Marines' current line positions to the submarine. Relying on the navy mattress covers that the Marines had hung in the palm trees to use for signaling, Nautilus fired a barrage of seventy-five rounds with super-quick fuses from four thousand yards at sea. These rounds would burst from the air as they would hit the palm fronds at the top of the coconut palms. This proved effective for the Japanese that were in the open but not for any Japanese seeking shelter in their coconut log bunkers. The crew on Nautilus discovered that one of their six-inch guns was malfunctioning in the elevating mechanism and would slip, causing the shell to over-shoot great distances from their intended target. On their own initiative, they commenced a check-fire on that gun. However, Corey radioed to the submarine requesting a full check-fire as the rounds were falling very close to his lines. Since the naval gunfire had not appeared to have an effect on the heavy Japanese fire, Captain Jones ordered a cease-fire. Jones requested by radio to Nautilus, that it was decided that a supply of mortars would be the obvious solution to tamper the effects of the Japanese machine gun emplacements. Nonetheless, heavy machine gun fire prolonged mostly throughout their third day. As long as the men would lay prone, most of the rounds would go over their heads. Heavy enemy machine gun fire pinned down the crew of Lt Corey's Machine Gun section and it was impossible to move gun or crew. Pvt Carroll E. Berry and Pvt James E. Hensley of the crew had their canteens and hip pockets torn by the enemy fire. One of the recon BAR Marines, PFC William D. Miller, was hit by two machine gun bullets while in an exposed position. In an audacious effort under intense fire, Private Bert B. Zumberge attempted to rescue him. While attempting to render first aid and tried to shield PFC Miller with his own body from the enemy machine gun fire, Zumberge was also hit. Twice in the upper left arm, between shoulder and elbow, one bullet fracturing his arm. He continued to render first aid as Sgt Samuel F. Lanford helped Zumberge to cover after much protesting from Zumberge that Miller first be moved. But Miller was badly hit and could not easily be moved. Sgt Lanford returned to remove PFC Miller; enemy fire became increasingly heavy. PFC Miller was hit twice more and it became impossible to get to him, and two of the company's Corpsmen James E. Fields and Morris C. Fell exposed themselves several times trying to retrieve Miller. PFC Harry J. Marek was wounded by an accidental discharge of a BAR in their established beachhead area, taking a round in the chest. Corporal John F. King had developed a severe hernia while unloading supplies the previous night. Jones made contact with the Nautilus at 2000 and evacuated PFC Marek and Cpl John F. King through the surf by rubber boat. Marek later died and was buried at sea. By noon, while Jones was awaiting the arrival of his requested mortars, Nautilus radioed to him that the American transports were at the WEST PASSAGE and suggested that Jones meet them in the whaleboat. Jones broke off the firefight and consolidated his positions. He decided to coordinate with the approaching naval Task Force that arrived as the island occupation force. He sent Lt. Shinn with the 2nd Platoon back to the 3rd Platoon with orders to assist their withdrawal. Captain Jones had taken a small group with him, Major Hunt, Lt. Crosby, Lt. Hand, George, the native pilot, and Sgt Daniel J. Bento and started across the lagoon in the whaleboat for the Task Force at the WEST PASSAGE, a three-hour boat trip. They saw a number of transports, two hospital ships and numerous escorting men-of-war ships. As they were about one-half hour, all the ships of the task force left the area. About from the Task Force, Hunt spotted the 'feather' of a submerged periscope from their position. The submarine made no moves toward the small party, so they returned to the atoll. No physical contact was made with the approaching task force. Meanwhile, Shinn arrived at 1245 and informed Lt. Corey that the 1st and 2nd Platoons were pulling back, returning to the beachhead. Corey's machine- gunners were receiving heavy fire, however, making it impossible to extricate them, and the Lieutenant decided to pull them out. Shinn departed, leaving one squad with Corey and taking Pvt Zumberge along. While Jones and his small group had moved to the WEST PASSAGE to contact the task force, a US Navy destroyer appeared on the other side of the atoll. Lt Silverthorn went out to DD-608 and gave her captain a description of the situation which in return sent a small landing party to offer them naval gunfire support agreeing to shell the enemy Japanese positions. By this time, Jones and his small group returned. Corey radioed Captain Jones at 1315 that he was not pulling out until he could move his machine-gunners and wounded, and would remain until dark if necessary. At 1330 he dispatched a patrol under Sgt Lanford went to see if it were possible to pull out the machine gun and PFC Miller. The enemy fire had slackened considerably. Sgt Lanford returned with the Machine Gun crew and PFC Miller, who unfortunately had died as a result of his wounds. Pvt Zumberge was evacuated to USS Gansevoort by Lt. Silverthorn's rear CP along with Pvt Dannie O. Messenger who had been shot while returning to the CP from an outpost at 0500. Lt. Corey's group reached camp by 1700. The destroyer moved out to fire on the enemy positions between 1800 and 1900 and fired many rounds of five-inch shells into the enemy position. Jones had the destroyer fire some fifty rounds. The fire hit the coconut palms causing air burst (exactly Nautilus's firing routine earlier) except that this time it proved quite effective and agreed to continue its use the following morning on the Japanese positions. PFC Miller was buried early in the morning of November 25, 1943, at the site of the second beachhead CP. Most of the day was spent clearing fields of fire and building field fortifications since at 0730, natives had arrived informing Jones that some of the Japanese were dead and they had left their positions, leaving behind two wounded. Captain Jones dispatched Lt Shinn's First Platoon to guard the Japanese boat and whaleboat, and anticipating that the enemy would make an attempt to attack the beachhead or break through to their boats, strengthened the beachhead defenses. Lt Shinn's men altered the whaleboat to render it temporarily useless. At 1400, an English-speaking Apamamese boy puffing a cigarette that Lt. Hand had given him appeared, shouting \\"The Saps are all dead.\\" He had secluded himself near the Japanese radio station and observed the remaining Japanese that survived the Navy/Marine gunfire. The garrison commander, a Japanese Captain, assembled his troops in two ranks and was giving them an oration to motivate his troops. The Japanese captain brandished a samurai sword in one hand and waved a pistol in the other, urging them to \\"Kill all Americans!\\" During his violent gesturing the pistol accidentally discharged, shooting himself in the stomach, killing him. Completely demoralized, the Japanese troops began digging their own graves; when they were done, they lay down in them and shot themselves in their jaws, committing mass suicide. Captain Jones dispatched his executive officer, Lt. Silverthorn and Lt. Corey with two platoons to investigate. When they arrived at the Japanese CP at 1700, they confirmed the death of the twenty-three dead Japanese defenders in all. It was difficult for them to understand why they committed suicide; near each individual firing position were several hundred rounds of ammunition, and from ten to forty hand grenades. Also lying about were approximately a dozen rifles, ten pistols, two light machine guns, and one heavy machine gun. An examination of the position revealed that the Japanese had fire superiority despite their inferior numbers. The area included the radio station, officers' quarters, QM shed, boat shed, numerous huts, and live chickens. No articles were touched and all men were cautioned about touching any of the many wires. The Marines began to bury the dead with help from the Apamamans. At 0700 on November 26, 1943, the Marines sighted the , , and escorting ships closing in on the beachhead. While Jones was launching a boat, a plane dropped a message inquiring whether it were safe to land troops. Jones replied affirmative and continued out to USS Harris to contact Lieutenant Colonel McLeod, Commanding Officer of 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines. India Company was dispatched and landed without incident. An officer from USS Maryland arrived with an order from division ordering Jones' Marines to embark USS Harris at once. Camp broke at 1030 and all expendable gear turned over to Captain North, Commanding Officer of India Company as the Recon Marines departed Apamama and the natives that had helped them so well. The Marine recon losses on the Apamama operation were two killed, two wounded, and one injured. Brigadier General Leo D. Hermle, Assistant Division Commander of the 2nd Marine Division landed with the 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines and assumed occupation duties. An eight-thousand-foot airstrip was carved out of Apamama's coral by the Task Force's Naval Construction Battalion. By January 15, 1944, this airstrip was being used by heavy bombers to the Marshall Islands for continuation of the attack. Captain Jones was later awarded the Legion of Merit by Lieutenant General Holland M. Smith for this impeccable amphibious reconnaissance operation.Copy of Legion of Merit Medal citation, Medals and Decorations Branch, HQMC. The Marshall Islands Planning in the Gilbert Islands was successful but highly costly during Operation GALVANIC. In December 1943, a modified plan was made to neutralize the inessential islands in the Marshall Islands, the atolls of Jaluit, Wotje, Maloelap, and Mili. There was also the need to seize Kwajalein, the main Japanese naval base in the Marshalls. The Joint Chiefs of Staff gave approval; D-Day was changed to January 31, 1943, resulting from Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz and Admiral Raymond Spruance acquiescing to Turner's recommendations. The operation was given the codename FLINTOCK, permitting the assembly of sufficient combat shipping to accommodate two divisions, and all participating ships, aircraft and ground elements increased preparations. Following their successful seizure of the Apamama Atoll with the conjunction of the Tarawa operation in November 1943, VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company returned to Pearl Harbor for training, weapons upgrading and replacement of the two Marines killed; preparing for their next objectives, reconnoitering the atolls in the Marshalls. LtGen Holland Smith, the VAC Commander, was convinced that Jones's company could repeat the same success seizing Majuro and Eniwetok as they had in the Apamamas. The Majuro Atoll (also known as 'Arrowsmith' Atoll) lies southeast of Kwajalein, consisting of fifty-six islets that were adequate for long airstrips along the lagoon that is long and up to wide, with a total of of lagoon area highly suitable for a fleet anchorage. The islands are ringed by an enclosing reef on the seaward side of the islets. First Lieutenant Harvey C. Weeks of the 4th Platoon and his reinforced platoon of forty-two men landing on Calalin Island in the Majuro Atoll, were the first Americans to land on territory that was held by the Japanese prior their attack Pearl Harbor; since many islands were occupied thereafter by the Japanese. This honor, however, was given in error to the Army Scouts of the 7th Infantry Division for their landing on Kwajalein five hours later. Since the Army Scouts were trained by the VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance personnel, it didn't tarnish any mixed feelings, and they shared their honor. The 7th Scouts were subsequently commended the Presidential Unit Citation. =Majuro, January‚ÄìFebruary 1944= Majuro was one out of four attack groups operating in the landing beachhead assault during the greater Operation FLINTOCK. Admiral Spruance initiated the operation in the Majuro to secure additional air and sea bases as it possessed the largest potential fleet anchorage in the Central Pacific.General Gordon Sullivan, USA, Chief of Staffs, Eastern Mandates: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II, NARA. The Majuro Atoll consists of fifty-six islets along a lagoon that is long and up to wide ringed by a reef on the seaward side of the islands. The main island of Majuro was long, thin and enclosed on the southern side of the lagoon. Over fifty-six codenames were used on the islands that made up the Majuro Atoll, or codename SUNDANCE. Captain Jones's company was involved in the pre-planned reconnaissance. They landed only on the northern islets of Calalin (LUELLA) and Eroj (LUCILLE), considered entrance islands to the lagoon; Uliga (ROSALIE) and Delap (SALOME), the western portions of the atoll; the main island of Majuro (LAURA), running 10 miles (16 km) west-to- east along the southern end of the atoll; and Djarrit (RITA). On January 21, 1944, VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, with the addition of 1st Lt. Harvey C. Weeks's 4th PlatoonLt. Harvey C. Weeks, War Diary, Operations of Reconnaissance Company on SUNDANCE ATOLL, (HistDiv, HQMC: Mar 16, 1944); 65A-5188, Box 2, Folder A19-10-VAC, OpnRpt (Encl 1), ReconCo Rpt 2l Jan-02 Feb, 1944. (which returned from a mission in the Makin Atoll), embarked on at the destroyer escort docks in Pearl Harbor for amphibious reconnoitering of the Majuro Atoll. Attached to the company was Lt. George Hard, Ocean Island Defense Force, as guide and interpreter (who was present during the Apamama operation previously); Mr. William Mueller of the Gilbert Islands, also as interpreter; and Staff Sergeant Schlosenberg and Technical Sergeant Szarka from Corps Public Relations. USS Kane, along with VAC, departed Pearl Harbor on January 23, 1944, and rendezvoused with Task Force 51, or the Majuro Attack Group, on January 24. As soon as the ship cleared the channel, the ship's captain gave a briefing of the predetermined mission en route to Majuro over the public address system and cartographs were distributed among the officers and Marines. A preliminary discussion of the mission and detailed plans were given of the approaching operation and familiarization of the topography of Majuro (SUNDANCE). Kane remained with the convoy until 2200 on January 29, 1944, to proceed alone to SUNDANCECapt.

Kane harbored at a point thought to be 5000 yards seaward from LUELLA Passage, at 2030, nine hours prior to the main attack force. Before an advanced landing party was about to set off to shore, they discovered that an error had occurred in navigation, due to misinterpretation of the island profile. The group reembarked Kane and proceeded northward approximately 12,000 yards to their corrected position toward LUELLA. Arriving at their planned location at 2130, Jones dispatched Weeks's and his nineteen Marines of the 4th Platoon, reinforced by eleven mortarmen from a Mortar Platoon commanded by 2nd Lieutenant Boyce L. Lassiter. The lesson was learned that having attached mortarmen was paramount, after their experience during the previous Apamama Operation, codename BOXCLOTH. There were eight headquarters personnel with one Corpsman and interpreter. Each recon Marine carried one-third of a K-ration and D-Ration, two fragmentation grenades and 45 rounds of .30 Carbine ammunition for their M1 carbines (or) 48 rounds of .30-06 ammunition for the M1 Garand rifles (or) 280 rounds of .30-06 per Browning Automatic Rifle, determining who was assigned to which weapon. Weeks and his Marines of the 4th Platoon disembarked from Kane; twenty men and two officers loaded onto one Higgins landing craft while the remaining ten loaded onto two rubber boats, which were towed in line astern to the Higgins boat. During the first 2000 yards, due to heavy seas, the towing rings were pulled out of both rubber boats and the Marines attempted to maintain the movement by grasping the towline and bracing their feet against the rubber cross pieces. Two Sergeants, James B. Rogers and Blackie Allard, were pulled into the sea with full combat gear with un-inflated life preservers. After Allard was retrieved, Cpl Cecil W. Swinnea, a Texan, inflated his own life preserver and tossed it as a lariat to Rogers who was retrieved several minutes later. All the men were subsequently transferred to the Higgins boat, which barely floated with the additional weight. Despite the fact that several Marines fell overboard, at 0400, the main landing party landed on LUELLA with all their men safe and no adherent loss to their troops. By midnight, at 2330 on January 30, Weeks's recon team landed on the beachhead, and immediately he sent Lassiter and sixteen men to reconnoiter the adjacent islet of LUCILLE. Embarking on a rubber craft, they trekked across the separating passage. It was extremely difficult because of shallow reefs and poor visibility. Splitting into five patrols of three men each, Lassiter's team landed on LUCILLE at 0230. Meanwhile, at 0030, Weeks continued to reconnoiter the remaining island of LUELLA. While Lassiter faced no findings of any enemy contact nor presence on LUCILLE, they returned to Lt. Weeks's party and they rendezvoused back with USS Kane informing Captain Jones their retrieved information. By 0200 on January 31, 1944, Kane and the rest of VAC Amphib Recon Company reached their position approximately 3000 yards southeast tip of ROSALIE to coordinate a small landing on SALOME for reconnoitering. An advanced landing team, led by Silverthorn, scouted first to cover the landing and set up a command post while signaling to the main landing craft remaining adrift from Kane, using hooded flashlights‚Äîtwo long dashes separated by two-minute pauses. As the remainder of the VAC Amphib Recon Company was trekking to shore, four rubber crafts capsized, losing some of their equipment. A Marine photographer lost most of his camera equipment, and they had to ditch two rubber crafts for the sake of riding in the Higgins boat. Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill from the Majuro Attack Group scheduled to commence bombardment at 0600 on January 31 from aerial and naval gunfire from the cruiser and , a destroyer, after the team's SRC-620 field radio had maintained radio silence. For eighteen minutes, the Marines and natives on SALOME were bombarded by friendly-fire until finally at 0630 the message got through by Jones using a TBX radio.Lt. Corey, War Diary, Operations of Reconnaissance Company on SUNDANCE ATOLL, (HistDiv, HQMC: Mar 16, 1944); 65A-5188, Box 2, Folder A19-10-VAC, OpnRpt (Encl 1), ReconCo Rpt 2l Jan-02 Feb, 1944. No Marines nor natives, nor especially the major Japanese buildings were hit. Most of the projectiles hit the coconut trees and were air bursts.USS Nautilus log, Patrol Seven, VAC, Recon Company, Action Report, War Diary, Operation of Reconnaissance Company on SUNDANCE Atoll, 16 Mar 1944,; Box 2, Folder A-19-10-VAC, Open Report (Encl. 1), Recon Co Report, 21 Jan-02 Feb 1944, History and Museums Division, HQMC. Jones concluded that there were no Japanese other than the four patrols of recon Marines already on the ground. Fifteen minutes later, Jones received word that the gunfire would cease and to move the patrols out of the area immediately. Captain Jones meanwhile had been ordered to rendezvous with the CO of BLT 2/106 on board to discuss further amphibious reconnaissance on RITA and LAURA. Reembarking USS Kane, Capt. Jones dispatched Shinn's Platoon and Minnear's platoon. When the 1st Platoon and 2nd Platoon were proceeding across the reef passage to RITA, the 2nd Platoon was spotted by an observation plane from the USS Portland. Assuming that the Marines were enemy Japanese troops, the pilot proceeded to strafe the platoon. Despite the signals from the Marines, the pilot maintained strafing maneuvers; no one was injured and the men sustained minor injuries from the obstacles of the coral reefs. Shinn's platoon located a village on RITA and reported no enemy with no natives present; twenty or more excellent temporary frame buildings in good condition, none of which had been damaged by the \\"friendly\\" naval gunfire. Laid scattered in the area were numerous items, such as hand carts, steel rails, lumber, window frames, empty oil drums, a small steam locomotive and a narrow gauge railway line, a heavy steam roller, explosive materials, insulated electrical wire, and abundance of coconuts and papaya. By interrogating the natives, they revealed that there were an Imperial Japanese Navy Warrant Officer, Japanese garrisons and a few civilians working on LAURA. Two natives agreed to accompany Jones's company as guides and interpreters, Eliu and Jeff Jefferson, a trader native to the Marshall Islands. They both agreed to accompany the Marines as an interpreter and guide for the islet of LAURA. Shinn's and Minnear's platoons continued to reconnoiter until 0800, when they reembarked USS Kane, reporting back to Jones that RITA was secured.lstLt Harry C. Minnear, War Diary, Operations of Reconnaissance Company on SUNDANCE ATOLL, (HistDiv, HQMC: Mar 16, 1944); 65A-5188, Box 2, Folder A19-10-VAC, OpnRpt (Encl 1), ReconCo Rpt 2l Jan-02 Feb, 1944. On February 1, 1944, Capt. James Jones had received orders to assemble his company on Kane by 1700 to prepare for a reconnaissance of LAURA, disembarking by 2100, January 31 and Arno Atoll later that night. He secretly emplaced three patrols about the headquarters and a fourth patrol set to watch the two other Japanese houses. Harbored 4000 yards off the eastern point of LAURA Island, Weeks and his 4th Platoon, reinforced with twenty Marines from Lassiter's mortar platoon, landed on LAURA at 0030 using two Higgins boats. Eliu, the interpreter accompanying Weeks, began questioning the local natives. By 2300, Eliu encountered two of her native acquaintances and had agreed to lead their patrol to three houses occupied by the Japanese in a nearby settlement. Reaching the main native settlement at 0100, they immediately began making their reconnaissance working north. All natives were not permitted to travel to the village; they were instructed instead to stay away from the village, passing it on to every native citizen along the way. The presence of the patrols became quickly noticeable to the many natives in the vicinity, who became too numerous to control silently. And their solution was, that it became necessary to rush the houses. Doing so, twelve or fourteen people, including children, would flee from the front porch into the heavy foliage. Two patrols attempted a pursuit but were able to apprehend only two natives. Two other patrols proceeded to investigate the other Japanese fales but were found deserted. They reached the Japanese garrison and began to search the area and the beach fales. They recovered crude grenades made from 100 lbs of dynamite, one .30-cal machine gun, one 7.07 mm machine gun and two .50-cal machine guns with plenty of ammunition, which came from a downed B-24 Liberator. When the Japanese abandoned Majuro in November, 1942, they left many finished or nearly completed buildings and barracks, an observation tower, seaplane hangars and good construction equipment and materiel. Nothing could be learned as to the whereabouts of the Japanese naval officer. At about 0530, the Japanese Imperial Navy Warrant Officer Nagata crept back to his quarters. Although armed with a katana and an American-issued .45-cal pistol, Lt. Weeks, a former college wrestler, jumped him from the rear, taking him down. He had formerly been in charge of the 400 laborers building gun emplacements on various Marshall Atolls, but at present was stationed as an overseer to the Japanese property and buildings on RITA Island. As Nagata put up no resistance, Lt Weeks' detail returned to the original beachhead at 0600 with all available personnel to LAURA Village. Later, Lt. Corey's 4th Platoon captured three more Japanese on LAURA and held them as prisoners. In one of the fales, they found additional gear from the crashed B-24; fire-damaged flight suits, flight jackets, a .30-cal machine gun, a sextant and a khaki shirt with the name \\"Master Tech Sergeant Hanson\\" on the collar. Natives later confirmed that those two machine guns and gear were salvaged from a B-24 that was ditched a month ago. The American crew were taken prisoner and evacuated to the Maloelap Atoll. At 0955, on the morning of D-Day January 31, 1944, Rear Admiral Hill was able to report to Vice Admiral Spruance that Majuro was then secured and the Marines awaited the return of the LCP(R) to take Jones's company to the command ship USS Cambria and Jones conferred with the officers of BLT 2/206. Majuro Atoll was secured at 1500 on January 31, 1944, with Jones and his recon Marines having accomplished their mission of securing the Entrance Islands to safeguard the passage of the transport. An Army battalion was sent the following morning and Task Force 51 circled the atoll and anchored in the lagoon. Jones received further orders to reembark Kane at 1500 and the Marines reembarked with their prisoner under guard of Platoon Sergeant French LeClair with all Japanese weapons found on LAURA Island. By 1630, Jones and his company proceeded to officially secure SALOME and ROSALIE on the east end of the lagoon. Jones was ordered to report to the Commanding General, V Amphibious Corps to reconnoiter Arno Atoll (CARILLON). After landing and finding nothing to report, they reembarked USS Kane. The next evening on D+1 (Day-Day plus 1), February 2, and arrived and joined the rest of the ships in anchor. By next day of February 3, over thirty ships were harbored in the lagoon. The Company departed and embarked USS Kane at 0700, February 3, 1944, ascertaining that there were no Japanese in the atoll. The captured warrant officer provided valuable information. Captain Jones recommended that the interpreters who accompanied the patrol be furnished in debt to the VAC. Jeffries was received aboard the flagship with appropriate honors. Also, Jones saved valuable installations from destruction from naval gunfire and aerial bombardment. One of the larger buildings on the island was converted into a hospital and the Special Service Squadron took over the other buildings. Fortunately nothing was seriously damaged during the 18-minute \\"friendly-fire\\" bombardment by Portland and Bullard. In short order, Majuro Atoll became a thriving forward operating naval base with an airstrip quickly built for local defense. Jones and his VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company were inbound for a fierce fire fight on the small islands of the Eniwetok Atoll. =Eniwetok, February‚ÄìMarch 1944= right Eniwetok, meaning \\"Land between West and East\\" in Marshallese, was known for an excellent anchorage, with an immense lagoon stretching north‚Äìsouthwise and east-to-west providing the largest lagoon in the Marshalls. The circular-shaped atoll of Eniwetok lies WNW of Roi-Namur and from the Mariana Islands, making up some forty islets that comprise the Eniwetok Atoll. Operation CATCHPOLE was involved in the planned occupation of Truk, Kusaie, Wake, and the Eniwetok Islands (DOWNSIDE). Most of the islands in DOWNSIDE covered an area approximately . The VAC Amphib Recon Company under Capt. James Jones was attached to Task Group One (TG-1) 7 ‚Äì February 25, 1944, cooperating with Capt. Katzenbach's scouting unit, Company D, 4th Division. The plan was to coordinate the 22nd Marines with the 106th Infantry Regiment (minus BLT 2/106). Intelligence estimated an enemy strength of twenty-nine hundred to four thousand on the entire atoll. Kane sailed for DOWNSIDE, on February 15, 1944, with Task Group 51.14 in , entering the lagoon of Eniwetok at 0900, February 17, anchoring at 1145. Their plan was to reconnoiter and seize Aitsu (CAMELLIA) and Rujiyoru (CANNA) in order to allow a joint artillery battery emplacement, consisting of the 104th Field Artillery and the 2nd Separate Pack Howitzer Battalion, to establish a fire base for bombardment on the targeted northern islet of Engebi.Henry I. Shaw, Jr., Bernard C. Nalty and Edwin T. Turnbladh, Central Pacific Drive: History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II; Vol. 3 (HistBr, HQMC, 1966). Upon receiving orders that H-Hour would be scheduled at 1230, Capt. Jones transferred VAC Amphib Recon Company from USS Kane to their landing ship as instructed, then loaded onto the amphibious tractor, for the prepared landings on CANNA and CAMELLIA.Capt. James Jones, Commanding Officer, VAC AmphibReconCo., Action Report DOWNSIDE Operation, (Mar 18, 44), HistDiv, HQMC, 65A-5188, Box 2, Folder A20-l-VAC, ReconCo, ActRpt ENIWETOK, and 65A-5188, Box 10, folder TG- l-V MAC, Encl. D, SAR, ENIWETOK. They were supported by gun power from two nearby infantry landing crafts. Splitting the recon company in half, Capt. Jones, two of his officers, and fifty-seven recon Marines boarded three LVTs and landed on CAMELLIA Island at 1320, February 17, 1944. Some difficulty was encountered when two of the LVTs were stuck in the impermeable sand along the beachhead, barely able to maneuver them to a more solid sand bank. But by 1355, quickly finding that it was unoccupied, CAMELLIA was secure with no Japanese forces nor natives on the island. Meanwhile, Executive Officer 1st Lieutenant Merwyn Silverthorn also using three LVTs with four officers and fifty-seven men, landed ten minutes later at 1330 with the other half of the recon company on CANNA Island. CANNA was unoccupied except by twenty-five natives. The islet was secure at 1400. After useful information translated by interpreter William Mueller, five of the natives informed the Marines on the disposition and strength of Japanese defense forces. They discovered that at least 1000 Japanese troops were on each of the three main islands; Parry Island (HEARTSTRINGS), Eniwetok (PRIVILEGE) and Engebi (FRAGILE), plus 1000 laborers. However, no further information was obtained whether or not there were Japanese on the other islands.James L. Jones, After-action Report of the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, V Amphibious Corps, DOWNSIDE (CATCHPOLE) Operation, 09 March 1944; pp. 1‚Äì9. While the recon Marines from VAC Amphib Recon Company were seizing the \\"artillery islands\\", the United States Navy Underwater Demolition Teams, also using amphibious tractors, or amtracs, were conducting underwater reconnaissance. The UDT swimmers would reconnoiter fifty feet from the shore of FRAGILE, casting from LVTs. Their main focus was to locate submerged obstacles that could dismay a landing force and naval mines. The joint-Marine and Army artillery battery began their emplacement on both CAMELLIA and CANNA, landing at around 1500. As soon as they were ashore, the recon Marines reembarked, leaving behind Lt. Shinn's 1st Platoon across the inter-islet channel of COLUMBINE to provide security for the Marine's 2nd Separate Pack-Howitzer Battalion. However, 104th's Field Artillery Battalion on CAMELLIA already had a sufficient number of soldiers providing their own security. At 1600 on D-Day (D-0), using their rubber boats, Minnear's 2nd Platoon and Weeks's 4th Platoon patrolled the island of BUTTERCUP that lay immediately northwest and adjacent from CANNA and CAMELLIA. After finding it unoccupied, they proceeded to reconnoiter CARNATION and COLUMBINE, reaching it by 1700. They found these two islands also unoccupied. Meantime, Lt. Silverthorn and his fifty-seven recon Marines returned to Jones and the remaining company. With VAC Amphib Recon Company rejoined, they dug in and spent the night on a nearby, unoccupied island of BITTERROOT. By 1902, it was confirmed that both artillery batteries had been fully emplaced with target firing base area registered for ready.Brigadier General Thomas E. Watson, letter to CMC, 1 March 1953 (3 April 1954); Historical Branch, G-3, Headquarters, Marine Corps. Crossing the channel through the heavy surf toward a small islet west of FRAGILE, Capt. Katzenbach's Scout Company, the 4th Marine Division landed on Bogen (ZINNIA) on the morning of February 18, (D+1). After scouting and reconnoitering, by 0327 it was declared unoccupied and secured, becoming the last amphibious reconnaissance mission before the main landing assault on FRAGILE. The captured islets of CAMELLIA, CANNA and ZINNIA prevented the enemy from fleeing and \\"island-hopping\\" to a nearby island, potentially to regroup with reinforcements or settle into defensive fortifications, awaiting the American Marine/Navy Fleet. Preceded by extensive naval gunfire and aerial bombardments, the 22nd Marines landed an assault on FRAGILE against the defended Japanese. One Marine was killed and two wounded from fire coming from the fierce firefight on FRAGILE. As an indication of how low the fire was, all of these Marines were lying flat on the ground when hit. Also, enemy coconut log bunkers were centralized and interconnected with complex trenches dug and constructed in a manner of radiating from its hub, covered with hidden spider holes. The Marines quickly resolved the issue by dropping incendiary or smoke grenades; the smoke would eventually convey through the covered trenches exposing all the hidden, unpredictable trap doors. While the 22nd Marines and 106th Infantry were in the process of capturing Engebi Island (FRAGILE), both Jones's and Katzenbach's recon and scouts captured a Japanese soldier while reconnoitering the eight other 'unoccupied' islands in the area. At 0900 on February 18, on D+1 just southeast of FRAGILE, landing on Muzingbaarkikku (ARBUTUS) \\"friendly-fire\\" hit three recon Marines, injuring two and later killing one while being evacuated to the ship. Apparently the rounds were dispersed from Marines on Engebi, firing machine guns onto a Japanese-held defense on Skunk Point. Using 60-mm mortars, the recon team was able to gain the western edge of ARBUTUS on the reef passage facing Engebi, and was ordered to secure it overnight to D+2 to flank any fleeing Japanese troops from FRAGILE. Around the afternoon of D+1, sometime around 1640, the two joint-Marine/Army infantry regiments officially secured FRAGILE. The 22nd Marines and the Army's 106th Infantry along with the 104th Artillery reembarked the USS Kane for an upcoming assault on Parry Island (HEARTSTRINGS). This made the 2nd Marine Artillery available to pack up and reinforce Jones if necessary. Marine General Thomas Watson carefully observed the continuous hard assault and casualties on Engebi, or FRAGILE, and decided to wait for the seizure of the main Japanese bastion on HEARTSTRINGS. Captured documents taken on FRAGILE confirmed that HEARTSTRINGS was strongly held and contained an artillery element. On D+2, General Watson ordered both the recon and scout Marine companies, to continue reconnoitering the string of islets to the west and the eastern islets of DOWNSIDE. The Marine Scouts headed for the eastern islets heading south and found Elugelab (SAGEBRUSH) unoccupied, but at Rigili (POSY) they killed nine Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, VAC Amphib Recon Company, (minus his headquarters platoon), with Lt. Lassiter's mortar platoon headed to the eastern islets and continued south en route to Japtan (LADYSLIPPER). Weeks's 4th Platoon reinforced with some attached mortarmen conducted a recon of LILAC, a small islet west of the Deep Passage, midway between LADYSLIPPER AND HEARTSTRINGS, on the morning of D+3, February 21. Although they found the island secured, they found it was recently occupied by the enemy. The island once had a Japanese flag on a tall mast and a sunken Japanese landing barge offshore. At this time, Task Force-55 landed two infantry regiments, the 22nd Marines and the Army's 106th, the landing force against heavy Japanese resistance on the capital island of Eniwetok (PRIVILEGE). Close to 1800 on D+3, Jones and his entire company landed on LADYSLIPPER with Lt. Lassiter's mortar platoon for securing the beachhead, while Jones's company maneuvered into line skirmishes and held his right flank on the lagoon-side, proceeding south. Reaching the Deep Passage that separates the islets of LADYSLIPPER and HEARTSTRINGS, without any incident, they circled back to north up along the eastside ‚Äì seaward of the island. Meanwhile, Jones's company declared LADYSLIPPER secured at 1929 after finding no sights of any enemy occupation and waited for the inbound ship USS Kane to arrive. VAC Recon Company embarked the USS Kane at 1345 while the 2nd Marine Artillery battery disembarked Kane and unpacked their howitzers with Lassiter's mortar platoon as their security. On the morning of D+4, February 22, 1944, the battalion landing teams (BLTs) beached onto HEARTSTRINGS and PRIVILEGE, preceded by naval gunfire, aerial bombardment and artillery barrages. Parry Island took most of the heavy-weighted gunfire out of the whole DOWNSIDE operation. While the beaches were covered in smoke from the early bombardment, confusion caused three infantry landing crafts (LCIs) to be fired on by the naval Task Force. The Marines hit the beaches at 0908 with two battalion landing teams, the 1st (1/22) and 2nd Battalions (2/22) of the Regimental Combat Team, and the 22nd Marines, or RCT-22. The 3rd Battalion, 22nd Marines (3/22) landed for a follow-in trace and were immediately engaged by the Japanese with small-arms fire and mortars. Jones was pre-briefed of a recon mission of Parry Island, or HEARTSTRINGS at 1230, D+4. His orders were to regroup his whole company (including headquarters personnel) and land his VAC Recon Company with the 4th Division's Scouts Company onto 'GREEN Beach #2' of HEARTSTRINGS and augment into the 1st and 2nd Battalion of RCT-22. Landing at 1320 in a covered landing, Jones reported to the commanding officer of RCT-22, Colonel John T. Walker. In turn, he was immediately ordered to report to Lt. Colonel Donn C. Hart, the commanding officer of the battalion landing team 2/22. In a decision to split Jones's company into two recon teams, executive officer 1st Lt. Silverthorn was sent with Corey's 3rd and Weeks's 4th Platoon along with a divided half of the detached mortar platoon to augment Company F (FOX), while Jones took Shinn's 1st and Minnear's 2nd Platoon to Company E (EASY), who had been in fierce battle for six hours. This provided about fifty-five extra men to each rifle company. The larger force now available enabled each company to complete a push against the enemy to the sea. Jones placed the 1st Platoon on the left flank and the 2nd Platoon on the right and advanced with EASY Company for the final 250 yards of the beach. Joined by four light tanks, the recon platoons were 'mopping-up' any bypassed enemy snipers. Reaching 50 yards, the platoons rushed passed EASY's assault elements to push the remaining enemy to the sea. Conferring with the EASY Company commander, Jones's recon element took over the enemy beach defense. However, Silverthorn's recon element had more difficulty. While FOX, between EASY and GEORGE Company, was securing the beach approaching at 25 yards, they came across an area honeycombed with dugouts filled with snipers in connecting emplacements along the beach. Silverthorn and his platoons could see if they needed the help of flame throwers and demolitions. After a brief withdrawal to some 30 yards from the beach, they regrouped with necessary additional firepower. In short order, they overran the Japanese defenses, sustaining four casualties during the action. Withdrawing for the night, the recon troops were phased into FOX Company's Main Line of Resistance. During the night, the company accounted for about 15 enemy dead without loss to themselves. On the next morning of February 24, 1944, the commanding officer of 22nd Marines detached VAC Amphib Recon Company at 1030 and withdrew to the beach where they embarked aboard a LCT for further transfer to the APD USS Kane. Upon orders of Task Group-One (TG-1), the VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company was transferred to at 1130, and were en route for Pearl Harbor at 1600, February 25, 1944. Upon arrival to Camp Catlin, the Commander of V Amphibious Corps (VAC) General Holland M. Smith awarded 1st Lieutenant Weeks the Bronze Star for actions on Eniwetok and presented VAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Company the special commendations endorsed by Commandant General Alexander Archer Vandegrift.Corps General Order No. 30-44, 19Mar44, HQ, VAC, Subj: Commendation, Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, V Amphibious Corps, for action in the Central Pacific Area. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz presented Capt. James Jones his second Legion of Merit, signed by United States Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. The Mariana Islands The four largest islands of Guam, Rota, Saipan and Tinian, replaced Truk as the next series of islands for seizure in the Mariana Islands, or Operation FORAGER, becoming logical strategic targets. Saipan and Tinian, being the northernmost islands in the Marianas, were the landing objectives for General Smith's V Amphibious Corps ‚Äì consisting of the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions, with the Army's 27th Infantry Division as the V Amphib Corps' Reserve component. The seizure of Guam in the southern Marianas was tasked by Major General Roy S. Geiger, whose III Amphibious Corps (composed of the 3rd Marine Division, 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and the Army's 77th Infantry Division). In the center of the Marianas, or FORAGER lies Saipan, only from Tokyo, Japan. It was known at that time, the \\"Pearl Harbor of Japan\\", being the main administrative headquarters for all of the Japanese forces in the western Pacific. All the supplies and troops were funneled through Saipan that made up the whole of Japan's defense forces, their inner defense line. The island of Tinian lies south across the channel from Saipan. It was considered to contain the best airfields in the Marianas that catered to the Pacific campaign. One of the airfields was the launch site for the B-29 Bomber Enola Gay, which dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima. They only major town at that time was Tinian Town, which centered at its mass, a 9,000-man Japanese defense force led by Japanese Colonel Keishi Ogata. All the Marine assault commanders confirmed by aerial photography and reconnaissance flown from nearby Saipan that the 2,000-yard wide sandy beach along Sunharon Bay, on the southwest side of Tinian, was the most heavily defended of all possible usable beaches. On the eastern side of Tinian at Asuga Bay, were more beaches chosen for contingency beach landings, which would encompass around the 25-foot cliffs for beach exits. These two beaches at Asuga Bay were designated as YELLOW #1 and #2, which also contained formidable Japanese defenses. YELLOW #1 was 355 yards long and YELLOW #2 was 200 yards long. The small, white-sanded beaches at Hagoi on western Tinian were the only potential beaches capable of permitting LVTs, DUKWs, artillery trucks and supply vehicles. Being designated as WHITE #1 and #2, these beaches were scarcely defended by approximately one company of a Japanese defense force. Aboard the command ship , a tense, contentious conflict erupted between Admiral Kelly Turner and General Holland Smith over which beach was suitable for a major beach landing. But General Holland M. Smith resolved upon a landing on WHITE #1 and WHITE #2 since they were able to receive artillery support from Saipan and would provide the element of surprise. General Smith had the full support of Admiral Hill, who was in charge of the entire operation. However, Admiral Turner adamantly opposed considering any beachhead landing on the WHITE beaches. He instead reasoned that WHITE #1 was only 60 to 75 yards wide and WHITE #2 was only 135 to 160 yards wide, with depth of between 15 and 20 yards, making it impractical for two divisions to land a large beach assault. But the WHITE beaches had a relatively smooth off-lying reef shelf 300 yards long and it was felt LVTs and LCVPs could disembark troops who could wade ashore. Also, landing on WHITE away from the main Japanese defenses onto an essentially undefended beach was a better approach then landing on Turner's proposed beaches at Tinian Town. Another factor to consider was the short over-water distance from Saipan, which lies across the Saipan Channel. The landing force could preload on Saipan without having to organize itself for a typical ship-to-shore landing. Also, by landing on the northern tip of Tinian, most of the island would be within the fan and range of General Smith's thirteen artillery battalions that were sited hub-to-hub on the southern slopes of Saipan. Aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Japanese were fully aware of the United States's interest in the beaches off Tinian Town and were making last minute improvements to their defenses on beaches of YELLOW, BLUE, GREEN #1 and #2, Red #1 and #2 and ORANGE. =Saipan, June 1944= D-Day was originally set for June 15, 1944. The VAC Amphib Recon Battalion departed Pearl Harbor on May 28 aboard the and the . Alpha Company was tasked for a D-1 night beach landing to seize the 1,554-foot Mount Tapochau center of the island. Fortunately, the mission was canceled. BRAVO Company landed early in the afternoon on D-Day and on June 17, BRAVO Company joined with rest of the battalion at Chalan Kanoa. The battalion carried out a variety of assignments, such as Command Post Security and the \\"mopping up\\" of bypassed Japanese defenders and sniper patrols. Also, BRAVO would patrol out of the larger town of Garapan while the assault divisions moved north on the island. After thirty-nine days of intense close combat by the battalion landing teams supported by naval gunfire, artillery and close air support, Admiral Turner and General Holland Smith declared Saipan secured on July 9, 1944. The Americans suffered 3,225 killed in action and 13,061 wounded. The Japanese totaled 23,811 dead. The POWs numbered 928, and 838 Koreans and 10,258 Japanese civilians were interned. =Tinian, July 1944= The VAC Amphib Recon Battalion was alerted on July 3 of the Tinian mission and were handed orders on July 9, to reconnoiter the YELLOW and WHITE beaches. Given the time, Major James Jones tasked his two-company battalion for rehearsals as they embarked from Stone Pier on BLUE Beach and transited to their rehearsal area on two PURPLE beaches of Magicienne Bay on Saipan through the night of 9 ‚Äì July 10. The actual mission was scheduled to be conducted throughout the evening of 10 ‚Äì July 11, 1944; Alpha Company and UDT 7 (Silverthorn and Burke) were to reconnoiter beach YELLOW #1 on the eastern side of Tinian while BRAVO Company and UDT 5 (Shinn and Kaufmann) were assigned to reconnoiter WHITE #1 and #2 beaches on the northwestern side. They were asked for location and nature of the obstacles on the beach and the height and characteristics of the cliffs and the vegetation behind the beaches, in addition to the depth of water and the characteristics of the off- lying reef. Also, they were to give an appraisal of types of landing crafts that could be landed on each particular beach, plus the types of vehicles which could cross the reef and move inland. General Holland M. Smith also requested their estimate as to whether the infantry could climb the cliffs without ladders or cargo nets.Northern Troops and Landing Force Operation Order 27-44, 9 July 1944, Recon files, History and Museums Division, HQMC. Top secret declassified to unclassified. Major Jones with Capt. Silverthorn's Company A accompanied by UDT Team 7 under Navy Lieutenant Richard F. Burke embarked onto , while Shinn's Company B embarked on the with UDT Team 5 under Lt. Commander Draper L. Kauffman. The APDs carried the joint-reconnaissance force to a point just offshore of Tinian. Faces colored with black and silver nonreflective face paint, they donned cammies or cut-off shorts made from utility trousers with soft covers as headgear. To avoid their feet being cut and torn by the coral, they either wore coral or tennis shoes, or an occasional pair of boondockers. Also, every sailor and Marine had a small inflation bladder (usually not inflated), providing positive buoyancy when required. Armed with only Ka-Bar or Fairbairn-Sykes combat knives, the recon Marines and the UDT Teams disembarked from their APDs. The recon Marines used eight rubber boats for each beach while the UDT teams were in two rubber boats for each beach, and were towed by Higgins boats to within 400 to 500 yards offshore from the beach. Two Marines were left in each boat to paddle them to keep them stationary off from the beaches while the swimmers went to their objectives, YELLOW Beach off Tinian Town, and WHITE #1 and #2 in the northwestern portion of the island. The Navy UDT and the recon Marines were accustomed to different reconnoitering methods,Carl W. Hoffman, The Seizure of Tinian, HistDiv HQMC, (Wash, D.C.: 1951) the Marines, reconnoitering the beach and the land inward, scouted the size and location of exits inland through the hills and dunes, the UDT, conducting underwater reconnaissance found that the shelving reef had only a few ragged breaks in its sea edge for the amphibian tractors to avoid. Silverthorn's Alpha Company and Burke's UDT 7 disembarked from the USS Stringham at 2100 and were towed to their position off YELLOW #1 (Asuga) Beach. The UDT found anchored mines, numerous potholes and coral heads. The hydrography of YELLOW #1 made it negatively inconclusive to land a beach assault. At 2232, the moonlight conveyed through the recently heavy clouds and revealed double-apron barbed wire along the beaches. 2nd Lieutenant Donald Neff of Alpha Company worked his way inland about 30 yards, silently evading a Japanese sentry that was having a cigarette. As he was looking for beach exits for tracked and wheeled vehicles, sounds of explosives were heard from a nearby beach. The UDT interpreted the explosion that had been spotted and departed the area since the security orders were to avoid disclosure of any landing intentions. Also, if any mines or obstacles were encountered, they were not to be disturbed. On the other hand, the Marines that were closer to the beach later surmised that the Japanese were working on their beach fortifications in hasty construction of trenches and blockhouses, and proceeded with their reconnaissance.Jeter A. Isely and Philip A. Crowl, The U.S. Marines and Amphibious War, (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1951). Occasionally, Japanese sentries patrolling atop the twenty-five-foot escarpments flanking YELLOW #1 would shine flashlights onto the beach below but Silverthorn's Marines were never detected. Although one enemy patrol walked within a few yards of the Marines, they failed to spot them. They returned to the Stringham at 0200 with \\"negative\\" collective information in consideration of using YELLOW #1 for beach landings. The results were conclusive. Moored mines, pot holes, large boulders, barbed wire on the beaches as well as pillboxes, hundred-foot cliffs at each end flanking the beach, and more fortifications being developed by the Japanese made the beaches totally undesirable. To the northwest, Lieutenant Leo Shinn's Bravo Company immediately had problems the moment they disembarked from USS Gilmer at 2130. Originally, Shinn had split his team into two, one aiming for WHITE #1 (the most northern of the two) and the other team for WHITE #2. A strong northerly tidal current had carried WHITE #1 team north, landing on a coral outcropping about 800 yards north of Tinian. If not for the coral outcrop, the strong tide would have carried them farther into the Saipan Channel. The other team that was heading for WHITE #2 ended up on WHITE #1 instead, in which they made a hasty reconnaissance. Also, the northerly current plus low scudding clouds at night made it extremely difficult to locate the recovery rubber boats, moving them north from their extraction pickup point. Two Marines, Gunnery Sergeant Sam Lanford and PFC John Sebern were aware that they could not stay near the WHITE beaches as it would jeopardize the entire operation if caught. They swam out into the Tinian Channel that separated Saipan and Tinian, using their partially inflated flotation bladders stuffed in their dungaree jackets. After treading water for a few hours, they were recovered by the USS Dickerson (APD-21), a picket boat patrolling the channel. UDT's Lt. Commander Kaufmann underwent a similar swim for recovery and was also recovered by Dickerson. Company B as a whole returned with partial report on only WHITE #1. Major Jones was not completely satisfied with the first night's reconnaissance. Jones reassigned Capt \\"Silver\\" Silverthorn to redo both WHITE #1 and #2 due to his successful recon of YELLOW #1 the night prior. Knowing the critical mission in obtaining pertinent information, Silver arranged six two-man swimmer teams of one officer and one senior staff NCO each, eliminating any junior ranked enlisted on the second night of reconnaissance, 11 ‚Äì July 12, 1944. Alpha Company's executive officer, Lieutenant Weeks, took MGySgt Pat Patrick, the only Bravo Company swimmer along with Silver's Company 1st Sergeant Ken Arzt, and lieutenants Wayne Pepper, Paul Taylor, Ted Toole and \\"Mac\\" MacGregor; each with their respective platoon sergeants. The six teams headed for the WHITE beaches, three on WHITE #1 and three on WHITE #2. Taking the extra step, he requested more definite radar tracking of his boats from the APD to the beaches. Towing a rubber boat mounted a metal tripod wrapped in wire mesh with their highly radar-visible steel \\"pot\\" helmets, this provided a good, solid radar \\"target\\" for USS Stringham. This allowed the 'combined' recon teams to accurately land on their assigned beaches while they corresponded through their SCR-300 radio for course directions. Their observation of the three- to five-foot cliff just inland from the beach permitted the LVT units to engineer a simple yet ingenious design of a deployable, portable ramp with its frame made from timbers. This allowed them to potentially exit the LVT over the obstacle as they were immediately dropped in place. The wheeled and tracked vehicles were able funnel their way inland from the narrow beaches. They successfully confirmed the usability of WHITE #1 and #2 for the major landing assaults to follow. The recon Marines accomplished their missions without the loss of a single man and were able to bring back sketches as well as samples of the vegetation for study.Fletcher Pratt, The Marines' War, (New York: William Sloane Associates, Inc., 1948) As Silverthorn briefed Admiral Hill, Hill kept pressuring for Silverthorn's opinion on the WHITE beaches. To convince Admiral Hill, Silverthorn emphatically said... :\\"Admiral, the beaches are narrow... [but] there are no mines, no coral heads, no boulders, no wire, no boat obstacles and no offshore reefs. The beaches are as flat as a billiard table!\\" Armed with this factual data, General Smith and Admiral Hill returned to Admiral Turner expecting a change in his policy. Nothing changed. He simply would not listen, and again ordered Smith and Hill in very positive terms to stop all White Beach planning. Admiral Hill went over Adm. Turner's head, going directly to Admiral Spruance and uproariously argued along with Generals Smith and Harry Schmidt for use of the WHITE beaches. Spruance, not wanting to nullify his subordinate, Turner, summoned a conference. Alleviating their tempers and differing opinions, the results of the reconnaissance were presented; he requested a vote beginning with the most junior officer present. All voted \\"Yea\\" and anxiously looked to Turner, who, after a pause, finally added his approval;, the WHITE beaches were ultimately chosen. Two weeks later at dawn, the battle for Tinian was commenced on July 24, 1944, when the 4th Marine Division landed on the two small WHITE beaches. They attacked 1500 yards inland before suffering their first casualty. With aid from the 2nd Marine Division, it took nine days to seize Tinian and declare it secured, on August 1, 1944, the same day Guam was declared secured. The extremely difficult operation was almost perfectly executed, and the landing force operations officer, Colonel Robert E. Hogaboom, credited this from the high competence of the preliminary reconnaissance. The Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, VAC, boarded the destroyer USS Azalea City and departed for Pearl Harbor on 9 August, arriving at Camp Catlin, Hawaii, on August 20, 1944. When V (Fifth) Amphibious Corps returned from Tinian, the V (Fifth) Amphibious Corps (VAC), was redesignated as Fleet Marine Force, Pacific on August 26, 1944. Subsequently, the Amphib Recon Battalion also made a titular change from VAC Amphib Recon Bn to FMF Amphib Recon Bn. Iwo Jima, January‚ÄìMarch 1945 Through the dates January 16‚Äì24, 1945, 1st Lieutenant Russell Corey, Commanding Officer of B Company, or BAKER Company, embarked along with his Marines aboard and performed command-post exercises (CPXs) around the beaches of Hawaii for preparation for amphib recon beach landings on Iwo Jima. Three days later on January 27, they departed, arriving off the coast on February 18. Originally, the entire BAKER Company was to prepare for a pre-D-Day amphib recon of Iwo Jima's beaches; instead Lt. Corey was given further orders to detach three of his amphib recon Marines from B Company, FMF Amphib Recon Battalion and composite them into a 'provisional' amphibious reconnaissance unit. The purpose of the temporary consolidated amphib recon unit was to save precious time by embarking a mixed crew of recon Marines and UDT in gathering valuable information and bringing it back to their own respective intelligence sections for processing. This unit was composed of Marines from the Scout and Sniper Companies of the 4th Marine and 5th Marine Divisions and sailors from four UDT Teams of #12, #13, #14 and #15. The \\"provisional\\" amphib recon unit embarked the USS Blessman (APD-48) for Iwo Jima, along with four other APDs USS Bull (APD-78), USS Bates (APD-47) and USS Barr (APD-39; carrying the other tasked UDT sailors and Recon Marines that were to conduct their pre-D-Day amphib recon on the eastern beaches of Iwo Jima on D-3, three days prior to D-Day. Next day on February 17, 1945, D-2 the next pre-D-Day beach landing was unusually conducted during the daytime, but had been preceded by naval gunfire which commenced at 0700. Battleships , and bombarded the beaches as they closed in at three thousand yards from the shore. By 1025, Rear Admiral William Brandy ordered the fire-support to cease; meanwhile the cruiser took six direct hits in the exchange of fire as they Japanese batteries ashore opened fire onto the minesweepers while it observed the Japanese batteries open fire on the minesweepers. The USS Pensacola silenced the offending batteries within five minutes. When the minesweepers were finished, the UDT and recon Marines disembarked onto their Higgins boats and immediately lashed the rubber boats to the starboard side, then proceeded to their designated beach. They dropped the UDT and Marine swimmers into the water. Most of the swimmers coated themselves in Navy water pump grease since at that time, no cold-water exposure suits had been invented. At the same time, the B-29 bombers and the battleships continued their bombing raids. Because of the naval gunfire and aerial bombardment, the Japanese commander, General Kuribayashi, mistakenly sensed that the Americans were coming in for a main invasion and opened fire. The infantry landing crafts and the enemy Japanese forces began exchanging fire from their 20 mm, 40 mm and 4.5-inch rockets over the combat swimmers (both the Marines and UDT) in the water. Three recon teams embarked onto Higgins boats with each of the recon teams accompanied by the Navy's UDT swimmers. One recon Marine from each conglomerated team acted as photographer, and remained aboard the Higgins boats to take photographs of the beach defenses. Towards shore, the boats strafed side-to-side towards shore while the men crouched low as possible to avoid being hit by incoming enemy fire. The LCI(G)s were constantly under heavy enemy fire from hidden, well- covered batteries in the high ground, just north of the beaches at the base of Mount Suribachi.Charles Q. Lewis, Navy SEALs: A History, (Garden City, NJ: Dockery Military Book Club) Heavy batteries would repeatedly lay suppressive fire by using light mortars, machine guns, rifle fire, and occasionally antiboat guns. The eastern beaches were photographically reconnoitered left- to-right by Sergeant Jim Burns and Captain Reynolds on GREEN Beach under the southeastern corner of Suribachi. Sgt. Clete Peacock covered RED Beach #1 in the center and Sgt. Robert Cole covered RED Beach #2 on the right, where Futatsu Rock separated RED #1 from RED #2. Both Burns and Peacock used a Contax 35 mm camera, and Cole used a Leica camera. Once they completed their objectives, they planned to extract from the sea by rubber boats towed from the Higgins LCIs and quickly headed to the gunboats. Meantime, fighter planes came in laying smoke while the destroyers were firing white phosphorus shells to cover their withdrawal. Every one of the twelve LCI(G)s had been hit or was sinking. One of the landing crafts, LCI(G) #466, was still afloat and in operational conditions due to the heavy incoming fire. It allowed some Marines to board it and exit the danger zone immediately. Despite the heavy fire, it proved to be an advantageous opportunity as it exposed their positions in the well-hidden bunkers. While on board #466, Sergeant Jim Burns, one of the recon photographers, and Ensign Frank Jirka, a UDT liaison officer, were both hit by shrapnel; Burns in his arm, torso and eye; Jirka in his legs. Most of the wounded were brought onto the USS Tennessee for treating severe casualties and the mildly wounded. Sgt. Burns turned in his Contax camera, along with vital and pertinent intelligence, to Captain Reynolds for use in briefing the commanders. Afterwards, he was medically evacuated to Hawaii and returned to the continental United States, receiving a Bronze Star for his actions. Ensign Jirka, on the other hand, lost both of his legs. By late afternoon at 1600 on D-2, the same recon/UDT team, less casualty and wounded, reconnoitered the western beaches of BROWN, WHITE and ORANGE, both their #1 and #2. The UDT sailors conducted their underwater reconnaissance sweeping for enemy mines, natural or man-made obstacles; the recon Marines charted beach reconnaissance and continued onward inland, both working in the same littoral beach area. They all returned to ship by 1800. The photographs proved to be invaluable and the commanders were briefed about the situations and what to expect on the beaches. The Navy UDT teams and three recon Marines from Company B, FMF Amphib Recon Bn, under the command of Marine Sergeant Melvin C. Holland, reported that they discovered only one underwater ship mine of the western beaches and had blown it with detonated explosives. There were no land minefields nor submerged obstacles on either of the eastern and western beaches. D-Day was permitted to be on schedule by two days with sufficient beach intelligence, to include the gradients and surf conditions and beach permeability. Both the APD and , a destroyer‚Äìminesweeper, were under an enemy aerial raid. One of the joint-Navy/Marine recon teams were aboard the USS Blessman. Blessman departed the beach area and rendezvoused with the 'Gunfire and Covering Force' offshore, commanded by Rear Admiral Roger. Roughly around 2130, two planes made a stern approach on Blessman, dropping a bomb that passed down through its hull. The munition plunged itself through to the forward fireroom. Sustaining a substantial amount of damage, forty-two men on board were either killed or missing. Among those killed was Sergeant Holland. Later, on February 20 (D-Day +1), Lieutenant Russell Corey, 125 Marines with six officers from BAKER Company, FMF Amphib Recon Bn landed by a Higgins boat late in the evening. Waiting until dawn, Corey and his Marines quickly moved west along the beachhead toward the perimeter line of 28th Marines near the base of Mt. Suribachi, where Lieutenant Corey and his Marines ended up staying for a number of days ‚Äì reporting daily to the command post that lay a little farther north from their location. The command post, the recon units and advance party landed on February 23, 1945, D-Day +4. Following the assault since D-Day on Iwo Jima, Corey and BAKER Company of FMF Amphibious Recon Bn, disembarked in twelve amphibious tractors from Company C, 2nd Armored Amphibious Tractor Battalion with orders to reconnoiter the northwestern coast of Iwo Jima. Lt. Corey and his Marines reached Kama Rock and Kangoku Rock by March 12, 1945.LtCol Whitman S. Bartley, Iwo Jima: Amphibious Epic, (Wash., D.C.: HQMC, 1954). They speculated that some Japanese coast-watchers were in the vicinity helping adjust their fire upon the American ships during three weeks ago in the beginning phases of the battle. After finding no evidence, except a stone emplacement and some caves recently vacated from Japanese presence, Lt. Corey and B Company reboarded the LVTs and returned the VAC Corps headquarters on Iwo Jima. Lt. Russell Corey radioed Major James Jones (who was with the remaining FMF Amphib Recon Bn, Company A) in Pearl Harbor, HI and debriefed him of Company B's successful mission on Iwo Jima. Jones ordered Corey to take BAKER Company to the 'newly-Allied occupied' island of Saipan, arriving on March 19, 1945, for a few weeks to allow the amphib recon Marines to recuperate and replace any of their damaged equipment, for preparation of the upcoming operation in the Okinawa Islands. Meantime, Major Jones and Company ABLE proceeded toward Okinawa. On March 26, 1945, in the absence of Corey's BAKER Company, Iwo Jima was declared secured. Okinawa Islands, March‚ÄìJune 1945 Before the operation of the Okinawa Islands, or codename ICEBERG, Major Jones's FMF Amphib Recon Battalion (minus BRAVO Company) was directed to be attached and to assist and train the scout soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 305th and 306th Infantry Regiments from the Army 77th Infantry Division's scout soldiers in preliminary pre-D-Day amphibious reconnaissance. Since the beaches of Hawaii closely resemble the beaches of ICEBERG, Jones and ABLE Company (the rest FMF Amphib Recon Battalion) made several practice beach recon landings with 77th Division's Scouts and left immediately to rendezvous with Rear Admiral Ingolf N. Kiland's Western Islands Attack Group, heading for ICEBERG. Still aboard the two APDs, they arrived in the East China Sea, off the coast of the small, volcanic and peaklike islands of Kerama Retto on March 25, 1945, four days prior to L-Day. Early March in 1945, they disembarked onto the and from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, en route to Leyte. Meanwhile, Lt. Corey and BRAVO Company of FMFPAC Amphib Recon Bn, were en route to Saipan for refitting and recuperation from their previous missions on Iwo Jima. Admiral Turner wanted the both recon assets (Jones's Battalion and Army 77th Scouts) to land on Kerama Retto and Keise Shima, the western islets of ICEBERG for preliminary L-Day reconnaissance. He planned for further seizure due to its excellent anchorage for their ships to harbor for naval projection during the rest of the ICEBERG operation.Joseph H. Alexander, The Final Campaign: Marines in the Victory of Okinawa, historical monograph (Wash. D.C.: History and Museums Division, HQMC 1996). Their objectives were to seize offshore enemy artillery bases from which the mixed, \\"sea-based\\" Army/Marine 'provisional' field artillery battery could fire their 155-mm \\"Long Toms\\" and other artillery at hand for support for the upcoming main landing on Okinawa.Richard B. Frank, Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle, (New York City, NY: Penguin Books, 1990). Beginning on the nights of 25 ‚Äì March 26, 1945, L-Day minus 7‚Äì6 days, Jones's ABLE Company of FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion, led by company commander Capt. Merwyn Silverthorn, disembarked the USS Scribner and Kinzer and landed in the Keise Shima islets of Kuefo Shima, Naganna Shima and Kamiyama Shima. Finding the islands unoccupied of enemy Japanese defenders or coastwatchers, the Navy UDT teams came offshore and blew up coral with explosive charges for clearing a passage for the upcoming joint- provisional artillery elements. Meanwhile, Major Jones, the commanding officer of FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion ordered Lt. Corey and BRAVO Company to board on to the next available APD-54 at Saipan and arrive to the Okinawa Islands to reinforce Jones and the rest of FMF Amphib Recon Battalion (particularly Major Jones and ABLE Company) by April 1. Later that day, the 77th Scouts landed in the Kerama Retto Islands and Silverthorn's ALPHA Company continued their mission reconnoitering the islands throughout Keise Shima. ALPHA Company landed ashore the southern tip of Awara Saki on Tokashiki at L-5, one of the larger islands that rests in the islands of Kerama Rhetto. It too was found unoccupied. Next day on L-4, ABLE Company landed on Mae Shima and Kuro Shima. At around 0630 in the morning, a Japanese kamikaze boat attacked head on, while they attempted to land on Mae Shima but Capt. Silverthorn's amphib recon Marines opened fire with suppressive fire from their automotive weapons; when it approached 300 yards they blew it up, quickly putting it out of commission. During the kamikaze attacks, the , two of the amphibious ships of Demonstration Group CHARLIE, and the tank landing ship LST 844 were struck. On April 1, 1945, BRAVO Company arrived on L-Day, off the beaches of the east coast at Minatoga to join the 2nd Marine Division for support in their landings. With Major Jones now with his reassembled FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion (including Headquarters Company and its weapons platoon), they were temporarily attached under the echelon of the 'Eastern Islands Attack and Fire Support Group'. At 0200 on April 5, 1945 (L+6), Major Jones with his whole subordinate command of FMFPAC Amphib Recon deployed two of his companies, A and B Company, for reconnaissance of the six islets guarding Chimu Wan for enemy presence and beachhead landing information. And along with the amphib recon battalions' headquarters company reinforced and weapons platoon, accompanying the Marines was a small unit of war dogs and handlers. Preceding the main battalion recon landing was a small team of amphib recon Marines landing on the western beach of Tsugen Shima. Although they encountered civilians on the beach, they signaled the remainder of the battalion ashore. While the headquarters company set up the command post, both A and B recon companies continued further inland, with Lt Corey's Company landing just north from Silverthorn. Just inland from the beach, they encountered four Okinawan civilians, capturing two; the other two fled, alerting the nearby Japanese garrison in Tsugen village. Immediately, both ALPHA and BRAVO Company encountered heavy machine-gun and mortar fire. Corey's BRAVO Company encountered heavy resistance from Japanese-dug trench systems. They suffered two amphib recon Marine casualties, including all the war dogs and handlers accompanying the amphib recon Marines. Major Jones quickly decided to withdraw since they had accomplished their mission in determining enemy presence in the area. Lt. Corey of BRAVO Company directed Marine Sergeant Clarence Fridley to command a five-man squad, of what was considered one of the best within the company; PFCs Nelson Donley, Clarence Krejci, Wiley Saucier and Donald McNees, to cover their withdrawal of the battalion from the beaches. Most of their rubber boats were damaged during mortar attacks and found some unscathed and available. Fridley's squad covered and protected the other amphib recon Marines that were 'over-loading' the dead and eight wounded Marines on the rubber boats. By dawn, they were collectively down on the beach and planned their withdrawal. Finding no usable rubber boats, the remaining amphib recon Marines swam the few kilometers out to sea where the APDs were waiting, dropping their equipment as they took to deeper waters. Four days later, the Army's 3rd Battalion, 105th Infantry of the 27th Infantry Division landed its force on Tsugen Shima, supported by naval gunfire. Other islands were explored on following days. The entire FMF Amphib Recon Battalion landed at 0015, April 7, 1945, on Ike Shima, locating only one civilian. Major Jones then deployed both of his companies early on the morning of April 7. ABLE Company reconnoitered Heanza Shima, landing at 0545. Finding it unoccupied, they proceeded across the channel to the south and by 0800, they arrived to Hamahika Shima. Here they discovered fifteen hundred Okinawan civilians. Meantime, BAKER Company landed on adjacent Takabanare Shima, south of Ike Shima at 0530, finding two hundred Okinawan civilians. Later, they both embarked on to their APDs, returning to Major Jones with their reports. Later that evening at 2230 on April 7, BRAVO Company landed on Kutaka Shima, south of Ike Shima‚Äîthe southernmost of the \\"eastern islands\\"‚Äîthrough heavy surf. Although no civilians nor Japanese were encountered, three rubber boats were dumped in the heavy surf and one Marine drowned. By 0100, April 8, 1945, they returned to the APD, concluding the last recon mission of the eastern islets in the Okinawa Islands. Encircling Okinawa, the two APDs repositioned the amphib recon battalion on the northwestern coast of Okinawa, near Motobu Peninsula. Major Jones' FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion was tasked in participating in seizing the two islets on the western coast of Okinawa, Ie Shima and Minna Shima ‚Äì north of Motubu Peninsula. The entire amphib recon battalion landed on Minna Shima at 0445, April 14, 1945. Taking only two hours to cover the whole island, they found no presence of Japanese defenders and only thirty Okinawans. They returned to their APDs in preparation to cover the beach landings for protecting the UDT's recon in their anticipation of the Army's artillery landing scheduled for April 15. Following the UDT clearing the littoral area for the upcoming main landing party, the Army landed two 105-mm howitzer battalions and one 155-mm howitzer battalion; it provided positive support during the Army's 77th Division landing on Ie Shima scheduled for the 305th and 306th Regiments on April 16. By April 20, 1945, Ie Shima was announced secured. Major Jones and the entire FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion remained on Minna Shima until noon on April 14, when they reembarked their APDs. Three days later, they were detached from the Army's 77th Division joint-occupation operation and reported attached to III Amphibious Corps Months later in mid-June 1945, the FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion coordinated recon missions with the 'organic' scout-recon companies of the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions. These were going to be Jones's battalions' last, final missions during World War II and their necessary preliminary reconnaissance for the ICEBERG operations. On the night of 13 ‚Äì June 14, BRAVO Company, under Lt. Russell Corey landed on Kume Shima, west of Naha, finding only civilians and withdrew returning to their ship. However, later on June 26, 1945, Major Jones's amphib recon battalion of 252 men, and A Company of 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment disembarked from LST-1040 and landed again on Kume Shima, an islet west from offshore Okinawa. They seized and occupied the offshore island, encountering a large number of civilians and a radio relay station operated by 25‚Äì30 Japanese soldiers.Bevin G. Cass, History of the Sixth Marine Division, (Wash., D.C.: Infantry Journal Press, 1948) Simultaneously, Major Tony Walker's 6th Marine Division Recon Company seized the eastern islands in the vicinity offshore from Okinawa. The recon Marines of the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion were awarded for their accomplishments, however the recon Marines were always inadequately commended due to public recognition. Rubber-stamped in very large letters on both top and bottom of the page clearly stated, 'TOP SECRET'. The Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion received a commendation from Major General A. D. Bruce of the 77th Infantry Division. The commendation notes that the battalion joined the Division at Leyte prior to departure for Okinawa Gunto, and Major Jones and his staff participated in the final planning phase for the operation, and that the information obtained during the patrols played a crucial part in the successful operations against Kerama Retto, Keise Shima, and Minna Shima, as well as valuable assistance during the Kerama Retto and Ie Shima operations. An endorsement personally signed by Lt General Simon Buckner also classified TOP SECRET, noted: :\\"... I personally followed the excellent performance of the Battalion with much interest and would add that the part played by this splendid organization materially assisted in the success of our present campaign. The close cooperation of the services, Marine and Army, was here exemplified to the highest degree.\\" Endorsement, 330.13 (TAGGG), April 21, 1945, lstEnd, TS, AG Ser No. 000196-B, May 15, 1945. 2ndEnd is signed personally by Roy S. Geiger, dtd August 10, 1945. All in personal papers of Col. James L. Jones. In addition, the battalion also received an unclassified commendation signed personally by General Joseph Stilwell, commanding Tenth Army: :\\"... for your superior performance under the capable leadership of Major James Jones in carrying out your assigned missions in the Ryukyus Campaign. The Fleet Marine Force may well be proud of the development of amphibious reconnaissance as exemplified by your activities. Use of your battalion as the 'only-ground reconnaissance' agency held under Tenth Army Headquarters expedited the accomplishment of all phases of the recent campaign. Your aggressive action made unnecessary the use of large forces in the seizure of the eastern islands of Okinawa, the islands off Motobu Peninsula and Kume Shima.\\"‚ÄîGeneral Joseph W. Stilwell, Tenth Army to Fleet Marine Force Reconnaissance Battalion. Disbandment Dissolution of the battalion following World War II was quick. The battalion embarked 1 ‚Äì August 22 on the , a slow-moving troop transport from Okinawa, formulating plans to invade one of the southern Ryukyu Islands toward mainland Japan. They had progressed as far as Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands when the first atomic bomb was dropped. The Company remained at Ulithi, 23 Aug ‚Äì 11 Sep, and embarked the President Johnson, arriving at Pearl Harbor September 12. Major Jones was transferred to the continental United States after having served 25 months under combative service, leaving his executive officer, Markovitch, to command the FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion. Post World War II 2nd Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion Since the deactivation of the 'first' FMFPAC Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion on September 24, 1945, there was no need for Fleet Marine Force-level reconnaissance between World War II and the Korean War. The only recon units that existed within the Marine Corps, were the Marine Division-level recon companies. After two years of the Korean War, the generals both at Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic and Fleet Marine Force, Pacific recommended to then-Marine Commandant Clifton Cates that the Marine Corps must reactivate the FMF-level reconnaissance capability. The Corps commanders need their own recon assets and should not rely on the already heavily tasked division recon companies. Major Regan Fuller formed the 2nd Amphib Recon Battalion in December 1950 at Camp Lejeune as commanding officer, including Leo Shinn as the executive officer and Harry C. Minnear became the S-3. With the 3rd Marine Division also reactivated (due to end of World War II), the Marine Corps now had three division-level recon companies and two small force- level amphib recon battalions. On the West Coast, the reappearance of a specialized reconnaissance unit at Camp Pendleton was promulgated by the motivated Colonel Victor Krulak from G-3 of FMFPac. After Krulak sent a message to the Commanding General of FMFPAC, the Amphibious Reconnaissance Platoon was formed on March 12, 1951. Located initially in the 15-area of Camp Pendleton, the Platoon later moved to the Del Mar area due to proximity to the ocean. First Lieutenant Francis \\"Bull\\" Kraince, who had been one of Houghton's Recon Company lieutenants in Korea, was designated officer in charge, and TSgts Ernest L. DeFazio and John W. Slagel, along with SSgt Neal D. King and Cpl Wiley B. Ballow were the only non-commissioned officers for the 55-man recon platoon. The remainder consisted of a platoon of \\"boots\\" directly out of the recruit depots. The platoon at one time or another included the Communications Chief (S-6), Sgt Al Gray and SSgt Dave Twohey, along with five or so more men who subsequently were commissioned Marine Colonels, and TSgt Stan Lamote and Puckett, who retired as a Major and Captain respectively. Reconstruction On 1 April 1953, the platoon was expanded into company size and Kraince was relieved by Major Witt as commanding officer. By October 1953, FMFPAC directed the redesignation of 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company, as the 1st Provisional Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion, remaining under the Fleet Marine Force and further directed deployment of one company to Kaneohe as an element of the 1st Provisional Amphibious Reconnaissance Group. 1st Provisional Amphibious Recon Group was activated on October 14, 1953. Further, the 1st Provisional Recon Group deployed to Marine Corps Air Facility Kaneohe Bay, Territory of Hawaii, on October 19, 1953, for duty with the First Provisional Air-Ground Task Force. Leaving Headquarters and Service and B Companies at Camp Pendleton, A Company remained at Kaneohe Bay. Personnel were to be rotated on a six-month basis. On January 11, 1954, the Company at Camp Pendleton was redesignated Headquarters and Service Company of 1st Provisional Reconnaissance Battalion. A minor redesignation on August 31, 1954, altered the Company's title to Headquarters Section, and six months later, on February 24, 1955, it was redesignated 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company and subsequently attached to Headquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division the following October. Bobby Joe Patterson, initially an avid diver attached to 1st Combat Service Group's S-3 shop, later became one of the principal developers of submarine lock‚Äîin/lock-out gear. His proficiency was such that, like so many subsequent Force Recon Marines, he worked later for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1962 to 1964, relieved by another Force Recon Marine, Sergeant Dossier. Perhaps the last commanding officer of the 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company was Michael M. Spark, known to his peers as \\"Cycle Michael\\", who was killed later in Vietnam serving as regimental commander. Marine Corps Test Unit One By the time the two FMF Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalions were in their reconstruction period, Marine Corps Test Unit #1, MCTU#1, was also formed in 1954 for testing methods of mobilizing its Marines in the atomic age. Captain Michael Spark, Commanding Officer of 1st Amphib Recon Company was relieved by Major Bruce F. Meyers. When 1st Amphib Recon Company returned from operation in the Panama Canal aboard the USS Perch (ASSP-313), on June 16, 1957, the re-developed Research and Development, Reconnaissance Platoon from the Marine Corps Test Unit One, became the co-founder of 1st Force Reconnaissance Company, when it molded into the dismantled 1st Amphib Recon Company. Missions and training Training The Combat Swimming Company was formed before the end of World War II at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton as part of a staging regiment to train Marines listed for duty overseas in sea survival, knife and club fighting, and various survival skills. It trained pilots, UDT, and amphibious reconnaissance Marines as replacement personnel for the FMF Amphib Recon Battalion. The Commanding Officer of the Combat Swimming Company, Capt. \\"Dutch\\" Smith, had won a gold medal for diving in the 1932 Summer Olympics. It was presented to him by Adolf Hitler. One of the swimming instructors, Bruce F. Meyers, later became the officer-in-charge of the Troop Training Unit, Pacific of the Amphibious Reconnaissance School, a school established for the Navy UDT and amphib recon Marines, during their process for further training in amphibious reconnaissance in preparation for their first engagements in the Pacific. While Meyers was an instructor, Chesty Puller was the commanding officer of the Troop Training Unit. Meyers became a significant figure in the formation of the modern-FMF-level recon units. The first major test of amphib recon unit occurred during the Atlantic Fleet Landing Exercise, Number 52, or LANTFLEX 52, a series of training exercises conducted 15‚Äì17 November 1951.CINCLANT letter FF 1-2/A3, Series 01079, 26 May 1952, to Chief of Naval Operations, Subj: LANTFLEX 52 report; HistDiv, HQMC, uncatalogued archives. For this exercise, FMFLANT's Task Force 22 was supported by the 2nd Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion under direct control of the Commander of Amphibious Troops.Commanding General, FMFLANT ltr 63/frm, A16-1 FLEX 52, Ser 0719, 22 December 1951, to CINCLANTFLT, Subj: LNTFLEX 52 report; HistDiv, HQMC, uncatalogued archives. One company of the battalion participated during the fall of 1952 aboard the USS Sea Lion (ASSP-315), first in Vieques, then acting as reconnaissance-in-force along the coast of North Carolina of 16‚Äì20 October 1952; both on Onslow Beach and an amphib recon mission in the vicinity of Bogue Field, 9‚Äì13 November 1952. During the exercise, the G-3 of FMFLANT ordered the amphib recon unit to conduct a raid. Major Fuller objected that such a mission was not appropriate, but the G-3 stayed confirmed and ordered Fuller to carry out his orders. Later, when Fuller was being confronted by General Erskine, Kenny Houghton, the aide to the General noted that Major Fuller merely followed his orders. Erskine understood; the G-3 gave no more inappropriate missions. It is believed to recon purists that reconnaissance patrols should not be used to augment infantry-ground forces. During the 1950s, training and employment of recon teams became similar to that of the Division's Recon Company. A recommendation was forwarded on 5 May 1954 by the Commanding General, FMFLANT, to the commanding generals of 2nd Marine Division and Force Troops, FMFLANT, proposing that the 2nd Amphib Recon Company and the Recon Company of 2nd Marine Division conduct similar training and deployments, the division recon company to train from an ASSP for 15 training days during the first and third quarters, the 2nd Amphibious Reconnaissance Company to train in the second and fourth quarters. Both were to be employed as a unit once a year in a LANTFLEX exercise, and both were to dispatch a team of one officer or staff NCO and four to six enlisted to the Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, or NELM Battalion (Reinforced) alternating this commitment. Marines of the Amphib Recon Platoon, FMFPAC trained until they became adept in rubber boat handling and made practice landings in Guam and Hawaii. The landing exercise, LEX ABLE-1, was held at San Clemente Island in September 1951; together with UDT Team 3, they conducted amphibious reconnaissance training exercises off USS Perch ASSP-313 at Midway and Guam, from 8 October through 3 November 1951. The Platoon also provided instructors to train pilots in escape and evasion tactics and interrogation resistance at March Air Force Base. Part of their 'practice mission' included conducting raids as well as reconnaissance. During one such exercise, the unit embarked a submarine to \\"capture\\" the vital installations at Adak, Alaska, defended by a 1000-man force. Seven days were allotted the amphibious reconnaissance Marines to accomplish their mission. The platoon trained in the Central Pacific in 1952 and the Arctic in early 1953. The unit embarked on a training program which included participation in a number of small amphibious landing exercises in Southern California such as Operation RAINBOW involving 400 Marines under the command of Major Phillip E. Booth, Commanding Officer of 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Company.Fleet Marine Force, Pacific; msg 102230Z/October 12, 1953. Force Troops GenO #72 and #73.

In early 1956, the Company, now commanded by Major Eugenous M. Hovatter, was ordered to Hawaii to train with the 1st Provisional Marine Air-Ground Task Force at Kaneohe Bay, 11 March‚Äì25 April. The Company provided a 125-man aggressor force against 8000 Marines for the exercise on the island of Kauai. Success of the former Platoon at Adak was repeated during this operation, in which two objectives were not only reconnoitered but seized as well. The first was immediately captured and the other was taken so swiftly the exercise was repeated to satisfy shocked observing officers. During this exercise the unit was armed with three heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, and nine mortars. Mission statement Raiding was officially part of the reconnaissance mission which was now defined to include: the execution of amphibious reconnaissance missions; and to possess the capability of executing amphibious raids of limited scope.

Meetings were held in the fall of 1993 to gather interest in the new church, with the first Sunday services held in January 1994. As the church began to gain more worshipers, it moved from the Hyatt Regency Hotel, to Regis High School, to the Denver Tech Center, before the fall 1995 purchase of a Cherry Hills Village site in Englewood. By 1997, a growing congregation created enough demand for three Sunday services and the consensus to develop multiple campuses in the metro area contrasting the idea of other popular megachurches. Nearby suburb Aurora, is chosen as the location for a second campus with an initial goal of five campuses to open in the metro area within ten years. In September 1999, services began at Rangeview High School in Aurora under the direction of Rev. Robert Gelinas. Like the initial campus, Aurora experiences phenomenal growth and moves to a newly renovated movie theater complex at Chambers Road and Iliff Avenue in February 2001. In the summer of 2001, CCC experiences the loss of Brewer who leaves to be senior pastor at Bel Air Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles. 2002 saw CCC welcoming Rev. Anthony Pranno as the new senior pastor of the Englewood campus, and Gelinas officially named Lead Senior Pastor of Colorado Community Church. The Aurora Campus' popularity saw the 2004 additions of two Saturday services to join the three Sunday morning worship times, as well as construction of a new worship space named The Upper Room. The Upper Room is located in an adjacent building, renovated to hold 250 people around tables in a different atmosphere than the traditional sanctuary setting. The Upper Room contains a coffee bar, a separate stage, and monitors and projection screens that simulcast the live service. The same year saw the creation of Project 127, a Christian-based adoption agency, which aims to place orphaned children of Colorado with families. In 2006, Colorado Community Church officially announced Hugo Venegas would be lead pastor of a new campus located in the old Stapleton Airport area of Denver. Base Camp Stapleton opened in March 2007, and offers a bilingual service located at William Roberts Elementary School. Fall 2008 saw the closing of the Stapleton Campus, the bilingual service was moved to Saturday evenings in the Upper Room and has since been moved to Sunday morning at Englewood. At the end of 2009, Robert Gelinas returned to Aurora as their full-time Sr. Pastor and continues to be the Lead Pastor for Colorado Community Church. Hugo Venegas was announced as the Sr. Pastor for Englewood in November 2009.

Life About 1602 he was sent to India, whence two years later he went to Ethiopia, where he soon won favour with Emperor Susenyos. Sent on missions for the king, Father Fernandes in 1613 was dispatched south to find a route to Malindi on the Indian Ocean. According to James Bruce, the Father first started for Gojjam with Fecur Egzie, a Catholic convert, and ten Portuguese companions. After obtaining guides for the region south of the Abay, they left Gojjam 15 April, made their way through the territory of the Gonga, through Bizamo and to Ennarea where they were warmly welcomed. After an audience with the Benero or king of Ennerea, who received them surprisingly coolly (due to the influence of an Ethiopian Orthodox monk who was opposed to the Father's journey) and sent them to Malindi by way of Bale. Ant√≥nio Fernandes then became the first European to see the Gibe River, crossing the river as he left Ennarea, and later described it as carrying \\"more Water than the Nile\\".Baltazar T√©llez, The Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia, 1710 (LaVergue: Kessinger, 2010), p. 194 They then travelled through the Kingdom of Janjero, then across the Omo to Kambaata where they were detained for two days at Sangara. Upon reaching the ruler of Kambaata, Hamalmal, they found another Ethiopian Christian named Manquer, had arrived and claimed that the Father and his companions were to return to Susenyos' court. All three parties ‚Äì Hamalmal, Father Fernandes, and Manquer ‚Äì sent to Susenyos for instructions the ruler of Kambaata detained Manquer, waited three months for his reply, and found that the Emperor desired the Father to continue his journey south; Hamalmal detained Manquer and the Father and his party continued to the land of the Alaba. Their ruler, Aliko, was initially cool to this party, and when Manquer arrived to obstruct their journey, he imprisoned the party, where several of the Portuguese died. A council was then held, which decided to return the survivors to Kambaata, whence they returned to Gorgora, according to Bruce, \\"without any sort of advantage to themselves.\\"James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3 pp. 325‚Äì342 Father Fernandes translated various liturgical books into Ethiopian, and was the author of ascetical and polemical works against the other faiths prevalent in Ethiopia. Susenyos, years later, converted to Catholicism in 1622, after the arrival of Afonso Mendes, the Latin Patriarch of Ethiopia. Fernandes at this time became superior of the mission to Ethiopia, though his advice wasn't always heeded.Adrian Hastings, The Church in Africa, 1450-1950 (1996), p. 154. Susenyos publicly acknowledged the primacy of the Roman See and made Catholicism the state religion in 1626. For a time conversions were made, the monarch resorting to compulsion. However the Emperor's son, Fasilides, sided with the native church, and after his father's death restored the former faith proscribing the Catholic religion under the penalty of death. The missionaries, on their expulsion, found a temporary protector in one of the petty princes of the country, by whom, however, they were soon abandoned. Those who reached the port of Massowah were held for a ransom. Father Fernandes, then over seventy years of age, was one of those detained as hostage, but a younger companion persuaded the pasha to substitute him, and Fernandes was allowed to return to India, where he ended his days.

The Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Oregon Islands Wilderness protect wildlife and habitat on all of the approximately 130 rocks and islands along the corridor's shore.  History  The area was used by Native Americans. Later, it was used by several (now abandoned) mining operations, whose ruins are still visible. At the Indian Sands site within the park, archaeological finds have provided evidence of human activity in this area 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, which is likely the result of migration along the Pacific coast from the area of the Bering Land Bridge. The first acquisition for the park was purchased in May 1949. There were at least 12 additional purchases made by May 1957. The Oregon Parks commission received its first alien gift of made in 1950 by Borax Consolidated, Ltd of London, which retains the right to mine underground minerals such as borax. The company acquired the land around 1880 for mining purposes. There have never been overnight facilities.

The house was built in 1818 and was originally part of the Bandon estate of the 6th Duke of Devonshire. Kilbrogan House History  Kilbrogan House, and its accompanying stables, has stood on its site since 1818. Some original Georgian features include ornate cornicings in the main reception rooms and above the stairwell and entrance hall. A cantilever stairs leads upwards to the second floor. Kilbrogan stairs The house was leased by the Devonshire Estate to John Hornibrook, a local tanner. In 1896, Spencer Compton, the 8th Duke of Devonshire, sold the freehold to George Thomas Jones who was a land agent. He held on to the house for only four years and on 16 March 1900 he sold the freehold to his business partner, Richard Wheeler Doherty. An auction of the effects of George Thomas Jones took place in the house in 1900 and included rare and expensive paintings, oil and water colours, engravings as well as furniture and Dresden and other ornaments. A large greenhouse was erected on the south wall of the garden in 1901 and the conservatory on the first floor of the house was most likely added at the same time. Richard Wheeler Doherty leased the house to a family of McCarthys who were solicitors in the town. They moved out in 1912 and the house was then leased to Joseph Brennan who lived in the house until 1946. Brennan's business interests in the town included a bakery, a brewery, a corn merchants, a mill and electric company and a grocery and wine business. He had flour mills on the northern side of the river adjacent to the weir and supplied electric power to the town from 1919 until 1939. The mills were destroyed by fire in May 1968. Joseph Brennan's son, also Joseph Brennan, was a civil servant who became Secretary of the Department of Finance, Chairman of the Currency Commission from 1927 until 1943 and was governor of the Central Bank of Ireland from 1943 to 1953. His signature appeared on the Irish Currency notes for many years. The house became known locally as \\"Jo Pound Note\\". The freehold of the home passed from Richard Doherty to his wife and then to his daughter in 1939. She sold the freehold of the property in 1967 to Eugene Callanan, a medical doctor who owned the leasehold of the house since 1946 when the Brennans moved out. The house passed from Eugene Callanan's daughter Margaret to her son Ben Shorten. In 1992, the present owner started renovating the house and in March 2004 opened the formerly private residence for guest accommodation including bed and breakfast and self-catering.

This species is electroactive, and its toxicity arises from the ability of this dication to interrupt biological electron transfer. Because of its structure, 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine can bridge between metal centres to give coordination polymers. 4,4‚Ä≤-Bipyridine can also mediate electronic effects between two paramagnetic metal centers. History 4,4‚Ä≤-Bipyridine was first obtained in 1868 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Anderson (1819‚Äì1874) via heating pyridine with sodium metal.See: * Anderson called 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine \\"Dipyridine\\". * German translation: * See also: See Œ≥-Dipyridyl. However, Anderson's empirical formula for 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine was incorrect.Anderson gave the empirical formula for 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine as C10H10N2. See: * (Anderson, 1868), p. 209. * (Fehling, 1890), p. 974 (Œ≥-Dipyridyl). The correct empirical formula, and the correct molecular structure, for 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine was provided in 1882 by the Austrian chemist Hugo Weidel and his student M. Russo. The empirical formula for 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine (Œ≥-Dipyridyl) appears on p. 856 ; the molecular structure of 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine (Œ≥-Dipyridyl) appears on p. 867.  Uses  4,4'-Bipyridine is an intermediate in the production of paraquat, a widely-used herbicide. In this process, pyridine is oxidized to 4,4'-bipyridine in a coupling reaction, followed by dimethylation to form paraquat. :700px References Category:Bipyridines ","title":"4,4'-Bipyridine"},{"id":"17651431","text":"In statistics, the Newcastle‚ÄìOttawa scale is a tool used for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies included in a systematic review and/or meta- analyses.

History Free French RAF Squadron 340 (GC Ile de France) Spitfire bearing the Cross of Lorraine marking in the Paris Le Bourget museum. Becoming operational on 29 November with the operational code 'GW', the squadron flew defensive patrols until moving south in April 1942 to begin fighter sweeps over northern France. Between 1 April and 8 April 1942, the squadron was based at Redhill Aerodrome near Gatwick and between 27 July 1942 and 20 March 1943, at RAF Biggin Hill. In March 1943, the squadron was withdrawn for rest and returned to Scotland, moving to south-west England in November for fighter sweeps and anti-shipping operations off Brittany. Joining 145 Wing of the Second Tactical Air Force (2 TAF) in April 1944, 340 Squadron helped to provide fighter cover for the Normandy landings, then moved to France that August. After moving forward to Belgium in September 1944, the squadron returned to the UK to fly bomber escort missions and was based at Biggin Hill again between 3 November and 19 November 1944. In February 1945, the squadron rejoined 2 TAF in the Netherlands and for the rest of the war flew fighter sweeps over Germany. After a short period with the occupation forces, 340 was transferred to the control of the Armee de l'Air (French Air Force) on 25 November 1945. During the war years, 340 flew 7,845 sorties and over 10,000 flight hours. It claimed 37 enemy aircraft destroyed with 5 more 'probables' and over 500 vehicles and locomotives. Thirty of its pilots were killed and 6 became prisoners of war. Many more were injured, some seriously. For its gallant actions, 340 Squadron was awarded the French Croix de la Liberation. This was awarded to the heroes of the liberation of France and is an exception honour, second only to the Legion d'Honneur. Only 18 were awarded to French military units. In addition to the unit award, 19 squadron members were appointed to the order with the title Compagnon de la Liberation. Other awards included one M√©daille militaire, four Citations a l'Ordre de l'Armee and one Citation a l'Ordre des FAFL.History of 340 Squadron In the years since the war, the squadron has become French Air Force Escadron de Chasse 2/5 √éle-de- France.

Biography Miriam Shinezon (Ben-Porat) was born in 1918 in Vitebsk, Belarus (then Russia), the youngest of three sisters and four brothers. She grew up in Lithuania, where her parents owned a textile factory. After finishing high school in 1936, she immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine by herself. Most of her family was murdered in the Holocaust. In the Yishuv, she changed her name to Ben- Porat. She was one of the first women to study law at the Hebrew University, and in 1945 she was admitted to the bar.Salokar and Volcansek (1996), p. 38 Judicial career In 1949 she began to work in the State Attorney's office, and by 1953 she became the deputy State Attorney. In 1959 she was appointed as a judge in the Jerusalem District Court. Her swearing-in ceremony was boycotted by the Israeli Bar Association. Only following a public scandal, an apology was arranged between her and the Jerusalem Chamber of Advocates. By 1975, she became the President of the Jerusalem District Court. From 1964 through 1978, she was also a professor at the Hebrew University, specializing in contracts and commercial notes. In 1977, she became the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court.Salokar and Volcansek (1996), p. 38, 40Edelman (1994), p. 39 In 1988, upon reaching the retirement age for judges, she was elected by the Knesset to be the State Comptroller. She was the first woman to serve in this position. After five years, she was reelected. State Comptroller Ben-Porat presenting report to Israeli President Chaim Herzog In 1990, she published a report on the Israeli water system that led to the dismissal of the water commissioner. She also criticized government procedures for absorbing immigrants from the former Soviet Union; and the investigation of policemen accused of wrongdoing, which led to the establishment of the Justice Ministry police investigation unit. In 1991, she exposed the funds transfer by Minister of Interior Aryeh Deri to Shas institutions, which led to his trial. She also reported shortcomings in Israel's preparations to the Gulf War. She stopped a deal planned by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon to purchase 20,000 apartments from one contractor company. In 1992 she criticized the Housing Ministry, leading to the firing and indictment of Amidar chairman of the board, Uri Shani. In 1993, the law of government companies was amended following a report she published in 1989. She also managed to postpone a plan proposed by Finance Minister Avraham Shohat to sell Bank Hapoalim shares. In 1994 she pointed out suspicions of Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer's commitments to transfer funds to local authorities affiliated with the Labour Party. In 1995, she assailed the Shin Bet for breaching the Landau Commission report on torture. A criminal investigation was opened against major figures in the Ministry of Religious affairs, based on her report.Perry and Ironside (1999), p. 158 She also led to the amendment of the arrest law. In 1996 she revealed that the Transportation Minister Israel Kessar had allotted funds to local authorities, preferring authorities whose heads are Labour Party members. In 1997 she criticized the government's handling of the Israel Dockyards company during the time in which the company was in a state of temporary liquidation. On July 4, 1998, at the end of two terms, she retired from her position as State Comptroller, although she stayed involved in public activity and writing.

Life He was the son of Thomas Falkner, a Manchester apothecary, and had Calvinist, maybe Scottish heritage, but obtained his education at the Manchester grammar school. Later on, having studied medicine under Dr. Richard Mead, he became a surgeon and practised at his native place. His own health being delicate, he was advised to take a sea-voyage, and being acquainted with a ship chaplain on board the Assiento, a vessel trading with Guinea and carrying slaves to Buenos Aires, he accepted an invitation to accompany the vessel as surgeon. This was in or about 1731. On reaching Buenos Aires he was so ill that the captain was compelled to leave him there in the care of Father Mahoney, the superior of the Jesuit College. Here he recovered his health, and was received into the Roman Catholic Church. On 15 May 1732, he entered the Society of Jesus, becoming a member of the Paraguay province. Having spent some time at the Jesuit College of Cordoba del Tucum√°n in the city of C√≥rdoba, he went as a missionary to the Puelches, near Rio Segundo. His knowledge of medicine and mechanics procured for him considerable influence among the native peoples. In 1740 or soon after he was sent to assist Father Matthias Strobel in his mission to the Tehuelche people at Laguna de los Padres, 12 miles west of the present day city of Mar del Plata, the first permanent human settlement in the region. For more than 30 years he worked among the Tehuelches. In 1768 the Jesuits were expelled from South America by Royal Decree of Charles III of Spain. Falkner returned to England where, in 1771 or 1772, he joined the English province of the Society. He was appointed chaplain to Robert Berkeley of Spetchley. He then became chaplain to Mr. Berington of Winsley in Herefordshire, and afterwards to the Plowdens of Plowden Hall in Shropshire. Scientific discoveries He is credited with discovering the first fossil in present-day Argentina, an early landmark in Argentinian science. In 1760 Falkner discovered the skeleton of a big armadillo on the banks of Carcara√±√° River, near the village of Santa Fe; many years later the fossil was identified as originating from a glyptodon. This event occurred 27 years before the Dominican friar Manuel Torres discovered the fossil of a megatherium on the banks of Luj√°n River in 1787, later studied and described by Georges Cuvier in 1796. Cartography He was employed by the Spanish government in 1750 to draw a map of the coast of South America from the south of Brazil to Tierra del Fuego, which on its completion was printed in 1761 at Quito, and was noted for its accuracy. He also designed a chart of Paraguay in 1757, a chart of Tucuman in 1759, and several others of less importance. Works He wrote an account of his Patagonian experiences, which was published at Hereford in 1774 under the title A Description of Patagonia and the adjoining parts of South America, with a grammar and a short vocabulary, and some particulars relating to Falkland's Islands. The book as published was not his original work, but a compilation by William Combe, who used Falkner's papers. The book was translated into German, French, and Spanish. Another account of the Patagonians due to Father Falkner is found in the works of Thomas Pennant, who described his essay as \\"formed from the relation of Fr. Falkner, a Jesuit, who had resided among them thirty-eight years\\". After his death, the Spanish Jesuits who had known him in South America were anxious to obtain his unpublished works. They included treatises on the botanical and mineral products of America, and American distempers as cured by American drugs. It is stated by Fr. Caballero, S.J., that he had also edited Volumina duo de anatomia corporis humani. Lake Falkner in Argentina is named after him, as well as a street in the city of Mar del Plata.

Although rugby had been played in Pontarddulais before the club's formation, it was not until 22 September 1881 that the local inhabitants decided on creating an official rugby club.

History Swansea University first attempted to establish a medical school in the 1960s but initially missed out to other schools. The university did succeed in introducing Genetics and Biochemistry departments, laying the foundations for future expansion into medicine. Following Welsh political devolution in the 1990s, fresh calls were made to establish a medical school to serve the people of south-west Wales. In 2001, the Welsh Government established a medical school at the university's Singleton Park campus.

It was the first Energy Star-compliant PC, consuming very little power relative to other contemporary PCs, and made extensive use of recycled materials in its enclosure. Specifications The PS/2E featured an IBM 486SLC2 microprocessor with a 16KB L1 cache that ran at 50MHz on a 25MHz system bus (the processor clock was double that of the system bus). The processor's performance was dependent on the L1 cache containing the required instructions and data; there was no external L2 cache on the motherboard like on some other 486-based computers. It featured an ISA bus for input/output, which accepted a single ISA option adapter with the use of a riser card. Depending on the sub-model number, it came supplied with either a special option adapter for four PC card PCMCIA slots, or a network interface card for Ethernet or Token Ring networks for use as a diskless workstation. Additional options included several PCMCIA cards, a color LCD screen, and a color LCD touch-screen with a special version of OS/2. The PC borrowed some components from IBM's ThinkPad laptops: including the 1.44MB floppy disk drive and the hard disk drive. Its enclosure was composed of recycled plastics, and was designed to be easily recycled at the end of its service life. The power supply unit maximum power consumption was 24watts, and was completely passively cooled, and lacked a fan for that reason.

It was re-released in March 2011 under the title Limitless, in order to coincide with its 2011 film adaptation.Limitless, Amazon, accessed 18 March 2011. Plot Edward \\"Eddie\\" Spinola is a copywriter at a small publishing house in New York City. He starts using MDT-48, an experimental drug granting heightened intellectual, creative, and learning powers, and enabling its user to see meaningful patterns in large amounts of disparate data. Using his newly acquired intellect, Edward amasses a small fortune short selling technology stocks. His trading escapades don't go unnoticed, and he is offered a job by billionaire tycoon Carl Van Loon, mediating the merger between entertainment giant MCL Parnasis and Abraxis, the country's second largest Internet service provider ‚Äì a deal he sees to completion. However, his indiscriminate use of the drug leads to panic attacks and blackouts. Edward is suspected of bludgeoning to death Donatella Alvarez, the wife of a prominent Mexican artist, during an MDT induced fugue state. He further learns the full scope of the side-effects from his ex-wife Melissa, who had dabbled in the substance and suffered permanent neurocognitive damage, prompting him to gradually discontinue use of the drug. Edward initially reduces his intake to half a pill a day, but this quickly proves insufficient to maintain the level of mental acuity required to work out the details of the merger, and he is forced to increase the dosage. Realizing he is on a treadmill of addiction, Edward tracks down another user, from whom he learns of the existence of a drug, readily available over the counter, capable of negating some of the harmful side-effects. Armed with this knowledge, Edward resumes taking MDT and is filled with a renewed surge of energy and motivation. This proves to be a mere stop-gap measure, as Edward realizes the need to secure a steady supply. His stash running out, Edward makes a desperate attempt to blackmail the pharmaceutical conglomerate responsible for developing MDT into providing him with continued access to the drug. His gambit fails when men break into his apartment and steal his remaining MDT. He then receives an anonymous phone call on his land-line informing him that he had been under surveillance all along, and an unwitting guinea pig in a clandestine clinical drug trial. Facing imminent death from withdrawal, Edward comes to terms with his own actions and travels to Mahopac, New York, where he seeks redemption by leaving a bag full of cash at his ex-wife's doorstep. He then continues driving aimlessly up north, and eventually checks into a remote motel along the Vermont highway, where he pens his account of the last few months of his life and the events leading to his ultimate downfall. As he drifts into a semi- conscious state, Edward watches on as the President ‚Äì visibly under the influence of MDT ‚Äì announces the deployment of US troops into Mexico in a televised address to the nation. Adaptations Film Limitless is a 2011 American thriller based on The Dark Fields. The film was directed by Neil Burger and starred Bradley Cooper, Abbie Cornish, Andrew Howard and Robert De Niro. It was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011. The screenplay roughly mirrors the events portrayed in the book, albeit with a number of significant differences. For example, the novel is set during the peak and subsequent collapse of the Dot-com bubble, with allusions by several characters to \\"irrational exuberance\\" in the financial markets. Meanwhile, and while Edward mentions adverse market conditions indicating a bear market, the viewer is never given a clear time frame for the events portrayed in the film. Similarly, any mention of the growing tensions between the United States and Mexico is also absent from the movie adaptation, as is any reference to government involvement with MDT-48 (renamed NZT-48). The role of several characters was also changed in the movie adaptation, while others are altogether absent. Hank Atwood, for instance, who is shown to be quite fond of Edward in the novel, has no qualms about hiring a hitman to eliminate him and steal his supply of NZT in the film. Carl Van Loon, too, takes a similarly antagonistic view towards Edward, whom he tries to blackmail into doing his political bidding in exchange for a steady supply of the drug. Van Loon's daughter, the object of Edward's infatuation in the novel, is replaced by Lindy ‚Äì who leaves him at the beginning of the movie, only to rekindle their relationship after being charmed by Edward's NZT persona. (Illuminating) The Dark Fields is mentioned in the film as the name of the book written by the main character. Television A spinoff of the film based on the novel premiered in 2015, under the same title. It is a sequel which follows the events of the film.  Sequel  A sequel to the book The Dark Fields, Under the Night, was announced by its author and Amazon indicated that the sequel (in ebook form) would be available as from 4 October 2018. It was subsequently republished in America as Receptor: A Novel, released on 8 January 2019. In 1950s Manhattan ad man Ned Sweeney finds himself an unwitting participant in MK Ultra trials, the CIA's covert study of psychoactive drugs. The experiment introduces him to MDT-48, a mind-expanding smart drug, which takes him away from his wife and young son and straight to the corridors of the richest and most powerful people of his day. But before long, Ned is dead. Over 60 years later, Ned's grandson, Ray, meets Clay Proctor‚Äîa retired government official who may be able to illuminate not only Ned's life and death, and also the truth behind the mysterious MDT-48.

Little and distributed by Warner Bros. and Anchor Bay Entertainment. It was written by Alan B. McElroy and is based on the fighting game series of the same name. Its story follows Jin Kazama in his attempts to enter the Iron Fist Tournament in order to avenge the loss of his mother, Jun Kazama, by confronting his father, Kazuya Mishima and his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima, the latter of whom he thought was responsible for her death. It stars Jon Foo, Kelly Overton, Cary- Hiroyuki Tagawa, Ian Anthony Dale, Cung Le, Darrin Dewitt Henson, Luke Goss, Marian Zapico, Lateef Crowder, Cand√Æce Hillebrand, Anton Kasabov, and Roger Huerta. The film was produced by Crystal Sky Pictures and premiered on November 5, 2009 at the AFI Film Festival and was released in Japan on March 20, 2010. It grossed $1.7 million worldwide. Tekken spawned the 2014 prequel Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge. Plot Setting In the late 2010s, after the Terror War has destroyed much of civilization, 8 megacorporations survived and divided up the world around them; the biggest being Tekken Corporation, which controls North America. In order to placate the masses, the corporation's Chairman, Heihachi Mishima, sponsors the King of Iron Fist Tournament, or Iron Fist - in which fighters from the 8 corporations battle until one is left standing and receives a lifetime of stardom and wealth. In contrast to the rich and lush Tekken City, there is the slum area surrounding it, referred to as the Anvil. Story Jin Kazama has been raised by his mother, Jun, She has trained him in martial arts and has been a mentor, yet she never speaks of Jin's father, claiming he is dead. In 2039, Jin is now a rebellious 19-year-old teenage fighter and contraband runner who lives in the Anvil, and usually goes into fights and cooperates with the resistance groups to earn money to provide food (fruit, coffee and chocolate have become expensive and rare commodities in the Anvil). One night, Jin is targeted by the Jackhammers, the elite specs group that patrols the Anvil and ensures the safety of Tekken City, for cooperating with the resistance groups. He tries to return to his home, only to find his mother, Jun, killed by the Jackhammers bombarding the house. Grieving the loss of his mother and feeling guilty that he had not protected her, Jin swears revenge against Heihachi. In the ruins of his former home, he finds a Tekken Fighter I.D. belonging to Jun, revealing she was once an Iron Fist fighter. Furious about this, he decides to try out at the Open Call, which lets the Anvil pick a fighter for the tournament. After defeating the disgraced Marshall Law, who was dropped out of the Tournament and forced to fight in the Open Call, Jin is sponsored by former boxer Steve Fox, sponsor of the Open Call and former Iron Fist fighter, and is hailed \\"The People's Choice\\", who takes him to Tekken City. Upon entering Tekken City, Jin befriends mixed martial artist Christie Monteiro. After witnessing Raven overpower Capoeira fighter Eddy Gordo in the first match, Jin wins the match against Miguel Caballero Rojo, nearly killing him in a fit of rage. Heihachi's son, Kazuya Mishima, is impressed and offers Jin a place in Tekken Corp., but Jin refuses. Later that night, after sneaking out with Christie and visiting a nightclub, Jin is attacked by masked assassins, on the orders of Kazuya, who is scheming to take over Tekken and sees Jin as a possible obstacle since he is hailing as People's Choice. Jin survives the assassination attempt, thanks to Christie's interference. Steve and Christie attempt to discourage Jin from continuing in the tournament, but Jin vows to win Iron Fist and kill both Heihachi and Kazuya, and he gives Fox Jun's ID, he realizes he is her son, telling him that he knew her. Meanwhile, Kazuya blackmails the tournament's champion, Bryan Fury, into killing Jin in a match or be exposed as a partial cyborg, banning him from the tournament for life (cyborgs are banned from fighting). During the quarter-finals, Christie is paired with Nina Williams. But before the fight, Jin notices Nina's face, she was one of the assassins. After Christie defeats Nina, Jin is matched up with an elite swordsman named Yoshimitsu. Heihachi, liking this young fighter, deems that this match be reserved for the semi-finals and attempts to change the order, but Kazuya, who controls the Jackhammers, stops him. Kazuya then has Heihachi imprisoned and orders the match to begin, effectively seizing control of Tekken. Jin narrowly defeats Yoshimitsu, thanks to Heihachi tripping a security alert in the arena. Following the match, Kazuya orders all of the fighters to be detained. He tells them that the rules have changed, and so they must now fight to the death. Jin, Christie, and Steve try to escape, along with Raven, leaving Nina & Anna Williams and Sergei Dragunov behind, since they were in a separate cell. Kazuya notices them escaping and brings down some guards, causing a firefight. Steve, Christie, and Raven cover Jin but he walks across Heihachi's cell. Angry, he tries to taunt him, saying he is responsible for killing his mother. However, because Heihachi is their only chance of escaping Tekken, Steve frees Heihachi and joins the group. On the gunfight, Raven is wounded and recaptured, while the others make it out to the Anvil. In the warehouse that Jin uses as protection, Heihachi reveals to Jin the true nature of his origin. 20 years ago, Jun was fighting in the first Iron Fist tournament placed by the Tekken Corporation after the war, and she impressed Kazuya, who raped her, making him Jin's father, and left her for dead. She survived the assault and Heihachi took her out of Tekken City to the Anvil to keep her alive. Heihachi also tells Jin that since he is Heihachi's grandson, he could become the next Chairman. He also states the corporation's true purpose is to restore order to the world, though Jin can't believe what he is being told, believing that the corporation is spreading terror and fear to its residents. Heihachi entrusts Jin with the task of defeating Kazuya. Later on, the group is located by Jackhammers, who kill Steve Fox in a firefight and recapture the rest of the escapees. Before taking them back to Iron Fist, Kazuya orders the Jackhammers to execute Heihachi. Back in Tekken City, Raven comforts a dispirited Jin, saying that he saw what Jin did to Miguel Rojo and reminding him that anger doesn't fuel the soul, but incinerates it. Raven tells Jin that because there are many people depending on him, he can become champion without letting anger take control of his body. In the Finals, Jin is forced to fight against Bryan Fury, who had already killed Sergei Dragunov in a death match, while Kazuya holds Christie in the control room. At first he is outmatched, but remembering his mother's teachings, Jin kills Bryan. Angered about Jin's victory, Kazuya enters the tournament himself, armed with half moon axes, and begins the final match. The weaponless Jin is battered and is about to lose. He is saved, though, when Christie escapes by shooting the Jackhammers guarding her, creating a distraction. This allows Jin to wound and pin Kazuya, who baits Jin by claiming that he remembers how Jun \\"put up quite a fight.\\" Kazuya taunts him into inheriting the Mishima Curse (Heihachi imprisoned and killed his father and Kazuya presumably murdered Heihachi), but Jin refuses to kill his father, stating that it is not his curse. Christie comes to the stage and declares Jin the new Champion of Tekken. Elated, the crowd both in and outside the arena cheer for him. When Christie asks where he will go, he replies that he will go home to the Anvil, since he doesn't want to run the corporation. He walks out of Tekken City's gate and is saluted by the Jackhammers - symbolizing his new role as CEO of Tekken Corp. In a voiceover, Christie explains that Jin's victory made the Kazama family name synonymous with hope in the Anvil, but that the true legacy of Tekken is only beginning. After the credits, the scene shifts to Kazuya, who walks out of the arena and realizes that he lost control of the Jackhammers, who refuse to salute him. Back at Heihachi's execution, he kneels in front of a Jackhammer, who is holding him at gunpoint. His final words are: \\"I am Heihachi Mishima. I...am...Tekken. You will obey.\\" The Jackhammer lowers down his gun and obeys his command.

Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 19, 2011. Reception Tekken holds no critical score, but has a 31% approval rating by audiences on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 2.68/10. Katsuhiro Harada, director of the Tekken video game series, criticized the film: \\"That Hollywood movie is terrible. We were not able to supervise that movie; it was a cruel contract. I'm not interested in that movie.\\" Reacting to Harada's comments, Nick Chester of Destructoid said the film is \\"not great, but 'terrible' is a stretch,\\" saying that it \\"does a decent job of trying to stay true to the look and feel of the [games]\\" and that \\"the fight scenes weren't bad.\\" Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk gave the film two stars out of five, writing: \\"Tekken is a failure on many levels, but it does make a plucky attempt to replicate the flippy-floppy nature of the fighting elements, creating a limb-snapping effort of escapism surrounded by bland writing and sleepy performances.\\" He opined that director Dwight H. Little \\"show[s] off an impressive spectrum of fighting styles and intensity, though he goes a little crazy with trendy cinematographic choices and hyperactive editing.\\"Tekken (Blu-ray) : DVD Talk Review of the Blu-ray - Brian Orndorf, DVD Talk, July 13, 2011 Paul Pritchard of DVD Verdict compared Tekken to other video game film adaptations, writing: \\"In the grand scheme of things, Tekken bests both Street Fighter and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li movies with ease, but lacks the goofy charms of Mortal Kombat. Had it embraced its roots more openly, the film may well have offered more excitement. As it is, Tekken is just an average action flick, with nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the crowd.\\"DVD Verdict Review - Tekken (Blu-ray) (Region B) - Paul Pritchard, DVD Verdict, June 10th, 2011 Prequel On May 17, 2012, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Crystal Sky Pictures will bring back the prequel to Tekken. Producer Steven Paul told that the film titled Tekken: Rise of the Tournament has no cast set but the cast will resemble the characters from the games. On January 8, 2014, it was reported that the title had been renamed to Tekken: A Man Called X, starring Kane Kosugi, and the production was set to start later that month. Five days later, it was reported that the filming had begun in co- production of Lionsgate Entertainment and Crystal Sky Pictures. However, Kosugi's official website corrected the confusion with a non-Tekken film with the title Agent X. The Tekken film was renamed to Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge, which was directed by Wych Kaos and released on DVD on August 12, 2014.

Research Throughout the past two decades, he has been conducting research in the fields of psychology of learning and hybrid neural network (in particular, applying these models to research on human skill acquisition). Specifically, he has worked on the integrated effect of \\"top-down\\" and \\"bottom-up\\" learning in human skill acquisition,R. Sun, Duality of the Mind. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ. 2002.R. Sun, Anatomy of the Mind: Exploring Psychological Mechanisms and Processes with the Clarion Cognitive Architecture. Oxford University Press, New York. 2016. in a variety of task domains, for example, navigation tasks,R. Sun, E. Merrill, and T. Peterson, From implicit skills to explicit knowledge: A bottom-up model of skill learning. Cognitive Science, Vol.25, No.2, pp.203-244. 2001. reasoning tasks, and implicit learning tasks.R. Sun, P. Slusarz, and C. Terry, The interaction of the explicit and the implicit in skill learning: A dual-process approach. Psychological Review, Vol.112, No.1, pp.159-192. 2005. This inclusion of bottom-up learning processes has been revolutionary in cognitive psychology, because most previous models of learning had focused exclusively on top-down learning (whereas human learning clearly happens in both directions). This research has culminated with the development of an integrated cognitive architecture that can be used to provide a qualitative and quantitative explanation of empirical psychological learning data. The model, CLARION, is a hybrid neural network that can be used to simulate problem solving and social interactions as well. More importantly, CLARION was the first psychological model that proposed an explanation for the \\"bottom-up learning\\" mechanisms present in human skill acquisition: His numerous papers on the subject have brought attention to this neglected area in cognitive psychology. Relatedly, he has done pioneering work on dual process theory. Also known as two-system or two-level theories, his dual-process theories posit the co-existence of and the interaction between implicit and explicit processes.R. Sun, Integrating Rules and Connectionism for Robust Commonsense Reasoning. John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY. 1994.R. Sun, Duality of the Mind: A Bottom-up Approach towards Cognition. Taylor and Francis. 2002. Another strand of his work is a theoretical model of creative problem solving.S. Helie and R. Sun, Incubation, insight, and creative problem solving: A unified theory and a connectionist model. Psychological Review, Vol.117, No.3, pp.994-1024. 2010. In this work (with S. Helie), he proposed an integrative theory that is much broader in explanatory scope and used it to account for a range of empirical phenomena. Yet another strand is what he called cognitive social sciences --- the re-unification of the cognitive and social sciences through grounding the social sciences in the cognitive sciences.R. Sun, (ed.) Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2006.R. Sun, Grounding Social Sciences in Cognitive Sciences. MIT Press, Cambridge MA. 2012.

Background Ragusa was a bay horse bred by Harry Frank Guggenheim. He was sired by Ribot, who was standing in Italy when Guggenheim sent his mare Fantan to be covered in 1959. The mare proved very difficult to get \\"in foal\\" and did not conceive until 15 June, well after the usual breeding season had finished. Ragusa was a small and weak foal who needed to be hand fed on milk and eggs, and Guggenheim decided to sell him. At the Ballsbridge Sales in September 1961, Ragusa was sold for 3,800 guineas, to Paddy Prendergast on behalf of James R. Mullion and Meg Mullion of the Ardenode stud in County Kildare, Ireland. Racing career 1962: two-year-old season Ragusa made his first racecourse appearance in October 1962 at the Curragh where he won the Suir Maiden Plate over seven furlongs. 1963: three-year-old season On his first appearance of the 1963 season, Ragusa was sent to England, where he started favourite for the Dee Stakes at Chester Racecourse but finished second to My Myosotis. In June, he started a 25/1 outsider for the Derby at Epsom and exceeded expectations by finishing third of the twenty-six runners behind Relko and Merchant Venturer. At the Curragh later that month, Ragusa won the Irish Derby by two and a half lengths after Relko was withdrawn at the start. In July, Ragusa started at odds of 4/1 in a field of ten runners for Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, he King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He won by four lengths from the four-year-old Miralgo. At York Racecourse in August, he defeated the 2000 Guineas winner Only for Life in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at odds of 2/5. At Doncaster Racecourse in September, Ragusa started the 2/5 favourite for the St Leger and won in a canter by six lengths. 1964: four- year-old season Ragusa began his third season by winning the Ardenode Stakes at Naas, then ran third in the Royal Whip Stakes at the Curragh. In July, he returned to England and won the Eclipse Stakes by one and a half lengths from Baldric. On his final racecourse appearance, he finished unplaced in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Stud career Ragusa was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. The best of his progeny included Morston, Ragstone, Caliban (Coronation Cup), and Homeric. Ragusa died in 1973.

The principle behind such a time-keeping device is that it measure a quantity that either decreases or increases at a constant rate. Lamps or candles, burning fuel at a steady pace, fit this category, and as a bonus produce useful light. Hourglasses depend on the steady draining of fine sand through a small aperture.

The college grants a range of bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as teaching certificates in a variety of fields. It is a recognized academic institution, accredited by the Council for Higher Education (CHE), and as a public institution is partially financed by the Planning and Budget Committee (PBC). Approximately 3,500 students are enrolled at the college, 2,500 of whom are studying for academic degrees, and 1,000 of whom are studying in programs for professional certification, continuing studies programs, preparatory programs for completing high school matriculation certificates, and designated preparatory programs for students aiming to register for particular academic tracks.  History  Achva Academic College was established in 1971 by the Beer Tuvia Regional Council, [1] as a teachers' college. In the early 1970s, the college offered study programs for technicians and practical mechanical engineers, construction and industrial management, together with study programs in teaching including two- year tracks in early childhood education and one-year programs for aides in early childhood educational settings. In 1993, the college was approved by the CHE to offer study programs under the academic supervision of Ben-Gurion University. This was followed in 1995 by the CHE allowing Achva to award B.Ed. degrees subject to its approval in early childhood, elementary and middle school tracks, from its departments of education, literature, history, mathematics, sciences, Judaic studies, Hebrew language, and special education. In 1998, the CHE approval became full accreditation for Achva to grant these degrees at its discretion. At the same time, Arabic, English, and computers were added to the fields in which Achva was authorized to grant B.Ed. degrees. Under the guidance of the CHE, in 1997, the college instituted a separation, administratively distinguishing the Academic College of Education from the college under the auspices and supervision of Ben-Gurion University. An independent, non-profit association, by the name of Achva, was established in September 2000 under the academic auspices of Ben-Gurion University. Over the years, it conducted 12 general study programs for bachelor's degrees. In 2009, Achva College under the auspices of Ben-Gurion University became recognized as an independent academic institution and was granted accreditation for awarding independent B.Sc. degrees in life sciences. As a result, two academic institutions were established on the same campus, one beside the other with separate management, presidents, executive directors, and separate employee labor committees. By 2012, following a long process and the recommendation of the labor committees and the work of professional steering committees, a strategy was devised for the unification of the two colleges on the Achva campus. The CHE approved the unification that year under the name of Achva Academic College. Over the years, there were programs at the college which were transitional passageways to Ben-Gurion University for excelling students. The college severed itself from the university in 2012 as the unified structure formed one distinctive college with two undergraduate schools ‚Äì one in education and one in the sciences, and an additional school of graduate studies for master's degrees.

Nix, (September 19, 1861 - February 6, 1946) was a United States Marshal in the late 19th century handling the jurisdiction that included the wild Oklahoma Territory, later to be the state of Oklahoma. He was first appointed in 1893, in the closing years of the Old West, during the last years of the \\"Hanging Judge\\" Parker tenure. Biography Born in Kentucky, his uncle was a county sheriff, and his father a deputy sheriff. He went into business, working in sales and operating a grocery store and a hardware store. In 1885 he married childhood girlfriend Ellen Felts. Nix first came to Oklahoma during the Land Run of 1891, and was a Guthrie, Oklahoma, businessman with many influential friends, to include rancher Oscar Halsell, who for a time employed Bill Doolin and other members of the Doolin Dalton Gang, and who was involved in the 1884 Hunnewell Gunfight. When he was appointed to the position of US Marshal he was only 32 years of age, the youngest holding that position at the time. Law enforcement career He took over in a very volatile time. The Doolin Dalton gang was in full swing, committing bank robberies and train robberies in Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas. The outlaws had a haven in Ingalls, Oklahoma, and Marshal Nix wasted no time in moving to bring the gang down. His first course of action was to organize a posse to take the outlaws in Ingalls. With Deputy Marshal John Hixon in the lead, Nix dispatched a posse of fourteen Deputy Marshals to Ingalls. On September 1, 1893, in what would become known as the Battle of Ingalls, three of his deputy marshals, Deputy Marshal Thomas Hueston, Deputy Marshal Richard Speed, and Deputy Marshal Lafayette Shadley were killed in the ensuing gunbattle. Outlaws \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb, Charley Pierce, and \\"Dynamite Dan\\" Clifton were wounded, but escaped. Outlaw \\"Arkansas Tom\\" Jones was stunned and captured after dynamite was thrown at him by Deputy Marshal Jim Masterson. And a saloon owner known only as Murray was badly wounded by the marshals when he began shooting at the lawmen in defense of the outlaws. To topple the gang, Nix organized a special elite group of one hundred marshals, including Heck Thomas, Bill Tilghman, and Chris Madsen, who became known as the Three Guardsmen. Marshal Nix was staunchly defensive of his deputies, and the actions they were forced to take in order to bring the gang to justice. With Nix in support of them, the marshals began to whittle away at the gang, and by 1898 the entire Doolin Dalton gang had been wiped out with the exception of \\"Arkansas Tom\\" Jones, who was in prison. After his release he returned to breaking the law and was killed by lawmen. Two years after the Battle of Ingalls, saloon owner Murray was seeking damages for having been shot by the marshals. Marshal Nix stood in defense of his deputies, and addressed the Attorney General Judson Harmon directly on the matter, stating in part; \\"Murray and other citizens catered to their trade, carried them news of the movements of deputy marshals, furnished them with ammunition, cared for their horses, permitted them to eat at their tables and sleep in their beds\\", and continued \\"This man Murray came to the front door of the saloon either just before the outlaws left the building or just after, it is not known which. However, when he first appeared in the doorway, he had the door open just a short distance and had his winchester to his shoulder in the act of firing\\", he then added that \\"Three of the deputies seeing him in the position he was in, fired on him simultaneously. Two of the shots struck him and one broke his arm in two places.\\" The letter is now housed in the National Archives. Later life and death Nix was dismissed from his position after an audit in 1896, after critics accused him of misusing funds. Many now believe that he was merely the victim of the fee system used at the time for payment of Deputy Marshals, and he actually did not mismanage any funds. He returned to life as a businessman in Guthrie following his dismissal, in which he saw success. In 1929 Nix co-authored a book titled Oklahombres with Gordon Hines, detailing much of the work that went into bringing the gang down, in addition to the hunting down of many other outlaws, including the Jennings Gang. He also documents his youth in Kentucky, and reflects on the changes that had taken place from the 1890s to the 1920s in the way of the outlaws and the lawmen.

The collection was also published under the name Rhyme? And Reason? It is Lewis Carroll's longest poem. Both the poem and the collection were illustrated by A. B. Frost.  Synopsis  Illustration by A. B. Frost \\"Phantasmagoria\\" is a narrative discussion written in seven cantos between a ghost (a Phantom) and a man named Tibbets. Carroll portrays the ghost as not so different from human beings: although ghosts may jibber and jangle their chains, they, like us, simply have a job to do and that job is to haunt. Just as in our society, in ghost society there is a hierarchy, and ghosts are answerable to the King (who must be addressed as ‚ÄúYour Royal Whiteness‚Äù) if they disregard the \\"Maxims of Behaviour‚Äù. Ghosts, our Phantom tells the narrator, fear the same things that we often fear, only sometimes in the reverse: : ‚ÄúAllow me to remark : That ghosts has just as good a right, : In every way to fear the light, : As men to fear the dark.‚Äù  The Cantos  Phantasmagoria is divided into seven cantos which are named: :Canto 1. The Trystyng :Canto 2. Hys Fyve Rules :Canto 3. Scarmoges :Canto 4. Hys Nouryture :Canto 5. Byckerment :Canto 6. Dyscomfyture :Canto 7. Sad Souvenaunce Canto 1. The Trystyng The Trystyng is the meeting between the ghost and the narrator in which they become acquainted. The narrator has come home one evening to find something \\"white and wavy\\" in his dimly lit room. Hearing a sneeze, he addresses the Phantom, a shy creature who has caught a cold, he says, ‚Äúout there upon the landing‚Äù. The cordial exchange allays the narrator's apprehensions, the narrator's hospitality is appreciated by the ghost, and a conversation ensues. The ghost explains that the number of ghosts any house can accommodate is variable: some houses have more than one ghost, but this is a \\"one-ghost\\" house. He describes the ghosts' hierarchy: :A Spectre has first choice, by right, :In filling up a vacancy; :Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite ‚Äì :If all these fail them, they invite :The nicest Ghoul that they can see. Canto 2. Hys Fyve Rules Here he describes the Five Good Rules of Etiquette that ghosts are required to obey. =Rule 1= Let the ‚ÄúVictim‚Äù (all hauntees are referred to as ‚Äúvictims‚Äù) begin the conversation: ‚ÄúNo ghost of any common sense/Begins a conversation‚Äù (p. 12). Instead, the ghost should initiate a haunting by waving curtains or rattling a door. Should the victim take no heed, then the ghost tells him, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know the thing's a failure\\" (p. 12). =Rule 2= In a \\"ceremonious\\" call, \\"First burn a blue or crimson light...then scratch the door or walls\\" (p. 14). =Rule 3= Ghosts are required to \\"Protect / the interests of the Victim...To treat him with a grave respect, / And not to contradict him\\". The narrator says he has encountered ghosts who forget the third rule, to which the ghost suggests that perhaps ‚Äúyou first transgressed‚Äù by treating the ghost rudely: :If you address a Ghost as 'Thing!' :Or strike him with a hatchet, :He is permitted by the King :To drop all formal parleying ‚Äì :And then you're sure to catch it! =Rule 4= Ghosts must not trespass where other ghosts are living, otherwise (unless pardoned by the king) they must ‚Äúinstantly be slaughtered‚Äù: :That simply means 'be cut up small': :Ghosts soon unite anew. :The process scarcely hurts at all, :Not more than when you‚Äôre what you call :‚ÄòCut up‚Äô by a Review. =Rule 5= The king must be addressed as ‚ÄúSir‚Äù and ‚ÄúYour Royal Whiteness‚Äù (p. 17). After reciting his maxims, the ghost is thirsty and requests a glass of beer. Canto 3. Scarmoges The ghost speaks of the different classes of ghosts (Spectres, Elves, Goblins, and more) and their hierarchy, with Elves being ‚Äústupid company, you know, For any but themselves‚Äù (p. 19). He describes Inspector Kobold of the Spectre order, who spends his time at inns where port is served and is thus known as the ‚ÄúInn-Spectre‚Äù (p. 21). The narrator tolerates the pun, but when the ghost criticises the narrator's house as ‚Äúneither snug nor spacious‚Äù (p. 23), and complains about his host's food, wine, and cigars, the narrator objects angrily: : You‚Äôre getting as familiar : As if you were my cousin! (p. 24) The ghost reacts by throwing a bottle at the narrator, which strikes him in the nose and renders him unconscious for a time. When the narrator awakens, the ghost continues telling his story. Canto 4. Hys Nouryture In Canto IV, the ghost makes a reference to Bradshaw‚Äôs Railway Guide (which Carroll had parodied as a young child in his ‚ÄúGuida di Braggia‚Äù). :‚ÄúOh, when I was a little Ghost, : A merry time had we! : Each seated on his favourite post, : We chumped and chawed the buttered toast : They gave us for our tea.‚Äù : \\"That story is in print!\\" I cried : \\"Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not, because : It‚Äôs known as Bradshsaw‚Äôs Guide!‚Äù : (The Ghost uneasily replied : he hardly thought it was). Hailing from a long line of ghosts and of the order, the Phantom tells his family tree as such: His father was a Brownie; his mother was a Fairy. The children were of different stripe ‚Äì there was a Pixy, two Fays, a Banshee, a Fetch and a Kelpie, a Poltergeist and a Ghoul, two Trolls (‚Äúwhich broke the rule‚Äù), a Goblin and a Double, then an Elf, a Phantom, and finally, a Leprechaun. No Spectres, although he notes that when he was a young Phantom some Spectres did call on the family and were ‚Äúdressed in the usual white\\" (p. 29). Spectres are the ‚Äúghost-nobility‚Äù and look upon the rest of the ghost species with disdain and scorn. The ghost informs us of the ways of ghosts: it‚Äôs old-fashioned to groan, and instead now there is the more fashionable squeak ‚Äì which the narrator tells us \\"chill[s] me to the bone\\". (p. 31). A more difficult skill to master, the ghost says, is \\"gibbering\\" ‚Äì ‚Äúthat's something like a job‚Äù (p. 31). Ghosts are required to spend a great deal of money on skulls, crossbones, coloured fire, the fitting of robes, and other expenses. Ghosts also must conform to the standards of the Haunted House Committee, who \\"make a fuss / Because a Ghost was French, or Russ, / Or even from the City\\", and who disapprove of dialects such as the Irish brogue (p. 34). Canto 5. Byckerment Aren‚Äôt victims consulted about their particular ghost, the narrator asks. ‚ÄúNot a bit!‚Äù ‚Äì imagine, he tells us, what it would take to satisfy a single child: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôd be no end to it!‚Äù (p. 35). Ghosts regard new houses as unsuitable for haunting until the ghost has \\"trimmed\\" the premises by loosening doors and drilling holes in floorboards ‚Äúto let the wind come whistling through‚Äù (p. 38). The ghost mentions that he is subject to the authority of the Knight-Mayor. When the narrator says he doesn‚Äôt know the Knight-Mayor the ghost tells him, ‚ÄúEither you never go to bed,/Or you‚Äôve a grand digestion‚Äù, as the Knight-Mayor's duties are to \\"pinch and poke‚Äù those who eat too much before going to sleep (p. 39). Canto 6. Dyscomfyture The ghost discovers he has the wrong house and is not at Tibbs‚Äô house but Tibbets‚Äô, which makes the Phantom very angry and he tells our narrator, Tibbets, :‚ÄúWhy couldn‚Äôt you have told me so :Three quarters of an hour ago? :You king of all the asses!‚Äù (p. 48) When the narrator objects that he is not to blame for the ghost's carelessness, the ghost quickly calms down, accepts responsibility for his mistake, and thanks Tibbets for his hospitality. The scene ends with the two shaking hands (the ghost calls Tibbets ‚ÄúTurnip-top‚Äù). He says a Sprite may be sent instead and gives him advice on how to manage the sprite by rapping him on the knuckles. Canto 7. Sad Souvenaunce The Phantom leaves (favorite phantom) and nothing can bring him back, which leaves the narrator weeping‚Ä¶so he makes himself a drink and sings a ‚ÄúCoronach‚Äù :‚ÄúAnd art thou gone, beloved ghost? :Best of all familiars! :Nay, then, farewell, my duckling roast, :Farewell, Farewell, my tea and toast, :My meerschaum and cigars!‚Äù  Publication   Phantasmagoria and Other Poems  1869 collection of 26 poems, unillustrated. Phantasmagoria by Lewis Carroll was first published by Macmillan and Co., London, in 1869. Macmillan was also the publisher of the Alice in Wonderland books by Carroll. The first edition, had a blue cardboard cover with gold embossed cover illustration and edges and spine, bound by Burn & Co., Kirby Street, E.C. Cover illustrations on the original book (Morgan Library copy) represent the Crab Nebula in Taurus and Donati's Comet, \\"Two distinguished members of the Celestial Phantasmagoria\\".  Rhyme? and Reason?  1883 collection of 17 poems (also New York: Macmillan and Co., 1884), illustrated by Arthur B. Frost (new) and Henry Holiday (\\"The Hunting of the Snark\\"). One of the front pages states (quote): : Of the following poems, \\"Echoes\\", \\"A Game of Fives\\", the last three of the \\"Four Riddles\\", and \\"Fame's Penny-Trumpet\\", are here published for the first time. The others have all appeared before, as have also the illustrations to \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\". Some library records for Phantasmagoria and Other Poems, and other sources concerning that title, provide a list of contents that includes the four poems first published in 1883. This is because Macmillan re-used the old title Phantasmagoria and Other Poems for a different collection in 1911 and stated on its title page \\"First published in 1869.\\" In fact, it is a reissue of Rhyme? and Reason? except that \\"The Hunting of the Snark\\" is omitted.

Biography Born in Brooklyn to a Baptist minister, he was a founding member of Coalition of Conscience, a conglomeration of local organizations working to alleviate social problems in Washington, D.C. In 1968 he headed Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in D.C. He led the delegation from the District of Columbia to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Members of the District's Delegation were originally pledged to Robert F. Kennedy. Following Senator Kennedy's death, the delegation voted to nominate Rev. Phillips as a favorite son instead. He received 68 votes (behind Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern). By some accounts, this makes Rev. Phillips the first black person ever so nominated at a major party convention. He was without question the first African-American to receive votes for the presidential nomination at a Democratic National Convention. Frederick Douglass received votes for president at the 1888 Republican National Convention, but it does not appear from the official record that his name was actually put into nomination.Official Proceedings of the Republican National Convention Held at Chicago, June 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 25, 1888CNN: Think you know your Democratic convention trivia? Phillips said that his candidacy was meant to show that \\"the Negro vote must not be taken for granted.\\" At the time of his candidacy, Phillips was a president of the Housing Development Corporation, a government-backed housing venture in the federal capital. In 1971 he ran to become the first congressional delegate to the United States House of Representatives from D.C., but lost the Democratic primary to Walter E. Fauntroy. An advocate of full home-rule status for D.C., Phillips later moved back to New York City to become the Minister of Planning and Coordination at the Riverside Church. He died at the age of 59 and was survived by his wife, Jane, two sons: Channing D. Phillips, acting United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, and John E. Phillips, and three daughters: Sheilah P. Peterson, Tracy J. Phillips and Jill C. Phillips. References Sources * * Our Campaigns - Candidate - Channing E.

One of the most successful tunes from the album, \\"The Preacher\\", was almost rejected for recording by producer Alfred Lion, who thought it was \\"too old-timey\\", but reinstated at the insistence of Blakey and Silver, who threatened to cancel the session until he had written another tune to record in its place if it wasn‚Äôt included.Silver, H.

Campaign The by-election was the sixth to be held after the Munich Agreement was signed by the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the German dictator, Adolf Hitler.'Polling To-Day At Lewisham', The Times (24 November 1938), p. 9. The National Conservative candidate, Henry Brooke, campaigned strongly in favour of Munich. Chamberlain sent a message to Brooke: \\"I was very pleased to hear that you had been adopted as the National Government candidate in the West Lewisham by-election. Having been brought into personal contact with you in your work I have formed a high opinion of your ability and sound judgment, and I am sure that the qualities which you possess will stand you in good stead in Parliament\\".'Mr. Chamberlain And Critics Of Munich', The Times (11 November 1938), p. 9. In his election address, Brooke proclaimed to be a whole-hearted admirer of Chamberlain. He said that no one but Chamberlain \\"could have saved this and the world from appalling tragedy of war a few weeks ago. Had it not been for his courage, his pertinacity, and his profound faith that reason could be made to triumph, Czechoslovakia by now would have been swept out of existence, and men, women, and children indiscriminately would have been killed by the bombing of London...I warn you not to be led astray by untruths and deceptive half- truths, especially coming from those who at the last election opposed the National Government's decision to rearm, and now recklessly advocate policies which would lead straight towards war\\".'West Lewisham By-Election', The Times (21 November 1938), p. 18. In a second address to the electorate, Brooke declared: \\"To save you from another war and to establish lasting peace on a basis of justice. To help make our country so strong that she shall be treated everywhere with respect. To work to attain security of employment, and to promote the prosperity of trade and industry with that end in view\\". Brooke also opposed returning to Germany her ex-colonies that had been confiscated from her after the First World War.'New Voters At Lewisham', The Times (22 November 1938), p. 19. Arthur Skeffington, the Labour candidate, claimed that the relief that war was avoided by Munich had given way to a profound uneasiness at the way it had been achieved. He argued: \\"We cannot hide from ourselves that the terms secured by Hitler represented a triumph, not for reason, but for blackmail by threats of force. The democratic Czechoslovak Republic has been handed over to dismemberment and despoiled by ruthless dictatorships. But that is not all. Everywhere the people have suffered a major defeat. Hitler has gained vastly increased resources to equip him for further aggression. Not peace has been attained but only an armed truce--which is apparently to be used to pile up more armaments. No criticism of the Munich Agreement could be more damning\\". Skeffington said that Labour's policy would be to bring the peace-loving powers together in a real defensive combination to uphold peace and security. Effective rearmament for this and air raid precautions to protect the people were immediately necessary. Skeffington's eve-of-poll message to the electorate said that Britain had lost the international prestige it held under Labour's Foreign Secretary, Arthur Henderson, through seven years of National Government and was now engaged in a diplomatic retreat with the threat of war. Skeffington said Labour would increase old age pensions, improve education and extend social services.

Better known by his stage name Howlin' Dave, he is credited with introducing Filipino radio listeners to Pinoy (Filipino) rock music in the early 1970s, and to new wave and punk rock in the 1980s. Howlin' Dave grew up in Pasay City and dropped out of high school. While enrolled in a Fine Arts course at the Philippine Women's University, he was hired as a radio announcer on DZRJ-AM in 1974. He adopted the name \\"Howlin' Dave\\" after the American blues singer Howlin' Wolf. He soon became the host of Pinoy Rock and Rhythm, a weekend thirty-minute radio program that featured the then-nascent Pinoy rock music. The program was credited with popularizing such Filipino rock acts as the Juan Dela Cruz Band, Asin and the singer Sampaguita. Howlin' Dave himself became known for his trademark mangled grammar and syntax, his atypical on-air use of the Tagalog language, and for his passionate and excitable delivery in his big booming voice. The drummer Pepe Smith called him \\"the best rock DJ the Philippines ever had.‚Äù Howlin' Dave was also credited with introducing Filipino radio listeners to punk rock and new wave music beginning in the late 1970s, through his program New Wave Nights. His choice to promote punk music was controversial among his fellow deejays and with his station, but his program developed a following, with spikey-haired teens soon showing up at the radio station, drinking gin and breaking bottles. Between 1980 and 1985, Howlin' Dave hosted the annual 'Brave New World' punk concert, which he closed with his take on Sid Vicious's version of \\"My Way\\". In the late 1980s, Howlin' Dave was diagnosed with a brain tumor, as well as several other health problems that left him house-bound for several years. In his later years, he hosted radio programs with DZRJ, ROCK 990, and NU 107. In 2001, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the NU Rock Awards.

The flow from the sluice channel cut into the dam increased dramatically on June 10, 2008, going from 300 cubic metres/second to 7000 cubic metres/second in the span of four hours. The muddy waters flowed rapidly downstream causing flooding in the evacuated town of Beichuan and overtopping of dams. In 2013 broken banks from a severe flood caused the lake's water to fall to 503 metres above sea level, 40 metres below its peak and 9 metres below its 2010 level. As water receded, the Xuanping town in the Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County was revealed. Tangjiashan Lake in 2018, showing greatly reduced area.

He was one of the first Dutchmen to explore to the Caribbean and, while employed by the Dutch West Indies Company, was involved in extensive reconnaissance to establish Dutch bases in the West Indies. Biography Born in Vlissingen, Pieter Schouten found employment in the Dutch West Indies Company as would other former corsairs during this period. In early 1624, he was assigned three ships with which to chart the Caribbean as well as provide valuable reconnaissance on possibility of establishing Dutch bases in the region. Leaving port on January 26, his small squadron included the 24-gun Hoop under Captain Willem Jacobszoon, the 14-gun Eendracht under Captain Hillebrandt Janszoon and the 8-gun yacht Trouwe commanded by Captain Hendrik Worst. After arriving in Barbados in mid-March or May, he visited several islands and charted the coasts of Venezuela, Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba. He also briefly visited the Little Caymans to hunt turtles, becoming one of the earliest Europeans to land on the islands.Smith, Roger C. The Maritime Heritage of the Cayman Islands. Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2001. (pg. 59) His fleet captured several small vessels on the way, although none of his ships were capable of taking the faster and well-armed Spanish galleons. He left Cuba in August and remained in the Caribbean intending to finally head back to the Netherlands the following spring. However, the Eendracht had fallen behind and soon lost contact with Schouten and his flagship. By the time they had reestablished contact, they had encountered two Spanish merchant ships from Honduras. Willem Jacobszoon had managed to capture one of these, the San Juan Bautista under the command of Captain Francisco Hernandez y Moreno, and later used by the crew of the Eendracht when they were forced to abandon their after it ran aground at Tortuga Cays (north of present-day Havana, Cuba). Schouten and his men eventually arrived back in Vlissingen on September 13, 1624. Among the cargo brought back on the Spanish prize included 1,600 chests of sugar, 3,000 animal skins, large amounts of sarsaparilla, balm oil and several chests of silver. The wealth from the one ship alone was enough to convince the Dutch of the value of supporting future expeditions against the Spanish in the Caribbean. As a result of his expedition, St. Martin became one of the first Dutch colonies to be established before its destruction by a passing Spanish fleet in 1633.Marley, David F.

His name is also written Danziker, Dansker, or Danser. Danseker and the English pirate John Ward were the two most prominent renegades operating in the Barbary coast during the early 17th century. Both were said to command squadrons in Algiers and Tunis that were equal to their European counterparts, and, as allies, together represented a formidable naval power (much as had Aruj and Hayreddin Barbarossa in the previous century).Padfield, Peter.

He settled in Marseilles, France, marrying the governor's daughter. In 1607 he stole a ship and sailed for Algiers.Adrian Tinniswood, Pirates of Barbary: Corsairs, Conquests and Captivity in the Seventeenth, Penguin, Nov 11, 2010 Finding himself in the service of Redwan, the Pasha of Algiers, he led a brief but infamous career as a Barbary corsair. According to Ina B. McCabe, he introduced the round ship.Ina Baghdiantz McCabe, Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime, Berg, Jul 15, 2008 p.88 It is unclear why he became a corsair. He was made welcome as an enemy of the Spaniards and, within a year of his arrival, became one of the taife reisi's leading captains. Often bringing Spanish prizes and prisoners to Algiers, due to his exploits he became known under the names Simon Re'is, Deli-Reis (Captain Crazy) and Deli Kapitan among the people on the Barbary coast and the Turks. He incorporated captured ships into his fleet, and was supplied by Algiers with men and the use of their shipyards. He was also the first to lead the Algiers out of the Straits of Gibraltar, the farthest distance any had ever successfully navigated, and traveled as far as Iceland. Iceland would later be attacked by Barbary corsairs in 1616. Simon took at least forty ships and sank many of them during the three years that followed. After three more years of pirating, he had become quite rich and lived in an opulent palace. Simon The Dancer attacked ships of any nation, making trading in the Mediterranean Sea increasingly difficult for every nation. Many nations therefore looked for ways to stop his attacks (by counterattack, bribes for safe-passage or employing him as a privateer in their navy). Simon soon became acquainted with other renegades, particularly English pirates Peter Easton and Jack Ward. He formed a powerful alliance with the latter. Eventually, a French fleet under the command of De Beaulieu de Pairsac, while being assisted by eight Spanish galleys, for a short time threatened to capture him, but because of a sudden storm he was able to escape; he sailed along the coast with his ships where his pursuers could not reach them. Eight more Spanish men-of-war, under the command of Don Luis Fajardo, and an English squadron, under the command of Sir Thomas Shoreley, were also trying to capture Simon The Dancer at that time. Some of the exploits of Simon The Dancer are mentioned in a report written by Andrew Barker in 1609. In 1609, while taking a Spanish galleon off Valencia, Danziger used the opportunity to communicate a message to Henri IV and the French court through the Jesuit priests on board. He wanted to return to Marseilles, having long ago left his wife and children behind, and sought to be exonerated for his crimes. He was reunited with his family later that year, shortly after arriving in Marseilles with four well-armed warships on November 17, 1609. Welcomed by the Duke of Guise, he presented to him \\"a present of some Turks, who were at once sent to the galleys\\", as well as a considerable sum in Spanish gold. Danziger had been residing in Marseilles for a year when French authorities asked him to lead an expedition against the corsairs. Despite rumors of his capture, he returned to France later that same year. In 1615 he was called up by Louis XIII to negotiate the release of French ships being held by Yusuf Dey in Tunis.

Harry, not always aware of the significance of events, travels between linear time and A-Time to fix the outcome of events in the lives of others. Plot TimeTripper 1: Yestermorrow Siara Warner, a high school junior, becomes attracted to a fellow student, Harry Keller, after witnessing him prevent a shooting, seemingly by accident. Harry, in fact, has been given the ability to see time beyond its linear form, and used this ability to change the future. As he is still getting a handle on the ability, which, as he is well-aware, could also be the manifestation of schizophrenia or another mental illness. After he reaches a plain of existence he calls A-Time, he nevertheless decides to take his ability as truth. However, while navigating this new universe, where every moment co-exists simultaneously, Harry detects a temporal anomaly involving a school outcast. Meanwhile, he semi-successfully explains his condition to Siara, who believes him insane until he successfully brings her into A-Time, where both struggle to prevent predestined events from occurring. Yestermorrow was published in 2006. TimeTripper 2: InRage After a series of apparently random occurrences of public violence, Harry discovers that in A-Time, anger is being transmitted from person like a disease, resulting in violent events in reality. Additionally, the level of rage increases with each infection, causing progressively more violent outbursts in the high school population. As Harry tries to come up with a way to stop the chain of rage, Siara also attempts to mend their relationship, and a psychologist attempts to get Harry put back in a mental institution. InRage was published in 2006. TimeTripper 3: BlindSighted Finally resigned to the fact that his crush is dating his worst enemy, Harry falls for another girl, Elijah, who is attracted to him. After he begins seeing glimpses of a warehouse fire in the future which will kill numerous people, Harry deduces that a single individual, capable of manipulating A-Time as he is, has been causing the abnormal temporal occurrences thus far. He employs the help of Elijah, who he teaches about A-Time. Meanwhile, Siara attempts to repair their friendship as her suspicions towards Elijah grow. BlindSighted was published in 2006. TimeTripper 4: FutureImperfect Harry, drugged, delirious, and trapped in Windfree mental hospital, is incapable of entering A-Time, and though he knows the identity of the ' 'Daemon' ', he is dismissed as insane by his few visitors. After his mind is inexplicably brought back to A-Time despite the hospital medication, he is informed by a mysterious Archetype form about the finer points of reality.

During his four-year career as a pirate, he served as an officer under l'Ollonais and formed a brief partnership with Pierre Le Picard. He and Philippe Bequel later co-wrote a book detailing their explorations of the Honduran and Yucat√°n coastline.  Biography  Vauquelin first arrived in the Caribbean from Normandy, France around 1650. He was part of a buccaneering fleet being organized by l'Ollonais at the pirate haven of Tortuga and which would loot and plunder Spanish settlements throughout the Spanish Main during the next two years. Vauquelin was one of several officers serving in this expedition and was present at the raids against Maracaibo and Gibraltar in 1666 and Puerto de Cavallo and San Pedro in 1667. l'Ollonais and his fleet eventually split up, arguing over l'Ollonais desire to sail for Guatemala, shortly after the capture of a Spanish ship off the coast of the Yucat√°n. He and Pierre le Picard chose to leave the expedition, some accounts suggesting they were the ringleaders and instigators of the fleet's disbandment,Frothingham, Jessie Peabody.

Sailing along the coast of Costa Rica, he captured the town of Veraguas although he was driven from the area when he failed to take the nearby town of Nata and the two split up soon after. This defeat was later recorded in Alexander Esquemeling's The Buccaneers Of America almost twenty years later. Vauquelin seems to have lost his ship after this, although the circumstances are unrecorded. He did, however, manage to join the French pirate Chevalier du Plessis later that year. After du Plessis' death, Vauquelin was elected as his successor by the crew. He and his crew were able to successfully capture a Spanish prize, carrying a large cargo of cacao, near the port of Havana, Cuba before returning to Tortuga. In 1670, he and fellow buccaneer Philippe Bequel wrote an account of their careers at the Vice- Admiral Jean d'Estr√©es. The book contained detailed information of the geography of the Caribbean and West Indies, particularly the coasts of Honduras and the Yucat√°n, which were used by the Royal French Navy as well as later buccaneers.

SU2C raised over $100 million after that evening's broadcast. Funds collected by Stand Up To Cancer are then distributed by the American Association for Cancer Research.  History  Stand Up To Cancer was conceived of in autumn 2007, by a group of women who had been affected by cancer and believe that by merging the recourse of the media and entertainment industries into a single operation they would be able to fight against this disease in a more profound way. Stand Up To Cancer was formally launched on May 27, 2008. Current members of the SU2C Council of Founders and Advisors (CFA) include Katie Couric, Sherry Lansing, Kathleen Lobb, Lisa Paulsen, Rusty Robertson, Sue Schwartz, Pamela Oas Williams, and Ellen Ziffren. All current members of the CFA were co-producers of the 2012 televised special. The late co-founder Laura Ziskin executive produced both the September 5, 2008 and September 10, 2010 broadcasts.

Architects of Departmental Systems: Five Profiles, Canberra, CCAE, Canberra Series in Administrative Studies, Occasional Paper 3 In 1983, he was knighted for his services to the evolving Commonwealth Education Alfred Foley Francis Polden Newns was born in London into a missionary family. His father, the Rev Alfred Newns, was an Anglican clergyman who spent much of his life working in Montserrat and Antigua. Newns attended Mercers' School (Holborn), Christ's Hospital, and St Catharine's College, Cambridge. Colonial Administrator While studying at Cambridge he decided to apply to the Colonial Administrative Service (CAS). The job of colonial administrator was an attractive prospect for young men who sought both adventure and public service in the far flung outposts of Empire. In Newns's words, \\"It was looked upon as a plum job much in demand\\".Obituary in The Independent, 13 July 1998 Africa After a year's course on \\"Tropical African Services\\" at Cambridge, Newns was appointed to Nigeria in 1932. He was posted to South Eastern Nigeria and worked as an Assistant District Officer. His first post as District Officer was at Bende, Nigeria. He spent 17 years working in district administration and served under some of the greatest Colonial Governors of his era, including Sir Donald Cameron, Sir Bernard Bourdillon, and Sir Arthur Richards. In 1949, he moved to the Secretariat in Lagos. Newns spent over a third of his life in Africa, the continent which became his spiritual home. He abhorred all forms of racial prejudice, and counted numerous African leaders and academics among his very closest friends. These included Simeon Adebo, and Sir Milton Margai, the first Prime Minister of independent Sierra Leone. Newns was devastated by the assassination in 1966 of his friend Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Prime Minister of Nigeria, with whom he had worked closely during the constitutional preparations for Nigerian independence. He believed Tafawa Balewa's death to be not only a great tragedy for the people of Nigeria but also a huge blow to peaceful political change across the newly independent African continent. Newns was closely involved in the transformation of Nigeria from a British colony into an independent state. He was responsible for introducing the system of cabinet government in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and his methods were later copied throughout British Africa in the final years of colonial rule. Newns was Acting Governor of Sierra Leone until it was granted independence in 1961, when he stayed on for two more years to advise the new African administration, before moving to the Bahamas, where he served as Secretary of the Cabinet from 1963-71. Death In retirement, Newns lived in Cambridge, where he died on 21 June 1998.

A Dictionary of Universal Biography of All Ages and All Peoples. Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Company, 1995. (pg. 508) He was both an officer to l'Olonnais as well as Sir Henry Morgan, most notably taking part in his raids at Maracaibo and Panama, and may have been one of the first buccaneers to raid shipping on both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Biography Pierre le Picard is first referred to as an officer with l'Ollonais in his buccaneering expedition from Tortuga. Leaving with the fleet, he commanded a brigantine with 40 men and was present at the later raids against Maracaibo and Gibraltar in 1666 and Puerto Cabello and San Pedro in 1667. The fleet then stopped to regroup sometime after this point, capturing a Spanish ship off the coast of the Yucat√°n, before l'Ollonais called a council of his officers. Although proposing to sail to Guatemala, he and Moise Vauquelin opposed l'Ollonais' plan and, it is alleged, they encouraged the rest of the officers to leave their commander. The fleet did disband after this meeting, with Picard and Vauquelin leaving together to raid the coast of Costa Rica. The two successfully occupied and looted Veraguas that same year, however they parted ways after failing to capture the nearby town of Nata. This attack was included in Alexander Esquemeling's The Buccaneers of America years later. In 1669, he returned to Maracaibo once more as a guide for Sir Henry Morgan expedition and, two years later, joined him at Panama in command of the 10-gun Saint-Pierre. Although his activities are unknown during the next few years, at least one published source reporting his death in 1679, he is mentioned by then acting Governor of Jamaica Sir Henry Morgan as being active against English and Spanish shipping near Port Royal in 1682. He may have also been the Captain le Picard who, in early 1685, sailed with the French buccaneering expedition including Francois Grogniet, Mathurin Desmarestz, George Dew, and a Captain Townley that crossed the Isthmus of Panama to raid unprotected Spanish settlements in the South Seas. They later joined with English buccaneers Edward Davis, Charles Swan and Peter Harris, although Picard apparently did not get along with their English partners. He returned to the Caribbean after the raid on Guayaquil in May 1687 and, while en route to Hispaniola, looted the city of Segovia before eventually retired to Acadie in southeastern Canada. During King William's War, he may have also commanded a small squadron during King William's War and attacked the English colony at Rhode Island in 1690 although was forced to withdraw due to heavy casualties.

Sieckenius remained in command of a Panzer battalion, and took part in the Battle of France. The battalion remained in France until February 1941, when it was placed in reserve and returned to Germany. Here Sieckenius remained, refitting his battalion until he was transferred to the newly formed 16th Panzer Division in April, with which he took part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, during which Sieckenius was awarded the Knight‚Äôs Cross. Sieckenius was in command of 16th Panzer Division in Italy from May to November 1943, defending capably against the Allied landings at Salerno, and managing the subsequent withdrawal to the Viktor Line. (On the Volturno River north of Naples.) At the beginning of October 1943 16th Panzer was already moving to the Adriatic coast sector as a result of Allied pressure when an amphibious landing was made at Termoli. Sieckenius' performance in that battle was the reason for his sacking as commander of 16th Panzer, as it was considered he had not been sufficiently aggressive in repelling the landing, and an opportunity to hand a defeat to the Allies had been lost, along with an important defensive position. Generalmajor Sieckenius was eventually killed in action near M√§rkisch Buchholz during the Battle of Halbe.Hans-J√ºrgen Pantenius: Letzte Schlacht an der Ostfront - von D√∂beritz bis Danzig 1944/1945, p. 225 Awards *Wound Badge in Silver *Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 17 September 1941 as Oberstleutnant and commander of Panzer-Regiment 2 References Citations Bibliography * * Category:1896 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Zielona G√≥ra County Category:Major generals of the German Army (Wehrmacht) Category:German military personnel of World War I Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:Recipients of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross Category:German military personnel killed in World War II ","title":"Rudolf Sieckenius"},{"id":"17653120","text":"Beyond the Sea is a Big Finish Productions audio drama featuring Lisa Bowerman as Bernice Summerfield, a character from the spin-off media based on the long- running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

February 1998 is a Jamaican- born visual artist who lives in Britain and exhibits using the name \\"Fowokan\\" (a Yoruba word meaning: \\"one who creates with the hand\\"). He is a largely self-taught artist, who has been practising sculpture since 1980. His work is full of the ambivalence he sees in the deep-rooted spiritual and mental conflict between the African and the European. Fowokan's work is rooted in the traditions of pre-colonial Africa and ancient Egypt rather than the Greco- Roman art of the west. He has also been a jeweller, essayist, poet and musician (a former member of the funk group Cymande in the early 1970s). Background and career Born as Kenness George Kelly in Kingston, Jamaica, he migrated to Britain in 1957 and lived in Brixton, South London.Margaret T. Andrews, \\"Fowokan\\", in Alison Donnell (ed.), Companion to Contemporary Black British Culture, Routledge, 2001, p. 117. He decided to become an artist while on a visit to Benin, Nigeria, in the mid-1970s. He had travelled as a musician to Nigeria, where he experienced some kind of spiritual transformation or enlightenment. He returned to London determined to acquire knowledge of the technique of sculpture, which he was able to find in books and through trial and error. Coming to the visual arts comparatively late in life, he deliberately chose not to be trained in western institutions, which he felt could not teach him what he wanted to know, they being too deeply entrenched in their own traditions with little or no understanding or interest in the things that interested him most ‚Äì the ideas behind the art and culture of Africa. The philosophical aspect of his oeuvre came with his travels through various parts of Africa, exploring the spiritual side of his ancestral home. He believes the intuitive/spiritual aspect of reality that still abounds in Africa was his art school and university. He has also written essays that have been published in books and magazines. In 2011 Fowokan featured in \\"Better than Good\\", an arts education initiative to highlight the achievements of Black artists in Britain.\\"FOWOKAN: His Spiritual and Political Journey\\", Alexandra Galleries, 19 March 2011. His work was shown prominently in the exhibition No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960‚Äì1990, held at the Guildhall Art Gallery between July 2015 and January 2016.Annemari de Silva, \\"Exhibition Review: No Colour Bar\\", SOAS Spirit, 16 November 2015.Lola Okolosie, \\"We are here because you were there: a retrospective of black British art\\", New Humanist, 5 December 2015. Concepts Kelly sees African art not as art in the western sense but as creations associated with religion, magic and ritual. The encounter between the African and the European has brought about deep-rooted spiritual and mental conflicts at the core of the African, along with the belief that the African is nothing more than \\"the reflection of a primitive and barbarous mentality\\". Kelly believes that art has an important role to play in the struggle to define and redefine a contemporary African world-view. In today‚Äôs African artists‚Äô work, he argues, we must see the eyes and hands of the contemporary artist, looking anew, through the prism of an African aesthetic, speaking in a new world with the voices of the ancestors, voices for so long silenced; in doing so, their art will offer new generations the opportunity to look again with fresh eyes, to see themselves in new ways. The primary motifs of Kelly's practice are naturalistic portraits, such as his bust of Mary Seacole. But he also introduces forms that allude to a fascination with Africa and the African Diaspora, such as The Lost Queen of Pernambuco ‚Äî a sculpture inspired by the story of a settlement of Africans who, across the 18th and 19th centuries, escaped enslavement and lived as a community on the border of Brazil and Dutch Guiana for 90 years, only to be re-captured due to their lack of vigilance.\\"Clash Of Cultures (1/2)\\", Alex Sampson's Ravensbourne Blog, 13 October 2015. ‚Äî which, according to Nerve magazine, \\"has a beauty that overwhelms\\".Sandra Gibson, \\"Hawkins & Co\\" (review) , Nerve, 15 April 2008.

It displays the jobs and careers available and the education and skills required to get these jobs. Hosted by Bobby Jon Drinkard, On The Job is produced by AIDT, Alabama‚Äôs Workforce Training Institute in cooperation with Alabama Public Television.  History  The concept of the show was first discussed in October 2006. Initially AIDT was going to continue production of Alabama@Work, a show on Alabama Public Television, which had just been cancelled. After discussions with management, the focus of the show shifted to a more \\"worker/employee/student\\" focused show. The decision to move forward with a pilot was made November 1, 2006. The pilot was shot in January 2007 with Steve Marrlowe as host. The show was picked up by Alabama Public Television in May 2007 and full production began June 1, 2007. The show premiered on November 5, 2007 at 2:30PM CT on Alabama Public Television. The show is also available online. \\"On The Job\\" is the first show produced by AIDT, Alabama's Workforce Training Institute. The show was developed in response to Alabama's low unemployment rate and to encourage the citizens of the state to return to school to increase their education and potential careers. The show opened its third season with its 100th show on September 12, 2010.  Staff  On The Job is based on an idea by Christopher Roquemore who serves as Executive Producer for the show. Jacquie Allen, Clyde Hancock, Kendall Haywood, Heather Holladay, Doug Freeland (who also manages AIDT Productions) and Sonya Telfair along with Steve Marlowe as host were the initial staff of the show. Heather Holladay departed the show in August 2007 after completing 7 episodes as producer and Steve Marlowe hosted the first 10 episodes before being replaced by Bobby Jon Drinkard. Steve Marlowe still continues to work with the show as a consultant. In July, 2007, Robert Trione was added as a videographer/editor, but Trione was replaced a year later by Jeremy Oates.  Concept and content  Based loosely on format of Dirty Jobs show on the Discovery Channel, On The Job places the host in a variety of jobs available in Alabama to show people what these jobs entail as well as some of the skills and education required to get these jobs. The shows feature two or three segments per half-hour episode. Sometimes the segments and jobs are related, but in many cases they are not. Also featured each week is a listing of Job and Training Opportunities available across the state. Season 1 episodes also featured a Ready to Work segment that gave viewers advice concerning employment. The show is shot completely in 720p HD TV although it is broadcast by Alabama Public Television in Standard Definition.

One is the Scalphunter (Geoffrey Lewis), who says his trade is being a \\"buffaler\\" (buffalo hide trader). He is in search of gold. The others are a former ship Captain (Bo Brundin), also in search of the gold; the Woman from England (Margot Kidder), a former chambermaid who, in exchange for ship's passage to America, has signed an agreement to serve the Captain for five years as an indentured servant; and Mr. Rainbow (Christopher Walken), a former soldier who killed native Americans. The Captain sets out to find some of Montezuma's gold, risking danger from both the Native Indians and Mexican soldiers. The woman wants to get out of her contract with the Captain and go to New Orleans. She asks Mr. Rainbow to take her there, but he turns her down. The Scalphunter wants half of the Captain's gold, and tags along with his men. Mr. Rainbow sets out across the desert through the Viaje de la Muerte, the Journey of Death.

Alexis (compare the Greek verb ·ºÄŒªŒ≠Œæœâ, al√©xo) means \\"helper, defender\\". The ending \\"-is\\" points at its belonging to the masculine gender (according to Greek grammar); however, many American women are owners of this name, partly based on modern American tendency of giving girls male names. Russian version of this name is Alexey that is used only for men and has no female form. However, some European languages do have a female version, for example, in French, Alexia. It was also used as a name for several members of the ruling house of Russia, including Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, Tsarevich (heir apparent) Alexei Nikolaevich and Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich. While the name is mostly male, it has been predominantly given to females in the United States since at least the 1940s, when actress Alexis Smith began appearing in films. It has been among the top 50 most popular names for girls in the United States since 1990. In the 2008 book 5-Star Baby Name Advisor, author Bruce Lansky writes that the girls' name has the image of a \\"sexy and seductive knockout.\\"Lansky, p. 16 The increase in popularity of the name is sometimes attributed to the notable character Alexis Colby from the American television series Dynasty.

The role of the ORC is to identify best practices, to disseminate this information to a wide variety of user audiences, and then to assist with implementing, institutionalizing and sustaining these pre-K to 12 practices across the Ohio educational system. ORC uses proposal processes and subcontracts with two- and four-year higher education institutions and other pre- K to 12 education providers for aggregating best practices information, developing interactive data and knowledge bases, disseminating best practices information, and conducting applied research on needed areas critical to the state educational system. Best practices determined through ORC represent a variety of practices, suitable for different purposes and for different audiences, but certified through a peer-review process that assures the validity of each practice for its intended purpose. ORC also makes important contributions to communication with public and business stakeholders of education and to the expansion of the knowledge and databases for informing educational policy. The ORC provides links to peer-reviewed instructional resources that have been identified by a panel of Ohio educators as exemplifying best or promising practice. Available resources also include content and professional resources as well as assessment and general education resources that will support the work of pre-K to 12 classroom teachers and higher education faculty members. The resources are correlated with Ohio's academic content standards and with applicable national content standards. The administrative site for the ORC is located in and administered through the College of Education and Human Ecology of The Ohio State University. Many two- and four-year public and private higher education institutions and several other agencies are involved in the design of ORC's structure, the development of its products, and the delivery of its services. ORC operates primarily as a virtual best practice center, with working groups and research teams drawn from faculty at Ohio colleges and universities in cooperation with schools and school districts across the state. ORC's resources are available primarily via the web and are coordinated with other state and regional efforts to improve student achievement and teacher effectiveness in pre-K to 12 mathematics, science and reading.

Addison, based on a true story. It stars Anne Bancroft and Lynn Whitfield. Bancroft received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her role. Plot In Boston in the early 1960s, Geraldine Cummins was walking home alone from the movies when she was jumped and raped by a black man. Stunned, she returned home to her husband Bob, stating she had been raped. Sometime later, she finds she is pregnant. She keeps the baby for a few reasons: she is Catholic and she harbors a small hope that it could be her husband's baby. As the baby is a black girl, she fears the social isolation she would receive and what people would think of her. She is heartbroken, but decides to give up her daughter. She names her newborn daughter Barbara Anne Cummins and gives her to foster mother Corrine Burrel, a black woman in Roxbury. Seven years later, Barbara is a happy little girl. A few months later, a social worker comes into their home and informs Corrine that Barbara will be adopted by Annalise and Paul, white people living in Wisconsin. Corrine seeks legal action, looking to adopt Barbara for herself, but as she is divorced with no job and many children, she is turned down. Annalise becomes worried about Barbara's very detached nature and suggests to Paul they move to a suburban neighborhood where Barbara could be around other black kids. Paul is angry that they have to change everything for a child he did not want, but agrees, only to leave them after moving. Barbara has once again receded into herself after the neighborhood children make fun of her for being black with a white mother. Over the years until she is 16, she is alone without her mother or friends. At 16 she meets Don, a football playing choirboy. She falls in love with him and ultimately gets pregnant. Years later, in the middle of Barbara's third pregnancy, the doctor suggests she look into her birth family history for medical reasons. This leads her in search for her mother. She visits Corrine and later contacts the agency in charge of her adoption. By reading her adoption records, she comes to know the truth about her birth and her biological mother. After a night of contemplation, she decides to seek out her birth mother. Revitalized by the happiness of knowing she was wanted by both her birth mother and foster mother, Barbara reconciles with Annalise. Anxiously, Gerry and her 3 grown children wait at the airport for Barbara's arrival. Finally, after 34 years, mother and daughter meet. Barbara is angry as to why Gerry gave her up if she loves her, asking if it would have made a difference if she had been born white. Gerry says she only wanted the best for Barbara, to be with people who could teach her courage, which she could not, because Gerry felt ashamed for being raped and having a black daughter, though she loved her. Gerry apologizes to Barbara and the two reconcile as mother and daughter. Later, at a family reunion, Corrine, Gerry and Annalise meet again for the first time. The film ends with a picture of the entire side of Barbara's family, her mothers, her uncles, her brothers and sisters, her children, and her nieces and nephews, and Barbara no longer feels alone.

Bustamante's AquaLab group at Northwestern University. Ono claims to be able to increase download rates by between 31% and 207% on average, depending on whether the client is on an overloaded network or one with large available bandwidth.

A more recent evaluation (one that used a single client connected to only one ISP located in the United States) has shown that Ono's benefits in practice are far short of the claims made in the original paper. In particular, when downloading real BitTorrent swarms while measuring the end-to-end benefits of using Ono, performance is unchanged, and interdomain traffic is reduced by less than 1%.http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2009/papers/hotnets2009-final115.pdf Ono is open source and does not require additional infrastructure.

Apart from football, the club also offers a variety of other sports, like basketball, volleyball, and fencing. The club's golden era was in the 1930s and early 1940s when it made five appearances in the German championship finals round and won a number of Hamburg city championships against the now much more prominent clubs Hamburger SV and FC St. Pauli. Eimsb√ºtteler TV made headlines in 2011 when it lost almost its complete first and second teams because of disagreements over how to split the money earned from reaching the first round of the 2011‚Äì12 DFB-Pokal after winning the Hamburg Cup. ETV was forced to field a side predominantly made up of players from its under-19 side.Favorit F√ºrth locker weiter ‚Äì Neuer ETV chancenlos Weltfussball.de, published: 31 July 2011, accessed: 31 July 2011 History The beginnings The roots of the association lay in the 12 June 1889 formation of the gymnastics club Eimsb√ºtteler Turnerschaft. This club broke up within a month when a number of members left to form Eimsb√ºtteler M√§nnerturnverein. On 1 May 1893 the two groups were re-united as Hamburg-Eimsb√ºtteler Turnverein, while a new association using the name Eimsb√ºtteler Turnerschaft was established 28 December the same year. This club in turn joined HETV to create Eimsb√ºtteler Turnverband on 19 February 1898 with the goal of constructing a common sports hall.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag The facility was completed in 1910, under the direction of the chairman Julius Sparbier. A football department was established within ETV on 12 May 1906 and the footballers took up play in the A-Klasse Hamburg, the highest league in the city. They sent their first representative to the national side in 1910 and won their first city title in 1915. The team went on to make several appearances in the playoff round of the country's northern regional league in the late 20s and early 30s. In 1926, they lost the final of the regional Nordpokal (North German Cup) to Holstein Kiel by a score of 1‚Äì3. The club's golden years The Eimsb√ºttel side enjoyed its greatest success playing in the Gauliga Nordmark, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the 1933 reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. The team captured titles there in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1940 and 1942, often in close contests with better known club Hamburger SV. These Gauliga titles qualified ETV for participation in the preliminary rounds of the national championship where they scored victories in matches against eventual champions FC Schalke 04 in group play in both 1934Germany ‚Äì National play-offs 1934 RSSSF.com, accessed: 31 May 2008 and 1935.Germany ‚Äì National play-offs 1935 RSSSF.com, accessed: 31 May 2008 Their best result came in 1940 when they finished runners-up in their group to Dresdner SC. ETV made several appearances in the opening rounds of the Tschammerpokal tournament (1935‚Äì37, 1939‚Äì42), predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal, and also saw four different players capped through the 1930s and 40s. World War II forced play across the country to become more local in character and the Gauliga Nordmark was broken up into three separate leagues after the 1941‚Äì42 season. ETV became part of the new Gauliga Hamburg where they were able only to earn lower table results. The club's sports facilities were, like most of Hamburg, heavily damaged in air raids. From 1948, under the leadership of Robert Finn, the ETV started to rebuild its facilities. Postwar Post-war play in 1945 in the Stadtliga Hamburg saw the ETV continue as a mid-table team. A fifth-place finish in the 1946‚Äì47 season was not quite enough to qualify for the new Oberliga Nord, one of five new first division circuits within the country, which admitted the top four finishers from Hamburg. ETV won its way to the Oberliga the next year on the strength of a campaign that saw the team capture its division by winning seventeen and drawing one its of eighteen matches. The ETV spent the next eight seasons at the Oberliga level until being sent down to the Amateurliga Hamburg after a sixteenth-place finish in 1956. The team suffered through two consecutive poor seasons, narrowly missing relegation to the third tier. After recovering to win the division title in 1959 they were unable to advance further after doing poorly in promotion round play. They earned lower table results over most of the next several seasons and with the establishment of the Bundesliga in 1963, the second division Amateurliga became a third tier circuit where ETV continued to struggle against relegation. A last place finish in 1965‚Äì66 dropped Eimsb√ºttel to the Verbandsliga Hamburg ‚Äì Germania- Staffel (IV). The club generally finished in the upper half of the Verbandsliga table until declining in the latter half of the 70s. They earned a second-place result in 1980‚Äì81, but were eventually relegated to the Bezirksliga (V) in 1985 after a fifteenth-place finish. In the face of frequent league restructuring, ETV avoided slipping deeper into lower-tier football through timely promotions. In 1989, they moved up to the Landesliga Hamburg (V), and then made a quick advance in the late 90s, winning their way to the Verbandsliga Hamburg (V) in 1998, and then into the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (IV) the following year after a second-place finish. The club was overmatched in Oberliga play and struggled against relegation for four seasons, only avoiding demotion by the voluntarily withdrawal of other teams facing financial and license problems. Their turn in the Oberliga came to an end in 2003, when the ETV was unable to avoid being sent down to the Verbandsliga (V). The club's decline continued with a descent through the Landsliga Hamburg (VI) in 2005, to the Bezirksliga Hamburg-Nord (VII) in 2006. ETV enjoyed a successful 2007‚Äì08 regular season, finishing second on equal points with league winner Rahlstedter SC. This entitled the team to take part in the Landesliga promotion round where they finished fourth in the four-team competition.Relegation BL in LL Fusball.de, accessed: 10 June 2008 The 2008‚Äì09 season saw the club compete on the same level with its first and second team, but in separate leagues. ETV finished fourth in its league, the Bezirksliga Nord, while ETV II came second in the Bezirksliga S√ºd and earned promotion to the Landesliga through the play-off round. Consequently, the first team took up the second team's spot in this league in 2009‚Äì10 and was coached by the second team's coach Dennis Mitteregger.Fu√üball: ETV II spielt Aufstiegsrunde zur Landesliga ETV website, accessed: 12 July 2009 In 2010‚Äì11, ETV came ninth in the league but took out the Hamburg Cup for the first time in its history. This cup win however cost the club its coach and the majority of its players. While the club wanted to award 50 percent of the earnings for reaching the first round of the cup, Euro 110,000, to the football department, the players demanded a share of up to 75 percent.

He served in the military between 1916 and 1922, afterwards joining the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1938 Urb≈°ys was named its head and served in this position until Lithuania's occupation in 1940. Urb≈°ys was imprisoned by the Soviet authorities in 1940 and deported to Siberia, where he spent the next 13 years in various prisons. Urb≈°ys died in 1991, having lived long enough to see Lithuania's independence restored, and was buried in Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery, Kaunas.

The outbreak of World War I interrupted his studies and he enlisted in the army in 1916.Juozas Urb≈°ys . Retrieved on 2008-05-28 A few years later, Urb≈°ys completed his education at Chuguyevo Military School (, now Chuhuiv in Ukraine), returning to Lithuania in 1918 after Lithuania re-established its independence. He continued to serve in the Lithuanian military until 1922. After joining the foreign service, Urb≈°ys worked in Berlin, Germany between 1922 and 1927. His next assignment was in Paris, France, a post he held until 1932. Urb≈°ys was then named Lithuanian Minister Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Latvia, although he did not hold this position for long; in 1934 he was appointed the head of the political department in the Foreign Affairs Ministry. In 1938 he became the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs. Urb≈°ys' service in this capacity coincided with significant international developments. Rumors arose in 1939 that Nazi Germany would attempt to re-annex the Baltic Seaport city of Klaipƒóda from Lithuania (part of the Memelland region, the city and its surrounding area had until 1919 been part of the German province of East Prussia). Urb≈°ys had been representing Lithuania during the coronation of Pope Pius XII in Rome on March 12; while returning to Lithuania, he stopped in Berlin in an attempt to clarify the rumors. On March 20 Ribbentrop, the German foreign minister, met with Urb≈°ys. Ribbentrop demanded the cession of Klaipƒóda to Germany and threatened military action. Urb≈°ys relayed the ultimatum to the Lithuanian government. While a clear deadline was not given, Lithuania was told to make a speedy decision, and that any clashes or German casualties would inevitably provoke a response from the German military. Without any material international support, Lithuania had no choice but to accept the ultimatum. Lithuanian diplomats characterized the acceptance as a \\"necessary evil\\" that preserved its independence and hoped it was merely a temporary retreat. Another major diplomatic development occurred during October 1939. During the course of a visit to the Soviet Union, Urb≈°ys met with Vyacheslav Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. Joseph Stalin joined the group soon afterwards.Lituanus. Lithuania and Soviet Union 1939-1940. Retrieved on 2008-05-28 During the discussion a draft of a mutual assistance pact was presented, which resulted in the stationing of Red Army troops in Lithuania. The city of Vilnius and its surrounding region, which had been annexed by Poland in 1920, was returned to Lithuania. However, after about one year, the Soviet authorities presented an ultimatum that ended Lithuania's independence. Urb≈°ys' career as foreign minister ended in 1940. Soviet authorities sent him initially to a prison in Tambov; he was later moved to prisons in Saratov, Ivanov and elsewhere. Of his 13 years in prison, 11 were spent in solitary confinement. He was released in 1954 without the right to live in what was now the Lithuanian SSR. He was allowed to return to Lithuania in 1956. Urb≈°ys continued to make his living by translating works in the French language into Lithuanian. He regained notability after publishing his memoirs in 1988, a work described as one of the first to address Lithuanian history under Soviet rule. After Lithuania again regained its independence, Urb≈°ys was named an honorary citizen of Kƒódainiai (in 1990) and Kaunas (1991). His health was frail, preventing him from fully participating in the political process of independence, but he enjoyed the authority and respect of the Lithuanian people. Urb≈°ys died on April 30, 1991. After lying in state at the city of Kaunas' War Museum, he was entombed in Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery. His last political action was performed on August 23, 1988 when his speech, recorded in a tape recorder, was played during a SƒÖj≈´dis rally. In the speech he narrated about the Soviet‚ÄìLithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty signing in Moscow. Close to his death, Urb≈°ys was interviewed by a Swedish diplomat, who visited him on September 9, 1990 in his poor Soviet era flat that was located in the outskirts of the Kaunas city (soon after the declaration of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990). When asked about the possible Lithuanian military resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1940, he said that it would have been impossible and that there is no reason to compare Lithuania situation with Finland, who fought the Winter War, because it had a much better geographical position, Karelia and Mannerheim Lines. He also noted that the resistance might have only made the horrific occupation conditions of the state even worse.

Founded in 1988, the club takes its name from the Gaelic name for Edinburgh, D√πn √àideann and the surname of Edinburgh-born Irish republican and socialist leader James Connolly. Dunedin Connollys have won the Scottish Championship 14 times and the British GAA title three times, most recently in November 2017. Dunedin Connollys currently runs a Senior Men's team, a Junior Men's team, a Ladies' team and an underage set-up, Dunedin Og. History Dunedin Connollys was founded in 1988 on Leith Walk, in the north of Edinburgh, at an Irish dancing show. Father Eamonn Sweeney, the priest who had been instrumental in setting up Gaelic football clubs in the west of Scotland, had a chance meeting with Belfast native Anthony Haughey and plans for an Edinburgh-based Gaelic team were formed. Initially, the team consisted of first and second generation local Irish immigrants from a working-class background. The club trained on the Meadows, and played home matches at St Augustine's High School, Edinburgh on the western outskirts of the city. The establishment of the British University Gaelic football Championship and university teams at Heriot-Watt University and more recently Napier University and the University of Edinburghprovided the club with a wider playing pool with many of the university team players going on to turn out for Connollys. The club's first tournament success came in 1993, with victory in the O‚ÄôFiach Cup and was closely followed by the club's maiden Scottish Championship triumph the following year. In 1998, the club began ground-sharing with Portobello RFC at Cavalry Park in Duddingston. Present day In the early 1990s, there were nearly 20 Gaelic football teams competing in central Scotland. In 2018 that number has been reduced to just five, including Connollys. D√∫n Deagh D√°lriada, Glasgow Gaels GFC (formed in 1999 from the amalgamation of Glencovitt Rovers and Paisley Gaels), Sands MacSwineys GFC (formed by members of the Glasgow-based Pearse Harps who wanted to set up a team in Coatbridge) and Tir Conaill Harps (also established after an ‚Äòamicable‚Äô break away from Pearse Harps by the club's underage section) make up the other four teams. Dunedin Connollys currently has members from Mayo, Kerry, Carlow, Kildare, Tyrone, Leitrim, Sligo, Laois, Donegal, Tipperary, Derry, Armagh, and Roscommon. British success After losses to St Peter's Manchester GAA in 2004 and Harlsden Harps in 2005, Dunedin Connollys won their maiden British Championship in 2009, beating holders John Mitchel's of Liverpool by a score of 1‚Äì08 to 2-04. The club then won back-to- back British titles, defeating John Mitchel's after extra time in 2016 before defeating Birmingham side Sean McDermotts of Warwickshire GAA in 2017.https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/more-sport/dunedin- connollys-win-british-gaa-title-for-second-year-running-1-4619528 All- Ireland Junior Club Football Championship Dunedin Connollys has competed in the All-Ireland Junior Club Football Championship on three occasions, in 2010, 2016/17 and 2017/18. Connollys lost in the 2010 quarter-final to Emyvale of Monaghan GAA, going down 3‚Äì07 to 0-08. In early December 2016, Connollys defeated Laois side Rosenallis GAA 1‚Äì09 to 1‚Äì06 in Edinburgh before being knocked out by Ulster GAA champions Rock St Patrick's GAC in January 2017, losing 2‚Äì06 to 1‚Äì18 at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh. In December 2017, Connollys hosted first time Ulster champions Naomh Colmcille, with the Donegal side winning 1‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì06 in Edinburgh. Dunedin Connollys Ladies In 1998 a Ladies team was set-up by then club chairman Peter Dillon and his wife Suzanne. To begin with, Connollys Ladies competed in the Ladies University Championship and won it three years on the trot. The Ladies also won back-to- back sevens titles in 2006 and 2007. Since 2009 the ladies' team has competed in the Scottish Ladies university league and Championship. Dunedin Connollys Juniors As well as a Men's Senior team, Dunedin Connollys runs a Junior team. The second-string side made it to the 2016 Scottish Junior Championship final, where they were defeated by Glasgow Gaels. Dunedin Og Dunedin Connollys has a youth set-up, named Dunedin Og. Founded in 2012, the establishment of Dunedin Og marked the end of two years of hard work and coaching by local Gaelic football enthusiasts in Edinburgh's primary schools. Dunedin Og runs Under-10, Under-12 and Under-14 teams, all of whom compete as mixed gender teams. In 2015, eight Dunedin Og players were called up to the Scottish feile team while one player made the Scotland Under-16 squad.

Early life Ludlow was born on 29 September 1734 in Queens County on Long Island in the Province of New York in what was then British America. He was the son of Gabriel Ludlow (1704‚Äì1773), a merchant, and Frances (n√©e Duncan) Ludlow. Among his siblings was his younger brother Gabriel George Ludlow. After his mother's death, his father married Elizabeth Crommelin, with whom he had Daniel Ludlow, George's younger half-brother. His sister, Elizabeth Ludlow, was the wife of Francis Lewis Jr. (brother of Gov. Morgan Lewis). The first Ludlow in America was his grandfather, also named Gabriel Ludlow (1663‚Äì1736), who was born at Castle Cary and left Frome around 1694 to settle in New Amsterdam, and became a prominent and influential merchant, shipowner, landholder and longtime clerk of the New York General Assembly. He obtained a patent from King George II for a tract of 4,000 acres of land in what became Orange County, New York on the west bank of the Hudson River. His grandfather's grandfather, Thomas Ludlow, was the brother of both Gabriel Ludlow, Receiver of the Duchy of Lancaster during the reign of King Charles I, and Roger Ludlow, Deputy Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The wealth and status of the Ludlow family gave George and his brothers \\"several advantages, including education in a private school.\\" He spent a short period as an apprentice apothecary before turning to the law. Career After studying law, Ludlow was admitted to the bar, and rose quickly within the profession. He focused his practice on commercial cases and was often employed either as an arbitrator or an adjustor. Ludlow was able to amass a fortune quickly and retire early to a large estate on his native Long Island. Shortly after his retirement, however, he was appointed judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and on December 14, 1769, he was commissioned as a judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature and served as Master of the Rolls. After Ludlow was passed over for the office of Chief Justice of the Province of New York in 1780, in favor of William Smith, he resigned from the bench. As a consolation, Governor James Robertson appointed him Chief Superintendent of the police for Long Island in 1780. During the American Revolution, he remained loyal to the Crown. At the close of the war, his property, including his 140 acre estate in Hyde Park, passed to the State under the Confiscation Act of 1779, and in 1781, he abandoned his estate at Hempstead Plains to return to England, leaving his family behind until he could arrange their settlement elsewhere. He later \\"estimated the price of his loyalty at ¬£6,500 in real and personal estate.\\" Along with his brother Gabriel, he settled in the newly created Province of New Brunswick in Canada where the British Government gave them large tracts of land for the losses they sustained in New York. In 1784, he was named the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Province of New Brunswick. James Putnam, Isaac Allen, and Joshua Upham were appointed as assistant judges. His brother Gabriel was named the first mayor of the important port city of Saint John, New Brunswick. As chief justice he was a member of the original council that was to administer the province and he \\"participated in all decisions regarding legislation and justice\\" throughout Thomas Carleton's governorship. Ludlow and his brother held these positions for the next 25 years until his death in 1808.  Controversial views  Ludlow, a slaveholder himself, upheld slavery in New Brunswick in a controversial court case in February 1800. George Ludlow found that slavery was lawful based on customs in North America despite there being no British statute legalizing it. However, by 1820 slavery ended in New Brunswick, partly due to the controversy arising from the 1800 decision. George Duncan Ludlow also served on a local board of commissioners for the Sussex Vale Indian Residential School where he advocated for the total removal of Indigenous children from their parents. Personal life On 22 April 1758, Ludlow married his cousin, Frances Duncan, a daughter of Thomas Duncan and Mary (n√©e Ketcham) Duncan. In 1764, the Duncan home, a 3-story house on Pearl Street (then known as Queen Street), caught fire and burned to the ground, killing her mother and seven siblings in the nursery on the third floor. Only Frances, her father and her younger sister Arabella escaped. Arabella later married George's younger half-brother, Daniel Ludlow. Together, Frances and George were the parents of one son and two daughters, including: * Frances Duncan Ludlow (1766‚Äì1797) was the second wife of Richard Harison, a law partner of Alexander Hamilton who served as the Recorder of New York City and the 1st U.S. Attorney for the District of New York. * Elizabeth Ludlow (1768‚Äì1826), who married John Robinson, a Lt. in the Royal American Regiment who was a son of Col. Beverley Robinson and Susanna Philipse. * George Duncan Ludlow (1773‚Äì1847), who married Mrs. Carson, who was born in the Nevis, West Indies, in 1825. After her death, he married Camille Bernier in Paris, France. Ludlow acquired about 1,500 acres about five miles north of the new province's capital of Fredericton where he built a large home on the Saint John River, which he called Spring Hill after the estate of Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden, his New York patron of the 1760s. In February 1808, his brother Gabriel died and he suffered a paralytic stroke the following month that rendered him largely incapacitated until his death at Spring Hill on November 13, 1808. He was buried at the Old Burial Ground in Fredericton.Isabel Louise Hill, The Old Burial Ground, Vol. II, (1979) pp. 108‚Äì110 Legacy The village of Ludlow in Northumberland County is named in his honour.Place Names of Atlantic Canada by William Baillie Hamilton (1996 ) University of Toronto Press In 2019, a portrait of Ludlow was removed from Ludlow Hall, which houses the Faculty of Law, on the campus of the University of New Brunswick. On 26 May 2020, his name was removed from the Hall amid disputes about his controversial political stances.

She was the second wife of Emperor Suzong and gained great power during his reign, in alliance with the eunuch Li Fuguo, but eventually she and Li Fuguo turned against each other late in Emperor Suzong's reign, as the emperor grew gravely ill. Zhang tried to have Li Fuguo put to death, but instead was captured and killed by Li Fuguo and was posthumously demoted to commoner rank by Emperor Daizong. Background The future Empress Zhang's family was originally from Deng Prefecture (ÈÑßÂ∑û, roughly modern Nanyang, Henan). Her grandmother Lady Dou was a younger sister of Consort Dou, a concubine of Emperor Ruizong, whose son Li Longji later became emperor (as Emperor Xuanzong). Consort Dou was put to death by Emperor Ruizong's mother Wu Zetian in 693, while Li Longji was just eight. Lady Dou spent much time raising Li Longji, and later, after Emperor Ruizong returned to the throne in 710, he created Lady Dou the Lady of Deng and honored her greatly. Her sons Zhang Quhuo (ÂºµÂéªÊÉë), Zhang Quy√≠ (ÂºµÂéªÁñë), Zhang Qushe (ÂºµÂéªÂ•¢), Zhang Quy√¨ (ÂºµÂéªÈÄ∏, note different tone than his brother), and Zhang Quying (ÂºµÂéªÁõà) all became key officials, and Zhang Quy√¨ would become the father of the future Empress Zhang. As princely consort During Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era (742-756), the future Empress Zhang was selected to be a concubine for Emperor Xuanzong's son and crown prince Li Heng, and she carried the title of Liangdi, the highest rank for the Crown Prince's concubines.New Book of Tang, vol. 47 . It was said that after he was forced to divorce his wife Crown Princess Wei in 746, she became his favorite consort. She was said to be intelligent and well-spoken, and she knew how to please him. In 755, the general An Lushan launched a major rebellion against Emperor Xuanzong's rule, and in 756 was approaching the capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong and Li Heng to flee. On the way to Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçó, roughly modern Sichuan and Chongqing), however, Li Heng left Emperor Xuanzong's train and instead, following the suggestion of his son Li Tan the Prince of Jianning, decided to head for important border military outpost Lingwu to gather troops there to prepare for counterattack. On the way there, he had very few guards, and at night, Consort Zhang would always sleep to the outside of the Crown Prince. When Li Heng told her, \\"It is not a woman's responsibility to fight the bandits,\\" she responded, \\"I am afraid that sudden disaster would occur. If it does, I can use my body to shield you, and Your Royal Highness can get away.\\" Once they got to Lingwu, she gave birth to a child, but immediately got up just three days after birth to sew clothes for soldiers. When Li Heng asked her to rest, she responded, \\"This is no time for me to be idle.\\" He thereafter favored her even more. She would eventually bear two sons for him, Li Shao (Êùé‰Ωã) and Li Tong (Êùé‰æó). As imperial consort Soon after Li Heng arrived in Lingwu, the officials and generals there urged him to take the throne, and he did (as Emperor Suzong). He considered creating Consort Zhang empress, but at the advice of his key advisor Li Mi, decided that it was inappropriate to do so before he had a chance to seek the approval of Emperor Xuanzong (whom he honored as Taishang Huang (retired emperor)). Meanwhile, however, around this time Emperor Xuanzong sent her a saddle with seven kinds of jewels studded on it as a gift. Li Mi opined that in the difficult times, it would be inappropriate for her to use such a luxurious item, and therefore suggested instead that the jewels be removed and rewarded to those soldiers with accomplishments. Emperor Suzong agreed‚Äîand Li Tan publicly praised the decision, causing Consort Zhang to thereafter bear much resentment toward Li Mi and Li Tan. Meanwhile, she entered into an alliance with Emperor Suzong's trusted eunuch Li Fuguo, and together the two became powerful inside the palace, purportedly carrying out much misdeeds. Li Tan considered trying to kill them, and despite Li Mi's advice to the contrary, Li Tan did not stop his planning. In 757, Consort Zhang and Li Fuguo struck first, accusing Li Tan of plotting to kill his older brother Li Chu the Prince of Guangping, and Emperor Suzong, believing their accusation, forced Li Tan to commit suicide. This caused Li Chu and Li Mi to be fearful of her as well, although at Li Mi's urging, Li Chu did not himself try to kill them. Later that year, after a joint Tang-Huige force recaptured Chang'an under Li Chu's command, she was resentful of Li Chu's accomplishment and therefore spread rumors about Li Chu. Li Mi took this opportunity to resign to become a hermit, but before doing so, urged Emperor Suzong strongly not to listen to false accusations against Li Chu. In winter 757, after Emperor Suzong returned to Chang'an, he created Consort Zhang the imperial consort rank of Shufei (Ê∑ëÂ¶É), the second highest rank for imperial concubines,Old Book of Tang, vol. 51 . but did not immediately create her empress. He also created her sons Li Shao the Prince of Xing and Li Tong the Prince of Ding. Her sisters were created ladies, and her brothers Zhang Qing (ÂºµÊ∏Ö) and Zhang Qian (ÂºµÊø≥) married the Ladies Da'ning and Yanhe, respectively. Emperor Suzong created her empress in spring 758. As empress After Empress Zhang became empress, she tried to have her son Li Shao, who was said to be only a few years old, made crown prince. Emperor Suzong, who favored Li Chu as crown prince, could not decide immediately, but after consulting with the official Li Kui, he created Li Chu crown prince later in 758 and changed Li Chu's name to Li Yu. She nevertheless thereafter tried to have Li Yu replaced with Li Shao, but after Li Shao died in 760, because Li Tong was even younger, Li Yu's position was secure. Throughout the years, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo's alliance held, and in 760, they together persuaded Emperor Suzong to acquiesce to forcibly moving Emperor Xuanzong, who was then at his preferred subsidiary palace Xingqing Palace (ËààÊÖ∂ÂÆÆ), back to the main palace, and exiling Emperor Xuanzong's staff members. However, as of spring 762, when both Emperors Xuanzong and Suzong were seriously ill, Empress Zhang and Li Fuguo had begun to be rivals. (During Emperor Suzong's illness, at one point, to display her love for him, she used her blood to write Buddhist sutras in order to seek blessing for him.New Book of Tang, vol. 77 .) She summoned Li Yu and tried to persuade him to join her in killing Li Fuguo and his ally Cheng Yuanzhen. Li Yu declined, and she instead tried to persuade his younger brother Li Xi (Êùé‰øÇ) the Prince of Yue, to join her. Li Xi agreed. (Her biographies in Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang also indicated that she offered to make Li Xi emperor.Old Book of Tang, vol. 52 .) She and Li Xi thereafter had the eunuch Duan Hengjun (ÊÆµÊÅÜ‰øä) select some 200 strong eunuchs, ready to ambush Li Fuguo and Cheng. On May 14,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Empress Zhang issued an order in Emperor Suzong's name, summoning Li Yu. Cheng found out and informed Li Fuguo, who intercepted Li Yu at the palace gate and then escorted him to the camp of the imperial guards under Li Fuguo's command. The guards under LI Fuguo's command then entered the palace and arrested Empress Zhang and Li Xi; the other eunuchs and ladies in waiting fled, leaving Emperor Suzong without care. On May 16, Emperor Suzong died, and Li Fuguo thereafter executed Empress Zhang and Li Xi, as well as Li Xian the Prince of Yan, and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong). Many of her associates were executed, while Zhang Qing, Zhang Qian, and her uncle Dou L√ºxin (Á´áÂ±•‰ø°) were exiled. She was posthumously demoted to commoner rank.

Tanchelm, the date and place of whose birth is unknown, was supposed to have been a monk, perhaps from the circle of Count Robert II of Flanders (1092‚Äì1111). From 1112 he preached in Antwerp, the Duchy of Brabant, Flanders and Zeeland against the official church and its hierarchy, against the Real Presence in the Eucharist. He opposed the payment of tithes and condemned those priests who lived with women. He was apparently also in Rome, where he is supposed to have campaigned, in vain, for an extension of the Bishopric of Th√©rouanne to cover the islands of the Scheldt. He was briefly put under arrest in Cologne in 1113/1114 but released again, despite the vigorous protests of the cathedral clergy of Utrecht. In 1115, he was slain by a priest while on a water journey. The followers of Tanchelm, who is reported to have allowed himself to be venerated almost to the point of worship, were still to be found for a period after his death in Antwerp; in 1124 Saint Norbert of Xanten preached against their heresies.

As an inspector, he was the investigating officer on the 1923 Seznec case, in which he has been accused of falsifying the evidence.Between Justice And Politics: The Ligue Des Droits De L'Homme, 1898-1945, William D. Irvine, Leland Stanford Jr University, 2007The French Against the French: Collaboration and Resistance, Milton Dank, J. B.

During World War II, France was occupied by Nazi Germany. Bonny became a collaborator and joined the French Gestapo, known as the Carlingue. Upon the Liberation of Paris he was put on trial and later convicted on war crimes. He was executed by firing squad on 26 December 1944 alongside career criminal Henri Lafont and footballer-turned-crook Alexandre Villaplane.The French Against the French: Collaboration and Resistance, Milton Dank, J. B. Lippincott Company, 1974, p.221 Beside the overwhelming memory of a traitor and unscrupulous collaborator, he is commonly seen as incarnating the figure of a corrupt man; the executor of the lower works of the Vichy regime. He is held to be the basis for the character of Monsieur Philibert in Patrick Modiano's wartime novel (The Night Watch).  Early life  Bonny was born on January 25, 1895 in Bordeaux, France. His parents were farmers. After finishing his secondary education in Bordeaux, he briefly found office work at a branch of Peugeot, and then at the Compagnie g√©n√©rale transatlantique (or the French Line). In December 1915, he was drafted and became a POW shortly thereafter, during the Battle of the Somme. He remained imprisoned for the majority of the war. Repatriated to France in 1918, he was posted as secretary to the general staff of the Bordeaux military region, with the rank of corporal.  Police work (1920-1927)  In 1919, Bonny took the police exam and entered the force as an inspector in the provisional police force that was operating in liberated regions. He married Blanche √âmie in 1920, and worked in Somme, France, before being transferred to the oversight unit of the S√ªret√© g√©n√©rale's forensic investigation services in Paris on August 11, 1922. He would spend the rest of his career there, working under divisional commissioners Vidal, Granger, and then Hennet until his termination in January, 1935. The S√ªret√©, nicknamed \\"The Secret\\", was under the command of the Minister of the Interior, and was located on the rue des Saussaies. Their jurisdiction was expansive, and included the policing of gambling, associations, syndicates, and other groups with potential to cause civil unrest, surveillance of foreigners and counter-espionage, as well as business, press, and publishing. Although they were responsible for the entire region, the S√ªret√©'s budget was limited compared to that of its rival, the Paris Prefecture of Police and its Directorate of Judicial Police.  Assignment to counterintelligence  This is a period of uncertainty in Bonny's career. It is thought that during this period, Bonny was dispatched for a time to work in counterintelligence for the Minister of War. According to his son, Jacques Bonny, he resolved a number of leaks which supposedly earned him favor with General Maud'huy. The date of these events is uncertain. Maurice Gar√ßon supposes that they took place before Bonny's entrance into the police force, but Jacques Bonny, drawing from an anonymous article in D√©tective magazine from the early 1930s, places these events in the early 1920s. The following is Bonny's principal biographer's (Guy Prenaud) comment on the subject: \\"one wonders whether it was not at that time, having then acquired the reputation of a particularly capable man, that some people thought of employing Pierre Bonny for work that was rather confidential, but undoubtedly a little undesirable because it was on the borderline of legality.\\", whereas Jacques Bonny is quoted saying the following: \\"No sooner had he joined the police force than, thanks to luck and his special skills, he unconsciously got his dick caught in the wringer, perhaps the most dangerous one of all: 'parapolitics', so as not to say politics in general.\\"  The Seznec Affair  In January 1923, Bonny obtained the grade of trainee inspector at the S√ªret√© g√©n√©rale. Posted as a \\"clerical secretary\\" to Commissioner Achille Vidalin June 1923, he became involved in the Seznec Affair where he played only a minor role. The case cited over 500 meeting minutes/other records, and Bonny's name appeared in only four minutes (only one of which he drew up himself), and in five reports. Bonny did not discover the famous typewriter, which was one of the key pieces of evidence in the Seznec Affair, however, he was assigned to transport the typewriter to Paris so that it could be examined as part of the investigation. Bonny's presence in the investigation took on considerable importance much later. Joseph Marie Guillaume Seznec's post-war defense, based on late testimonies, makes Bonny out to have orchestrated the conspiracy and to be the author of allegedly false witness statements against Seznec. After the request for revision made in 1955 at the direction of the journalist Claude Bal, it is one of the arguments formed by the lawyer Denis Langlois in 1977, and is among those newly presented in 2001 by Jean-Denis Bredin.

The practice is currently led by Liza Fior and Katherine Clarke. Every project contains an element of unsolicited, unpaid for research. The practice was founded to challenge conventional architectural practice, with their own set of values and a firmly women based agenda, muf question the roles within architectural practice. The practice put community at the centre of their projects. Their practice insists upon creatively exploring solutions which do not have to result in the creation of a building. muf works to support marginal claims to space and often create a multiplicity of small, modest proposals to an over-arching solution. muf offer flexible working to their staff ensuring that their ideals are interwoven to their practice, they have never had less than 80 percent female staff ratio. They have worked closely with Hackney council on many projects including Kings Crescent Estate which is particularly notable for the Play Street, the scheme works with regeneration and new build, it is a tenure- blind scheme reconnects the estate to the outside world and engaged the residents throughout the transformation of their estate. In 2011 muf worked to renovate Altab Ali Park. Named after a Bangladeshi-born garment worker who was murdered by teenagers in Whitechapel in 1978, the park stands on the site of the white-walled 14th-century church which was bombed during the Blitz. Muf maintained the complex layers of the site, demarcating the shape of the church on the earth, leaving the old tombstones and adding structures and stones (some fragments of the old church) to create a web of memorialisation, personal and urban, social, local and global. History muf were formed in 1994 when they were loaned office space for 6-months in Great Sutton Street, London. They were committed to working in the public realm, at the same time critiqueing the private realm (where 'care' and 'feeling' had been confined). muf were strong supporters of flexible working practices, which allowed childcare responsibilities and external teaching commitments to continue.Doina Petrescu, Altering practices: feminist politics and poetics of space, Routledge (2007), pp. 57‚Äì68.

History  Redcliffe College was founded on 5 April 1892 as the YWCA Testing and Training Home.Redcliffe College, Redcliffe College: 1892-1992 (London: Redcliffe College, 1992), p.1. Originally based at 495 Kings Road, Chelsea, in 1896 497 Kings Road was purchased and a door was made between the two houses. Redcliffe was the first institution to provide missionary service training for women. In 1917 the College moved to 66 Redcliffe Gardens, Kensington. In 1931 the College moved again to 66 Grove Park Road, Chiswick where it remained until 1995. During the Second World War, the War Office took over the college for use by the Women's Auxiliary Air Force while the students moved to Lancashire, Upper Norwood, and Feering. They returned to Chiswick in 1944. In 1984, the college became co-educational, allowing men as well as women to enrol. In 1995 the College relocated to Wotton House in Gloucester, where it began delivering courses in collaboration with the University of Gloucestershire, offering undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes. In partnership with Wycliffe Bible Translators and SIL International, Redcliffe established the Centre for Linguistics, Translation and Literacy in 2013, providing specialist training for field workers in this area; this continued until July 2019. In 2015, the College embarked on a new era, discontinuing its undergraduate programme to focusing on providing continuing professional development for Christian ministry, mission and development workers. Selling its Wotton House site in early 2016, Redcliffe moved to the grounds of Gloucester Cathedral, where it delivers blended learning postgraduate programmes. Redcliffe also has hubs in Asia and Oceania where it delivers the MAs in Leadership and Member Care.  Approach  Redcliffe's ethos and course design is based on providing continuing professional development (also described variously as continuing vocational development or continuing ministry development) to those in active Christian mission, ministry or third-sector global development work. Redcliffe has a specific focus on cross-cultural training, noting that the majority of students are involved in work that requires significant cross-cultural skills, as they work with and across multicultural and cross-cultural boundaries. Core programmes are designed to be studied part-time and with blended delivery, in order to ensure that students remain effective on-the-job practitioners while they study, critically engaging with their practice and experience, as well as their theory.  Courses  Each course at Redcliffe comprises a range of modules including topics in biblical, theological, cross-cultural and missional studies. Current courses available include: Postgraduate courses *Postgraduate MA in Contemporary Missiology; can recognise a specialism in: **Bible and Mission **European Mission **Justice, Advocacy and Reconciliation **Scripture Engagement *Postgraduate MA in Leadership in a Complex World *Postgraduate MA in Member Care Week-long courses *Time to Lead University accreditation All of Redcliffe's courses (except short course options) are validated by the University of Gloucestershire, and the College is accredited by the British Accreditation Council. In-keeping with its focus on continuing professional development, modules are available to auditing students on a non-validated basis, and postgraduate degree programmes can be completed over a period of between two and four years.

L. McDougall, 09/1854 from the Franklin House Hotel Guest Register dating from Sept, 1854 - April, 1855. This register is in the private collection of H. Blair Howell. Archibald Livingston McDougall (1817 ‚Äì June 23, 1864) was an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War who commanded the 123rd New York Volunteer Infantry early in the war and subsequently led a brigade at the Battle of Gettysburg. Biography Archibald Livingston McDougall was born in 1817 near East Greenwich in Washington County, New York. In 1848, McDougall married Mary Blanchard (b.1826), with whom he had five children: John (b.1849), William (1854-1886), Mary (b.1856), Jennie McDougall Davison (b.1859), and Grace McDougall Law (b.1861). He worked as a lawyer in Pennsylvania and New York before enlisting for military service in September 1862, during the American Civil War. McDougall was appointed colonel of Company S of the 123rd New York on July 26, 1862. His regiment joined the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, XII Corps under Alpheus Williams in time for the Battle of Chancellorsville. After Chancellorsville, the remaining units of the 2nd Brigade were amalgamated into the 1st Brigade of Brig. Gen. Joseph F. Knipe. When Knipe went on convalescent leave because of an old wound, McDougall became acting brigade commander. He commanded the brigade on the march of XII Corps north that began on June 13, 1863. His brigade served on Culp's Hill, except when it went to the left flank of the army late on July 2, 1863, to help stop the Confederate advance. When they returned to the right flank, McDougall's men almost collided with Confederate troops who had occupied part of Culp's Hill. Knipe returned to XII Corps after Gettysburg, and McDougall rejoined his regiment. He did file a report on his brigade's actions at Gettysburg.McDougall's Official Report for Gettysburg When Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker took XII Corps and two divisions of XI Corps to the relief of the Army of the Cumberland, besieged in Chattanooga, Williams‚Äô division was assigned to guard supply lines. Thus it missed the battles in which Brig. Gen. John W. Geary‚Äôs 2nd Division participated. McDougall's regiment joined the new XX Corps in the Army of the Cumberland. He was wounded in the leg at the Battle of New Hope Church, Georgia on May 25, 1864. Surgeons amputated the leg, but McDougall died on June 23, 1864, at an officers‚Äô hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

He studied law at the University of Salamanca, but in 1564 forsook the legal career in order to become a Jesuit. While in Spain, he was Prefect of the College of √Åvila, Procurator of the Province of his order, founder of the College of Villa Garcia, its rector and master of novices, and rector of the College of Valladolid. He learned of a call for fifty Jesuits, to be sent to Peru; he asked permission to become one of their number. He reached Lima in 1581 and found there his appointment as rector of the College of San Pablo. In that capacity he was surrogate to the Provincial, Father Baltasar de Pi√±as, and founded, under the direction of the Company of Jesus, the College of San Martin, the first school of secular learning established at Lima. The foundation of that school was confirmed by Pope Sixtus V, in 1585, and Father Atienza became its first rector. In 1580 he was made Provincial of the Jesuits in Peru. He fostered and extend the missions in Ecuador, the Gran Chaco, Tucuman and Paraguay. Out of these efforts the province of Paraguay was born in 1607. During that period a printing press was established by the Jesuits at the Indian village of . Jointly with Father Jose de Acosta, he directed the publication of catechisms and textbooks of Christian doctrine for the use of the Indians.

Story  * Gathering of the Heroes Chapter It was the times of war in the continent of Mirisha, a time where the three kingdoms of Shou, Gou and Giga struggle for power and authority. Before the three countries become established, the rebellion of the Yellow Scarves has allowed Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) to seize control over the government, he killed Reitei (Han Ling Di) the emperor of that time and stole the \\"Gyokuji (ÁéâÁíΩ)\\", then promoted himself to Prime Minister spreading tyranny through the land. But a year after, the anti- Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) spirits are on the rise because of the discovery of Reitei's (Han Lin Di's) assassination, Enshuu (Shou/Shu Kingdom) was quick on gathering troops and with Sousou (Cao Cao) on board the anti-Toutaku alliance is formed. Heroes from all over gather under the anti-Toutaku banner, including Ryuubi's (Liu Bei's) Yuushu Resistance. The anti-Toutaku allied forces fought against the Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) Troops at the Korou Fortress (Hu Lao Guan) which is just outside Rakuyou. This chapter parallels the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Hulao Pass. *Clash of the Heroes Chapter The anti-Toutaku (Dong Zhuo) alliance was disbanded after the defeat of Toutaku, the heroes each return to their homeland, expanding their territory and causing conflicts. With the death of Sonken Zephyranthes (Sun Jian), his son Sonsaku (Sun Ce) is aiming to stabilize the situation in Koto. Sousou (Cao Cao) has clashed with the Hero of Kahoku, Enshou (Yuan Shao). Ryuubi (Liu Bei) has travelled far from his homeland Yuushu to Keishuu to seek help from the famous strategist, Koumei (Kong Ming). This chapter parallels the Battle of Guandu and the events eventually leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. *Battle of the War Gods The battle of Red Cliff ended with the victory of Ryuubi (Liu Bei) and Sonken (Sun Quan) army, the land is split into three kingdoms ‚Äì Shou, Giga and Gou. But there is no news of the missing Sousou (Cao Cao) and Ryuubi (Liu Bei). On the empty throne of Shou is the Ryuuteiken and ascending the throne of Giga is son of Sousou (Cao Cao), Souhi (Cao Pi). Souhi leads Giga to a campaign to conquer the land westwards. On the barren lands of Seiryou stands one man, Bachou (Ma Chao), burning with flames of revenge. The Giga Troops are said to be dark zombies with burning red eyes and are impossible to kill. Later in the series, the god of war, Shuu, returns. This chapter parallels the events after the formation of the Three Kingdoms themselves. *Side Story: Heroic Clash Chronicles As time gradually progress towards the Red Cliff Battle, a whistling lone warrior wanders Mirisha. The warrior bearing the same name as the past ruler of So \\"Kouseki\\" encounters other warriors at various places, often engaging in clashes with them. And now after many struggles he finally arrive at his homeland Kishuu, the land soon to be the battlefield of the Red Cliffs and the land last known as \\"So\\"... The stories of the heroes not touched on in the main story, told in 12 episodes through the manga in the instruction sheet of the model kits in the series. The key character of this side story is Kouseki Turn-X (Xiang Yu). The story is set before the Battle of the Red Cliffs and parallels the Chu‚ÄìHan contention. *Brave Battle Warriors BBW, to some extent, can be considered as the fourth part of Sangokuden, and is played out in anime and plamodel series. Storywise, it follows the past series but with the addition of more details like Sousou's attempt to assassinate Toutaku. With the anime as the main story, the plamodel series serves as a digest for the parts involving the character. Even though both series are on the same timeline, there are exceptions where the anime vary from the plamodel series. There are also characters original to the anime. *Brave Battle Warriors Genesis The manga serialization in Gundam Ace. It focus on episodes not shown in the anime's main story.

Wiley-VCH . Solid form When SiO gas is cooled rapidly, it condenses to form a brown/black polymeric glassy material, (SiO)n, which is available commercially and used to deposit films of SiO. Glassy (SiO)n is air- and moisture- sensitive. Oxidisation Its surface readily oxidizes in air at room temperature, giving an SiO2 surface layer that protects the material from further oxidation. However, (SiO)n irreversibly disproportionates into SiO2 and Si in a few hours between 400 and 800¬∞C, and very rapidly between 1,000 and 1,440¬∞C, although the reaction does not go to completion.W. Hertl and W. W. Pultz, J. Am. Ceramic Soc. Vol. 50, Issue 7, (1967) pp. 378-381. Formation of SiO The first precise report on the formation of SiO was in 1887J. W. Mellor \\"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry\\" Vol VI, Longmans, Green and Co. (1947) p. 235. by the chemist Charles F. Maybery (1850‚Äì1927) at the Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland. Maybery claimed that SiO formed as an amorphous greenish-yellow substance with a vitreous luster when silica was reduced with charcoal in the absence of metals in an electric furnace.C. F. Maybery Amer. Chem. Journ. 9, 11, (1887). The substance was always found at the interface between the charcoal and silica particles. By investigating some of the chemical properties of the substance, its specific gravity, and a combustion analysis, Maybery deduced that the substance must be SiO. The equation representing the partial chemical reduction of SiO2 with C can be represented as: : ‚áå Complete reduction of SiO2 with twice the amount of carbon yields elemental silicon and twice the amount of carbon monoxide. In 1890, the German chemist Clemens Winkler (the discoverer of germanium) was the first to attempt to synthesize SiO by heating silicon dioxide with silicon in a combustion furnace.C. Winkler Ber. 23, (1890) p. 2652. : ‚áå However, Winkler was not able to produce the monoxide since the temperature of the mixture was only around 1000¬∞C. The experiment was repeated in 1905 by Henry Noel Potter (1869‚Äì1942), a Westinghouse engineer. Using an electric furnace, Potter was able to attain a temperature of 1700¬∞C and observe the generation of SiO. Potter also investigated the properties and applications of the solid form of SiO.U.S. Patent 182,082, July 26, 1905.E. F. Roeber H. C. Parmelee (Eds.) Electrochemical and Metallurgical Industry, Vol. 5 (1907) p. 442. Because of the volatility of SiO, silica can be removed from ores or minerals by heating them with silicon to produce gaseous SiO in this manner. However, due to the difficulties associated with accurately measuring its vapor pressure, and because of the dependency on the specifics of the experimental design, various values have been reported in the literature for the vapor pressure of SiO (g). For the pSiO above molten silicon in a quartz (SiO2) crucible at the melting point of silicon, one study yielded a value of 0.002 atm.\\"Handbook of Semiconductor Silicon Technology,\\" W. C. O'Mara, R. B. Herring, L. P. Hunt, Noyes Publications (1990), p. 148 For the direct vaporization of pure, amorphous SiO solid, 0.001 atm has been reported.J. A. Nuth III, F. T. Ferguson, The Astrophysical Journal, 649, 1178-1183 (2006) For a coating system, at the phase boundary between SiO2 and a silicide, 0.01 atm was reported.\\"High-Temperature Oxidation-Resistant Coatings ,\\" National Academy of Sciences/National Academy of Engineering (1970), p. 40 Silica itself, or refractories containing SiO2, can be reduced with H2 or CO at high temperatures, e.g.:Charles A. (2004) Schacht Refractories handbook. CRC Press, . :(g) ‚áå As the SiO product volatilizes off (is removed), the equilibrium shifts to the right, resulting in the continued consumption of SiO2. Based on the dependence of the rate of silica weight loss on the gas flow rate normal to the interface, the rate of this reduction appears to be controlled by convective diffusion or mass transfer from the reacting surface.G. Han; H. Y. Sohn J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 88 [4] 882-888 (2005)R. A. Gardner J. Solid State Chem. 9, 336-344 (1974) Gaseous (molecular) SiO Silicon monoxide molecules have been trapped in an argon matrix cooled by helium. In these conditions, the SiO bond length is between 148.9 pm and 151 pm.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, Academic Press (2001) p. 858. This bond length is similar to the length of Si=O double bonds (148 pm) in the matrix-isolated linear molecule (O=Si=O), indicative of the absence of a triple bond as in carbon monoxide. However, the SiO triple bond has a calculated bond length of 150 pm and a bond energy of 794 kJ/mol, which are also very close to those reported for SiO. The SiO double bond structure is, notably, an exception to Lewis' octet rule for molecules composed of the light main group elements, whereas the SiO triple bond satisfies this rule. That anomaly not withstanding, the observation that monomeric SiO is short-lived and that (SiO)'n' oligomers with 'n' = 2,3,4,5 are known, all having closed ring structures in which the silicon atoms are connected through bridging oxygen atoms (i.e. each oxygen atom is singly bonded to two silicon atoms; no Si-Si bonds), suggests the Si=O double bond structure, with a hypovalent silicon atom, is likely for the monomer. Condensing molecular SiO in argon matrix together with fluorine, chlorine or carbonyl sulfide (COS), followed by irradiation with light, produces the planar molecules (with Si-O distance 148 pm) and (Si-O 149 pm), and the linear molecule (Si-O 149 pm, Si-S 190 pm). Matrix-isolated molecular SiO reacts with oxygen atoms generated by microwave discharge to produce molecular which has a linear structure. When metal atoms (such as Na, Al, Pd, Ag, and Au) are co-deposited with SiO, triatomic molecules are produced with linear (AlSiO and PdSiO), non-linear (AgSiO and AuSiO), and ring (NaSiO) structures. Solid (polymeric) SiO Potter reported SiO solid as yellowish- brown in color and as being an electrical and thermal insulator. The solid burns in oxygen and decomposes water with the liberation of hydrogen. It dissolves in warm alkali hydroxides and in hydrofluoric acid. Even though Potter reported the heat of combustion of SiO to be 200 to 800 calories higher than that of an equilibrium mixture of Si and SiO2 (which could, arguably, be used as evidence that SiO is a unique chemical compound),J. W. Mellor \\"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry\\" Vol VI, Longmans, Green and Co. (1947) p. 234. some studies characterized commercially available solid silicon monoxide materials as an inhomogeneous mixture of amorphous SiO2 and amorphous Si with some chemical bonding at the interface of the Si and SiO2 phases.Friede B., Jansen M.

Many believe it originates from the word fayruz, meaning \\"turquoise\\" in Syriac (a dialect of the Aramaic language still spoken there), in reference to the green color of the surrounding landscape. However, some historians believe the name \\"Fairouzeh\\" was mentioned in the Old Testament as \\"Berothah\\" (Second Book of Samuel, 8:8). History The majority of the village's inhabitants were farmers. The majority of people owned enough land to grow wheat, barley, lentil, olive trees and wine grapes. Almost every family raised sheep, goats and chickens. The original farmers also owned horses, donkeys and cows. They were self-sufficient of basic food supply throughout the whole year. The water source was acquired from deep wells about (18 to 20 meters). The two most famous wells (Jub) were Jub Hamza and Jub Jaaber. Without the existence of these two wells, the continuous life in Fayruzah as we know it would have not existed. The structure of Jub Hamza in the middle of the village was preserved as a ‚Äúmonument‚Äù for current and future generations. The village now uses city running water and electricity. The elders in the village were known for their colorful and unique clothes. Most men, women and kids wore similar traditional outfits. The homes were built similar in shape and architectural design. Traditional home walls were built from hardened mud pieces and the roofs from wood and topped with mixed hay and mud. Some of the early big homes had several families living together side by side. The most known family names in early Fayruzah are: Abdullatif, Abdulnour, Abdulhai, Abdel Aziz, Askar, Assaf, Assfour, Attiyah, Ballat, Dabbous, Danial, Deeb, Dib, Diab, Darghali, Fattali, Fedail, Fleyeh, Ghanem, Grair, Habahab, Habroun, Hannoun, Hamad, Hawara, Helow, Hourany, Howarah, Hushaan, Hussary, Jubi, Joudi, Kassas, Khalil, Maida, Mbarkeh, Maleh, Makhool, Mashhour, Masoudi, Mushamel, Nader, Nahim, Nakkoud, Noufal, Nussais, Rahal, Ruboz, Sayegh, Seder, Shahadeh, Shahla, Taweel, Toma, Tiessan, Trad, Watfa, Wanis, Younan. In the last 50 years, many more families have moved to Fayruzah from neighboring towns and villages and made it their home. St. Elias Syriac Orthodox Fairouzah‚Äôs population comprises about 7,000 people. Based on a current and future civil plan, it will occupy about of land when it is completed. The village is estimated to have been established around the 16th century. Its first inhabitants were mostly Syriac Orthodox Christians who came from Sadad in the 16th century. They migrated to Fayruzah to be closer to Homs and thus benefit from better living conditions. Most of them were farmers. Modern era In the early 20th-century all children attended elementary school. They were taught religious and general education. The first middle school was built in Fayruzah in 1949 as one of very few middle schools around Homs. Many students from Fayruzah and neighboring villages graduated from this school and continued their higher education in Homs and Damascus. From the end of World War I until after the 1960s, a large wave of Fayruzah's residents emigrated to South America and to the United States, seeking better living conditions. Currently there exists a large community of Fairouzian people in Los Angeles and smaller ones in Detroit, Jacksonville and Miami. There are also a few families from the village living in Salta, Argentina. This is believed to be one of the reasons why the villagers were introduced to the traditional Argentinian drink, mate.

Early life Samaratunga died when Balaputra was a boy. As a young heir to the throne, his authority in Central Java was frequently challenged by local landlords. An extended family member by the name of Garung forced Balaputra to accept his tutorship. Garung was part of the Sanjaya Dynasty and was related to Balaputra through marriage of Garung's son, Rakai Pikatan to Pramodhawardhani, Balaputra's sister. During the regency of Garung, the Javanese political landscape was relatively peaceful. The regency ended in 832 when Garung disappeared.  Sri Maharaja of Suvarnadvipa, King of Srivijaya  Around 852, Rakai Pikatan of Sanjaya began garnering influence from the local nobles. This worried Balaputra and he tried to suppress Rakai Pikatan in order to regain control. His effort failed miserably however, due to his inexperience. The Sailendras were eventually forced to leave Java for Palembang, the seat of Srivijaya as well as the home of Balaputra's mother, Tara. Balaputra's defeat by Jatiningrat (Pikatan) was recorded in the Shivagrha inscription that recorded that Balaputra had constructed a fortress made of hundreds of heaped stones for his refuge. With the retreat, Central Java fell into the hands of Sanjaya, ending the Sailendra's rule over the area. The Sanjayas later founded the Medang Kingdom and continued to rule Java until Srivijaya reasserted its dominance over the island in the 11th century. Soon after he left Java, Balaputra became the ruler of Srivijaya. While the record on Balaputra is scarce, it is known through the Nalanda inscription that he ordered the construction of a Buddhist monastery in Nalanda, India. He also sent an ambassador to China.

He left a valuable anthology of Arabic poetry to accompany his many historical works http://www.crusades- encyclopedia.com/imadaldin.html and worked as a man of letters during the Zengid and Ayyubid period. Biography He was born in Isfahan in the year 1125, and studied at the Nizamiyya school in Baghdad. He graduated into the bureaucracy, and held jurisdiction over Basra and Wasit. He then became a deputy of the vizier ibn Hubayra. After the death of ibn Hubayra, he went to Damascus in 1166 CE (562 Islamic Calendar) and entered the service of the qadi of Damascus, Kamal ad-Din. The qadi presented him to the Zengid Nur ad-Din, who appointed him a professor in the school he had established there, which then became known as the Imadiyya school in his honour. Nur ad-Din was later appointed to be his Chancellor. After the death of Nur ad-Din in 1174, Imad ad-Din was removed from all his bureaucratic duties, and was banished from the palace. He went to live in Mosul and later entered the service of Saladin, the Kurdish Sultan of Egypt during that time. When Saladin took control of Damascus, Saladin's vizier, al-Qadi al-Fadil, appointed him chancellor, and he also became al-Fadil's deputy. Although Saladin had been unsure of his talent because he was only a scribe, Imad ad-Din soon became one of the sultan's favourites. As chancellor he did not have to perform the everyday duties of the chancery scribes, and he had a lot of leisure time in Egypt. From then on he accompanied Saladin on all his campaigns. After a certain raid, he was chosen to kill one of the prisoners, but the prisoner was a child and was instead exchanged for a Muslim prisoner held by the Crusaders. Imad ad-Din was present at the Battle of Marj Uyun, the Battle of Hattin, and the subsequent campaign to expel the Crusaders from the Holy Land. At Acre, he criticized Saladin for giving away the city's treasure instead of spending it on the reconquest. At Beirut, he became ill, but was the only scribe capable of writing the terms of surrender. He had recuperated in time to see the aftermath of the Siege of Jerusalem (1187), where he again criticized Saladin's generosity; he was also disgusted by those in charge of the ransom who took bribes, and the rich Crusader nobles who took their treasures with them rather than ransoming the poor. He was present at Acre again during the Third Crusade when the Christians retook the city of Acre, and was among those who fled after the defeat. After Saladin's death in 1193, he began writing his biographies of the sultan. He wrote the Kitab al-Barq al-Shami, which is largely lost, save for its third and fifth volumes, but was abridged by al- Bundari and used heavily by the Muslim historians Ibn al-Athir and Abu Shama in their own chronicles. He also wrote al-Fath al-Qussi fi-l-Fath al-Qudsi, which survives. He died in 1201.

In liturgical churches the dismissal will often take the form of ritualized words and gestures, such as raising the minister's hands over the congregation, or blessing with the sign of the cross. The use of a final blessing at the end of a liturgical service may be based upon the Priestly Blessing prescribed for the kohanim in the Torah (). Eastern Orthodoxy Patriarch Theophilus III of Jerusalem, giving the blessing with Dikirion and Trikion. In the Orthodox Church, blessings by the priest will occur at both the beginning and the end of each service, and there may be other benedictions during the course of the service. The final benediction is the dismissal, and will often entail mention of the feast day or saint being commemorated that day. Russian Orthodox priest giving dismissal with blessing cross at the end of Divine Liturgy. The priest will bless with his right hand, and the bishop will bless with both hands. In both cases, the hand is held so that the fingers form the initials IC XC (the abbreviation for \\"Jesus Christ\\" in Greek), and at the concluding words he traces the Sign of the Cross in the air with his hand. If a bishop is holding his paterissa (crozier) while making the dismissal, he will raise both his right and left hands and trace the Sign of the Cross with both his crozier and right hand, crossing the one in front of the other, then blessing again with the Dikirion and Trikion, as the choir chants, Eis poll√° etƒì, D√©spota (\\"Many years, O Master\\"). More solemn benedictions, such as that which comes at the end of the Divine Liturgy, will be made with a blessing cross rather than the hand.  Greater Dismissal  Dismissals are of two types: the Greater Dismissal and the Lesser Dismissal. The Greater Dismissal is used at the end of the Divine Liturgy, Vespers and Matins. The general form of the Greater Dismissal is as follows: :May Christ our true God, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother; of the holy, glorious and all-praised apostles, * of (the patron saint of the church or monastery), of (the saint whose feast day it is), of the holy and righteous ancestors of God, Joachim and Anna; and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind. * At the Great Dismissal, the priest will insert a special phrase according to the day of the week: On Sundays and from Pascha until its apodosis (leavetaking), it comes at the very beginning: *Sunday: May He Who rose from the dead, Christ our true God... On Wednesdays and Fridays, it is inserted after mentioning the Mother of God: *Wednesday and Friday: ...by the power of the precious and life-creating Cross... On the other days of the week it is inserted before mentioning the patron saint: *Monday: ...through the mediations of the honourable heavenly bodiless hosts... *Tuesday: ...of the honourable, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John... *Thursday: ...of our father among the saints, Nicholas the Wonderworker... *Saturday: ...of the holy, glorious and victorious martyrs; of our holy and God-bearing fathers...  Lesser Dismissal  The Lesser Dismissal is used services at which the Greater Dismissal is not called for, such as the Little Hours and Typica, Compline, Midnight Office, etc. It does not mention the commemoration of the day of the week (except on Sundays), the patron saint of the church or the saint of the day. The Lesser Dismissal is as follows: :May Christ our true God, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God- bearing fathers and of all the saints, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind. On Sundays and from Pascha until its apodosis, the phrase, May He Who rose from the dead... is inserted at the beginning of the Lesser Dismissal; however, none of the other weekday phrases are used. When used at the end of the Liturgy of Preparation and Prayers of Thanksgiving after Communion the saint who composed the Liturgy is inserted after mention of the Mother of God (see next section). Divine Liturgy At the dismissals used at the Divine Liturgy‚Äîwhether Greater or Lesser‚Äîafter commemorating the apostles, the priest adds the name of the saint who is credited with writing the Liturgy: * Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom: ...of our father among the saints, John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople... * Liturgy of St. Basil the Great: ...of our father among the saints, Basil the Great, archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia... * Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts: ...of our father among the saints, Gregory Dialogist, Pope of Rome...  Festal Dismissals  On Sundays, at each of the Great Feasts of the Lord‚Äîfrom the day of the feast until its apodosis (leavetaking)--on each day of Holy Week, and throughout Bright Week there are special phrases which are added at the beginning of the dismissals. These are used at both the Lesser and the Greater Dismissals, and are inserted before the words: Christ our true God.... *Sundays: May He Who rose from the dead... *Nativity of the Lord: May He Who was born in a cave, and lay in a manger for our salvation... *Circumcision: May He Who on the eighth day deigned to be circumcised for our salvation... *Theophany: May He Who for our salvation deigned to be baptized by John in the Jordan... *Meeting of the Lord: May He Who for our salvation deigned to be carried in the arms of the Righteous Symeon... *Transfiguration: May He Who on Mount Tabor was transfigured in glory before His holy disciples and apostles... *Palm Sunday: May He Who for our salvation didst deign to ride the colt of an ass... *Monday through Wednesday of Holy Week: May He Who is going to His voluntary Passion... *Great Thursday: May He Who through His surpassing goodness did show the most excellent way of humility when He washed the feet of His disciples, and did condescend even unto the Cross and burial for us... *Great Friday: May He Who for us men and for our salvation did deign to suffer the dread Passion and the life-creating Cross, and voluntary burial in the flesh... *Pascha and Bright Week: May He Who rose from the dead, trampling down death by death and on those in the tombs bestowing life... *Ascension: May He Who in glory did ascend from us into heaven and sittest at the right hand of God the Father... *Pentecost: May He Who sent down from heaven the Most Holy Spirit in the form of tongues of fire upon His holy disciples and apostles... *Kneeling Prayer (Pentecost night): May He Who did empty Himself from the divine bosom of the Father, and come down from the heavens to the earth, and take upon Himself all our nature, and deify it; and afterwards did ascend again into the heavens and sit down at the right hand of God the Father, and did send down upon His holy disciples and apostles the Divine and Holy Spirit, one in essence, one in power, one in glory, and co- everlasting, and through Him did enlighten them, and through them the whole world... The phrases used on the Great Feasts of the Lord (excluding Palm Sunday and Pascha) are not said on Sundays, but are replaced with the normal Sunday phrase: May He Who rose from the dead... Furthermore, on the Great Feasts of the Lord, and from Palm Sunday through Thomas Sunday (the Sunday after Easter) neither the patron saint of the church nor the saint of the day are mentioned in the dismissal.

Published in 1958, it was her fourth novel. It is set in a lay religious community situated next to an enclosed order of Benedictine nuns in Gloucestershire. Plot The setting is Imber Court, a country house in Gloucestershire that is the home of a small Anglican lay religious community. It is situated next to Imber Abbey, a convent belonging to an enclosed order of Benedictine nuns. The owner of Imber Court and the community's de facto leader is Michael Meade, a former schoolmaster in his late 30s. The community supports itself by a market garden. The novel begins with the journey of Dora Greenfield from London to Imber by train. Dora is a young former art student who is married to the difficult and demanding Paul Greenfield, an art historian who is staying at Imber Court as a guest while studying 14th-century manuscripts belonging to the Abbey. Dora left her husband six months earlier, but he has persuaded her to return to him. On the same train are Toby Gashe, an 18-year-old boy who has just finished school and is going to spend a few weeks as a guest at Imber Court before starting university, and James Tayper Pace, a community member who formerly ran a settlement house and led youth groups in the East End of London. Among the community members is Catherine Fawley, a young woman who is preparing to enter the convent as a nun. Her twin brother, Nick, is living at Imber Court's lodge. Nick is a troubled and troublesome character, often drunk, who has been invited to Imber Court at the request of his sister in the hope that the spiritual surroundings will be of benefit to him. Fourteen years earlier Michael, then a schoolmaster with aspirations to the priesthood, had been in love with his teenaged pupil Nick. The relationship was unconsummated and apparently mutual, but Nick informed the school's headmaster. As a result, Michael lost his job and did not see Nick again until he came to stay at Imber Court, where the two do not acknowledge having known each other in the past. The Abbey, which is separated from the Court by a lake, has a bell tower but lacks a bell. Shortly after her arrival Paul tells Dora of a centuries-old legend that the original 12th-century bell flew out of the bell tower and plunged into the lake after a nun broke her vows by receiving a lover in the Abbey. A new bell is being manufactured and will be arriving soon. It will be taken first to Imber Court for a christening ceremony to be performed by the Bishop, and then taken over a causeway across the lake to be installed in the Abbey. After a few days Michael takes Toby with him to a nearby town to pick up a mechanical cultivator which the community has purchased for use in the market garden. They have dinner in a pub, where Michael drinks too much cider, and on the drive back Michael realizes that he is attracted to Toby, whom he impulsively kisses when they arrive home. Toby is shocked, and Michael is remorseful and later apologizes to Toby, who agrees to say nothing about the incident. Toby, a keen swimmer and diver, discovers a large object submerged in the lake and concludes that it is a bell, although he has not heard the legend. When he tells Dora what he has found she decides that they should recover the bell and surreptitiously substitute it for the new one. She persuades Toby to go along with the plan, and he uses a tractor to pull the bell from the lake and hide it in an outbuilding in preparation for making the switch the night before the ceremony. However the plan fails, as Toby is prevented from meeting Dora by an encounter with Nick. Nick tells Toby that he saw Michael kiss him, and accuses him of flirting with both Michael and Dora. After winning a physical struggle between the two, Nick sends Toby to confess to James Tayper Pace. As the new bell as being carried across the causeway for its ceremonial entrance into the Abbey, it falls into the lake. It is later discovered that the causeway has been sabotaged, and Nick is suspected. Catherine runs away and tries to drown herself in the lake. Dora tries to save her, but she cannot swim, and both women are rescued by a nun who has observed the incident from the Abbey side of the lake. When Michael arrives on the scene it becomes evident that Catherine is in love with him and is having a mental breakdown. The following day Catherine is taken to a clinic in London, James confronts Michael with the news of Toby's confession, and Nick commits suicide. In the aftermath of these events, the community is dissolved. Toby goes up to Oxford University and Dora once again leaves Paul and resumes her art studies. Major themes A major theme is the yearning for a spiritual life in a materialistic age, which the Imber Court community tries to achieve by partially separating itself from the secular world. Imber Court is intended as a refuge for \\"half-centemplative\\" people who \\"cannot find a work which satisfies them in the ordinary world\\". The community members' spiritual pride is the source of much of the novel's humour, as when an officious community member lets Dora know that she has inadvertently broken a rule against bringing fresh flowers into the house. On the other hand, the unreligious outsider Dora, who is looked down upon by the community members, is the only character whose real and nonjudgemental interest in other people allows her to glimpse Catherine Fawley's inner turmoil. In a similar vein, Michael realizes too late that he has been too concerned with his own spiritual well-being to run the risk of trying to help Nick. The nature of virtue, another major theme, is the subject of two Sunday talks given to the community by James and Michael. James insists that people should strive for perfection by unquestioning observance of a strict moral code, a view which has the attraction of simplicity. Michael, on the other hand, leaves more room for human frailty and suggests moral improvement, rather than perfection, as a reasonable goal. Michael Meade's secret homosexuality is an important aspect of the novel, which was published only one year after the Wolfenden report recommended the decriminalization of private homosexual acts involving consenting adults. His homosexuality is presented without \\"fanfare or politics\\" as one variety of love. Murdoch was notable for her sympathetic portrayal of homosexuals, and after The Bell at least one gay character appeared in each of her novels . The novel's structure is characterized by numerous sets of doubles and \\"contrastive pairs\\", including the twins Nick and Catherine Fawley, the new and old bells, the two communities at Imber Court and Imber Abbey, and the two confessions by Nick and Toby, both of whom are loved by Michael but betray him. These pairs, which contribute a \\"pleasing symmetry\\" to the plot, have also been analysed in terms of Murdoch's Platonic view of reality. Music of various kinds appears frequently and sound is an important image throughout. The sounds include the songs of birds in the forest, which are heard in several scenes, and the bird imitations by one of the community members. The nuns are heard singing in their chapel and some of the Imber Court community sing madrigals and listen to Bach recordings, which Dora dislikes, although she later comes to enjoy Mozart. Literary significance and reception The Bell, Iris Murdoch's fourth novel, was published in 1958 by Chatto & Windus in Great Britain and Viking Press in the United States. It was an immediate popular and commercial success, with 30,000 copies of the British edition printed within ten weeks of its publication. The novel was widely and positively reviewed. The Times, while remarking that Murdoch tended to \\"explain exhaustively rather than to indicate imaginatively\\", described The Bell as \\"a story which is running over with purpose and intelligence\\" and \\"a joy to read\\". Writing in The Spectator, Frank Kermode called it \\"a very notable achievement\\". He noted changes in her style over the course of her four published books, and an increased interest in placing her stories \\"in some large pattern of related meanings\\". Elizabeth Bowen described the book as \\"a masterpiece of direct narrative\\", both \\"more remarkable\\" and \\"more orthodox\\" than her previous books, but retaining Murdoch's characteristic \\"dynamic strangeness\\". In The New York Times, Gilbert Millstein described The Bell as \\"an addition of consistent excellence\\" to her body of work. His review noted thematic parallels with Mary McCarthy's 1949 novel The Oasis. Writing in Partisan Review, Irving Howe found the novel as a whole unrealistic and overly symbolic, but praised Murdoch's ability to write \\"convincingly, without rant or affectation\\" about love, including homosexual love, which he described as a \\"rare novelistic gift\\". Scholars have analysed The Bell in terms of its relationship to Murdoch's philosophical thought. In the 1950s she published several essays opposing the currently dominant schools of analytic philosophy and existentialism. The Bell can be seen as symbolically demonstrating the shortcomings of both views, with the rule-bound Imber Court community representing analysis with its insistence on publicly observable behaviour as the essence of morality, while the unruly and self- absorbed Nick represents Existential Man. Peter Conradi notes that The Bell is \\"her first novel to be fuelled by Platonism, in which Good substitutes for God, and any authentic spiritual tradition, including appreciation of the visual arts ... provides a means of ascent\\". Both Conradi and A. S. Byatt contrast and compare The Bell with Murdoch's 1963 novel The Unicorn. Conradi sees them both as \\"toy(ing) with the sublime\\", which \\"has at its heart the disharmony between mind and world\\", while for Byatt the novels are related to each other by their treatment of religious themes. Adaptations Television The Bell was adapted as a four-part television miniseries by Reg Gadney. Directed by Barry Davis with music by Marc Wilkinson, it appeared on BBC Two beginning on 13 January 1982. The cast included Ian Holm as Michael Meade, Tessa Peake-Jones as Dora Greenfield, and Michael Maloney as Toby Gashe. Radio A three-part adaptation of The Bell by Michael Bakewell was broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 series Classic Serial in November 1999. Among the cast were Cathryn Bradshaw as Dora and Jamie Bamber as Toby.

Shaft alignment is the process of aligning two or more shafts with each other to within a tolerated margin. It is an absolute requirement for machinery before the machinery is put in service. When a driver like an electric motor or a turbine is coupled to a pump, generator, or any other piece of equipment, it is essential that the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. Flexible couplings are designed to allow a driver (electric motor, engine, turbine, hydraulic motor) to be connected to the driven equipment. Flexible couplings use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. Flexible couplings can also use shim packs. These couplings are called disc couplings. Tools used to achieve alignment may be mechanical or optical, like the Laser shaft alignment method, or they are gyroscope based. The gyroscope based systems can be operated very time efficient and can also be even used if the shafts have a large distance (e.g. on marine vessels). Before such a shaft alignment can be done, it is also essential that the foundations for the driver and the driven piece are designed and installed correctly. If that is the case, then shaft alignment can be started. The resulting fault if alignment is not achieved within the demanded specifications is shaft misalignment, which may be parallel, angular, or both. Misalignment can cause increased vibration and loads on the machine parts for which they have not been designed (i.e. improper operation). Types of misalignment There are two types of misalignment: parallel and angular misalignment. With parallel misalignment, the center lines of both shafts are parallel but they are offset. With angular misalignment, the shafts are at an angle to each other. The parallel misalignment can be further divided up in horizontal and vertical misalignment. Horizontal misalignment is misalignment of the shafts in the horizontal plane and vertical misalignment is misalignment of the shafts in the vertical plane: * Parallel horizontal misalignment is where the motor shaft is moved horizontally away from the pump shaft, but both shafts are still in the same horizontal plane and parallel. * Parallel vertical misalignment is where the motor shaft is moved vertically away from the pump shaft, but both shafts are still in the same vertical plane and parallel. Similar, angular misalignment can be divided up in horizontal and vertical misalignment: * Angular horizontal misalignment is where the motor shaft is under an angle with the pump shaft but both shafts are still in the same horizontal plane. * Angular vertical misalignment is where the motor shaft is under an angle with the pump shaft but both shafts are still in the same vertical plane. Errors of alignment can be caused by parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or a combination of the two. Misalignment detection Misaligned rotating machinery causes high cost to the industry as it causes premature damages to the machinery, loss in production and excessive energy consumption. Misalignment is the most common cause of machinery malfunction. A poorly aligned machine could cost 20% to 30% of machine down time, replacement parts, inventory and energy costs. Large returns are usually seen by regularly aligning the machine. The total operation life is extended and process conditions are optimized for efficiency. Hence it becomes extremely important for the maintenance and engineering professionals to understand machine malfunctions caused by misalignment. Vibration signatures are widely promoted for studying machine malfunctions. However, most literature will not be able to provide a clear picture of signature characteristics uniquely and directly attributable to misalignment. Every author will report different signatures. There are still no reports of systematic, controlled experiments with varying parameters. However we can carry out various experiments to elucidate any consistent features of vibration signatures for misaligned machinery. To begin with lets consider a simulator which is fault free and is able generate controlled faults, it should possess three machine operating parameters, coupling types, amount of misalignment and the motor speed which will be systematically varied while all the other parameters will be held constant. The machine should be fault free with the exception of deliberate misalignment which is varied systematically. Therefore, baseline vibration data is recorded for each of the test conditions. Vibrations should be monitored via sensors which should be placed in strategic locations to get accurate data. The X, Y, Z coordinate system is used to show direction. For this experiment we can use three different stiffness couplings, four levels of offset should be used on the left bearing housing to simulate a combination of angular and parallel misalignment. Equivalent offset on the right bearing housing to get parallel misalignment. The experiment must contain four speeds of rotation and the goal here must be to determine the effects of coupling stiffness, level and type of misalignment and finally the speed of rotation on vibration spectra. Data can be acquired from the specially designed hardware and software for the simulator. The purpose of this experiment should be to examine the spectra due to misalignment between the motor and the rotor shafts. Spectral comparisons should be made across coupling measurement points on left bearing housing and the motor. The data should be compared in both vertical and axial direction. If the results at 960 and 2100 RPM do not show significant vibration, the study can be limited to a higher speeds of 2900 and 3800 RPM. A correlation between misalignment and vibration signature could not be discerned. The data for all cases contained several harmonics. Both axial and lateral vibration was present in all cases. The dominant harmonic varied from condition to condition. As a general rule, as expected, increased misalignment yielded increased vibration peaks. As another general rule, peak vibrations in the misaligned machine were in the axial direction. For predictive maintenance applications where the goal is machinery health monitoring, it is sufficient to realize that the problem is complex. One can routinely trend the vibration spectra until it becomes severe. But for root cause analysis, one must exercise caution and perform a detailed analysis. Obviously, the rules provided in training courses and wall charts are doubtful at best. The observed changes that occurred with shifts of speed and misalignment do not show a typical signature for misalignment vibration spectra. Hence, it can be concluded that misalignment vibration is a strong function of machine speed and coupling stiffness. A single point vibration spectrum does not provide good and reliable indication of machinery misalignment. Observations of spectra in axial and radial directions at various speeds and several points are needed to diagnose misalignment effects. Orbital plots of vertical and horizontal measurements in the time domain might also be needed. Non-linear dynamic modelling must be performed to gain full understanding of misalignment effects. Finally, more work in this field is simply needed in order to develop simple rules for diagnosing machinery shaft misalignment.

Schenck was born in Amsterdam and baptized in a Catholic hidden church. He became a renowned virtuoso viola da gamba player. His compositions included music for a Dutch Singspiel, Bacchus, Ceres en Venus, which can claim to be the first opera in Dutch, and from which songs were published in 1687, as well as works for the viola da gamba. Around 1696 he accepted an appointment to the court of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine in D√ºsseldorf. After Johann Wilhelm's death in 1716, the electoral court moved to Mannheim. There is some uncertainty about the date of Schenck's death as there is no mention found in the D√ºsseldorf Protestant church records or parish and cemetery records in Amsterdam. His last known published work appeared in 1712. He is no longer mentioned in the list of court musicians compiled in 1717.

They were men in the prime of their lives who were fairly wealthy, and could afford decent equipment. They were the heavier infantry of the legion who carried large shields and wore good quality armor. Their usual position was the second battle line. They fought in a quincunx formation, supported by light troops. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. History and deployment According to Pat Southern, principes appear to have been born from remnants of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat at the hands of the Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used many smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. Camillan system In the early Camillan system of organisation of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8 metres (6 ft) long. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, the most common form being chainmail, which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement. In this type of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, military units of 60 men each. The principes stood in the second battle line, behind hastati of the first line and in front of the triarii in the third. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least dependable troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line. Polybian system thumb By the time of the Punic wars of the 3rd century BC, this form of organisation was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back. The principes had been increased in number to 1,200 per legion, and formed 10 maniples of 120 men each. The rorarii and accensi had been disbanded. Leves had been replaced with velites, who had a similar role, with forty of them being attached to each maniple in the legion. Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion; the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati, who had also been re-armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii who would then engage the enemy. This order of battle was almost always followed, the Battle of the Great Plains and the Battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force, routing the opposing Carthaginians. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side by side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, he formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry. Marian reforms With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, intended to combat a shortage of manpower from wars against the Numidian king Jugurtha in North Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely with legionaries uniformly armed with gladius and two pilum. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as miles, or soldiers, with the same state purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry.

It launched gunman \\"Mysterious\\" Dave Mather to fame. Mather had first ventured to Las Vegas as a part of the Dodge City Gang, which also included gunmen John Joshua Webb and \\"Arkansas\\" Dave Rudabaugh. Gambler Doc Holliday was also in town at the time, and though generally listed as a member, he was not. However, he was a friend to the gang. The gang was organized by Justice of the Peace Hoodoo Brown, to control the gambling houses in Las Vegas, muscling out any unwanted rivals, thus raking in profits. Dave Mather at that time had a reputation as a gunman, but no real documented accounts of gunfights short of his involvement in the Railroad Wars as a hired gun, with his time in Las Vegas being prior to his well-known 1884 gunfight with lawman Tom Nixon in Dodge City, Kansas. On January 22, 1880, Marshal Joe CarsonJoe Carson and Mather entered Close and Patterson's Variety Hall after receiving complaints from citizens of rowdy customers inside. Whether Mather was actually deputized has never been confirmed, but it is believed that he was because Las Vegas had a \\"no guns in town limits\\" ordinance in effect and Mather was armed. The \\"rowdy customers\\" were cowboys T.J. House, James West, John Dorsey, and William \\"Big\\" Randall, who had been going in and out of saloons and generally making trouble. At some point during the proceedings the cowboys were alleged to have thrown their glasses at a bartender, and dared anyone present to stop them. Upon entering Marshal Carson demanded that the cowboys relinquish their weapons. They refused. A gunfight started; who drew and/or fired first is not known. Marshal Carson was killed almost immediately. Mather killed Randall, wounded West and put him out of the fight, and wounded Dorsey, who managed to escape with House. House and Dorsey were captured two weeks later, and brought to the Las Vegas jail to await trial. An angry mob broke into the jail, pulled House, Dorsey and West from their cell, and lynched them. The gunfight was the first substantiated account to which Mather's name could be attached, and it launched him into western fame as a gunman.

It was last stationed at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. On 2 May 2014, the 7th Fighter Squadron was inactivated. Overview History World War II The 7th Fighter Squadron origins date to 16 January 1941, when it was activated as Selfridge Field, Michigan as the 7th Pursuit Squadron. It was equipped with Seversky P-35s that were transferred from the 1st Pursuit Group that left Selfridge for Rockwell Field, California. In May 1941, the squadron proceeded to Morrison Field, West Palm Beach, Florida, to train in the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter.Pascalis & Ferguson After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, training was greatly accelerated to prepare the squadron for combat duty. By 16 February 1942, the 7th found itself at Bankstown Airfield, Sydney, Australia, as one of the first American aviation units in the Southwest Pacific, flying the Warhawk. The squadron's first combat action with the Japanese happened on 14 March over Horn Island, Queensland off the Cape York Peninsula, Australia, with the 7th downing 5 Japanese A6M Zeroes, taking no losses themselves. Until September 1942, the 7th would remain in Australia, engaged primarily in air defense. The 7th moved to join the other 2 squadrons of the 49th Pursuit Group, in the defense of Darwin, Northern Territory, in April 1942. 7th Fighter Squadron P-40E in Australia, March 1942 It then moved North to Schwimmer Airfield, Port Moresby, New Guinea, where its P-40s flew attack and air defense missions against Japanese fortifications. During this period, the squadron, known as the \\"Screamin' Demons,\\" adopted their mascot and emblem, the Bunyap, an Australian aboriginal death demon. Even to this day, the Bunyap remains the squadron emblem. During World War II, the 7th had 10 of its members earn ace status, as each of them destroyed 5 or more enemy aircraft in aerial combat. The squadron continued to function effectively during WW II scoring 36 \\"Kills\\" in December 1944. By the end of the war, the Screamin' Demons had achieved 178 \\"Kills.\\" The squadron participated in the Allied offensive that pushed the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track, took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943, fought for control of the approaches to Huon Gulf, and supported ground forces during the campaign in which the Allies eventually recovered New Guinea. It covered the landings on Noemfoor and had a part in. the conquest of Biak. After having used Lockheed P-38 Lightnings, P-40 Warhawks and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, the squadron was equipped completely in September 1944 with P-38's, which were used to fly long-range escort and attack missions to Mindanao, Halmahera, Seram, and Borneo. The unit arrived in the Philippines in October 1944, shortly after the assault landings on Leyte and engaged enemy fighters, attacked shipping in Ormoc Bay, supported ground forces, and covered the Allied invasion of Luzon. For or intensive operations against the Japanese on Leyte, the group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. Other missions from the Philippines included strikes against industry and transportation on Taiwan and against shipping along the China coast. The end of the war in August 1945 found the 7th Fighter Squadron on Okinawa, preparing for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, in November. 7th Fighter-Bomber Squadron F-80C taking off from Itazuke ABAircraft is Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star, serial 49-526, on 14 August 1950. After VJ Day, the squadron moved to the Japanese Home Islands, initially at the former Imperial Japanese Navy Atsugi Airfield, near Tokyo on 15 September 1945. Its war-weary P-38 Lightnings were sent back to the United States and the squadron was re- equipped with North American P-51D Mustangs with a mission of both occupation duty and show of force flights. In February 1946, the squadron was moved to Chitose Air Base, on northern Honshu and assumed an air defense mission over Honshu and also Hokkaido Island. The pilots of the squadron were briefed not to allow any Soviet Air Force aircraft over Japanese airspace, as there was tension between the United States and the Soviet Union about Soviet occupation forces landing on Hokkaido. In April 1948, the squadron moved to the newly- rebuilt Misawa Air Base when the host 49th Fighter Group took up home station responsibilities. At Misawa, the squadron moved into the jet age when it was re-equipped with the Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star. Korean War With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 7th was one of the first USAF squadrons dispatched to Korea from Japan, initially operating propeller-driven F-51Ds to cover the evacuation of civilians from Kimpo and Suwon. Next, it flew close air support missions to help slow the advancing North Korean armies. Later, it turned to the interdiction of enemy troops, supplies and communications from Misawa. However its short-range F-80Cs meant that the 49th had to move to South Korea in order for them to be effective. 7th Fighter- Bomber Squadron F-84G ThunderjetAircraft is Republic F-84G Thunderjet, serial 51-10538 \\"Damn Yankee\\" at Pohangdong AB (K-3), South Korea, equipped with wing pylon fuel tanks and JATO bottles. The squadron moved to Taegu Air Base (K-2) on 1 October 1950, becoming the first jet fighter outfit to operate from a base in South Korea. During the autumn of 1950 and spring of 1951, the squadron flew combat missions on a daily basis from Tageu, flying escort missions for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses over North Korea and engaging Communist Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters in air-to-air combat. When the Chinese Communist Forces Intervention Campaign gained momentum in 1950‚Äì1951, the squadron again concentrated on the ground support mission, attacking Communist Chinese ground units in North Korea, moving south until the line was stabilized and held just south of Seoul. The 49th changed equipment to the Republic F-84G Thunderjet in mid-1951, It engaged Communist forces on the ground in support of the 1st UN Counteroffensive Campaign (1951). Afterwards, it engaged primarily in air interdiction operations against the main enemy channel of transportation, the roads and railroads between Pyongyang and Sinuiju. Also, it flew close air support missions for the ground forces and attacked high-value targets, including the Sui-ho hydroelectric plants in June 1952 and the Kumgang Political School in October 1952. On 27 July 1953, the squadron joined with the 58th Fighter-Bomber Group to bomb Sunan Airfield for the final action of F-84 fighter-bombers during the Korean War. The wing remained in Korea for a time after the armistice. It moved to Japan in November 1953 and returned to its air defense mission. The squadron upgraded to the North American F-86F Sabre in 1956. By late 1957, however, Worldwide DOD Budget restrictions during FY 1958 meant that the fighter wing atChitose would be eliminated as part of a reduction of the USAF units based in Japan. United States Air Forces in Europe Due to its seniority, the 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing was not inactivated with Chitose's closure, but replaced the 388th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Etain-Rouvres Air Base, France on 10 December 1957 in a name-only transfer. The 7th assumed the aircraft, personnel and equipment of the 561st Fighter-Bomber Squadron which was inactivated. As the 49th had been a part of American forces in the Pacific since it was sent to Australia in January 1942, the assignment to Europe after fifteen years in the Pacific was a major change for the organization. F-100D Super Sabre 56-3290, 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Etain-Rouvres Air Base, 1958 Republic F-105D, 49th Tactical Fighter Wing Taking over the seven North American F-100D Super Sabres and three dual-seat F-100F trainers of the 561st, the squadron continued its normal peacetime training. The squadron began keeping four of its planes on 15-minute alert (Victor Alert) on 1 February 1958 so a portion of the squadron could react quickly in an emergency. During the fall of 1958, most of the squadron operated from Chalon-Vatry Air Base while the runway at Etain was being repaired and resurfaced. However, the nuclear-capable F-100 was troublesome to the host French Government, the French decreed that all United States nuclear weapons and delivery aircraft had to be removed from French soil by July 1958. As a result, the F-100s of the 49th Wing had to be removed from France. After negotiations with the French, the 49th's Wing commander was informed that the wing would be departing from France on 1 July 1959 and be moved to Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany. During the relocation to West Germany, the squadron deployed to Wheelus Air Base, Libya, for gunnery training. However, not all squadron personnel moved to Spangdahlem, as many of the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing personnel there were almost at the end of their tours and did not want to move to RAF Alconbury, where the 10th was being relocated to in order to accommodate the 49th. As a result, some squadron ground support personnel instead moved to RAF Lakenheath, England to backfill vacancies there, while the 10th Wing personnel at Spandahlem were allowed to finish out their assignments. At Spangdahlem, the squadron flew F-100s until 1961 when it converted to the Republic F-105 Thunderchief, commonly known as the \\"Thud\\". The 49th Wing was only the third USAF unit to operate the F-105. As part of United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE), the 7th participated in many NATO exercises. In February 1967, the 7th opened the 49th weapons training detachment at Wheelus Air Base to begin transition to the McDonnell F-4D Phantom II, and received its first F-4D on 9 March 1967. In the late 1960s, the defense budget began to be squeezed by the costs of the ongoing Vietnam War. Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara decided to reduce costs in Europe by \\"Dual Basing\\" United States military units in Europe by returning them permanently to the United States, and conducting annual deployment exercises in Europe, giving the units a NATO commitment for deployment to bases in Europe if tensions with the Soviet Union warranted an immediate military buildup. The 49th Tactical Fighter Wing returned to the United States under this policy, moving on 1 July 1968 to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, to serve as the US Air Force's first dual-based, NATO- committed wing. Holloman Air Force Base At Holloman, the squadron participated in Tactical Air Command (TAC) tactical exercises and firepower demonstrations to maintain combat readiness. Also, the first \\"Tail Codes\\" to identify squadron aircraft were applied, rather than the traditional blue color of the 7th which had been used since the Korean War. Initially \\"HB\\" was the tail code identifier for the 7th, however, in 1972, Air Force Manual 66-1 specified wing tail codes and the squadron's planes were standardized on the 49th's \\"HO\\" tail code. However, a blue tail stripe was applied to identify squadron aircraft.Martin, 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-4D Phantom at Spangdahlem AB during an annual \\"Crested Cap\\" deploymentAircraft is McDonnell F-4D-29-MC Phantom II, serial 65-792, in September 1970. 7th Squadron F-4D Phantom after the changeover to the \\"HO\\" tail code in 1975Aircraft is McDonnell F-4D-31-MC Phantom II, serial 66-7745. The 7th also retained its NATO commitment to return once a year to its \\"dual base\\" home in West Germany. These deployments were known as \\"Crested Cap\\", and were as follows: * F-4 deployments: :: Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany, 12 September-7 October 1970; Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, 9 September-6 October 1971; Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, 2 March-2 April 1973; 2 April-3 May 1974; 2 October-6 November 1975; Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, 24 August-25 September 1976 * CFB Lahr, West Germany, 24 August-16 September 1981 (F-15A) * F-15 deployments: :: Canadian Forces Base Lahr, West Germany, 26 August-25 September 1983; Gilze-Rijen Air Base, Netherlands, 27 May-24 June 1986, 12 June-9 July 1990 With the end of the Cold War and subsequent force drawdowns by USAFE, these annual exercises ended in 1991. =Operation Constant Guard III= On 4 May 1972, after North Vietnam invaded South Vietnam, the entire wing, except for a rear echelon that remained to run Holloman, deployed at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. Operation Constant Guard III, ordered in response to the North Vietnamese invasion, was the largest movement that TAC had ever performed. In nine days, the squadron deployed its F-4D Phantom IIs from Holloman to Takhli. Airmen arriving reported that Takhli was a mess, with missing or broken plumbing fixtures, no hot water, and no drinking water ‚Äì that had to be trucked in from Korat every day. Bed frames had been thrown out of the hootches into the high snake-infested grass, and mattresses or bedding consisted of sleeping bags at best. The 7th flew combat sorties in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos from 1 July to 24 September 1972 during Operation Linebacker, the bombardment campaign in North Vietnam. During this deployment, the squadron flew over just about every battle zone from An Loc to vital installations in the Hanoi vicinity. During five months of combat, the squadron did not lose any aircraft or personnel. The unit closed out its Southwest Asia duty 6 October 1972. =F-15A Eagle era= In October 1977, the 49th Wing ended its \\"dual-base\\" commitment to NATO and changed to an air superiority mission with the wing beginning a conversion from the F-4D Phantom II to the McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle; the 49th being the second USAF operational wing to receive the F-15A. The transition was completed 4 June 1978. 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-15A, about 1980Aircraft is McDonnell Douglas F-15A-19-MC Eagle, serial 77-100. Due to the change in equipment, the annual NATO deployments were taken over by the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina in 1978. However, they resumed (although not on an annual basis) in 1981. In the United States, training missions were refocused on dissimilar air combat tactics for multi-theater operations, participating in numerous Red Flag Exercises, joint training exercises, and deployments in the air defense/superiority mission. Frequent deployments were made to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada to exercise with the Northrop F-5E Tiger II \\"Aggressor\\" aircraft of the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, and other aircraft types (including clandestine exercises with Soviet aircraft flown by the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron at Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada). Also, after TAC absorbed the interceptor mission of Aerospace Defense Command in 1979, the squadron maintained the TAC NORAD air defense alert commitment in the Eagle, with the best scramble times in NORAD. On 12 October 1989, the squadron was called into action once again. Several F-15A aircraft deployed to Howard Air Force Base, Panama in support of Operation Just Cause. The purpose of this deployment was to support President George H.W. Bush's national drug control strategy. During this operation, General Manuel Noriega surrendered and was transported back to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida where he was arraigned on federal drug trafficking charges. No combat sorties however, were flown in support of the removal of Noriega and the squadron returned to Holloman by the end of October. With the introduction of the F-15C Eagle in the mid-1980s, the upgraded Eagle began replacing the F-15A/Bs in service with all of the USAF units that had previously been operating the Eagle with the exception of the 49th Wing. By the time of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the F-15A Eagles at Holloman had been relegated to a training role; combat deployments of the Eagle were the purview of F-15C units. =F-117 Nighthawk era= 7th Fighter Squadron F-117A crew chiefs prepare an aircraft for flight at Holloman AFB In 1992, the 49th Wing underwent a number of transitions. As a result of the end of the Cold War, reduced defense budgets were the order of the day. As a result, the 7th Fighter Squadron retired its F-15A Eagles and received the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighters and personnel of the 37th Fighter Wing's 415th Fighter Squadron, which was inactivated. After conversion to the F-117A in May 1992, The 7th deployed fighters and their crews to Southwest Asia during the 1990s as part of Operation Southern Watch to support United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq, to enforce the no-fly zone over the southern part of that country to deprive Saddam Hussein of his Weapons of Mass Destruction programs and to force his compliance with the UN monitoring regime. 7th F-117s fighters deployed to the Gulf in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox to upgrade the strike force's capability to attack high-value targets. But the 18-hour flight from Holloman AFB to Kuwait meant that the operation was over before the F-117 aircraft arrived in the Gulf. In June 1999 the 7th took over the pilot transition training mission to the F-117A and the Northrop AT-38 Talon trainers, being redesignated as the 7th Combat Training Squadron. The 7th became the mainstay of developing combat capability for the F-117, with its T-38s providing both transition training as well as dissimilar air combat training as \\"aggressors\\" against the Nighthawk. The training mission with the stealth fighters continued until 2005 when it was announced by the Air Force that the Nighthawk would be retired in favor of the Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor stealth superiority fighter. The 7th was inactivated on 15 December 2006 after 65 continuous years of active duty. =F-22A Raptor era= First 7th Fighter Squadron F-22A Raptor arriving at Holloman AFB on 2 June 2008 The inactivation of the 7th, however, was brief as it was reactivated on 15 May 2008 as the 7th Fighter Squadron, and equipped with the Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor. The 7th was the first of two F-22 squadrons to be activated at Holloman. The squadron was equipped with 18 F-22s transferred from the 3d Wing at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, the last aircraft being received in late 2009. After its reactivation, the 7th Fighter Squadron deployed frequently to overseas locations in support of United States objectives. The 7th Fighter Squadron, better known as the \\"Screamin' Demons\\", maintained combat readiness to deploy worldwide in accordance with Secretary of Defense taskings. Operating the F-22A Raptor, the squadron provided air dominance in the world's most dangerous threat arenas. In 2012, it was announced that the 7th Fighter Squadron was to move its support personnel and aircraft to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, in the spring of 2013 to comply with the Air Force's F-22 fleet consolidation plan. In return, the squadron was to receive General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona as part of a training restructuring plan to move the F-16 Training School from Luke to Holloman. Luke AFB is scheduled to begin the Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II training mission in October 2005.

These moves were reviewed and in April 2014 the last of the F-22s were sent to Tyndall. The squadron was inactivated a month later, on 2 May.

It is based on a novel by Horia PƒÉtra≈ücu, which in turn reflects real-life events witnessed by the author. Produced under the communist regime, which it indirectly criticizes, it is a tragicomedy about incompetence, indifference and misuse of power. Structured as a film within a film and largely shot as a mockumentary, The Reenactment stars George Constantin as a prosecutor who keeps in custody two minor delinquents, VuicƒÉ and Nicu, played respectively by George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ and Vladimir GƒÉitan. He makes them reenact their drunken brawl at a restaurant, and is helped in this effort by the militiaman Dumitrescu (played by Ernest Maftei) and a film crew. Two bystanders watch upon the youngsters' degradation at the hands of the prosecutor. They are The Miss (Domni≈üoara in the original), played by Ileana Popovici, who is amused by the succession of events, and the pedantic alcoholic Paveliu (Emil Botta). The recipient of much critical acclaim and considered in retrospect one of the most notable contributions to Romanian cinema, The Reenactment was released at a time when the communist regime was in its liberalization phase, coinciding with the first decade of rule by Nicolae Ceau≈üescu. Nevertheless, its political implications irritated communist officials, and the censorship apparatus decided to withdraw the film from cinemas only months after its premiere. In 1969, Pintilie was pressured to work outside Romania, and focused mainly on stage production for the following twenty years of his career. The Reenactment was again screened at home in 1990, one year after the Romanian Revolution toppled communism. Production and plot Both Horia PƒÉtra≈ücu's novel and the screenplay (co-authored by PƒÉtra≈ücu and Pintilie) are closely based on real- life events. The incident was witnessed by PƒÉtra≈ücu during the early 1960s, and took place in his native town of Caransebe≈ü, shortly before a celebration of August 23 (Communist Romania's national holiday, commemorating the 1944 coup). \\"Horia PƒÉtra≈ücu: '√én Reconstituirea am dat tot ce am putut ca prozator' \\", in Informa≈£ia Cluj, Nr. 37/1999Romanian Cinema on the Edge. The Films, at the University of Pittsburgh site; retrieved May 28, 2008 The militiamen involved had detained two youths with no prior criminal record, accusing them of having been drunk and disorderly, and had decided to make them reenact the scene in order to educate the public about the perils of alcohol. In a 1999 interview, PƒÉtra≈ücu acknowledges that, as a university student and part-time activist at a local culture house, he was a member of the original crew. Like in the film, the militiamen's decision seems to have outweighed the punishment proscribed for such offences: they made the youths film the same scene over and over, and, in the process, exposed them to public humiliation. PƒÉtra≈ücu, who credits German writer Erich Maria Remarque and his All Quiet on the Western Front with having inspired his narrative, states: \\"At the actual, filmed reenactment I for one had a terrible shock. They were children, they were just children. The police made them do what they had previously done. But that was a beach, a pool, there were girlies wearing bathing suits, some of them were connected with those girlies, and the [militiamen] were making them do what they had done when they were drunk, which was absurd, which made me shiver.\\" In both story and film, VuicƒÉ dies after his friend, pressured by the authorities into making the reenactment look more authentic, hits him over the head with a stone.Ciprian Cirniala, \\"Filme cu ≈üi despre mili≈£ieni R.S.R.\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 2008 There was a significant gap between the story's publishing and the start of production. Filmmaker Mircea SƒÉucan recalls repeatedly urging PƒÉtra≈ücu to turn his text into a screenplay.Iulia Blaga, Fantasme ≈üi adevƒÉruri. O carte cu Mircea SƒÉucan, Editura LiterNet, Bucharest, 2007, p.51. Before Pintilie took up the project, Horia PƒÉtra≈ücu says, he was approached by two other directors. The first was Radu Gabrea, who abandoned it once he decided to resettle in West Germany; the second was Liviu Ciulei, who disagreed with the writer over the plot's tragic outcome, and eventually ended talks. Also according to PƒÉtra≈ücu, Pintilie was enthusiastic about making the film, and anxiously approached the author just as he was taking his final exams. George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ, Vladimir GƒÉitan and Ileana Popovici were debuting actors in their early twenties. As MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ recalls, he and GƒÉitan were cast after a brief interview with Pintilie. Silvia Kerim, \\"Galeria vedetelor\\" (interview with George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ), in Formula As, Nr. 332, October 2008 Poet and actor Emil Botta was fifty-seven at the time, while George Constantin was thirty-five and Ernest Maftei forty-eight. Despite the marked age difference, MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ remembers, the communication on the set was smooth and the atmosphere playful. The film was shot on location in the Southern Carpathian resort of Sinaia, but preserves some elements from the intended setting, including the restaurant's name of PescƒÉru≈ü (\\"Seagull\\"), which had been borrowed from its Caransebe≈ü model. Themes In addition to its factual content, The Reenactment stands as a metaphor for the people's inability to control their own destinies under the grip of a totalitarian regime, and, through its cultural implications, is also seen as a retrospective condemnation of Socialist realism and its didacticism (see Socialist realism in Romania). To a certain degree, Pintilie's film also criticizes the indifference with which such persecution is received by the public. A recurring motif in the film is the background noise of crowds rooting for their squad during a soccer match, in what the director explains is a satirical allusion to the Greek choir's role in cheering the performers, in this case transfigured by \\"human dumbness\\". Silvana Silvestri, \\"Noile hƒÉr≈£i ale infernului\\" (interview with Lucian Pintilie) , in Revista 22, Nr. 753, August 2004 In 2004, Lucian Pintilie wrote that his decision to shoot the film was also motivated by his disgust in respect to the invasive practices of communist authorities, having previously been informed that one of his friends, a closeted gay actor, was denounced for breaking Romania's sodomy law, and, in order to avoid the prison sentence, was forced to have intercourse with his wife while investigators watched. Pintilie also stated his objection to the very notion of an inquiry, noting that such a procedure \\"is the most effective way of veiling reality\\", and indicated that the film was in part an allusion to the tradition of torture and repeated interrogation, enforced by the Securitate secret police in the previous decade. George Constantin's character was thus supposed to be a Securitate officer, but, Pintilie claims, the institution was scandalized by the possibility of an exploration into its past, and appealed to Nicolae Ceau≈üescu personally to prevent this from happening; as a consequence, Pintilie turned the protagonist into a prosecutor. Although the reference to Militia practices was the result of such pressures, it became one of the most valued attributes of the film. The portrayal of militiamen as brutal and irresponsible contrasted with their sympathetic portrayal in films approved of by the Ceau≈üescu regime, and especially with the post-1970 series Brigada Diverse. In a 2007 article for G√¢ndul, journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu writes that, by exposing the torment which could be caused even by routine Militia interventions, The Reenactment \\"had discarded the urban legend of 'militiamen so stupid that they make one laugh with tears when seeing how stupid they are'.\\" \\"Harshness\\" was identified by Mircea SƒÉucan as a main characteristic of the film. Stressing that he does not find this trait to be a defect, he states that, had he directed the film, he would have insisted more on the \\"cold\\" aspect of the inquiry, to stand in contrast with the melodrama-like aspect of some scenes. Commenting on such traits, Cristian Tudor Popescu wrote: \\"37 years ago, a prosecutor and two militiamen were organizing, on the terrace of an isolated pub, the reenactment of a brawl between two guys. Under the eye of Lucian Pintilie, the tremendous actor George Constantin, together with George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ, Vladimir GƒÉitan and Ernest Maftei, were reconstructing [...], starting from a beer mug crashing into a head, the whole monstrous skeleton of the kitschy evil on which Romanian communist authorities were relying.\\" Cristian Tudor Popescu, \\"Simulan≈£i\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 174, June 2007 (originally published in G√¢ndul, June 5, 2007) In 1965, Pintilie had directed the film DuminicƒÉ la ora ≈üase, which dealt in part with similar themes, but, as the director indicates, only hinted in that direction. It was showcased and acclaimed at the Pesaro Film Festival in Italy. He recalls: \\"The film's prologue clearly placed the plot in the years of [Romanian] socialism. [...] Who are the youths from the film's prologue? I was asked directly by the audience [...] Aren't today's youths these youths in the film? No, I shamelessly lied, for there was clearly a possibility for prevarication, no, I said in order to be able to return to Romania and make The Reenactment.\\" George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ recounts not realizing at first the importance of his role: \\"The best proof of [our] sublime unawareness was that, when shooting was over, I asked Pintilie‚Äîjoking more or less‚Äîwhen he was going to give me a more important part to play... He smiled and said just this: 'Wait and see the movie!' \\" Impact and legacy Censorship The Reenactment 's release coincided with the peak of liberalization policies in Romania, and with a moment when Ceau≈üescu appeared to be pursuing an independent path within the Eastern Bloc. However, the film caused consternation among communist officials. PƒÉtra≈ücu recalls that the film was only shown sporadically as the censorship apparatus was deciding its fate: it premiered at the LuceafƒÉrul Cinema in Bucharest, where \\"the projectionist was driven out of his mind\\" because it ran as the main feature for two months on end. MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ recalls: \\"the film's presentation was stripped of all ceremony. Better put, the film was introduced through 'the back door' at LuceafƒÉrul... It stood there, without any comments, for about a month, before being withdrawn as discreetly as it had appeared.\\" The Reenactment was also shown in Timi»ôoara, but, PƒÉtra≈ücu indicates, no program or promotional material given approval for publishing; it was only shown with discretion in several other main cities, \\"until people had heard about it\\", then withdrawn. The writer also remembers being \\"glad\\" upon learning that the film managed to raise public awareness, and that it incited viewers to engage in rioting against Militia forces. Early in 1969, the authorities took the decision to withdraw the film from cinemas, a ban which lasted until the regime came to an end two decades later.Marina Kaceanov, \\"On the New Romanian Cinema\\", in P.O.V. Filmtidsskrift, Nr. 25, March 2008, Section 3 Doinel Tronaru, \\" 'De ce trag clopotele, MiticƒÉ?' - De fr√Ænghie, mon≈üer!\\" , at Editura LiterNet (originally published in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, March 2, 2002); retrieved May 28, 2008 According to George MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ: \\"It's worth knowing that, upon viewing, some comrade [that is, communist official]‚Äîit no longer matters what his name was!‚Äîsaid 'this film ought to be stored in a room and someone should swallow the key'...!\\" It was as a result of the scandal that communist officials began investigating Romanian cinema in general, and intervened to stop filming on Pragul albastru, which was based on a screenplay by Ion Dezideriu S√Ærbu, a former political prisoner who was undergoing rehabilitation. Daniel Cristea-Enache, \\"Reinser≈£ia √Æn literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\" (Part XXIV), at Editura LiterNet; retrieved May 28, 2008 Pintilie's Securitate file, made available for the public in the 2000s (decade), contains lengthy and minute reports on the film, and documents the negative reaction of official critics (quoted saying that the film is \\"mediocre\\" or \\"mean\\"), but also the appreciation from the part of more rebellious intellectuals. Emil Berdeli, \\"De ce te urmƒÉre≈üte Securitatea, MiticƒÉ? De fricƒÉ, mon≈üer\\" , in Gardianul, May 12, 2008 For instance, it describes how, moments after having seen the film in Bucharest, the avant-garde author and former communist Geo Bogza scribbled in the snow set on the director's car the words: \\"Long live Pintilie! The humble Geo Bogza.\\" In May 1970, the Cannes Film Festival offered to show The Reenactment during its Une Quinzaine des R√©alisateurs event. As Pintilie notes, the invitation was intercepted by the Securitate and never reached him. In a fragment of his 1970 diary, published in 2003, he reflected his frustration over this issue, comparing the censorship apparatus with the bureaucrats sarcastically depicted in the works of 19th century writer Nikolai Gogol: \\"the Gogolian clerks have decided to strike me out of Romanian cinema for good. For as long as I am alive, they have not won their bet.\\" Lucian Pintilie, \\"Niki Ardelean, colonel √Æn rezervƒÉ (Niki ≈üi Flo) un soi de synopsis\\", in Revista 22, Nr. 690, May‚ÄìJune 2003 The same year however, he was able to return to the Pesaro Film Festival, where he was celebrated with a retrospective and a special trophy. Pintilie confesses that the ceremony failed to impress him at the time, due to his feelings of dissatisfaction and his determination to continue filming in Romania. Lucian Pintilie, \\"A privi rƒÉul √Æn fa≈£ƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 753, August 2004 Such events were also organized in other cities, among them London and Bologna, but Pintilie refused to attend them. Another clash between Pintilie and the communist system occurred in 1972, when he satirized officials by staging a subversive version of Gogol's The Government Inspector, which was suspended soon after its premiere.Annette Insdorf, \\"A Romanian Director Tells a Tale of Ethnic Madness\\", in The New York Times, November 4, 1994 In an interview with The New York Times, he records a meeting he had with the censors: \\"I was told, 'If you want to continue working here, you have to change your conception of the world.' I answered, 'But I've just started formulating it. [...] All I can do is develop it.' \\" During the following period, Pintilie only worked sporadically in Romania and was pressured to seek employment abroad (notably, in the United States, where he served as artistic director for Minneapolis' Guthrie Theater and Washington, D. C.'s Arena Stage). His only other film released at home before 1989, the 1981 De ce trag clopotele, MiticƒÉ?, was loosely based on stories by Ion Luca Caragiale. Noted for subtly criticizing the Ceau≈üescu regime at a time when it had return to a hard-line stance (see July Theses), it was itself censored by the officials. Film critic Doinel Tronaru argues that both productions are equally accomplished. PƒÉtra≈ücu, dissatisfied by the new restrictive guidelines, avoided contributing screenplays, and instead focused on cultural activities with Adrian PƒÉunescu's Cenaclul FlacƒÉra, whose shows still maintained a degree of artistic independence. Recovery Pintilie made his comeback in Romania only after the Romanian Revolution, and served as head of the Ministry of Culture's Cinema Creation Studio. He resumed film directing and producing, with titles such as Balan≈£a, An Unforgettable Summer, Lumi√®re and Company, and the 1996 Too Late (nominated for Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival, the same year). Many of them revisit Romania's communist past, and, in his later production DupƒÉ-amiaza unui tor≈£ionar, he focuses on a more obvious treatment of the Securitate and its repression tactics. After being again made available for public viewing, The Reenactment again was the subject of critical interest. It was recovered together with similarly censored films by Radu Gabrea (Beyond the Sands) and Dan Pi≈£a (The Contest). It was likened to Mircea SƒÉucan's 1973 production 100 de lei, and, alongside Pintilie's other films, is credited with having inspired the post-Revolution \\"Romanian New Wave\\". Cristian Tudor Popescu also argued that the invasive techniques which stand at the center of the film have a continued presence in post-1989 Romanian society. He proposes that they are similar to a sensationalist trend in Romanian television, which sees stations competing for ratings by closely following cases of suicide and murder. At the Berlin International Film Festival 2002 edition, it was shown as part of a retrospective on 1960s cinema, alongside films such as Lindsay Anderson's if...., John Schlesinger's Billy Liar, Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence and Jean-Pierre Mocky's Solo.

The Reenactment was the only pre-1989 film to be aired alongside works by \\"New Wave\\" directors: Corneliu Porumboiu (12:08 East of Bucharest), Radu Muntean (The Paper Will Be Blue), Cristian Mungiu (Occident), Cristi Puiu (Stuff and Dough) and Cristian Nemescu (California Dreamin').

Executive producers were Michael Cuscuna and Stephen Reed. The project was the brainchild of White, who proposed transforming traditional jazz standards based on saxophone/piano arrangements with multiple synthesizers.

He was born in Rye, New York, in the midst of some of the most historic golf courses in the country, such as Bethpage State Park (his all-time favorite is the Black Course), Westchester Country Club, and Winged Foot. Sneaking onto some of the most renowned courses in the United States, Richard fell in love with the golden age architects and the impressions they left on the land. Architects such as A. W. Tillinghast, Donald Ross, Charles B. McDonald, and Seth Raynor inspired him through books, drawings and the courses they designed (which he was fortunate enough to play on occasion). After receiving his Bachelor of Landscape Architecture degree from the University of Georgia, Richard went to work for golf course architect Dan Maples in Pinehurst, North Carolina in 1990. The Maples family was well rooted in the world of golf course architecture. Frank Maples (Dan‚Äôs grandfather) was the construction superintendent for Donald Ross on the first four courses at the famed Pinehurst Country Club and Dan‚Äôs father was a golf architect in his own right, apprenticing under Mr. Ross himself. After completing his time with Dan Maples, Richard moved on to work with Denis Griffiths, another well known architect based in Braselton, Georgia. Working under two of the industry‚Äôs most respected architects, both of whom were past Presidents of the American Society of Golf Course Architects, provided Richard with the technical skills required to start his own legacy. Whole In One Design Group, Inc. was founded in 1993 by Richard Mandell and three civil engineers from Easton, Maryland. By 1999, Richard bought out his partners and changed the firm name to Richard Mandell Golf Architecture. He based his firm in the village considered by many as the Home of American Golf: Pinehurst, North Carolina. For the past two decades, Richard has been involved with the design or redesign of over 35 courses throughout the world. Richard Mandell is also a noted golf historian and author. He recently published the book, Pinehurst ~ Home of American Golf (The Evolution of a Legend), a work that recounts the history and development of one of the most celebrated golf areas in the United States. He has also contributed chapters to Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective (both volumes 1 and 2) as well as Favourite Holes By Design (where he describes the fourth at Bethpage Black). Richard has penned numerous articles for magazines such as Links Magazine, Golf Illustrated, and Golf Course Architecture. Since 1997, Richard has taught a class on golf course architecture at North Carolina State University. Richard also writes a Golf Blog for The Washington Times called Golf Today: Players, Events and Fields, where he discusses everything from PGA Tournament venues to Golf in China.

Harris, also known professionally as R.H. Harris, (March 23, 1916 ‚Äì September 3, 2000) was a gospel artist and lead singer of the Soul Stirrers. He had a pure tenor three-octave voice that he utilized for moans and slurs and leaps into falsetto. He was instrumental in transforming the ensemble jubilee quartet style of the 30s into the lead-focused hard gospel style of the 40s and 50s. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 as a member of the Soul Stirrers; the group was also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000. He was the fountainhead of numerous gospel and soul singers, and direct model to Sam Cooke, who replaced him as lead singer of the Soul Stirrers. Early life Harris grew up on a farm 13 miles outside Trinity, Texas in the former \\"Blackland\\" settlement (named after the darkness of its soil, not the racial constitution of its residents). James and Katie Harris and their nine children (Rebert was their sixth) lived about 300 yards from the barbed wire fence of the Eastham Prison Camp, where convicts would toil in the fields and sing themselves back home with a mixture of spirituals and blues. Musical career Rebert says he started arranging his first gospel quartet, with his brother Almo and two cousins, before he even knew what the quartet style was. The group was called the Friendly Four and then the Friendly Gospel Singers when Harris moved to town to start seventh grade at the Trinity Colored High School. After tenth grade, which is as far as the school went, 15-year-old Harris attended Mary Allen College in nearby Crockett and weighed a tempting offer to join (Silas) Roy Crain's (aka \\"Senior\\" Crain or S.R. Crain) group the Soul Stirrers, who had moved to Houston. At the time the Soul Stirrers were a jubilee group, singing poppy, up-tempo numbers such as \\"Down By the Riverside\\". But as soon as Harris finally committed (Rebert says the year was 1931; gospel historians usually put the year at '35 or '36), he helped change the group's sound to a slower, deeper, more passionate hard gospel style. Harris claimed to have no musical influences besides ones he found in the trees and fields of his family's farm outside Trinity. In the late 1940s, Harris helped to create the National Quartet Convention to help \\"professionalize\\" the African-American gospel music community.

Kirkwood served on the Royal Research Ship Discovery II for six years before World War II, twice circumnavigating the Antarctic Continent (in Summer and Winter). He was with the rescue party which found Lincoln Ellsworth and Herbert Hollick-Kenyon when they crashed on a flight in Antarctica. He was Captain of HMNZS Endeavour (1956), an Antarctic Research support vessel, both as HMNZS Endeavour and when, as the John Biscoe, the ship belonged to the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Under the leadership of Edmund Hillary, Kirkwood landed the New Zealand section of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition along with the material needed to construct Scott Base.

The nickname seems to stem from an altercation with the crew on the voyage out from England, when most of the sledging ration boxes were badly damaged by seawater from the hold. When Captain Kirkwood was challenged about this he replied \\"What do you expect? They're only made of plywood!\\" From which point on, he was known as Our Captain Plywood On 17 March 1958, at the end of the Expedition, Kirkwood was waiting for Vivian Fuchs, Sir Edmund Hillary and the rest of the Expedition with the Endeavour to transport them back to Wellington. Fuch's team had travelled from Shackleton to Scott Base via the South Pole (a total journey of 2,158 miles in 99 days, or 98 days if it is remembered they crossed the date line at the Pole; against the original estimate of 100 days).

(SWD) was one of the largest mortgage banking, real estate and insurance firms in the Southeast of the United States. It was founded in 1884 as the Telfair Stockton Company and operated until 1983 when it was broken up by its new owner Phillips Petroleum Company. The assets were sold to First National Bank of Boston and Gate Petroleum. Prior to its breakup the company was headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida and was the developer of Ponte Vedra Beach in the early 1930s.Florida Times-Union: May 31, 2007-When Ponte Vedra was just a rural beach by Maggie Fitzroy At its height, SWD had a real estate portfolio worth $100 million and a mortgage loan servicing portfolio of $3.8 billion, providing services in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. History The company was founded as Stockton, Whatley in the late 19th century and the original partners were James R. Stockton Sr., Brown L. Whatley and Joseph W. Davin. The San Marco district of Jacksonville was developed by the Stockton Whatley Company in the 1920s.EU Jacksonville: April 5, 2007-Historically Ours San Marco It developed the Ponte Vedra Beach in the early 1930s. J.J. Daniel became president of SWD in 1960. He led development of the Deerwood section of Jacksonville, and the companion Deerwood Country Club, the most exclusive gated communities at the time and for many years thereafter. In 1964, SWD was purchased by the General American Oil Company.The Handbook of Texas online: GENERAL AMERICAN OIL COMPANY Don Davis was named General Manager of Deerwood Country Club in 1965, a position he held for over 20 years. In 1978, Davis was promoted to Operations Vice President of SWD, responsible for all Deerwood Club operations, including the sale of residences and home sites. William F.

When the bids were analyzed, Phillips saw that they would maximize their return by selling SWD's real estate and mortgages separately. First National Bank of Boston was not interested in the real estate, so their offer of $120 million for the mortgage banking business was accepted. New York Times: May 23, 1983-Boston Bank Acquisition Gate Petroleum bid $60 million for the real estate portfolio, which was less than the value of the assets, but they were the only entity that submitted an offer on just the real estate, so the properties were sold to Gate.Newboy: the Autobiography of Herbert Hill Peyton, Herbert Hill Peyton, , published by Gate Petroleum Co, January 1997 page 171 References External links Category:Mortgage lenders of the United States Category:Defunct financial services companies of the United States Category:Defunct companies based in Florida Category:Banks based in Jacksonville, Florida ","title":"Stockton, Whatley, Davin &amp; Co."},{"id":"17654981","text":"is a UK company law case concerning the fiduciary duties of directors, and in particular the doctrine concerning corporate opportunities. In the course of his appellate judgment, Lord Justice Sedley, sitting with Lord Justice Brooke and Lord Justice Jonathan Parker, cast doubt on the correctness of the contract law case, Bell v. Lever Bros Facts In Plus Group Ltd did not like one of its partners, John Pyke, and wanted him to resign. Pyke refused. The other directors tried to squeeze him out by excluding him from management and severing his salary. Without resigning his directorship, Pyke set up his own company and got a lucrative contract with a major In Plus customer. In Plus then sued him for breach of fiduciary duty, arguing that he had procured a corporate opportunity for himself, when he owed it to In Plus. Judgment The Court of Appeal, upholding the finding of the trial judge, held in favour of Pyke. Sedley LJ referred to a submission by Pyke's counsel that Bell v. Lever Bros precluded any liability for holding a directorship which competed with the company. Although unnecessary for the judgment, he questioned whether it could still be regarded as correct. In any case, Sedley LJ acknowledged that Pyke had poached a customer, but said that his... > ‚Äú...duty to the claimants had been reduced to vanishing point by the acts' > of his fellow director and shareholder‚Ä¶ For all the influence he had, he > might as well have resigned.‚Äù Brooke LJ quoted Lord Upjohn's dissenting judgment in Boardman v. Phipps that the circumstances of... > ‚Äú...each case must be carefully examined to see whether a fiduciary > relationship exists in relation to the matter of which complaint is made‚Äù. He stressed that Pyke had been effectively expelled from the company some six months prior to any of the events in question. Also, he was not allowed to withdraw the money he invested in the company and was being denied remuneration. Pyke had not used any company property for the opportunity, or any confidential information that came to him qua director. Jonathan Parker LJ concurred with Brooke LJ. The Court of Appeal was thus intent on achieving a just result for Pyke and, on the particular facts, his effective exclusion from the company eliminated his fiduciary duties. Of particular note is the fact-intensive approach taken by the court in exonerating the director from liability. This is especially so in the light of the anxiety expressed by Sedley LJ in emphasising that the trial judge's finding that the customer had made it known that it would not deal with the claimant was immaterial.19 It is noteworthy that the court opted for this route as a means of exonerating the defendant rather than exercising its discretion to relieve him from liability under s.727 of the Companies Act 1985 had it first chosen to apply the inexorable rule forbidding conflict transactions.

He was a cousin of Hakimullah Mehsud. Education Hussain studied at the Jamia Farooqia seminary for four years.  Operations  Hussain ran a training camp for suicide bombers in South Waziristan and had been active in violent acts against the Pakistani government. In May 2007 he directed a campaign of attacks in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The attacks included targeted killings of tribal elders and political agents, and attacks on police which resulted in many civilian deaths. The violent nature of the attacks almost led to a split with Baitullah Mehsud, who at the time was amir of the TTP. On 1 June 2007, Mehsud captured 17 of Hussain's men and threatened to kill them in retaliation for a particularly brutal attack upon the residence of Pir Amiruddin Shah, the Political Agent of Khyber Agency, which killed guests and family members and had been undertaken without Mehsud's consent. However, Hussain was still a commander of Taliban forces. Hussain was reported dead after his home was destroyed in January 2008, but in May 2008 appeared in front of Pakistani media to deny the reports.Roggio, Bill (2008-05-25). \\"Taliban commander Qari Hussain survived military operation in Waziristan\\". The Long War Journal. He was later reported killed in a 23 June 2009 airstrike at Makeen in South Waziristan, but then phoned reporters to prove he was alive. A few days after the airstrike, the Pakistan government announced a 10 million rupee reward for the killing or capture of Hussain, among other Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan commanders. On 2 November 2009 the reward was increased to 50 million rupees ($600,000) A report by the Press Trust of India cited sources affirming that Hussain was killed on 14 January 2010, in the American drone airstrike in North Waziristan that reportedly killed Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud; however, Hussain apparently spoke with local media by telephone to deny Mehsud's death. The News International later reported that \\"top Pakistani and US sources\\" confirmed Hussain's death in the same drone strike against Mehsud. However, he once again appeared in an interview, speaking with Rediff.com in March 2010, and again denying Mehsud's death. Hussain claimed responsibility for the 2010 Times Square car bomb attempt in an audiotape that was posted on the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan News Channel on the website YouTube. Authorities in Pakistan believe that Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistani-American who admitted to planting the Times Square car bomb, was introduced to Hussain via Mohammad Rehan, and subsequently received explosives training before he returned to the United States. On 15 October 2010, several reports came out indicating that Qari Hussain was killed in an American drone strike. Geo TV said that he and five Turks were killed on 2 October in the Dattakhel area. The Press Trust of India stated that he and three others were killed on 7 October outside of Miranshah in Jungle Khel. While Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq denied these reports were true, Qari Hussein never contacted media to confirm his survival. On 26 October, a senior Taliban operative as well as a counter terrorism expert contacted the Asia Times confirming that Mehsud was killed on 7 October in the sub-district of Khushali in Mirali. The TTP officially confirmed Mehsud's death in December 2013.

History  The album is one of several that resulted from the partnership between Roach and Brown after Roach invited Brown in New York City to join him in creating a band.Except where otherwise noted, section source: Brown and Roach together selected additional musicians to comprise the quintet from among the jazz musicians currently active in Hollywood. The band's early line-ups included Sonny Stitt, Teddy Edwards, Carl Perkins and George Bledsoe, but by the time the first of these sessions was recorded in August 1954, they had been replaced by the more long-term line-up of Clifford Brown, Harold Land and Richie Powell, the brother of jazz luminary Bud Powell. The band was prominent in the jazz scene; Land, brought in when predecessor Edwards declined to tour with the group, experienced an enormous increase in his reputation in the jazz world, while Land's successor (Sonny Rollins) would be springboarded by the visible position into superstardom..  Critical reception  The album was critically well received. The Blackwell Guide to Recorded Jazz ranks it as among the best of the short-lived quintet, which in its 2¬Ω years of existence \\"left behind a body of music that encapsulates all the best virtues of hard bop\\". \\"The numerous felicities of this tightly-knit working band\\", author Barry Dean Kernfeld wrote, \\"were seldom better displayed than in these dynamic performances\\".Kernfeld, 275. In its review, AllMusic describes it as \\"by far some of the warmest and most sincere bebop performed and committed to tape\\", indicating that \\"[i]t represents bop at its best and is recommended for collectors and casual fans alike\\".  Notable tracks  According to The Rough Guide to Jazz, two of the songs featured on this album, \\"Daahoud\\" and \\"Joy Spring\\", have become \\"part of the standard jazz repertoire\\". The song \\"Joy Spring\\" was composed by Brown in honor of his wife, whom he called his \\"joy spring\\".Spellman, A.B. and Murray Horwitz.

Portrait L√©once Vieljeux (12 April 1865, Les Vans, Ard√®che, France ‚Äì 12 September 1944, Struthof) was a colonel in the French reserve army, industrialist and mayor of La Rochelle. Life Gaining a diploma from the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1888, he was attached to the 123e r√©giment d‚Äôinfanterie at La Rochelle, where he married H√©l√®ne Delmas, daughter of the famous arms manufacturer from that town. He left the army to enter his father-in-law's family business \\"Delmas Fr√®res\\", becoming its president, changing its name to \\"Compagnie Delmas-Vieljeux\\", and making it one of France's most important shipping companies. Sitting on La Rochelle's municipal council from 1912 to 1925, he became its mayor in 1930. With the onset of the Second World War, L√©once Vieljeux began working to resist the town's Nazi occupiers. Thus, when on Sunday 23 June 1940 a German lieutenant presented himself to mayor Vieljeux with a request to hang a German swastika flag from La Rochelle's h√¥tel de ville, Vieljeux replied that he was a colonel (in the reserves) and had no orders to receive a junior officer, even if he was from a victorious army. This first act of resistance was followed by systematic opposition to the posting of Nazi propaganda posters. At the same time, he helped engineers and workers from his factory who belonged to the ALLIANCE Resistance network to find means of escape. On 22 September 1940, he was removed from his office of mayor and then (in 1941) expelled from the town. Later returning to La Rochelle, he was arrested at the start of 1944. Interned at Lafond before being transferred to Poitiers then Fresnes, he was finally sent to the camp at Schirmeck near Strasburg, where he remained from 1 May to 1 September 1944. On the night of 1/2 September 1944 he was taken to the camp at Struthof, where he was shot at the same time as 300 other men and 92 women, up to the age of 80. His funeral service took place in the Protestant church in La Rochelle in the presence of 3,000 townspeople of all denominations and social classes. A commemorative stamp with his face on was issued on 28 March 1960.

Foveated image with fixation point at Stephen F. Austin statue. Foveated imaging is a digital image processing technique in which the image resolution, or amount of detail, varies across the image according to one or more \\"fixation points\\". A fixation point indicates the highest resolution region of the image and corresponds to the center of the eye's retina, the fovea. The location of a fixation point may be specified in many ways. For example, when viewing an image on a computer monitor, one may specify a fixation using a pointing device, like a computer mouse. Eye trackers which precisely measure the eye's position and movement are also commonly used to determine fixation points in perception experiments.McConkie G W and Rayner K (1975) The span of the effective stimulus during a fixation in reading, Perception & Psychophysics, 17, 578‚Äì86Loschky, L.C. & Wolverton, G.S. (2007). How Late Can You Update Gaze-contingent Multi-resolutional Displays Without Detection? ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications, 3(4):25, 1-10. When the display is manipulated with the use of an eye tracker, this is known as a gaze contingent display.Duchowski, A. T., Cournia, N., and Murphy, H. 2004. Gaze-Contingent displays: A review. Cyberpsychol. Behav. 7, 6, 621--634. Fixations may also be determined automatically using computer algorithms.Z. Wang, L. Lu and A. C.

A new foveated space-variant camera for robotic applications. In IEEE, International Conference on Electronics Circuits And Systems, ICECS'96, Rodos, Greece, October 1996. and image compression.Geisler, W.S. and Perry, J.S. (1998) A real-time foveated multi-resolution system for low-bandwidth video communication. In B. Rogowitz and T. Pappas (Eds.), Human Vision and Electronic Imaging, SPIE Proceedings, 3299, 294-305. For descriptions of these and other applications, see the list below. Foveated imaging is also commonly referred to as space variant imaging or gaze contingent imaging. Applications Foveated imaging for progressive transmission Compression Contrast sensitivity falls off dramatically as one moves from the center of the retina to the periphery.Wandell, Brian A. (1995) Foundations of Vision. . p.236Barghout-Stein, Lauren. On differences between peripheral and foveal pattern masking. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 1999. In lossy image compression, one may take advantage of this fact in order to compactly encode images. If one knows the viewer's approximate point of gaze, one may reduce the amount of information contained in the image as the distance from the point of gaze increases. Because the fall-off in the eye's resolution is dramatic, the potential reduction in display information can be substantial. Also, foveation encoding may be applied to the image before other types of image compression are applied and therefore can result in a multiplicative reduction. Foveated sensors Foveated sensors are multiresolution hardware devices that allow image data to be collected with higher resolution concentrated at a fixation point. An advantage to using foveated sensor hardware is that the image collection and encoding can occur much faster than in a system that post-processes a high resolution image in software.Marc Bolduc, Martin D. Levine. A real-time foveated sensor with overlapping receptive fields. June 1997, Real-Time Imaging, Volume 3 Issue 3 Simulation Foveated imaging has been used to simulate visual fields with arbitrary spatial resolution. For example, one may present video containing a blurred region representing a scotoma. By using an eye-tracker and holding the blurred region fixed relative to the viewer's gaze, the viewer will have a visual experience similar to that of a person with an actual scotoma. The figure on the right shows a frame from a simulation of a glaucoma patient with the eye fixated on the word \\"similar.\\" Video gaming Foveated rendering is an upcoming video game technique which uses an eye tracker integrated with a virtual reality headset to reduce the rendering workload by greatly reducing the image quality in the peripheral vision (outside of the zone gazed by the fovea). At the CES 2016, SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) demoed a new 250 Hz eye tracking system and a working foveated rendering solution. It resulted from a partnership with camera sensor manufacturer Omnivision who provided the camera hardware for the new system. Quality assessment Foveated imaging may be useful in providing a subjective image quality measure.Z. Wang, A. C. Bovik, L. Lu and J. Kouloheris, \\"Foveated wavelet image quality index,\\" SPIE's 46th Annual Meeting, Proc. SPIE, Application of digital image processing XXIV, vol. 4472, July-Aug. 2001. Traditional image quality measures, such as peak signal-to- noise ratio, are typically performed on fixed resolution images and do not take into account some aspects of the human visual system, like the change in spatial resolution across the retina. A foveated quality index may therefore more accurately determine image quality as perceived by humans. Image database retrieval In databases that contain very high resolution images, such as a satellite image database, it may be desirable to interactively retrieve images in order to reduce retrieval time. Foveated imaging allows one to scan low resolution images and retrieve only high resolution portions as they are needed. This is sometimes called progressive transmission.

One of the many Sea Dogs who plagued the Spanish Empire during the Elizabethan age, Geare was well-known to the Spaniards of the West Indies and the Spanish Main as commander of the Little John. He remained one of the most active in the region throughout the 1590s and up until his retirement in 1603. Biography Michael Geare was born in Limehouse around 1565, reportedly from a poor cockney background. An apprentice mariner in his youth,Fury, Cheryl A. Tides in the Affairs of Men: The Social History of Elizabethan Seamen, 1580‚Äì1603. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. (pg. 12‚Äì13) Geare embarked on his earliest voyages with Sir George Carew (also known as George Carey) and later Captain John Watts with whom he would first rise to prominence between 1588 and 1591. That same year he took part in the successful Blockade of Western Cuba expedition as captain of the Little John, one of five-ship flotilla under William Lane and financed by Sir Frances Drake among others. Lane gave glowing accounts of Geare's bravery in battle and with whom he began to earn a small fortune from privateering and smuggling activities. Lane eventually began personally financing the Little John which was later renamed the Michael & John when he became a partner with Geare in 1592. During the next three years, Geare would complete four successful voyages in the West Indies with the Michael & John. In 1595, an encounter with a Spanish galleon near Havana, Cuba resulted in the loss of fifty of his crew and a Spanish pinnace he had previously captured. After making his escape, Geare was able to recoup his losses by capturing another Spanish prize before returning to England. Commanding the Neptune the following year, he was accompanied to the Caribbean by a pinnace sailed by John Rilesden and Christopher Newport. He and fifteen men stole the pinnace later that year and captured several prizes before arriving in Jamaica to join a privateering expedition to Honduras led by Sir Anthony Shirley and Captain William Parker. After a failed raid against Trujillo, they turned towards Puerto Caballos and successfully captured the city. Finding little of value however, Geare decided to part company with Shirey and Parker who continued overland across the mountains of Guatemala and to the Pacific coast. In May 1601, while in the West Indies with David Middleton with the pinnace James, he captured three ships while in command of the Archangel. Although he managed to bring back two of the captured ships, he lost contact with the third. Its crew eventually sailed to Morocco where it was sold there instead. Participating in a three- ship consort with Captain Christopher Newton the following year, he captured two Spanish warships among several others. On 24 January 1603 Geare and Christopher Newport participated in a joint Anglo-French operation when they directed eight ships during the landing of armed privateers near Santiago, Cuba. Their advance was halted by the Spanish Governor Fernando Melgarejo de Cordoba, both by a single artillery piece and stampeding a herd of cattle towards the raiders, and they were eventually forced to flee.Marley, David F. Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2005. (pg. 150) Soon after he and Christopher Newport then attacked Puerto Caballos again after they heard that two Spanish galleons were unloading their goods, in a bold move the English and French captured them after a hard fight burning one and taking the other as a prize. The booty from this was considerable and after this last adventure, he decided to retire to Stepney, a suburb of London. His home, having a small dagger hung outside, gained some notoriety during his later years. Shortly after his return to England, he was bestowed a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth I. Upon his death, he left an annual allowance of five pounds to be shared among the families of those lost at sea and the indigent sailors of his native Limehouse.James, Lawrence.

The atoms are often within Van der Waals distance of each other and are about as strong as hydrogen bonds. The effect can be intramolecular or intermolecular. Intermolecular metallophilic interactions can lead to formation of supramolecular assemblies whose properties vary with the choice of element and oxidation states of the metal atoms and the attachment of various ligands to them.  Nature of the interaction  This type of interaction is enhanced by relativistic effects. A major contributor is electron correlation of the closed-shell components, which is unusual because closed-shell atoms generally have negligible interaction with one another at the distances observed for the metal atoms. As a trend, the effect becomes larger moving down a periodic table group, for example, from copper to silver to gold, in keeping with increased relativistic effects. Observations and theory find that, on average, 28% of the binding energy in gold‚Äìgold interactions can be attributed to relativistic expansion of the gold d orbitals. An important and exploitable property of aurophilic interactions relevant to their supramolecular chemistry is that while both inter- and intramolecular interactions are possible, intermolecular aurophilic linkages are comparatively weak and easily broken by solvation; most complexes that exhibit intramolecular aurophilic interactions retain such moieties in solution. One way of probing the strength of particular intermolecular metallophilic interactions is to use a competing solvent and examine how it interferes with supromolecular properties. For example, adding various solvents to gold(I) nanoparticles whose luminescence is attributed to Au‚ÄìAu interactions will have decreasing luminescence as the solvent disrupts the metallophilic interactions.  Applications  Gold(I) complexes can polymerize by intermolecular metallophilic interactions to form nanoparticles. The polymerization of metal atoms can lead to the formation of long chains or nucleated clusters. Gold nanoparticles formed from chains of gold(I) complexes often give rise to intense luminescence in the visible region of the spectrum. Chains of Pd(II)‚ÄìPd(I) and Pt(II)‚ÄìPd(I) complexes have been explored as potential molecular wires.

Engineered and constructed by the Chance Brothers and Company from Birmingham in 1879 and completed in 1880, the lighthouse was erected during British rule in Malacca as a beacon for ships travelling along the Strait of Malacca. While remaining in operation as of 2008, the building is now supplemented with a second, newer concrete tower that operates advanced equipment for shipping communications. Located on Undan Island, the lighthouse is located off the coast of Malacca, and is situated on the summit of the island. As a result, the lighthouse, like others in the country on small islands, is largely reachable solely by boat, its site and tower closed from the public. The original lighthouse consists of an octagonal cylindrical light tower housing the lantern and a gallery, and is adjoined to a single storey keeper's house; both structures were constructed of masonry. A more recent concrete communications tower, roughly three times the height of the original lighthouse, is cylindrical and stark in design, and situated directly beside the lighthouse.

One of these languages determines \\"canonical forms\\" for the elements of the semigroup, the other languages determine if two canonical forms represent elements that differ by multiplication by a generator. Formally, let S be a semigroup and A be a finite set of generators. Then an automatic structure for S with respect to A consists of a regular language L over A such that every element of S has at least one representative in L and such that for each a \\\\in A \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\varepsilon\\\\\\\\}, the relation consisting of pairs (u,v) with ua = v is regular, viewed as a subset of (A# √ó A#)*. Here A# is A augmented with a padding symbol.. The concept of an automatic semigroup was generalized from automatic groups by Campbell et al. (2001) Unlike automatic groups (see Epstein et al. 1992), a semigroup may have an automatic structure with respect to one generating set, but not with respect to another. However, if an automatic semigroup has an identity, then it has an automatic structure with respect to any generating set (Duncan et al. 1999). Decision problems Like automatic groups, automatic semigroups have word problem solvable in quadratic time. Kambites & Otto (2006) showed that it is undecidable whether an element of an automatic monoid possesses a right inverse. Cain (2006) proved that both cancellativity and left-cancellativity are undecidable for automatic semigroups. On the other hand, right- cancellativity is decidable for automatic semigroups (Silva & Steinberg 2004). Geometric characterization Automatic structures for groups have an elegant geometric characterization called the fellow traveller property (Epstein et al. 1992, ch. 2). Automatic structures for semigroups possess the fellow traveller property but are not in general characterized by it (Campbell et al. 2001). However, the characterization can be generalized to certain 'group- like' classes of semigroups, notably completely simple semigroups (Campbell et al. 2002) and group-embeddable semigroups (Cain et al. 2006).

It saw action in the Second Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. In 1969, the regiment reduced to a cadre and the Yeomanry lineage discontinued. History Formation and early history The regiment was originally formed in 1798 as independent troops. It became the Lancashire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1828. After being disbanded in 1832, it was re-formed as the Lancashire Hussars in 1848. It went on to become the Lancashire Hussars Imperial Yeomanry in 1901 and the Lancashire Hussars Yeomanry in 1908. Second Boer War On 13 December 1899, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the Second Boer War was made. Due to the string of defeats during Black Week in December 1899, the British government realised they were going to need more troops than just the regular army, thus issuing a Royal Warrant on 24 December 1899. This warrant officially created the Imperial Yeomanry. The Royal Warrant asked standing Yeomanry regiments to provide service companies of approximately 115 men each. In addition to this, many British citizens (usually mid-upper class) volunteered to join the new regiment. The regiment was based at Prince Albert Road in Liverpool at this time (since demolished). First World War In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments. = 1/1st Lancashire Hussars= The 1/1st was formed in Liverpool in August 1914 and attached to the Welsh Border Mounted Brigade. In 1915, the regiment was split up, the regimental headquarters and B Squadron joining the 31st Division and, after moving to France, being briefly attached to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division. The rest of the regiment was attached to 35th Division, (C Squadron) and 30th Division, (D Squadron). The regiment was re-formed in May 1916 to form the VIII Corps Cavalry Regiment. In July 1917, the regiment was dismounted and dispatched for training as infantry. This was completed in September 1917, when the men joined a battalion of the King's, which was redesignated as the 18th (Lancashire Hussars Yeomanry) Battalion, the King's (Liverpool) Regiment. = 2/1st Lancashire Hussars= The 2nd line regiment was formed in September 1914. By July 1915, it was under the command of the 2/1st Western Mounted Brigade (along with 2/1st Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry, and the 2/1st Westmorland and Cumberland Yeomanry) and in March 1916 was at Cupar, Fife. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were numbered in a single sequence and the brigade became 21st Mounted Brigade, still at Cupar under Scottish Command. In July 1916 there was a major reorganisation of 2nd line yeomanry units in the UK. All but 12 regiments were converted to cyclists and as a consequence the regiment was dismounted and the brigade converted to 14th Cyclist Brigade. Further reorganisation in October and November 1916 saw the brigade redesignated as 10th Cyclist Brigade in October 1916, still at Cupar. The regiment moved to St Andrews in July 1917. By January 1918, 10th Cyclist Brigade had moved to Lincolnshire with the regiment at Skegness. About May 1918 the Brigade moved to Ireland and the regiment was stationed at Bandon and Buttevant, County Cork. There were no further changes before the end of the war. = 3/1st Lancashire Hussars= The 3rd Line regiment was formed in 1915 and in the summer it was affiliated to a Reserve Cavalry Regiment at The Curragh. In the summer of 1916 it was affiliated to the 10th Reserve Cavalry Regiment, also at The Curragh. It was absorbed by the 2nd Reserve Cavalry Regiment, still at The Curragh, in early 1917. By 1918 it had left the 2nd Reserve Cavalry Regiment when the 1st Line regiment was converted to infantry and joined 5th (Reserve) Battalion of the King's (Liverpool Regiment) at Oswestry. Inter-War Years In 1920, in common with many other Yeomanry regiments, the Lancashire Hussars were converted to a Royal Field Artillery (RFA) role and was redesignated as the 2nd (Lancashire) Army Brigade, RFA, at Manchester. In 1921, it was redesignated as the 106th (Lancashire Yeomanry) Brigade, RFA, and then when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924, as the 106th (Lancashire Yeomanry) Field Brigade, RA, with HQ returning to Liverpool. It served as 'Army Troops' in 55th (West Lancashire) Divisional Area. In 1938 it was retitled as the 106th (Lancashire Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery.Litchfield, pp. 129‚Äì30.Titles and Designation, 1927. Second World War = 106th (Lancashire Hussars) Regiment, RHA= At the start of the Second World War, the hussars comprised 423rd and 424th Batteries, based in Liverpool. By November 1939, it was part of the UK-based 1st Cavalry Division and was equipped with 4.5 inch Howitzers (424 Bty) and 18 pdr Field Guns (423 Bty). In January 1940, the regiment moved to Palestine.Joslen, pp. 33, 473. It moved to North Africa in August 1940, by which time 424 Bty had become No. 1 and No. 2 Batteries (Anti-tank) and 423 Bty had become No. 3 and No. 4 Batteries (Anti-aircraft), known as 1/106 Bty, 1/102, Bty, etc. The former two were equipped with Bofors 37 mm anti-tank guns on Portees, and the latter two with captured Italian 20mm Breda Model 35 AA/AT guns. Each new battery consisted of only two troops, A and B (No. 1 Bty), C and D (No. 2 Bty), E and F (No. 3 Bty) and G and H (No.4 Bty). It served with the 7th Armoured Division during many of the early battles in North Africa. At the end of February 1941, the regiment was advised that it was to become a Light Anti Aircraft (L.A.A) regiment of just three batteries (comprising 36 x 20mm Breda gunsOperation Lustre aid to Greece ‚Äì file ref WO 106/3132) and was then later known as 106th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Lancashire Hussars). In March 1941, the regiment deployed to Greece via Operation Lustre as part of W Force. Upon disembarking at Piraeus, the regiment deployed to Glyfada for 2 weeks training. Thereafter, the regiment was sent to defend the airstrip at Larissa. The German advance forced the British to retreat to the town of Nauplion, where the 106th were the only AA defence. After destroying their Breda guns, the regiment was evacuated to Crete on board . Most of the regiment ended the campaign in the defence of Suda Bay in the Battle of Crete, becoming prisoners of war in the process. It was placed in suspended animation in July the same year, with many of its men going to reinforce the 102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Regiment RA, which were being strengthened and re- equipped after being evacuated from Greece and Crete. = 149th (Lancashire Hussars) Regiment, RHA= Postwar When the TA was re-formed in 1947, the regiment was renamed the 306th (Lancashire Hussars) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA, before being amalgamated with the 390th (King's Own) LAA Regiment, RA in 1950. Later, in 1956, it became 'P' (Lancashire Hussars) Battery of 287th (1st West Lancashire) Medium Regiment, RA and, by 1967, it was just 'A' Troop (Lancashire Hussars), P (1st West Lancashire) Battery, The West Lancashire Regiment, RA (Territorial). In 1969, the regiment was reduced to a cadre (absorbed into 208 (3rd West Lancashire) Battery of 103 (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment Royal Artillery in 1973) and the Yeomanry lineage discontinued.

The Pictet Group employs around 4,600 people, including 900 investment managers. It has a network of 28 offices in financial services centres, including registered banks in Geneva, Luxembourg, Nassau, Hong Kong and Singapore. Pictet does not engage in investment banking, nor does it extend commercial loans. According to its 2019 Annual Review, Pictet had 576 CHF Bn of assets under management or custody, with its total capital ratio significantly exceeding the levels demanded by Swiss regulators. Banque Pictet & Cie SA is rated Prime-1/Aa2 by Moody's, and F1+/AA- by Fitch.  History  The Scripte de soci√©t√© (memorandum of association) for the Banque De Candolle Mallet & Cie Pictet traces its origin to the foundation of Banque De Candolle Mallet & Cie in Geneva on 23 July 1805. On that day, Jacob-Michel-Fran√ßois de Candolle and Jacques-Henry Mallet signed, with three limited partners,Jean- Louis Mallet, brother of Jacques-Henry, Paul Martin and Jean-Louis Falquet a Scripte de Soci√©t√© (memorandum of association) to form a partnership.\\"Pictet & Cie\\", 1805-1955, Atar, Geneva, 1955. Like all Geneva banks at the time, it started out trading in goods, but soon abandoned trading to concentrate on assisting clients in their financial and commercial business and advising them on managing their wealth. By the 1830s, it held a broad range of securities on behalf of clients, to diversify their risks. On the death of de Candolle in 1841, his wife‚Äôs nephew Edouard Pictet joined the partnership, and the name Pictet has remained with the bank ever since. Between 1890 and 1929, the Bank went through a period of substantial growth, the number of employees rising from 12 to more than 80 over 30 years.Pictet Group Historical Archives, ref. AHP 1.1.7.1 Although the Pictet family had been intimately engaged with the bank since the mid 19th century, it was only in 1926 that the company changed its name to Pictet & Cie. After a period of relative stagnation marked by the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World War, Pictet began to expand in the 1950s as the Western world entered a prolonged period of prosperity and economic growth. In the late 1960s, the Bank embarked on the new business of institutional asset management, which has since grown to account for around half its total assets under management.\\"200 years of History : one bank and the men who built it\\", Atar, Geneva, 2005. In 1974, it opened an office in Montreal, the first of its current network of 28 offices around the world. Its workforce of 70 staff in 1950 rose to 300 by 1980.\\"Pictet & Cie, Gen√®ve : 1805-1980\\", Geneva, Atar, 1980. As of 2011, Pictet was Switzerland‚Äôs third largest wealth management company, and also one of Europe‚Äôs largest banks in private hands In 2014, Pictet changed its legal structure from a simple partnership to become a corporate partnership (soci√©t√© en commandite par actions), which acts as a holding company for its global business. Pictet did not publish its annual results during its 209 years as a simple partnership, then published annual results for the first time upon becoming a corporate partnership. This enabled the company to manage its businesses in an international environment, and also allows the seven partners who are owner- managers of Pictet to preserve the rules of succession, which have remained unchanged for more than 200 years. Under those rules, ownership cannot be passed down to partners‚Äô children: it is a temporary status which ends once a partner has retired. Partners hand over ownership of Pictet in batches every five to 10 years so that there are always partners from three generations connected to the family, to avoid problems that can arise with generational change. To date, there have been only 43 partners. Pictet operates by assigning business activities and key functions like human resources, risk control and legal affairs to different partners. Small committees supervise the various corporate activities so that no single partner is solely responsible for an entire area. Pictet Group‚Äôs senior partner, who is the most senior partner at the time of appointment, has oversight for areas concerning central corporate functions, such as HR, auditing, risk and compliance. As primus inter pares, he chairs the partners meetings and represents Pictet inside and outside the bank.  Structure  Wealth management Pictet Wealth Management provides private banking for owners of larger fortunes and family office services for families of exceptional wealth. The services include dedicated asset management, advice on strategy and investment selection, execution in global markets, safeguarding client assets and continuous monitoring. For hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments, Pictet Alternative Advisors, an independent unit, selects third- party investment managers to construct alternative investment portfolios for investors. Pictet Investment Office, is a special unit within Pictet that only looks after the wealthiest and most sophisticated clients of the bank and invest their assets into liquid and illiquid opportunities, in public and private markets following a high risk/return strategy across the capital structure. Operating out of 22 Pictet offices worldwide, Pictet Wealth Management had CHF 234bn of assets under management on December 31, 2019 and employed 1029 full-time equivalent employees, including 352 private bankers. On November 26, 2012, it was reported that Pictet's wealth management unit was the target of a United States Department of Justice probe along with 11 other Swiss financial firms. The Department of Justice investigated banks that it suspected of aiding tax evasion. Unlike the other firms, Pictet indicated that it would not book any provisions in its 2015 accounts and that its current capital reserves were large enough to cover any potential fine.

History  Commissioned during British rule in Malacca, the lighthouse was completed in 1849 as an additional beacon for ships travelling along the Strait of Malacca. The lighthouse is also notable for its location within the old harbour town of Malacca, atop St. Paul's Hill on the south side of the harbour and affront the ruins of St. Paul Church . The lighthouse was eventually deactivated; the functionality of the lighthouse diminished further as the Malaccan harbour underwent land reclamation during the late-20th century. The building is now part of Malacca City tourist attractions.  Design  As the structure is located within an urban area, the Malacca Light is essentially an approximately 13 metre (43 feet) high, three-storey square tower with no outbuildings, assuming an angular form different from many of its cylindrical and cone shaped counterparts throughout the region. The masonry tower consists mainly of a lantern and gallery mounted on an arched base, and is solely accessible from ground level via a small ladder. Having been designed and built during the mid-19th century, the lighthouse adopted basic elements from neoclassical architecture. The tower is painted white.

It follows some considerable unrest in the courts about the strictness of the law relating to taking corporate opportunities. Facts Mr Foster and Mr Bryant were directors of the plaintiff, a surveying company, and pretty much all their work came from a company called Alliance. Mrs Bryant also worked for the company, until Mr Foster said she was going to be made redundant. Unsurprisingly, this made Mr Bryant unhappy. He resigned. Alliance still wanted both of them to keep working. It said that Mr Bryant should still give his services. Mr Foster argued that Mr Bryant's services should be contracted out through their company still, not a separate one. But he lost the argument. Mr Bryant, fully funded by Alliance, set up a new company. However this was all done a few days before the resignation had actually taken effect. In the light of the preceding events, the company sued Mr Bryant, alleging that he had breached his fiduciary duty during the period between resigning, and his resignation taking contractual effect. FBS Ltd (i.e. Mr Foster) sued Mr Bryant for breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty, and the diversion of corporate opportunities to himself. Judgment Upholding the judge, the Court of Appeal found there was no breach of fiduciary duty in this case. Rix LJ delivered the principal judgment, starting with the Canadian Supreme Court case, Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley. Here, defendant directors had resigned so that they could take the benefits for themselves of a project that they had been negotiating on behalf of the company. Laskin J had held that the defendants were ‚Äúfaithless fiduciaries‚Äù, their duties survived resignation, their resignation had been influenced by wanting to get the opportunity, and that they were in breach of trust. However, he stressed that he was ‚Äúnot to be taken as laying down any rule of liability to be read as if it were a statute‚Äù, but rather the standards of loyalty, good faith and the no-conflict rule should be looked at with reference to all the circumstances. > \\"Among them are the factor of position or office held, the nature of the > corporate opportunity, its ripeness, its specificness [sic] and the > director's or managerial officer's relation to it, the amount of knowledge > possessed, the circumstances in which it was obtained and whether it was > special or, indeed even private, the factor of time in the continuation of > fiduciary duty where the alleged breach occurs after termination of the > relationship with the company, and the circumstances under which the > relationship was terminated, that is whether by retirement or resignation or > discharge.\\" Rix LJ felt that Laskin J was right to see the strict equitable rule as nevertheless merit based. He also referred to three further cases, in the spirit of an article by Prof. John Lowry from 2000, which supported a more 'nuanced' approach.J Lowry and R Edmunds, ‚ÄòThe No Conflict-No Profit Rules and the Corporate Fiduciary-Challenging the Orthodoxy of Absolutism‚Äô [2000] Journal of Business Law 122-142 First, in Island Export Finance v Umunna[1986] B.C.L.C. 460 Hutchinson J (who relied on Laskin J's judgment) extensively, took the view that the proposition that liability arises from the mere fact that the defendant's position as a director led him to a post-resignation opportunity, was too widely stated. In Balston Ltd v Headlines Filters Ltd[1990] F.S.R. 385 Falconer J, following the views expressed by Hutchinson J, stated, > ‚ÄúIn my judgment an intention by a director of a company to set up business > in competition with the company after his directorship has ceased is not to > be regarded as a conflicting interest within the context of the principle, > having regard to the rules of public policy as to restraint of trade, nor is > the taking of any preliminary steps to investigate or forward that intention > so long as there is no actual competitive activity, such as, for instance, > competitive tendering or actual trading, while he remains a director.‚Äù Thirdly, in Framlington Group Plc v Anderson[1995] 1 BCLC 475 Blackburne J held that in the absence of special circumstances, like a prohibition in a service contract, a director commits no breach of duty merely because, while a director, he takes... > \\"...steps so that, on ceasing to be a director... he can immediately set up > business in competition with that company or join a competitor of it. Nor is > he obliged to disclose to that company that he is taking those steps.‚Äù Rix LJ draws the conclusion from these three cases, and the authorities cited by the trial judges in their judgments, that although the general equitable principle which places an embargo on conflicts of duty is beyond doubt, the extent of a director's duty may depend upon the particular circumstances of the case. Furthermore, drawing on Lawrence Collins J's reasoning in CMS Dolphin Ltd v Simonet, where the claimant company successfully claimed that Simonet, its former managing director, was in breach of fiduciary duty by diverting a maturing business opportunity to a new company established by him following his resignation, Rix LJ stressed that there should be ‚Äúsome relevant connection or link between the resignation and the obtaining of the business‚Äù. In so doing, he placed emphasis upon the need to demonstrate both lack of good faith with which the future exploitation was planned while still a director, and the need to show that the resignation was an integral part of the dishonest plan. Thus, in cases where liability for post-resignation breach of duty had been found, there was a causal connection between the resignation and the subsequent diversion of the opportunity to the director's new enterprise. That said, Rix LJ recognised the difficulty of accurately summarising the circumstances in which retiring directors may or may not be held to have breached their fiduciary duties given that the issue is ‚Äúfact sensitive‚Äù. It was clear, however, that the defendant's resignation was innocent of any disloyalty or conflict of interest. Moses LJ, while recognising that the resolution of issues of breach of fiduciary duty are fact specific, felt ‚Äúalmost‚Äù nostalgic for the days when there were inflexible rules of equity which were inexorably enforced by judges ‚Äúwho would have shuddered at the reiteration of the noun-adjective‚Äù. Buxton LJ, also endorsing Rix LJ's judgment, stressed that the facts were particularly unusual and the Court was right to adopt a realistic approach to the alleged breach of duty. It is, he said, > ‚Äúunreal to contend that, faced with Mrs Watts proposal, [the defendant] > should have gone out of his way to seek to deter her from it.‚Äù See also *Guth v Loft, the Delaware decision that deviated from the strict approach. *Keech v Sandford, the rule of equity that has been the bedrock of fiduciary duties for 280 years.

In 2018, Columbia University announced his termination from his administrative positions after an internal investigation uncovered violations of university policies. He died shortly after from a rapidly neurodegenerative condition diagnosed as progressive supranuclear palsy. Education Jessell received his PhD in neuroscience from the University of Cambridge PhD in 1977 with Leslie Iversen at the MRC Neurochemical Pharmacology Unit. Career and research After his PhD, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School with Gerald Fischbach. In 1981 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. In 1985 he joined the Columbia University faculty where he worked for the remainder of his career and became Claire Tow Professor of Motor Neuron Disorders (in neuroscience). Jessell is known for his work on chemical signals that play a role when nerve cells assemble during development to form neuronal circuits. In 1994, he showed that netrin guides commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord. Awards In 1994 Jessell was awarded the NAS Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences.

It serves the ZIP Code 10901, covering the village of Suffern. It was built during the New Deal and reflects that era's architectural styles, combining elements of the Colonial Revival style preferred by the Treasury Department for new post offices in the early 20th century with the Streamline Moderne style predominating in the late 1930s. Its interior features a wall relief by Elliot Means, one of the many public artworks commissioned by the Section of Painting and Sculpture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Wall relief by Elliott Means (1937) Building The post office is a single-story, five-bay steel frame building with a buff brick exterior. It is square-shaped with a rear wing and flat roof. The central three bays of the front facade are done in a symmetrical, vertical pattern of scalloped limestone, with some marble trim. Polished aluminum letters attached to the facade above the main entrance identify the building as a post office and its location. Some aluminum lampposts have been added since the building's construction. Aluminum is also used for the doors and vestibule, leading on to the L-shaped lobby, almost intact from its original design. Ceramic tile is used for the flooring and dado to counter height. Vertical scalloping similar to that in the exterior is used on the plaster ceiling's molded cornice. On the wall above the entrance to the postmaster's office is \\"Communication\\", a relief by sculptor Elliot Means. It depicts a partially clothed woman, surrounded by the moon, clouds, stars, mountains and waves, shooting a bow with flaming arrow. History Suffern's first post office was established in 1797 by founding settler John Suffern, but fell into disuse a decade later. A village post office was formally reestablished in 1858 and used several rented spaces over the years. In 1931, the Treasury Department, which was then the Post Office's parent agency, got Congress to appropriate money for a standalone post office building in several New York communities, Suffern included. The land was purchased for $20,000 in 1935. The next year, the post office was built for $90,000. Treasury Supervising Architect Louis Simon used an austere Colonial Revival design, demonstrated by the building's fenestration, brick facing and multi-paned sash windows. Variations on this basic design can be found in other New York post offices Simon built during this period. But to a far greater degree than other post offices he built during this period elsewhere in the state, he incorporated more contemporary, Art Deco and Streamline Moderne elements, such as the expansive brick face, the use of aluminum in the transom, the limestone scalloping and the lack of exterior ornamentation or cornice otherwise. Only the post office in the Chemung County village of Waverly, almost an exact copy of Suffern's, uses this many modernistic elements. Means' relief was added in 1937, and fluorescent lighting was installed in the lobby in 1965. There have been no major changes besides those to the building since it was opened.

The STO was created under laws and regulations of Vichy France,The Law of 4 September 1942 (') and the Law of 16 February 1943 with its associated regulations. but it was used by Nazi Germany to compensate for its loss of manpower as it enlisted more and more soldiers for the Eastern Front. The German government promised that for every three French workers sent it would release one French prisoner of war. Those requisitioned under the STO were accommodated in work camps on German soil. French forced laborers were the only nationality to have been required to serve by the laws of their own state rather than by German orders. This was an indirect consequence of the autonomy negotiated from the German administration by the Vichy government. A total of 600,000 to 650,000 French workers were sent to Germany between June 1942 and July 1944. France was the third largest forced labor provider, after the USSR and Poland, and was the country that provided the largest number of skilled workers. 250,000 POWs also had to work for the Reich from 1943 onwards, having been \\"transformed\\", voluntarily or involuntarily, into civilian workers.  History  Plaque in Quimper commemorating a January 1944 act of sabotage against the STO office, destroying 44,000 files. On 22 June 1942, Pierre Laval, Prime Minister in the Vichy regime, announced the enactment of the ', whereby French workers were encouraged to volunteer to work in Germany to secure the release of French prisoners of war. Fritz Sauckel, dubbed the \\"slavemaster of Europe\\", was appointed Generalbevollm√§chtigter f√ºr den Arbeitseinsatz (General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment) on 21 March 1942 and charged with obtaining labor from across Europe. His appointment was roughly concurrent with the return to power of Pierre Laval. Until that time less than 100,000 French volunteers had gone to work in Germany.Jean-Paul Cointet, Pierre Laval, Fayard, 1993, , pp.378-380 The refusal to send 150,000 skilled workers was one of the causes of the fall of the Darlan government.Fred Kupferman, Pierre Laval, Balland, 1987; 2nd edition, Tallandier, 2006, p.383-388 In 1942 and 1943, Sauckel used intimidation and threats to meet his objectives. Laval negotiated, procrastinated and complied in turn, so that relations between the two men were tumultuous, Sauckel alternately praising Laval for his cooperation or condemning him for obstruction.H. Roderick Kedward, STO et Maquis, dans La France des ann√©es noires, tome 2, Seuil, 1993, p. 271-294 Sauckel's increasing labor requirements between spring 1942 and early 1944 were known as \\"actions Sauckel\\" (Sauckel actions). The law of 4 September 1942, signed by Philippe P√©tain, Marshal of France and Chief of State of Vichy France, as well as by Laval, was entitled \\"'\\" or \\"Law of 4 September 1942 on the use and guidance of the workforce\\". It required all able-bodied men aged 18 to 50 and single women aged 21 to 35 to \\"be subject to do any work that the Government deems necessary\\". After Hitler ordered, on 15 December 1942, the transfer to the Wehrmacht of 300,000 German workers, Sauckel required, on 1 January 1943, in addition to the 240,000 French workers already in Germany, a further quota of 250,000 men to be dispatched by mid-March. To satisfy this second \\"action Sauckel\\", the law of 16 February 1943, signed by Prime Minister Laval for Joseph Barth√©lemy, the Minister of Justice, deemed it necessary that all males over 20 be subject to the service du travail obligatoire. Regulations were issued the same day and subjected males born between 1920 and 1922, roughly all males between the ages of 20 and 23, to the service. Previous requisitions under the rel√®ve theoretically concerned only workers. With the introduction of the STO, recruitment would henceforth be made by whole age groups. Young people in the classes of \\"1940\\", \\"1941\\" and \\"1942\\", that is to say those born between 1920 and 1922, were obliged to go to work in Germany (or France) as a substitute for military service. The Class of \\"1942\\" was the most affected and exemptions or suspensions initially promised to farmers or students were removed in June 1943. Theoretically, the STO also applied to young women but, for fear of the reactions of the people and the Church, women were not generally called up. Those called up in the second \\"action Sauckel\\" included 24,000 young men of the Chantiers de la jeunesse fran√ßaise, the uniformed organization for young men that replaced military service in France between 1940 and 1944. These provided the last contingent of the \\"1942\\" class.Jean- Pierre Az√©ma et Olivier Wieviorka, Vichy, 1940-1944, Tempus Perrin, 2004, pp. 255-257, 1st edition, 1997 A third \\"action Sauckel\\" followed: On April 23, 1943, the Germans made new demands for 120,000 workers in May and another 100,000 in June. On August 6, 1943, they demanded an additional 500,000. These goals were never achieved because increasingly potential conscripts evaded the requisitions. The STO caused the departure into hiding of nearly 200,000 evaders, of whom approximately one quarter became full-time members of the French resistance. Finally it was the Germans themselves who put an end to the demands of Sauckel. On 15 September 1943 the Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer concluded an agreement with Vichy government minister Jean Bichelonne exempting many French companies working for Germany from Sauckel's requisitions. However, this meant that the French economy increasingly became integrated with that of Germany. Sauckel continued his labor levies, formally in parallel with the new policy of Speer, but the fourth \\"Sauckel Action\\" launched in 1944 turned out to be unproductive in obtaining additional workers. The STO accentuated the movement of French public opinion against the Vichy regime and contributed to the Resistance. But it also brought the latter a task of considerable magnitude: to find money, food, weapons, etc. for thousands of young men who suddenly flocked to the resistance. STO conscripts also formed the first among 35,000 who escaped from France to North Africa to join the Free French or the French Liberation Army.

He made his professional debut in January 1938 and reached makuuchi in May 1944, nearly 25 years before the more well known Hawaiian born Takamiyama Daigoro. However, he fought in only one tournament in the top division before being drafted into the Imperial Japanese Army against his wishes, and he never returned to sumo. He remained in Japan after the war, and ran an inn later in life. Career He was born as Harley Ozaki in Pierce, Colorado, although he was to list Chikuj≈ç, Fukuoka as his birthplace on the banzuke ranking sheets. He joined Dewanoumi stable in January 1938. He had been introduced to the stable by a relative during a visit to Japan. Initially he knew nothing about sumo, assuming that the sand covered clay dohy≈ç was made of concrete. He was the fifth Japanese-American in sumo and the first to reach elite sekitori status. He never had a losing score in his eight years in sumo. He was promoted to the second j≈´ry≈ç division in January 1943 and reached the top makuuchi division in May 1944. He scored six wins against four losses, but this was to be his last tournament before being drafted into the Japanese army. He still had American citizenship and had really wanted to fight for the United States, but as he could not return to the US he agreed to change his citizenship at the urging of the Japan Sumo Association. He adopted the Japanese name of Kiichiro Ozaki. He survived the war but decided not to return to sumo, believing he could make a better living as an interpreter for the US forces. He regained his US citizenship and in his later years ran a ryokan in Tokyo with his wife. Career record *Through most of the 1940s only two tournaments were held a year.

Founded in 1928, there were (as of 2008) 495 baptized members. Three of Redeemer's pastors held rather long tenures; Rev. Worth Setzer served for nearly 31 years, Rev. George Bornemann for 17 years, Rev. Richard Drews for 26 years. Rev. Robert Fitzpatrick served for 7 years. Moreso recently, Rev. Scott Stiegemeyer served at Redeemer for five years; the current pastor is Rev. Anthony Oliphant, Redeemer Lutheran Church, Pastors and Staff who was installed in the autumn of 2015. This church is designed in a reserved mixture of Gothic and Neo-Baroque styles, and possesses artwork covering a number of different movements, including medieval-style stained glass, carved wooden doors, and a contemporary piece representing the Holy Spirit which hangs in the northern transept. History Founding Founded at an April 19, 1928 meeting at Hawthorne Elementary School, the congregation initially had only 22 English-language Lutheran members after splitting off from Immanuel Lutheran Church, which would only provide services in German. The first worship service had been held Easter Sunday, April 8, in the auditorium of the same school with attendees from Immanuel Lutheran Church and Trinity Lutheran Church of Villa Park, Illinois. Rev. H. H. Hartmann was the field missionary of the Northern Illinois District of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and Other States (the former name mostly German-speaking LCMS), and both he and Rev. H. Prange of Trinity Lutheran Church, Oak Park, provided the group with organizational guidance. By May 25 the core group had grown to 40 people, who approved a preliminary organization and elected officers. The fledgling congregation chose to join the English District of the LCMS; the women members' recommendation of ‚ÄúRedeemer Evangelical Lutheran Church‚Äù was accepted as the congregation‚Äôs name. The rolls were kept open for chartering members and were finalized with 109 people. Rev. G. Schuessler, president of the English District, arranged for visiting pastors to lead worship.New Church Organized in Town In October 1928 the English District approved the new church's constitution and by-laws, thus chartering them as a congregation. On October 29, the group elected its first officers and committees. Dr. Edward Marquardt chaired a building committee, tasked with planning for the congregation‚Äôs first purpose-built facility.Redeemer Calls First Pastor Church building In January 1929 the group purchased land in an elm- shaded residential area at the northwest corner of Kenilworth Avenue and St. Charles Road as the future site for their church. In April of that year they hired the Hotchkiss & Edgar architectural partners, the same firm that had designed Immanuel Lutheran, to design the Elmhurst building, and held the groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday, October 20, 1929. The building was initially larger than was strictly required by the size of the congregation, but members expected the congregation to grow through missionary outreach.Redeemer Church Builds The church building, described at the time as a restrained modern Gothic-style building, was complete by May 18, 1930 and was characterized as \\"one of the most attractive and imposing houses of worship in Elmhurst.\\" Three worship services were planned for the dedication activities. At 10:45 a.m. Rev. W. F. Wilk of St. Louis preached, while Erwin Miller led Redeemer's choir. At 3:00 p.m. Rev. G. Schuessler, president of the English District, preached a sermon, while the St. John Lutheran Church choir of La Grange, Illinois, sang. LCMS vice-president Rev. William Dallmann preached at the 8:00 p.m. service, with singing by the West Suburban Male Quartet. On the three subsequent evenings services were led by English District vice-president Rev. E. F. Haertel; Rev. O. E. Geiseman, of Oak Park; and Rev. W. H. Prange, of Oak Park; with the St. John Lutheran male chorus providing special music.Redeemer Lutheran Church dedicated Worship Facility Church pipe organ Initially, the church was equipped with a M√∏ller pipe organ, but the instrument was repossessed by the organ builder during the Great Depression.Redeemer Lutheran Pipe Organ Re-Dedicated In 1953, a new Reuter organ was installed to take its place. Fifty years later, congregational leaders, led by cantor and organist Ann Burns, began to interview area companies to obtain bids on reconditioning and enhancing the Reuter organ. Berghaus Organ Co. of Bellwood, Illinois was hired for the job, which was funded by church members' sponsorship of individual pipes from the new ranks. Congregants who thus ‚Äúbought‚Äù a pipe were entitled to take home one of the old pipes removed in the renovation. After six months of renovation, the pipe organ was rededicated on May 23, 2004. The ceremony featured four choirs singing hymns based on the Nicene Creed and highlighting the seasons of the liturgical year; the organ was backed by instrumentalists from the congregation. Expansion Responding to what the pastor called ‚Äúgrowing pains‚Äù, in 1955 the church added an annex to the north side of its 25-year-old structure to provide classroom space for its ‚ÄúChristian education activities.‚Äù In the groundbreaking ceremony on September 26, 1954, Rev. Setzer used the same shovel he had previously used in 1929 to break ground for the main building. The annex was dedicated with Rev. Dr. A. R. Kretzmann of St. Luke Lutheran Church of Logan Square, Chicago, presiding.Redeemer Expands Facilities for Education Needs On January 2, 1972, Redeemer celebrated the opening of ‚ÄúTitus Place,‚Äù across the street from the church, with a furnished kitchen, two classroom areas for meetings or Bible studies, and a commons area for larger gatherings and receptions. The new building also accommodated a main office for the church, a pastor's study, a boardroom and a gymnasium for athletics, fellowship activities, and other gatherings. Land for the new building had been purchased from the Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic parish, and ground was broken in January 1971.Redeemer Begins New Year Dedicating Parish Center In 1977 a leaded stained-glass window was installed above the chancel; the window had been donated by congregation charter members Dr. & Mrs. Edward Marquardt 25 years earlier, in 1952.Redeemer Church Welcomes New Pastor Pastors Rev. Worth Setzer, a 1923 graduate of Concordia Seminary of St. Louis, Missouri, was installed on October 7, 1928 as Redeemer Lutheran Church‚Äôs first pastor. Setzer had previously been pastor of St. Stephens Lutheran Church in his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina. In February 1958 founding pastor Rev. Setzer left Redeemer for the pastorate of First Lutheran Church, Cleveland, Tennessee, and on August 23, 1959, Pittsburgh native Rev. George Bornemann became only the second resident pastor in the church's 30-year history. Previously pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church in Toronto, Bornesmann had helped to found Lutheran congregations in Port Credit/Mississauga, North York and Scarborough, Ontario.The Rev. George Bornemann Welcomed by Redeemer Bornemann left Redeemer in the middle of 1976 after being elected president of the English District of the LCMS and was succeeded by Rev. Richard Drews on May 15, 1977. On March 30, 2003, the congregation installed Rev. Robert Fitzpatrick as pastor. He had been serving this non-geographic district as the president‚Äôs executive assistant for missions, and he had previously served for 18 years with a suburban Cleveland congregation and for ten years with a small-town Nebraska church.Redeemer Lutheran Calls its Fourth Pastor Next in line, Rev. Scott Stiegemeyer, took on his responsibilities on January 24, 2010, and served until June 7, 2015, after which he took a call to Concordia University Irvine as an Assistant Professor of Theology and Bioethics.Concordia University Irvine, Scott Stiegemeyer: Assistant Professor of Theology and Director of Pre-Seminary & Pre-Deaconess Studies Programs.

He is considered one of the world‚Äôs foremost experts in the cellular bases of motor behaviour. His research is focused on understanding the cellular bases of motor behaviour; in particular, he has shown how neuronal circuits in the spine help control rhythmic movements, such as those needed for locomotion. He is current secretary general of International Brain Research Organization IBRO and President of the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS). For his work, in 2008 he was awarded the $1 million Kavli Prize for deciphering the basic mechanisms which govern the development and functioning of the networks of cells in the brain and spinal cord. This prize distinguish the recipient from the Nobel prizes in basic medical sciences. Notable Neuroscientists like Eric Kandel, 2000 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or medicine named Grillner‚Äôs work on the workings of complex neurocircuitry extremely important and this progress in understanding motor systems, the cognitive role in motor systems, is a brilliant advance and has revolutionized our understanding of how the nervous system is wired. Prof. Grillner studied at the medical faculty in Gothenburg, Sweden, and received his Doctor of Medicine (MD); PhD in neurophysiology in 1969. He has been a Professor and Director of the Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology at the Karolinska Institute since 1987. He is a member of the Academia Europaeae, Royal Swedish Academy of Science, National Academy of Science (US), Institute of Medicine (US) and former member, deputy chair and chairperson between 1988-2008 of the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet which awards Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and has received a number of awards including the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award in 1993 and the Reeve‚ÄìIrvine award in 2002. He was the co- recipient of the 2005 SfN Ralph Gerard Prize, highest recognition conferred by Society for Neuroscience and he was a co-recipient, with Thomas Jessell and Pasko Rakic, of the inaugural Kavli Prize for Neuroscience in 2008. Research His research has focused on the extraordinary capability of the brain to control movement. Early on he demonstrated that networks within the mammalian spinal cord can produce the detailed motor pattern of locomotion involving the coordination of hundreds of different muscles. In a paper published in 1987, he and James Buchanan provided a putative network scheme of interacting interneurons in the lamprey spinal cord, a model vertebrate system. The level of detail gained in this work is unique in that it has allowed changes in behaviour to be related to changes occurring at the cellular and network level. His later work is directed towards understanding the forebrain mechanisms underlying selection of behavior, and has shown that the organization of the basal ganglia, dopamine system, habenulae and pallium is evolutionary conserved in considerable detail over more than 500 million years. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

Early history Early 1900s junction diagram showing the layout at Godley with the then extant stations On 17 November 1841, Godley was the temporary terminus of the Sheffield, Ashton- under-Lyne and Manchester Railway's (SAuLMR) line from Manchester Store Street. The station was located close to the Hyde and Mottram Road and was sometimes referred to as \\"Godley Toll Bar\\". It closed on 11 December 1842 when the line was extended to . A permanent station was opened after the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) opened the Stockport, Timperley and Altrincham Junction Railway as far as on 1 February 1866 and the SAuLMR, by now renamed as the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;), opened a line from to Godley via Apethorne Junction. The station, which was named as \\"Godley Junction\\", had four platform faces: two on the Manchester line and two on the CLC route. The CLC platforms were only ever lightly used. The station and sidings were controlled by a single mechanical signal box which was located at the east end of the 'up' (Hadfield) platform. The connection to Woodley gave the MS&LR; access to the Port of Liverpool without the need go via Manchester. This resulted in Godley becoming the point where freight traffic from as far away as Merseyside met with traffic going to and fro over the Pennines. Exchange sidings were laid on both the MS&LR; and the CLC sides of the station; those on the CLC side were known as Brookfold Sidings. Brookfold Sidings had their own turntable and signal box. A CLC traffic office was based at Godley and, during the Second World War, the London and North Eastern Railway had an operational headquarters at the rear of the Up main line platform which controlled operations as far east as Wath and Doncaster. Electrification The electrification of the Woodhead line in 1954 gave Godley a strategic importance as it was the point where steam and then diesel workings over the former CLC system met with electric services via Woodhead. A traction change-over siding was installed and loops on each side of the line ran from Godley Junction to a point to the east. These loops were controlled by their own signal box known as \\"Godley East\\". On 1 April 1969, the turntable was taken out of use. The station was renamed from Godley Junction to Godley on 6 May 1974. By the late 1970s, traffic had declined on the Woodhead line and the sidings at Godley had become overgrown. Nearby, Manchester City Council erected high-rise housing estates which were served by a newly opened station at . On 20 July 1981, the connection to Woodley closed along with the Woodhead line between Hadfield and Penistone. Track lifting followed in 1985/6. Closure On 7 July 1986, a new station called was opened on the site of the original Godley Toll Bar station, and the original station was renamed Godley East. Thereafter, a Parliamentary train ran to Godley East - a Saturdays only 12:38 to train. The station formally closed on 27 May 1995. Present day The main platforms remained intact in 2015, although largely overgrown. The platforms on the Hadfield line are fenced off; however from the cycle track which now runs along the former line to Woodley and Stockport, the remains of the other platforms are visible. The derelict footbridge was removed during the late 2000s.

The spontaneous uprising of Neapolitan and Italian Resistance against German occupying forces ‚Äî despite limited armament, organization or planning ‚Äî nevertheless successfully disrupted German plans to deport Neapolitans en masse, destroy the city and prevent Allied forces from gaining a strategic foothold. The city of Naples was subsequently awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor, the four days are celebrated annually, and were the subject of the 1962 film, The Four Days of Naples. Prelude Historical background From 1940‚Äì43, Naples suffered heavy Allied bombing raids causing severe damage and heavy civilian population loss. It has been calculated that 20,000 civilian Neapolitans died in the indiscriminate attacks: over 3,000 died in the raid of 4 August 1943 alone, while around 600 were killed and 3,000 injured by the explosion of the ship in port on 28 March. The city's artistic and cultural heritage also suffered damage, including the partial destruction of the Chiesa di Santa Chiara on 4 December 1942. With the Allied advance in southern Italy, anti- Fascists in the Naples area (including Fausto Nicolini, Claudio Ferri and Adolfo Omodeo) began establishing closer contacts with the Allied commanders, and requested Naples' liberation. From 8 September 1943, the day in which the Cassibile armistice came into force, the Italian Army forces in the area (without orders, as were most of the units at the time) drifted toward Naples. Things there were already difficult thanks to the unceasing bombing raids and the imbalance in forces (20,000 Germans opposed 5,000 Italians in the whole of Campania). The situation in Naples soon devolved into chaos, with many higher officials, either unable to take the initiative ‚Äî or even directly collaborating with the Nazis, deserting the city, followed by the Italian troops. Those escaping included Riccardo Pentimalli and Ettore Del Tetto, the generals entrusted with military responsibility for Naples, who fled in civilian clothing. Del Tetto's last actions before fleeing had been to hand the city over to the German army and to publish a decree banning assemblies and authorising the military to fire on those disregarding the ban. Even so, sporadic but bloody attempts at resistance arose throughout the Zanzur Barracks, as far as the Carabinieri barracks at Pastrengo and at the 21st \\"Centro di Avvistamento\\" (Early Detection Post) of Castel dell'Ovo. Turmoil The Biblioteca nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III in Naples where clashes took place. In the days following the armistice, episodes of intolerance and armed resistance against Naples' German occupiers intensified, more or less organized, including on September 1st, a student demonstration in Piazza del Plebiscito and the first meeting of the Liceo Sannazaro in Vomero. On September 9th, a group of citizens encountered German troops at Palazzo dei Telefoni, and managed to escape to Via Santa Brigida. This latter episode involved a member of the Carabiniere, who opened fire to defend a shop from German soldiers attempting to loot it. On 10 September, between Piazza del Plebiscito and the gardens below, the first bloody clash occurred, with the Neapolitans successfully blocking several German motor vehicles. In these fights, three German sailors and three German soldiers died. The occupiers managed to free some of those imprisoned by the rioters, thanks to an injunction by an Italian official, who summoned his countrymen to surrender some of their hostages and all their weapons. The retaliation for the Piazza del Plebiscito clashes came quickly: the Germans set fire to the National Library and opened fire on the crowd that had gathered there. On 12 September, numerous soldiers were killed on the streets of Naples, while about 4,000 Italian soldiers and civilians were deported for forced labor. An announcement on 22 September decreed compulsory labor for all men from 18‚Äì33 years of age and set their forced deportation to work camps in northern Italy and Germany.de Blasio Wilhelm, Maria (1988). The Other Italy - The Italian Resistance in World War II. New York: Norton, p. 45. Neopolitans refused and as men were rounded up and brought to the stadium in the Vomero, a civilian uprising ensued. State of siege The same day, Colonel Walter Sch√∂ll assumed command of the military occupiers in the city, declaring a curfew and a state of siege, with orders to execute all those responsible for hostile actions against German troops, and up to 100 Neapolitans for every German killed. The following proclamations appeared on the walls of the city on 13 September: The orders were followed by the shooting of eight prisoners of war in via Cesario Console, while a tank opened fire against students who were beginning to gather in the nearby University and several Italian sailors in front of the stock market. A young sailor was executed on the stairs of the headquarters, while thousands of people were forced to attend by German troops. On the same day, 500 people were also forcibly deported to Teverola, near Caserta, and forced to watch the execution of 14 policemen, who had offered armed resistance to the occupying forces. The seeds of rebellion Together, the war's indiscriminate executions, looting, control of the civilian population, increasing poverty and destruction, spurred a completely spontaneous rebellion in the city, without external organization. 22 September On 22 September, inhabitants of the Vomero quarter were able to steal ammunition from an Italian artillery battery; on 25 September 250 rifles were stolen from a school; and on 27 September Neapolitan insurgents captured additional weapons and ammunition. 23 September In the meantime, Colonel Sch√∂ll on 23 September ordered additional measures to suppress the population, including evacuation (within 20 hours that same day) of the entire coastal area up from the waterfront: approximately 240,000 people would be forced to abandon their homes to allow the creation of a \\"military security zone\\" ‚Äî potential a prelude to the port's destruction. Almost simultaneously, a manifesto from the city's prefect called for compulsory work for all males between the ages of 18 and 30 ‚Äî in effect a forced deportation to labor camps in Germany. Only 150 Neapolitans out of the planned 30,000 responded to the call, leading Sch√∂ll to send soldiers into Naples to round up and immediately execute resisters. 26 September In response, on September 26th, an unarmed crowd poured into the streets, opposing the Nazi roundups and freeing the resisters from deportation. The rioters were joined by former Italian soldiers who'd thus far remained hidden. The four days 27 September On September 27th, large numbers of German troops captured about 8,000 Neapolitans, and 400-500 armed rioters responded in attack. One of the first outbreaks of fighting occurred in Vomero, where a group of armed men stopped a German car and killed the German NCO driver. That same day, fierce fighting followed in different areas of the city between the insurgents and German soldiers. The Germans began evacuating, spurred by news, later proved false, of an imminent Allied landing at Bagnoli. An Italian lieutenant, Enzo Stimolo, led a group of 200 insurgents against a weapons depot at Castel Sant'Elmo, which was captured that evening, not without bloodshed, after German reinforcements arrived from the Villa Floridiana and the Campo Sportivo del Littorio areas. At the same time, a group of citizens moved on the Parco di Capodimonte (the Capodimonte Park) in response to rumors that Germans were executing prisoners there. An insurgent plan, to prevent German engineers from destroying the Ponte della Sanit√† (the Maddalena Cerasuolo bridge) and thereby isolate the city center, was devised and carried out the following day. That evening, insurgents attacked and plundered weapons armories in the barracks at Via Foria and Via San Giovanni a Carbonara. 28 September On September 28th, fighting increased with further Neapolitan citizens joining the riot. In Materdei, a German patrol, which had taken shelter in a civil building, was surrounded and kept under siege for hours, until the arrival of reinforcements. By the end, three Neapolitans died in the battle. At Porta Capuana, a group of 40 men, armed with rifles and machine guns, set up a roadblock, killing six enemy soldiers and capturing four. Other fighting broke out in Maschio Angioino, Vasto and Monteoliveto. Germans launched raids in Vomero, taking prisoners inside the Campo Sportivo del Littorio, prompting an assault on the sports field by a party led by Enzo Stimolo, liberating prisoners the following day. 29 September On the third day of the riot, the streets of Naples witnessed fierce clashes. As no connection could be established with national anti-fascist organizations such as the Fronte Nazionale (an offshoot of the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale), the insurrection was still without central direction, operations being in the hands of local leaders. In Giuseppe Mazzini Square, a substantial German party reinforced by tanks attacked 50 rebels, killing 12 and injuring more than 15 of them. The workers' quarter of Ponticelli suffered a heavy artillery bombardment, after which German units committed several indiscriminate massacres among the population. Other fighting took place near the Capodichino Airport and Piazza Ottocalli, in which three Italian airmen were killed. In the same hours, at the German headquarters at Corso Vittorio Emanuele (which was repeatedly attacked by insurgents), negotiations were started between Sch√∂ll and Stimolo for returning the Campo Sportivo prisoners in exchange for the free retreat of the Germans from Naples. 30 September While the German troops had already begun the evacuation of the city before the arrival of Anglo-American forces from Nocera Inferiore, Antonio Tarsia in Curia‚Äîa high school teacher‚Äîproclaimed himself head of the rebels and assumed full civil and military powers. Among other things, he issued provisions regarding the precise opening hours for shops and citizens' discipline. The fighting did not cease, and the German guns in the Capodimonte heights shelled the area between Port'Alba and Piazza Mazzini for the whole day. Other fighting occurred in the area of Porta Capuana. The fleeing Germans left behind them fires and massacres, including the burning of the State Archives of Naples, which caused great loss of historical information and documents. A few days later there was an explosion at the Palazzo delle Poste, Naples, attributed to German explosives. Liberation of Naples Daimler scout car of 1st King's Dragoon Guards at the town hall in Naples, 1 October 1943 At 09:30 on 1 October, armoured patrols of the King's Dragoon Guards was the first allied unit to reach Naples followed by the Royal Scots Greys reinforced by troops of the 82nd Airborne Division. At the end of the day, the German commander-in-chief in Italy‚ÄîGeneralfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring‚Äîconsidered the retreat successfully concluded. Statistics for the four days of Naples vary: according to some authors, 168 rioters and 159 unarmed citizens were killed; according to the post-war Ministerial Commission for the recognition of partisan victims, casualties amounted to 155, while the registers of the Poggioreale cemetery listed 562 deaths. In contrast to other resistance episodes in Italy after the 8 September armistice, which also involved Italian fascists,The Repubblica Sociale Italiana, a German-supported puppet state, was declared on 23 September 1943. most of the fighting occurred between Italians and Germans. The revolt prevented Germans from organizing resistance in Naples against an Allied offensive, and furthermore from or destroying the city before a German retreat ‚Äî as Adolf Hitler had ordered. On 22 December, generals Riccardo Pentimalli and Ettore Del Tetto, who had abandoned Naples to the Germans after September 8th, were sentenced by the High Court of Justice to 20 years in military prison, Later their conviction was reduced for active collaboration with Germans. Domenico Tilena, head of the fascist provincial section during the riots, was sentenced to six years and eight months. In popular culture The historical episode of the Naples rebellion was recalled in Nanni Loy's 1962 film The Four Days of Naples, nominated for Oscars for best foreign film and best screenplay.. The final scenes of the film \\"Tutti a casa\\" starring Alberto Sordi (1960) also depicted the events, specifically those of September 28.

He collaborated with various leading staffage painters to create lively church interiors. Life Pieter Neefs the Younger was baptized in Antwerp on 23 May 1620. (see index, v.1; plate 57, v.2) His father was the painter Pieter Neefs the Elder and his mother Maria Louterbeens. The nave of Antwerp Cathedral Pieter had four siblings of whom his older brother Lodewijk also became a painter. The two brothers both trained with their father and as a result their works were very close to their father's, and attributions of their individual hands can be difficult. After the death of their father some time after 1656, the sons took over the family workshop.Peeter Neefs II, the Younger. FOMP, retrieved on 22 March 2013 Pieter Neefs the Younger appears never to have become a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. While unusual, he was likely never admitted because he was working in his father's workshop.Pieter Neefs II in Rafael Vaels Recent Acquisitions 2014, p 22 The last date on which he is known to have been active is 1675, a date found on a picture formerly in Vienna (Vaduz, Liechtenstein Museum). Work Pieter the Younger specialised in architectural subjects, particularly Gothic church interiors and some dungeon interiors. His earliest extant work is dated 1646. Interior of a church lit at night Pieter Neefs the Younger continued the tradition of the church interior in Antwerp in the manner created by his father and other artists of the previous generation like Hendrick van Steenwyck the Elder. His paintings show real as well as imaginary interiors of churches.Pieter Neefs the Younger, Interior of Antwerp Cathedral at Lempertz The interior of Antwerp Cathedral was one of his preferred subjects and many of his imaginary church interiors are a pastiche of elements of Antwerp Cathedral. Like his father he painted several nocturnal scenes of church interiors sometimes paired with daylight renderings of the same scenes.Pieter Neefs the Elder, The Interior of a Gothic Church by Night at Johnny van Haeften An example is the pair of Interiors of a Gothic Church in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest showing a diurnal and nocturnal view of two gothic churches with slightly different interiors. Neefs the Younger collaborated with a number of different artists, in the first place his own father. The closeness in style of father and son and the fact that the two artists used a similar signature have created considerable confusion in attributing works to either artist. Some attributions are based on the dress of the figures depicted in the compositions. This is for example the case with the Interior of a Cathedral, Night Scene (c. 1660, Victoria and Albert Museum) which was attributed to Pieter the Younger as the dress of the characters in the composition were identified as being fashionable during the 1660s, a time by which is father is deemed to have been deceased.Pieter Neefs the Younger, Interior of a Cathedral, Night Scene at the Victoria and Albert Museum The other artists with whom Neefs the Younger collaborated included Frans Francken III, David Teniers the Younger and Bonaventura Peeters the Elder who provided the staffage to his interiors. His output was as large as that of his father. File:Pieter Neefs I - Interior of a Gothic Church in Day Light.jpgInterior of a Gothic Church in Day Light File:Pieter Neefs I - Interior of a Gothic Church.jpgInterior of a Gothic Church at Night Father and son van Steenwijck and the two generations of the family Neefs painters are considered to be representatives of the Antwerp school of architectural painting. Typical for their style was the use of a rigid linear perspective which offers a view directly down the nave of the church. This style was also adopted by the Dutch painters Dirck van Delen and Bartholomeus van Bassen.Sergiusz Michalski, Rembrandt and the Church Interiors of the Delft School, in: Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 23, No. 46 (2002), pp. 183-193 The works of Pieter Neefs the Elder and Younger have been called propaganda for the Catholic Counter Reformation. They typically show the interior of churches loosely based on Antwerp Cathedral in which the whole panoply of Catholic ecclesiastical activity is going on, in particular the Catholic sacraments such as baptism, communion, marriage, Mass, confession, the giving of alms, etc. All of these activities were often included in a single composition in a church swarming with priests and bristling with statues and paintings.Tilman Seebass. 'Imago Musicae 1986, Volume 3', Duke University Press, 1987, p. 52 This stands in sharp contrast with the purged interiors of the churches in the Protestant Dutch Republic painted by Dutch painters of the time such as Emanuel de Witte, Gerrit Berckheyde and Gerrit Houckgeest.Andrew Pettegree, 'The Reformation World', Psychology Press, 2000, p. 507 Notes External links * Category:1620 births Category:1670s deaths Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:People from Antwerp ","title":"Pieter Neefs the Younger"},{"id":"17655644","text":"Stobart or Stobbart is an English surname, it may refer to: People * Chuck Stobart (born 1934), American footballer * Dickie Stobbart (1891-1952), Canadian footballer * Eddie Stobart (born 1929), British businessman, founded Eddie Stobart Logistics * Edward Stobart (1954‚Äì2011), British businessman * George Stobbart (1921‚Äì1995), English footballer * J.

It starts in Oberursel and goes along Bad Homburg, Frankfurt am Main, Offenbach am Main and Neu-Isenburg until it is ending in Egelsbach. Today's A 661 was opened with the sections Bad Homburg (today junction 3) and Frankfurt-Bonames (formerly junction 5b). While the road's extension to Oberursel-Nord was easy to build, the construction to Frankfurt-Eckenheim got significantly delayed. There was an interim end between Bonames and Eschersheim near the Bonameser Platz. After many years the extension to the Friedberger Landstra√üe followed. The section between Offenbach and Egelsbach was also already constructed, but at this time as a part of the A 49 which was planned as an Autobahn between Kassel and Darmstadt. After this plan had been abandoned this section became a part of the A 661\\\\. The section between the two others had been finalized step-by-step and was closed in 1995. At the newest section between the Friedberger Landstra√üe and Frankfurt-Ost (close to the Eissporthalle the lanes are very tight because of economy measures. There is no hard shoulder at the moment and the lanes are only separated by a one meter high concrete wall. From the planned section only the half had been built until 1995 because of the bridge which is needed at the Bornheimer Hang, so the lanes in both directions are smaller in this section than in the others. When the section is completed it is planned that there are three lanes like in the other sections and to build two more bridges. One bridge over the Seckbacher Tal (270 m) and one over the Erlenbruch (200 m). The construction has started in November 2007 and the plan is that the work is completed in 2009. By completing the A 661 also the bridges which are needed for the Autobahndreieck Erlenbruch (one double-deck bridge and the ramps). Between Seckbach and Bornheim is a special construction. The \\"Galerie Seckbacher Stra√üe\\" which was built in 1995 has two functions. At first is a bridge over the Autobahn for the Seckbacher Landstra√üe and the Heinz-Herbert-Karry-Stra√üe and second it is noise protection for the Seckbach district next to the Autobahn. On the top of the tunnel there was built a small park. In the construction it is possible to connect it to the Alleentunnel of the A 66\\\\. At the end near Egelsbach in the south it is also possible to expand the Autobahn. The drive-up and drive-downs to Darmstadt already had been asphalted but the plan to build the Autobahn to Darmstadt was stopped in 1980. At the northern end near Bad Homburg, the Autobahn is made to the Bundestra√üe 455, and this goes along Kronberg and K√∂nigsstein, while the Autobahn has ended there for over 20 years. There were problems with the roadbed on 15 July 2007 because of the heat wave. Some concrete slabs moved over others at A 661 near Dreieich (district Offenbach). The expansion joints were not large enough to fit the concrete slabs when they expanded because of the heat, the police said. Several cars were damaged.

Fierro and his counterpart and fellow lieutenant, Tomas Urbina, have been cited as the two halves of Pancho Villa, Fierro representing his malicious side. It is believed Fierro met Pancho Villa in 1913 following the Madero revolution. Originating from Sinaloa, Fierro was a former federal officer having taken part in fighting against the Yaqui Indians. Following his role as a federal officer, Fierro went on to work as a railway man, eventually being absorbed into Villa's ranks. Roles Soldier Fierro's prominence is often cited back to the Battle of Tierra Blanca on 23 November 1913. The battle included 5,500 of Villa's soldiers, against an estimated 7,000 federal soldiers. Before the battle began Fierro had been sent South to destroy the railroad tracks, forcing the federal soldiers to halt. As Villa flanked the well armed federal soldiers with cavalry, a locomotive filled with dynamite and percussion caps was rammed into the federal soldiers train cars, the resulting explosion caused the federal soldiers to flee to nearby undamaged train cars in retreat. Fierro is then noted as riding on horseback after the escaping locomotive, climbing on to the locomotive, running across the roofs of the train cars, and shooting dead the boilerman and conductor, pulling the train to a complete stop. All federal soldiers captured were executed and in the battle Villa captured 4 locomotives, 7 machine guns, horses, rifles and 400,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The death toll during the battle stood around 1,000 federal soldiers killed and 300 of Villa's. Executioner (left to right) General Rodolfo Fierro, Pancho Villa, General Toribio Ortega, Col. Medina Fierro is most known as Villa's executioner, known as (). A 1930 novel El √°guila y la serpiente by Mart√≠n Luis Guzm√°n gives Fierro his nom de guerre.Mart√≠n Luis Guzm√°n, El √°guila y la serpiente (1930), Mexico City: Editorial Porr√∫a 1987. Guzm√°n describes events following the capture of over 300 Orozquistas soldiers, followers of Pascual Orozco. The captured soldiers were led into a large field with Fierro on one end, and a wall on the other. They were informed, if they were to reach the opposite end and climb over the wall they would be allowed to continue on free. In groups of ten the captured men were set out to run, Fierro alone firing his pistol at them as they ran, his soldiers handing him fresh pistols to continue firing without delay. One captive is noted as making it over the wall and to freedom, only after Fierro stopped to massage an achy trigger finger. The shooting went on for two hours. Another account recounts that Fierro would ask each prisoner if they would rather return to their family, or join the army of Pancho Villa. Those deciding to return to their family were seen as men who would head back to their old regiment and were executed. Those choosing to join Pancho Villa were provided with a horse, a gun, and three bullets. General Rodolfo Fierro in 1914 Other stories exist of Fierro shooting a man dead in public in the state of Chihuahua. The person, sitting across from Fierro, argued that a man shot would fall backwards, Fierro disagreed. To settle the bet Fierro shot the man, and watched as he fell forward, confirming to Fierro that he was correct. A similar story is told by John Reed:Insurgent Mexico, part 4, chapter 13 outside the theater of Durango, a drunken man asked Fierro what time it was; Fierro said: \\"You! How dare you speak to me before I speak to you first-\\" and shot him dead. While working as Villa's railway superintendent, Fierro was publicly reprimanded by Villa for a train of supply water running 35 minutes late. Fierro, when the train arrived is said to have shot the conductor dead as an act of vengeance for his humiliation. This incident sparked strife amongst the railway workers, who primarily supported Villa. In another incident, a drunken Fierro killed a railway worker for bumping into him, this final incident caused Villa to act. Villa permitted a judge to begin collecting evidence against Fierro into his actions, a judge who begged to be removed from the case for fear of repercussion. The case never went to trial but Fierro was removed from the position of railway superintendent. It is often stated the case was a sham, simply to continue to retain support from the much needed railway workers. =Benton killing= Fierro is also known for the murder of William Benton on 17 February 1914, an Englishman and land owner in Mexico who had his land confiscated by Villa's forces. Numerous stories exist around what happened. Benton is cited as having stormed into Villa's headquarters in Ciudad Ju√°rez, demanding his land back from Villa, in which Villa refused. Following his refusal, Villa maintains Benton unsuccessfully attempted to draw a six-shooter pistol, he was wrestled to the floor and given a formal court martial and found guilty of attempted assassination, he was then executed and buried. A conflicting story exists in which Benton drew his pistol but was detained and removed from the town at night. He was taken to the desert, where a hole was dug and Fierro is believed to have struck Benton in the head with a shovel, dumping him into the grave without checking to see if Benton was still alive. Generals Rodolfo Fierro and Francisco Villa Commander On 15 January 1915, Villa turned over command of the western forces to Fierro and Calixto Contreras. The decision was made following the election of Roque Gonz√°lez Garza by the Mexico City Convention. Fierro and Contreras were defeated following being put in command. In Guadalajara, Jalisco on 17 January 1915, Fierro's forces were surprised by an attack and forced to flee to Irapuato, Guanajuato. Villa was forced to pull troops from Mexico City to North West Mexico to assist Fierro and Contreras. With the larger number of forces, (11,000 soldiers strong), Villa was able to take Guadalajara without a fight, Villa pursued but was repelled, after sustaining heavy casualties, he ordered a withdrawal moving himself and a large force of soldiers from the area. Fierro was again in charge of the west, and on March 22, attacked a well dug-in force at Tuxpan, Veracruz. Fierro was again defeated, losing two thousand men and eight hundred horses, the loss forced him to abandon Guadalajara as well. Death On 14 October 1915, Fierro died after being thrown from his horse and landing in quicksand. At the time, Fierro was marching toward Sonora when he encountered the quicksand at the Casas Grandes Lagoon. The weight of his belt, loaded with gold coins and material is said to have prevented him from being able to escape although it is difficult to conceive great wealth in an army in frank defeat.  In film  In the film Villa Rides (1968), Fierro was portrayed by Charles Bronson.  In books  The Friends of Pancho Villa (Berkeley: New York, 1996), a novel by James Carlos Blake. Fierro is the narrator of the novel. Fierro also appears in Blake's novel Under the Skin as the father of the novel's protagonist, Jimmy Youngblood. \\"Les amis de Pancho Villa\\" L√©onard Chemineau and James Carlos Blake (Rivages Noir Casterman, 2012), a graphic novelization of James Carlos Blake's The Friends of Pancho Villa. \\"Tom Mix and Pancho Villa\\", (St. Martin's Press, 1982) a novel by Clifford Irving.

In December 2012, Greenwood School District administration reported that 124 pupils or 15.7% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 51.6% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2010, Greenwood School District administration reported that 118 pupils or 14% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 56% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 134 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Greenwood School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The district has provided full day kindergarten since 2009. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who believe their child is eligible for services may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Coordinator. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The State requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Greenwood School District received a $423,236 supplement for special education services in 2010. In 2011-12 and 2012‚Äì13, the state provided the same allocation. In 2011-12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 all Pennsylvania School Districts received the same level of funding they received in 2010-11, for special education each year. *2014-15 school year, Greenwood School District received an increase to $432,780 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 *2015-16 school year, GSD received $447,661 in special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2015‚Äì16, July 2015 *2016-17 school year, Greenwood School District received a 2.3% increase in state special education funding to $457,996.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016‚Äì17, July 2016  Gifted education  The District Administration reported that less than 10 of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.  Wellness policy  Greenwood School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Greenwood School District offers a free school breakfast and lunch to low-income children. The program is funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture and local tax dollars.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs ‚Äì Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 To comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013‚Äì14 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Greenwood School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation.  Highmark Healthy High 5 grant  In 2011, Greenwood School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Greenwood High School received $9,460 which was used to purchase cardio equipment for integration into the Physical Education curriculum for all students in grades 7-12.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 In 2009, Greenwood Elementary School received a grant of $8,784 to purchase Cay Eye Gamepad Pro Plus dance system. Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools.  Safety and Bullying policy  The Greenwood School District administration reported there was one incident of bullying in the District in 2015. Additionally, there were two assaults on students and one case of harassment and two sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in zero incidents at the schools. In 2009, Greenwood School District administrative reported there was 1 incident of bullying in the district. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.  Budget  Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days' public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 Each year the school board has the option to exceed the Act 1 index limit and go to the voters for approval of the higher tax increase.

Testimony was given regarding state funding at the fastest growing districts and those with the greatest decline in enrollment since 1996. Area School District was identified as a district with a large decline in enrollment. The Commission developed a new basic education funding formula which sets a new way to distribute state basic education dollars. It abolished the practice of \\"hold harmless\\" funding, which gave districts at least the same as they got the previous school year regardless of declining enrollment. The plan became law in June 2016 (House Bill 1552).Basic Education Funding Commission, Commission minutes, 2016York Dispatch, Governor Wolf Signs Fair Funding Formula, June 2016 For the 2017-18 school year, Greenwood School District received $3,488,260 in Basic Education Funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.

The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.

Among the 500 districts in the Commonwealth, the highest property tax relief was given to Chester Upland School District at $632 in 2010 and in 2009.Tax Relief per Homestead, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report, May 1, 2010 Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Greenwood School District residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently, people with income substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate.  Enrollment  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, there are fewer than 840 students enrolled in K-12 in the Greenwood School District. There were 59 students in the Class of 2009. The senior class of 2010 has 61 students. Enrollment in Greenwood School District is projected to continue to remain low for the foreseeable future. The administrative infrastructure costs per pupil are high. With limited local taxation resources, opportunities for students are limited. Consolidation of the administrations with adjacent school districts would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in each community. These excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging mathematics and science achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to substantially reduce property taxes. Consolidation of the central administrations would not require the closing of any schools.Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments and Projections G-O A new district composed of Greenwood School District and Newport School District would have a student population of 2000 with stable enrollment projected for the next two decades. Through 2020, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania.

Greenwood School District currently has an athletic partnership with Newport High School for football, track, soccer, and wrestling. Greenwood School District provides a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports. The school board has policies that establish eligibility for participation. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks.

White (March 26, 1936July 13, 1981) was an American poet, editor and teacher. Biography Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, White attended Indiana University and Colorado State University where he attained an MA in Literary Criticism. White taught as a poet in the schools on the Navajo Nation and in Minnesota public schools as part of a pilot program by COMPAS. He also taught with Allen Ginsberg at Naropa University's Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics. While teaching, White edited the poetry collections Time of the Indian (1976), which featured the poetry of Indian schoolchildren, and First Skin Around Me (1976), which featured the work of contemporary Indian writers including Joy Harjo and Duane Niatum. His own books of poetry include the book The Salt Ecstasies, published in 1982 after his death by Graywolf Press. White died of cardiovascular disease on July 13, 1981, at the age of 45. Legacy  Influence  White had an influence on many writers as a mentor and friend. In her book Wild Mind, the author Natalie Goldberg credits White with giving her \\"permission\\" to be a poet. Others were influenced by the content of White's poetry. Mark Doty credits White as an early influence on his work and has written poetry in his honor. The poet Carl Phillips has written that White's The Salt Ecstasies was the first book he read that \\"spoke with disarming honesty about gay desire, desire generally, sex specifically.\\" He credits White's book as a \\"crucial voice\\" he encountered as he began as a poet. Poet Brian Teare has cited White as a major influence, revealing that he made a \\"pilgrimage\\" to White's Indianapolis grave while in graduate school.  James White Review  Soon after White's death a literary quarterly of gay men's writing was inaugurated under the name James White Review. Each issue contained poetry, prose, photography and other artwork and later issues contained book reviews. It was first published in Minneapolis in 1983, then publication moved to Washington, D.C. in 1998, and continued until 2005 when the Lambda Literary Foundation, its second publisher, stopped publication. The White Crane Institute is the current holder of the archives of the review and is considering options for future issues of the review.  James White Poetry Prize  In the spring of 2008, the White Crane Institute and Phil Willkie announced the establishment of a biennial gay men's poetry prize in honor of White, who was openly gay. The White Crane/James White Poetry Prize is a manuscript prize honoring \\"excellence in Gay Male Poetry.\\" The judge for the inaugural year of the prize was the poet Mark Doty.

It is located near Negenborn and Stadtoldendorf, in the Landkreis of Holzminden in the Weserbergland. It was the second oldest Cistercian foundation in Lower Saxony, Germany, after Walkenried Abbey. It survived the Reformation by becoming Lutheran, and with Loccum Abbey, also previously Cistercian, is one of the only two Lutheran monasteries in Germany with an uninterrupted tradition. The abbey church, St. Mary's, is also the parish church of the abbey's former estate villages Negenborn and Holenberg. Foundation The site of the villa Amelungsbornmeaning \\"the spring of Amelung\\", after a spring still visible today to the west of the present Stadtoldendorf was originally part of the ancestral lands of the Counts of Northeim.Heutger, N.C., Das Kloster Amelungsborn im Spiegel der zisterziensischen Ordensgeschichte, Hildesheim 1968, p.13. Siegfried IV, the last Count of Northeim-Boyneburg and HomburgGro√üe Baudenkm√§ler Heft 338 Kloster Amelungsborn, Verlag DONAU Druck 5. Auflage 1998, p. 2 gave the land at Amelungsborn for the foundation of a Cistercian monastery, which was officially settled by a community of monks from Altenkamp AbbeyAltenkamp or Kamp Abbey, also the mother house of the nearby Walkenried Abbey and Michaelstein Abbey near Blankenburg, was the earliest Cistercian settlement in the entire region, a daughter house of Morimond and a granddaughter of C√Æteaux, the Cistercian motherhouse founded in 1098 on 20 November 1135. With the establishment of this monastery and of the nearby Burg Homburg, built at around the same time, it seems that Count Siegfried was aiming to secure a part of his possessions that lay distant from his ancestral seat in North Hessen.Stadtoldendorf und seine Beziehungen zum Kloster Amelungsborn http://www.kloster-amelungsborn.de/vortrag_partisch.htm am 30 August 2006 No foundation charter has survived, although there is a confirmation dated 5 December 1129 by Pope Honorius II.the authenticity of the document is disputed Nevertheless, an interval of six years between foundation and settlement fits the general timescale of Cistercian foundations. The abbey was dedicated in 1135 by Bernhard I, Bishop of Hildesheim. The first abbot of Amelungsborn, appointed in 1141, was Heinrich I, a half-brother of the founder, Count Siegfried IV. Development and daughter houses The new monastery prospered and was soon able to extend the settlements of the order. As early as 1138 a monk of Amelungsborn was appointed abbot of Mariental Abbey near Helmstedt. In 1145 Amelungsborn provided the entire community (12 monks and an abbot) for the foundation of Riddagshausen Abbey near Braunschweig, of which it was thus the mother house.Riddagshausen is notable for the network of ponds constructed by the monks for the raising of fish, a landscape that is now a protected nature reserve, in which 11 of the original 28 ponds survive Amelungsborn was also the mother house of the rich and powerful Doberan Abbey (in the present Bad Doberan near Rostock), in 1171 and again in 1176, at the instigation of the missionary bishop Berno, once a monk of Amelungsborn, who in 1155 became Bishop of Mecklenburg and when in 1160 the seat of the bishopric was moved, the first Bishop of Schwerin. Further foundations at one remove were at Isenhagen-Marienrode near Wittingen and Wahlshausen near Fuldatal, daughter houses of Riddagshausen, and Dargun Abbey and Pelplin Abbey, daughter houses of Doberan. Amelungsborn became the richest monastery of the Welf sphere of influence, and the one most closely connected with the German colonisation to the east. By about 1280 the community numbered 50 monks and 90 lay-brothers. Even after the alienation of their Mecklenburg estates, principally round Satow and Dranse, in the 14th century, Amelungsborn Abbey remained an extensive landowner, thanks largely to the generosity of the Edelherren of Homburg, successors of the founder, and the Counts of Everstein, who gave many estates between the Weser and Leine, among them lands at Allersheim near Holzminden, Schnedinghausen near Moringen, Erzhausen, Bruchhof and Holtershausen near Greene, besides possessions in the towns of Einbeck, H√∂xter and Hameln, and forests near the abbey itself. After the Reformation During the first half of the 16th century Amelungsborn fell increasingly into the power of the Welf territorial princes. In 1549 the abbey was forced to cede the lucrative farm at Allersheim to Duke Henry the Younger of Brunswick. In 1568 Duke Julius of Brunswick implemented the Reformation in his realm, and the abbot and community converted to Lutheranism. The first Lutheran abbot was Andreas Steinhauer (d. 1588), who founded the school for which the abbey was from this point on principally known. In 1760 the abbey school was transferred to Holzminden by Duke Charles I of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and merged with the town school, the predecessor of the present Campe Gymnasium. Under the rule of Napoleon in 1806 Amelungsborn Abbey was dissolved, but by an anomaly the position of abbot remained. When in 1875 the school was taken over by the state and the educational duties of the abbey ended, the office of abbot remained as an honorary title for members of the senior Brunswick clergy From 1912 the position was left vacant for political reasons. In 1941 the church was transferred to the Hanover State Church (Landeskirche Hannover). The church senate assumed the rights of the previous territorial lords and took over responsibility for the abbey. World War II In World War II the buildings were severely damaged, including the outer ring wall, on 8 April 1945, when the premises were heavily bombed by American troops in pursuit of fleeing SS units. The church sustained particularly heavy damage, and the south side of the nave and the east window of 1350 were totally destroyed.Gedenktafel zum 6.

Revival In 1960 Christhard Mahrenholz was appointed 54th abbot, assembled a community and founded a society of laymen, Familiaritas.

Life He was a descent of Edmund Plowden, and was raised in a Catholic family. Educated at the College of St Omer, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1759, and was ordained priest at Rome, in 1770.Burton, Edwin. \\"Charles Plowden.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 January 2019 At the suppression of the Society, in 1773, he was minister of the College of Bruges. The Austro-Belgic government, in its execution of the decree of suppression, kept him imprisoned for some months after the closing of the college. He wrote an account of its destruction. After his release from confinement, he was for a time at the College of Li√®ge, which the prince-bishop of Li√®ge had offered to the English ex-Jesuits. Returning to England, he became a tutor in the family of Mr. Weld, and chaplain at Lulworth Castle, where he assisted at the consecration of Bishop Carroll, in 1790. He preached the sermon on the occasion, and published an account of the establishment of the new See of Baltimore. Father Plowden had a large share in the direction of Stonyhurst College, founded in 1794. After the restoration of the Society of England, he was the first master of novices, at Hodder. In 1817, he was appointed Provincial, and at the same time, Rector of Stonyhurst, holding the later office till 1819. Summoned to Rome for the XXth General Congregation (1820) and election of the Superior General of the Jesuits, he died suddenly in Jougne (France), on his journey homeward, and, through mistaken information to his mission and identity, he was buried with full military honours. His attendant had gathered the information that he had been at Rome in connection with business concerning a \\"general\\", and the town authorities, mixing things, concluded that he was a general of the British army, hence the military funeral. Works In addition to his many administrative activities and occupations, Plowden was a prolific writer. He was protagonist in the Catholic polemics ahead of the eventual Catholic Relief Bill. Sommervogel gives a list of twenty-two publications of which he was the author, besides several works in manuscript which have been preserved. He was a lifelong correspondent of Bishop Carroll and wrote a eulogy on the death of his friend in 1815. A large collection of the letters which the interchanged, originals or copies, exists at Stonyhurst and Georgetown College, as also in the Baltimore diocesan archives.

Special education In December 2015, the district administration reported that 219 pupils or 20.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 50.7% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, Newport School District administration reported that 223 students received special education services with 52% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2010, the district Administration reported that 238 pupils or 20% of the district's pupils received Special Education services with 55% of identified students having specific learning disabilities. In 2009, Newport School District Administration reported that 236 pupils or 20% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Newport School District has provided full day kindergarten since 2008. The district has seen no decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Newport School District received a $833,205 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, 2012‚Äì2013 school year and the 2013‚Äì2014 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì2011. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. *2014‚Äì2015 school year, Newport School District received an increase to $852,773 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 *2015‚Äì2016 - $882,341 *2016‚Äì2017 - Newport School District received a 2.2% increase in state special education funding to $901,593.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016-17, July 2016 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. Gifted education The Newport School District Administration reported that 19 or 1.61% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. School safety and bullying The Newport School District administration reported there was one incident of bullying in the district in 2012. Additionally, there were 10 assaults on students and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in eight incidents at the schools, with four arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Newport School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Safe School grant In 2013, Newport School District did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds must be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. The district also did not participate in the state's School Resource Officer and Police Officer grants. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2016, the average teacher salary in Newport School District was $59,532 a year.

The designated fund balance was reported as zero. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 By 2013, reserves held by Pennsylvania public school districts, as a whole, had increased to over $3.8 billion. In 2014, Newport School Board reported having $4,342,978 in reserves. Newport School District's annual budget was $16 million (2009‚Äì2010). In mid-2009, it was revealed that the district had a $1.1 million shortfall. The Board projected a $1.2 million deficit by the end of the 2009‚Äì2010 school year. For the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Newport School Board projected a substantial property tax increase to fund a $16.1 million budget.

The cuts are effective for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year. ;Superintendent Buyout Dr. Kerry W. Helm, Superintendent since 2006, resigned in December 2009, under board pressure due to taxpayer anger over the financial mismanagement. He negotiated a severance package that included: cash payments of $100,000 in two installments: $80,000 to be paid in January and $20,000 to be paid by Oct. 1, 2010. The district also agreed to make $981.63 in COBRA health insurance payments through June 2010. Helm had recently signed a new three-year contract in February 2009. Per that contract, the district would have needed to spend in excess $258,000 to buy him out of the $99,302 annual superintendent position.Casey, Thom, Newport board accepts Helm‚Äôs resignation, Perry County Times. December 30, 2009. Audit In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board.

Tuition Students who live in the Newport School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Newport School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Newport School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School -$8,029.56, Junior Senior High School - $7,705.36. Newport School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 1.1%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, per capita taxes $5, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. According to the Pennsylvania State Education Association, the average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year, plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. State basic education funding According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Newport School District receives 50.7% of its annual revenue from the state. In December 2014, the Pennsylvania Education Funding Reform Commission conducted a hearing. The commission developed a new basic education funding formula which sets a new way to distribute state basic education dollars. It abolished the practice of \\"hold harmless\\" funding, which gave districts at least the same as they got the previous school year regardless of declining enrollment. The plan became law in June 2016 (House Bill 1552).Basic Education Funding Commission, Commission minutes, 2016York Dispatch, Governor Wolf Signs Fair Funding Formula, June 2016 For the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, Newport School District received $5,864,313 in Basic Education Funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

He reported that at nearly 60 percent of SIG schools, more students are demonstrating proficiency in reading and math. Nearly a quarter of those schools reported math improvement in the double digits, and close to 20 percent of schools saw double-digit gains in reading.US Department of Education, Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan remarks - ‚ÄúWorking in the Nation‚Äôs Lowest-Performing Schools: A Progress Report‚Äù, MARCH 19, 2012 In 2012, the Newport High School was eligible for School Improvement grant funding due to ongoing low student achievement. In the summer of 2011, the district administration did not apply for School Improvement Grant funding, from the federal government (over $9.9 million available). Both Newport High School and Newport Middle School were eligible for funding. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. Transformation calls for a change in faculty and administration evaluations, mandated training in proven teaching techniques and rigorous curriculum change that focuses on student achievement. The Pennsylvania Education Secretary awarded $66 Million to reform Pennsylvania's lowest-achieving schools For 2010‚Äì2011, Newport School District did not apply for a School Improvement Grant. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the high school and middle school. In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal department of education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest-achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day. =Race to the Top grant= Newport School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands in additional federal dollars for committing to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Governor's Office Press Release January 20, 2010 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. The district employs three full-time technology personnel who service four fully equipped computer labs at the high school, two at the elementary school and five mobile wireless labs (Classrooms for the Future). In addition every classroom has at least one computer and many are equipped with Smartboards. The middle/high school library operates a mobile wireless lab of laptops for student use. Wireless internet access is available throughout the district. Both buildings in the district are monitored by digital surveillance equipment. =Title II grants= The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds. In 2012‚Äì2013, Newport School District received $76,319 in federal Title II funding.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2012-13, 2012 In 2014‚Äì2015, Newport School District applied for and received $72,825.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2014-15, 2014 =English language learners grant= The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at home. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.PDE, English As A Second Language (ESL), 2015 In 2012‚Äì2013 - Newport School District received $815 in Title III funding for English language learners. For 2014‚Äì2015, Newport School District received no Title III funding.PDE, Title III Grant Allocations 2014-15, 2014 Real estate taxes The Newport School Board property tax rates for school year 2016‚Äì2017 were raised by the school board to 14.1831 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, nonprofit hospitals, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Act 511 Tax Report, 2004 *2015‚Äì2016 - 13.9050 millsPDE, Real Estate Taxes by LEA, 2015 *2014‚Äì2015 - 13.9050 mills. *2013‚Äì2014 - 13.9050 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, May 2013 *2012‚Äì2013 - 13.7670 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, May 2012 *2011‚Äì2012 - 13.7670 mills *2010‚Äì2011 - 17.6270 mills *2009‚Äì2010 - 14.2270 mills *2008‚Äì2009 - 14.2270 mills *2007‚Äì2008 - 13.1600 mills *2006‚Äì2007 - 12.1600 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005‚Äì2006 - 11.1600 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Perry County residents amounts to about 3.11% of their yearly income.

Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employee pension fund) taking into account the PSERS contribution rate.

The amount received by the district must be divided equally among all approved residences. In 2012, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling, for the Newport School District, was $193 per approved permanent primary residence. The amount of property tax relief each school district receives is announced by the PDE in May each year. It is dependent on the amount of tax revenue collected on the casino slots in the previous year. In 2010, the tax relief was $194. In Newport School District, 2129 property owners applied for the tax relief.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Tax Relief per homestead May 1, 2010, accessed May 18, 2010 In 2009, the district's property tax relief was set at $194 for 2,174 approved homesteads. This was the highest tax relief to homestead owners residing in Perry County in 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least contiguous and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The highest property tax relief in Pennsylvania was given to residents in Chester Upland School District in Delaware County, at $632 in 2009 and 2010. In Perry County, 88.04% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. This was among the highest participation rates in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Auditor General Office, Special Report Pennsylvania Property Tax Relief, 2-23-2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Gambling Property Tax Relief. In 2012, the Pennsylvania Secretary of the Treasury reported issuing more than half a million property tax rebates totaling $238 million.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery. In 2012, these property tax rebates were increased by an additional 50 percent for senior households in the state, so long as those households have incomes under $30,000 and pay more than 15% of their income in property taxes.Pennsylvania Department of Revenue., Property Tax/Rent Rebate Program, June 2012 Enrollment In 2012, Newport School District enrollment declined to 1,175 preschool plus K-12. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, there are fewer than 1200 students enrolled in the district in K-12. There were 97 students in the Class of 2009. The senior class of 2010 has 68 students. Enrollment in Newport School District is projected to continue to remain below 1150 through 2019. With limited local taxation resources, opportunities for students are limited. Consolidation of the administrations with adjacent school districts would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in each community. These excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging mathematics and science achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to substantially reduce property taxes. Consolidation of the central administrations would not require the closing of any schools.PDE, Pennsylvania Public School Enrollments and Projections G-O 2008-09, 2010 A new district composed of Greenwood School District and Newport School District would have a student population of 2000 with stable enrollment projected for the next two decades. Newport School District has an athletic partnership with the Greenwood High School for football, track, soccer, and wrestling. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. The district is one of the 500 public school districts of Pennsylvania in 2013. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost- effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts.

A six thousand gallon cistern collects gray water to operate toilet facilities on all three floors of the building. The building features 21st century classrooms wired for technology, an auxiliary gymnasium and a new main gymnasium which seats approximately 1,500, a state of the art auditorium which seats 800, and state of the art technology education, agricultural education, and technology labs. The building is fully accessible to handicapped students and patrons. Wellness policy Newport School Board established a district-wide Wellness Policy in 2006. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Newport School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Newport School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The initial cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. ;eTools grant The district participated in Highmark Foundation's Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools grant which enabled mobile data collection of pertinent health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. Extracurriculars Newport Schools offer a full range of extracurricular activities, including: band and orchestra, chorus, and a wide variety of clubs and organizations. Newport students have represented the district at all levels of competition in both academic and extracurricular pursuits. Eligibility for participation is determined by the school board. The district reported spending $413,000 to provide extracurriculars in 2013‚Äì2014.Newport School District Administration Report to PDE - New POrt School District budget, June 2014 Newport School Board entered into a three- year contract with Central Pennsylvania Rehabilitation Services to provide an athletic trainer at practices and home games. The contract is for 25 hours a week for 40 weeks at $18,500 a year. Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Newport School District, Newport School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 The athletic stadium is named after George Katchmer who coached the school to its only undefeated season in 1953. There is a Buffalo pattern made from rocks displayed proudly behind the field. According to Pennsylvania's Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

Father Thomas Plowden, SJ (1594 - 13 February 1664) was an English Jesuit to whom has been traditionally attributed an important translation under the name Thomas Salusbury. Life Thomas Plowden was born in Oxfordshire, the third son of Francis Plowden of Shiplake Court (Oxfordshire) and Wokefield Park (Berkshire), and the younger brother of Edmund Plowden (colonial governor). His grandfather, Edmund Plowden, despite openly refusing to abandon his faith, faithfully served Queen Elizabeth I. > \\"In 1617 Thomas Plowden of Shiplake became a Jesuit. He was a grandson of > the Elizabethan lawyer Edmund Plowden.\\"The Jacobean Period Father Plowden was sent on the English Mission about 1622. He was seized, with other priests, by pursuivants in 1628 at Clerkenwell, the London residence of the Jesuits, where h filled various offices of the order, despite the perils of the Mission in London until his death there. Translation As was the case with his contemporary Fr Nathaniel Bacon (SJ), English Jesuits, given their illegal status as recusants, often published under assumed names. Father Plowden presented his translations under the name of the distinguished Welsh Salusbury family.Thomas Salusbury had been executed in 1586 in the Babington Plot Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle (1601) is dedicated to John Salusbury, also the name of a Welsh Jesuit priest during the Jacobean era. During the Civil War Sir Thomas Salusbury, 2nd Baronet was MP from Denbigh. Under such a name, as resonant as his own among the Catholic gentry, Fr. Plowden translated from the Italian of Daniello Bartoli The Learned Man Defended and Reformed (London, 1660). With letters of dedication to George Monk and William Prynne, Plowden offers a Jesuit literary contribution to the Restoration by making Bartoli's \\"happy pen\\" speak English too. The celebrated L'huomo di lettere originally appeared in Rome (1645). It had become a Baroque bestseller through dozens of editions in Italian and translations by the time Fr. Plowden presented it under the name of Salusbury at the press of the mathematician and surveyor William Leybourn and sold by the well known bookseller and publisher Thomas Dring \\"near St. Dunstan's Church\\" on Fleet Street in 1660. If the attribution of this translation to Plowden is correct, then the appearance of the following work in the next year and with the same printer bears close examination. Most now attribute it to the real \\"Thomas Salusbury, Esq.\\", younger brother of Sir John Salusbury, 3rd Baronet. This is the Mathematical Collections with translations of Galileo, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632) and works of Kepler, Castelli, Tartaglia and other European authors significant for the scientific culture of the Restoration whose diffusion it was Leybourn's purpose to promote. It is dedicated to Sir John Denham, a poet and the predecessor of Sir Christopher Wren as Surveyor of the King's Works and a member of the newly founded Royal Society. The introduction promises to follow up with a life of Galileo, recently identified, also the work of the same Thomas Salusbury.

Michael M√ºller C.Ss.R. (1825‚Äì1899) was a prolific Catholic writer of the 19th century in the United States. Life M√ºller (\\"Mueller\\" in English spelling) was born on December 18, 1825, in the village Br√ºck in the German Eifel region. He joined the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer and was under the spiritual direction of Joseph Passerat. In 1851, Frater Mueller was one of eleven clerics and priests chosen by the American Redemptorist Provincial to be sent to the United States. He completed his theological studies in Cumberland, Maryland, and was ordained on March 26, 1853, by the Redemptorist Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint John Nepomucene Neumann. In 1862, Mueller became pastor of the Redemptorist parish of Sts. Peter and Paul in Cumberland, Maryland, where he remained until 1866. During his tenure, the professed students were relocated from Cumberland to Annapolis. Stanton, Thomas J., A Century of Growth: or, the history of the Church in Western Maryland, Vol. 1, John Murphy Co., 1900, p. 58 He was appointed Superior and Novice Master at the Congregation‚Äôs foundation in Annapolis, Maryland. In subsequent years, he served the Redemptorist communities of America in a variety of capacities, including Consultor to the Provincial. M√ºller was a prolific writer. Of his Golden Rules for Directing Religious Communities..., a review in The American Catholic Quarterly stated, \\"... Whilst primarily intended for the superiors of Religious Houses, it will, we're sure, be appreciated by, and prove most valuable to all in authority.\\"The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Volume 17, (James Andrew Corcoran, Patrick John Ryan, Edmond Francis Prendergast, ed.), Hardy and Mahony, 1892, p. 669 Regarding salvation for those outside the Catholic Church, Fr. M√ºller wrote: \\"The Church, therefore, is not one religious body among many; it is the only religious body, inherent in the divine order of creation...The lesson, therefore, on the Church must be plain, and solid, and deeply impressed upon all who wish to be saved; all must learn and understand that only the Catholic Church is the Teacher from God, and the reasons why salvation out of her is impossible. He wrote on the concept of invincible or inculpable ignorance: \\"...inculpable ignorance of the fundamental principles of faith excuses a heathen from the sin of infidelity, and a Protestant from the sin of heresy; because such invincible ignorance, being only a simple involuntary privation, is no sin.\\" \\"But such ignorance has never been the means if salvation. From the fact that a person who lives up to the dictates of his conscience, and who cannot sin against the true religion on account of being ignorant of it, many have drawn the false conclusion that such a person is saved, or, in other words, is in the state of sanctifying grace, thus making ignorance a means of salvation or justification. \\"Inculpable ignorance has never been a means of grace or salvation, not even for the inculpably ignorant people that live up to their conscience. But of this class of ignorant persons we say, with Saint Thomas Aquinas, that God in His mercy will lead these souls to the knowledge of the necessary truths of salvation, even send them an angel, if necessary, to instruct them, rather than let them perish without their fault. If they accept this grace, they will be saved as Catholics.M√ºller, Michael. Invincible or Inculpable Ignorance Neither Saves nor Damns a Person, Questions and Answers on Salvation by Rev.

He was a charter member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM), Black Arts Music Society, Improvisational Arts band, and was a founding faculty member of the Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp. Early life Fielder was born in Meridian, Mississippi on November 23, 1935. His mother played the violin and piano; his father, Alvin Sr, played the cornet and was a pharmacist by profession. Alvin Jr's brother, William Butler Fielder, became a trumpeter and was professor of jazz studies at Rutgers University. Fielder initially learned the piano as a young child, but stopped and did not regain an interest in music until, at the age 12, he heard drummer Max Roach on record. He had drum lessons from Ed Blackwell while studying pharmacology at Xavier University of Louisiana, and then continued his degree at Texas Southern University while maintaining his musical development by taking lessons with local drummers and performing at night. Fielder completed his pharmacology studies with a master's degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Later life and career In Chicago, Fielder played with Sun Ra during 1959 and 1960. Encouraged by fellow musicians Muhal Richard Abrams and Beaver Harris, Fielder became more experimental in his playing, and went on to be a charter member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). The AACM's first released recording, Roscoe Mitchell's Sound, featured Fielder. In the mid- to late 1960s, he played in his own trio with Fred Anderson and bassist/cellist Lester Lashley, and worked part-time as a pharmacist. In 1969, he returned home to Mississippi. Fielder took responsibility for managing the family business, became involved in political activism, and continued to pursue his passion for music. In 1971 he met John Reese and helped develop the Black Arts Music Society (BAMS). Fielder was instrumental in bringing many AACM and other musicians to Mississippi. In 1975, Fielder began working with Kidd Jordan in what became the Improvisational Arts band, which featured various musicians over three decades, and appeared at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival every year from 1975 to 2008. In 1995, he participated as a founding faculty member in the Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong Summer Jazz Camp. He recorded in 1987 with Ahmed Abdullah, Charles Brackeen, and Dennis Gonzalez, and continued exploring in the free jazz vein in the 1990s with Joel Futterman, Kidd Jordan, and others. He toured with Andrew Lamb in 2002. In 2012, Fielder was awarded the Resounding Vision Award by Nameless Sound in Houston. He died, of complications from congestive heart failure and pneumonia, in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 5, 2019.

Ausgabe 1993 is a 25 km long and up to 3 km wide ice-free plateau with more than 100 freshwater lakes. It is situated in the Schirmacher Hills on the Princess Astrid Coast in Queen Maud Land in East Antarctica, and is on average 100 metres above sea level. With an area of 34 km¬≤, the Schirmacher Oasis ranks among the smallest Antarctic oases and is a typical polar desert. Geography The oasis is located between the edge of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Novolazarevskaya Nivl Ice Shelf. The approximately 100 m high plateau of the Schirmacher Oasis is a barrier to the northwards running ice stream. On the northern edge of the oasis are so-called epishelf lakes, bays separated from the ocean, which are connected with the ocean underneath the surface of the ice. Thus, tidal effects can be observed in the lakes. The epishelf lakes can contain either mere freshwater or saltwater which is overlaid by freshwater. The Antarctic Ice Sheet, southwards of the Schirmacher Oasis, reaches heights of 1500 m. The nunataks Skaly Instituta Geologii Arktiki (Skaly IGA) and Basisny-Kit protrude from the ice sheet. Between the offshore ice sheet and the Wegener Ice Sheet Plateau are the Wohlthat Mountains. The highest part of the Schirmacher Oasis is Mount Rebristaya with a height of 228 m. With its 34.5 m Lake Glubokoye is the deepest inland lake of the oasis. Spatially the largest lake within the oasis is Lake Sub with 0.5 km¬≤. A number of theories exist about the formation of the oasis that include geothermal heating, intense insolation, or the hypothesis that the ice flow is blocked by a geological feature such as a mountain. Climate The climate of the Schirmacher Oasis is relatively mild for Antarctic conditions. The annual average temperature is (summer, to winter ),Handbook of Antarctic Climate the annual average wind speed is 9.7 m/s, the annual average precipitation is 264.5 mm, and there are 350 hours of sunshine per month. Because of the positive radiation balance, the Schirmacher Oasis is regionally classified as a \\"coastal climate zone\\".Richter, W., Bormann, P. : Weather and climate. The Schirmacher Oasis, Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica, and its Surroundings. Gotha 1995. Flora and fauna The rocky soil at the Oasis allows growth only for a limited amount of undemanding plants like mosses and lichens. Animals are also rare at the Oasis. Exceptions are the Antarctic skua, the Antarctic petrel, the snow petrel, and the Wilson's storm petrel. Occasionally, Ad√©lie penguins can be seen at the oasis. History At the beginning of 1939 Germany launched an expedition under the command of captain Alfred Ritscher to explore an uncharted area of the Antarctic. They surveyed an area between latitudes 69¬∞10‚Äô S and 76¬∞30‚Äô S and longitudes 11¬∞30 W and 20¬∞00‚Äô E, totaling 600 000 km¬≤ and called it Neuschwabenland, or New Swabia. The area was surveyed by two Dornier hydroplanes, Boreas and Passat. One was piloted by Richardheinrich Schirmacher, who, on 3 February 1939, spotted both the oasis and the lake at its centre. Schirmacher named both after himself. Novolazarevskaya Station On March 10, 1959, the Soviet Union set up the research station Lazarev on the shelf ice in the region of the Schirmacher Oasis. The station was reinstalled in 1961 into the Oasis and was named Novolazarevskaya. In summer, up to 70 crew members reside at the station. In winter, on average 30 scientists and technicians work at the Novolazarevskaya Station. Research in natural sciences includes geodesy, glaciology, limnology, geomagnetism, geology, biology, meteorology, seismology, and other areas of expertise. On 20 December 2007 the Russian Bath was built near the station. It is the only glued timber building in Antarctica. Georg Forster Station On April 21, 1976, approximately two kilometres from the Russian station Novolazarevskaya and about 120 m ASL, the first German research station, the Georg Forster Station, was launched in Antarctica. In 1987, the station, which was run by the GDR, was named after the German naturalist Georg Forster. During its 17 years of existence, more than 100 scientists had worked at the station. In particular, their ozone measurements gained international recognition. The station withdrew service in February 1993, and by 1996 the entire station had been dismantled and disposed of. After the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc, parts of the Schirmacher Oasis counted among the heaviest polluted regions in Antarctica. Polar explorers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven and from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Saint Petersburg disposed of 1016 tons of scrap metal and refuse from the former GDR polar station and the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station. The site of the former station is marked by a bronze plaque. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 87), following a proposal by Germany to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Maitri Station In 1981, India launched the Indian Antarctic Programme. In 1983, the Dakshin Gangotri Station was set up on the shelf ice, about 90 km from the Schirmacher Oasis, but was decommissioned in 1989 due to excessive snow accumulation. In 1988, the Maitri Station was installed in the Schirmacher Oasis, approximately 5 km from Novolazarevskaya. Maitri is equipped with a meteorological station, as well as a geomagnetic and seismological observatory, and accommodates up to 26 scientists and technicians.

An area of is the Castle Hill, Newhaven Local Nature Reserve Geology Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs provides the best and most extensive exposure of an important chronological fossil site in England. The gentle folding and the ease of access to the cliff exposures make this an important collecting site for faunas of the upper Santonian and lower Campanian. It is an increasingly important reference section for the Upper Cretaceous. Black Rock is a key for the study of Quaternary Stratigraphy and has attracted scientific interest for over 150 years. The modern sea cliff at Black Rock obliquely intersects a fossil cliff and abrasion platform cut in the Upper Chalk. The platform is overlain by raised beach deposits of sand and shingle which contain shell fragments which amongst other methods have given the beach and cliff a general date from the second half of the last (Ipswichian) interglacial. The angle between the beach and the old cliff is filled by great quantities of coarse chalk rubble apparently derived from the weathering and erosion of the cliff in Devensian times. Chalk muds and fine chalk gravel and grit, are banked against the rubble on the west and may represent fan deposits. The muds contain appreciable quantities of loess and are overlain by further, coarser solifluction deposits. The chalk rubble and solifluction deposits are particularly notable for their fossil remains of many Devensian mammals, including Elephas primigenius, Tichorhinus antiquitatus and Equus caballus. The landforms, stratigraphy and mammal remains at Black Rock provide an extremely valuable record of former sea levels and changing environmental conditions during the last few glaciations which have affected this area, Southern England, unlike much of the rest of the UK has not been affected by full scale glaciation. An area of the cliff at Saltdean provides probably the finest example of conjugate normal faults in the Chalk of southern England. This exposure of Upper Chalk lies on the southern flank of the Weald anticline, an upward flexure of the crust and the major geological structure of south-eastern England. The faults run in a north-northeasterly direction, at right angles to the trend of the anticline. These structures were probably formed by stretching of the crust parallel to the axis of the anticline during an episode of crustal compression in the mid Tertiary. The formation of the Wealden Anticline is related to the formation of the Alpine Chain to the South. Along much of the cliffed coast between Brighton and Newhaven (and beyond to Eastbourne), frost involution structures can be seen in the upper meter of the chalk cliff. These involutions appear as repeated 'U' (festoon) shaped structures and date from the Devensisn (last glacial period). Frost heaving broke up the sub-surface sedimentary layers of chalk turning small slabs into a more and more upright orientation towards the surface, to be covered by present day soil. The centre of the 'U' structure is a fill of finer chalk and sands giving a more orange / yellow appearance. These structures have a polygonal surface manifestation which can be revealed by stripping away turf and soil. Slope angle appears to have had an effect on their formation. Where the gradient exceeds 20 degrees solifluction appears to have been a more dominant process preventing their formation. This may link to the patterned ground features of stone nets becoming elongated by gradient resulting in stone stripes as seen in modern periglacial environment and in relic locations such as Dartmoor. Undercliff Walk The Undercliff Walk is a 4.5 km path at the foot of the cliffs from Black Rock, Brighton to Saltdean. When it is open, this seafront route is popular with walkers and cyclists. However, Brighton & Hove City Council has often had to close it after rockfalls by Brighton Marina during the winters of 2000/01 and 2012/13. Netting and other devices have been placed on parts of the cliffs known to be unstable to prevent rocks from falling onto the path.http://www.brighton- hove.gov.uk/content/press-release/undercliff-walk-reopens References External links * Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in East Sussex Category:Geological Conservation Review sites Category:Newhaven, East Sussex Category:Brighton Category:Cliffs of England ","title":"Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs"},{"id":"17656130","text":"Odd Thomas may refer to: *Odd Thomas (character), featured in several novels by Dean Koontz *Odd Thomas (novel), the first of such novels *Odd Thomas (film), a 2013 film based on the Dean Koontz novel of the same name.

It is managed by Butterfly Conservation. History The reserve was originally established to protect the Lewes wave moth (Scopula immorata), now extirpated from Britain. It consists of grassy heath, woodland and scrub lying on sand over Weald Clay. Large parts of the woodland were planted with conifers in the latter part of the 20th century. As well as the main area of heathy grassland and a pond, it contains broad-leaved woodland of oak, birch and hornbeam, much managed as coppice. The reserve is the remnant of the more extensive heathland of Vert Wood and is now managed by Butterfly Conservation. Natural history The reserve supports an outstanding assemblage of moths and a varied butterfly fauna including several nationally scare species. Notable butterflies that may be seen are the small pearl-bordered fritillary, silver-washed fritillary, grizzled skipper and white admiral. Notable moths include the broad-bordered bee hawk-moth, eyed hawk-moth, elephant hawk-moth, pine hawk-moth and cream-spot tiger. The two areas of woodland in the reserve are Lower Vert Wood and Upper Vert Wood. The former is a bluebell wood and the latter has a well-maintained bracken-covered heath at its centre, as well as a large pond. Next to this expanse of water is a small hut owned by Butterfly Conservation, an organisation that saved several local species from extinction at the hands of Victorian butterfly collectors. A book inside the hut is open for people to document what species they have seen. The heath is vital for several reptile species ‚Äì if one is quiet one can see or hear adders slithering about or common lizards basking in the sun. In mammal terms, a family of red foxes has an earth and fallow deer can even be seen from a car as they dart across the road cutting through the trees. The nests of dormice in hibernation are dotted about the place in winter, and grey squirrels live in the trees. There are a lot of woodpigeons. Buzzards fly over the heath preying on the many songbirds that sing in the hedgerows and over the heath (including chiffchaffs) and leaving their distinctive messy grey pellets.

Kelly was once a nurse. He was jailed in Saudi Arabia for making alcohol and transporting a large quantity of Johnnie Walker. Like Yvonne Ridley, he converted to IslamMuslim Converts: Why Do They Choose Extremism? Asharq Alawsat Newspaper (English) after being imprisoned in Saudi Arabia in 2000. He has a daughter who lives with her non-Muslim mother as well as two sons, Osama and Muhammed. In November 2016 he was reported to have blown himself up on the orders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) during the Battle of Mosul (2016‚Äì17). Background Born Terence Edward Kelly in The Liberties, Dublin, he attended Roman Catholic schools there until age 15, when he left to work in pubs. At 23, he moved to London to train as an intensive care nurse and in 1996 took a job in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the King Faisal hospital, attracted by the tax-free salary, living there for 4¬Ω years. He lived for 3¬Ω years \\"downtown in a Saudi villa, not in one of the Western compounds. When I'd hear the call to prayer, I'd open the window and turn up the stereo in opposition to what I saw as an imposition.\\" Although Kelly went to work in Saudi Arabia because the salary was tax free he soon found bigger money in making alcohol, which is a strictly forbidden activity in that country. Kelly was subsequently caught and sent to jail in 2000, where an Afghan introduced him to Islam. Khalid Kelly, as he was later known, left prison a convert. Kelly recalls: \\"I got really good at making drink. I had three stills in my house and then I got arrested one day with five cases of Johnny Walker in the back of my car. I was sent to prison for eight months. I lost everything. It was all confiscated. The prison was 150 people in a dormitory with a mosque at the end. I‚Äôd been inside for four weeks and was at my lowest point when I was given the Koran in English. Someone explained it to me. And then it was very quick. I saw that God was the creator, the provider, the commander, and the legislator for mankind. It was all suddenly very clear. I felt freer than I had ever been ‚Äì even though I was in prison.\\" Kelly also said of this event: \\"It just filled in all the gaps, you know? It was like the answer to everything I'd every wondered about. There was even a Captain Ali there at the prison, and he gave me a Koran. And I'll always remember it because he wrapped it in a piece of newspaper, you know, because he didn't have any wrapping paper. And he was so happy for me. He was nearly crying, the man.\\" He said, \\"'I'm so happy you've come to the truth. It will change your life.' And indeed it did\\", he says. Describing his journey from scepticism to belief, or as he called it ‚Äúfrom darkness to light‚Äù, Kelly said, ‚Äúthe journey started with the illegal production of alcoholic drinks in Saudi Arabia whilst I was working as a nurse at the King Faisal hospital.‚Äù He went on to say: ‚ÄúBefore Islam, I didn‚Äôt know the meaning of love. I used to be like other British young men, drinking and going out, but when I read the Quran in 2000, whilst in jail, I felt a huge surge of compassion and sympathy. I feel now that what led me to Islam was God‚Äôs mercy and sympathy. It‚Äôs something bigger than myself and I can‚Äôt explain it with words.‚Äù In 2002 Kelly was deported to Britain where he allegedly soon began attending sermons by the radical preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad. Upon his return to Britain Kelly got a job working as a nurse at St Thomas's Hospital, London. However, rumours started that he was a supporter of the Taliban and subsequently lost his job. He became a member of the now disbanded hardline Islamic organisation Al- Mujaharoun, and became the leader of it in Ireland. Kelly was a member of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, a British Islamist organisation and a close associate of Sulayman Keeler, Abu Izzadeen. Omar Bakri Muhammed and Abu Hamza al-Masri, Abu Uzair and Anjem Choudary. He was also a member of Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect. In October 2003 Kelly appeared on The Late Late Show on RT√â One with Pat Kenny, alongside Anjem Choudary.Anjem and Khalid Kelly on The Late Late Show Declared fugitive in 2008 In March 2008 it was reported that Khalid Kelly was on the run. After the Danish cartoon controversy and subsequent arrests for having signs which said Kill those who insult the Prophet, Kelly fled the country and began travelling the Muslim world looking for a place to bring his wife and two sons, Osama and the newborn Muhammed.Looking for Osama Living in Pakistan In a newspaper interview in 2009, Khalid was reportedly living in the Swat Valley in Pakistan and was quoted during the interview as ready to travel to Afghanistan to fight against Coalition Forces : \\"Next week, inshallah, I could be in Afghanistan fighting a British soldier.\\"\\"Irishman wants to kill for Islam\\", The Times (UK), 15 November 2009 He returned to Dublin in April 2010, claiming to have been deported from an Eastern European country and to have lost his passport.  Obama threat  In May 2011 Kelly was arrested for threatening to assassinate Barack Obama. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror he said that al-Qaeda was likely to kill Obama on his upcoming trip to Ireland. He reportedly said he would like to do it himself, but was too well known. He stated > Personally I would feel happy if Obama was killed. How could I not feel > happy when a big enemy of Islam is gone? Following the interview, Kelly was arrested by counter-terrorism officers from Ireland's Special Detective Unit, under Irish terrorism legislation and questioned for a period of 3 days. His house in Dublin's north inner city was searched by specialist police. He was later released without charges and put under surveillance. Links to \\"Islamic State\\" Kelly had been linked to and voiced support for the terrorist group, the self-proclaimed \\"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\\", and in June 2015 he was detained and questioned by detectives attached to the Garda Counter-Terrorism International Unit (CTI) from Garda Headquarters' Crime and Security Branch (CSB).

Since 1920 Lenin had become concerned about oppositionist groups within the Communist Party. For example, the Democratic Centralists had been set up in March 1919 and by 1921 Alexander Shlyapnikov had set up the Workers' Opposition. Lenin regarded these as distractions within the party when unity was needed in order to neutralise the major crises of 1921, such as the famines, and Kronstadt Rebellion. Resolution on Party Unity 1921 Factions were also commencing to criticize Lenin's leadership. Consequently, the 10th Party Congress passed a Resolution On Party Unity, a ban on factions to eliminate factionalism within the party in 1921. T.Fiehn, C.Corin Communist Russia under Lenin and Stalin (2005) The resolution stated as follows. * Under the present conditions (apparently, the ongoing Kronstadt rebellion), party unity was more necessary than ever. * The Kronstadt rebellion was being exploited by \\"the bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and whiteguards in all countries of the world\\" in order to \\"secure the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia\\". * Criticism, \\"while absolutely necessary\\", was supposed to be \\"submitted immediately, without any delay\\", that is, without prior deliberation in any faction, \\"for consideration and decision to the leading local and central bodies of the Party.\\" * The \\"deviation towards syndicalism and anarchism\\" was rejected \\"in principle\\", but the central proposals of the Democratic Centralism group were accepted. * All factions were dissolved. The ban on factions after Lenin's death Faction members (such as members of \\"Workers' Truth\\") would be expelled from the Party in December 1923. Big opposition factions (such as Leon Trotsky's 'Left Opposition' and such as oppositionist groups around Nikolai Bukharin and Grigory Zinoviev) again appeared after the civil war ended. These factions were tolerated for several years, leading some modern Marxists to claim that the ban on factions was intended to be temporary.https://www.marxist.com/russia-rev-to-counterrev-part-one.htm When Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled on November 12, 1927, the ban on factions was however used to justify this, and there is no language in the discussion at the 10th Party Congress suggesting that it was intended to be temporary (Protokoly 523-548). A sense of a deficit in democracy was present in calls by Trotsky and The Declaration of 46 in 1923. Historians T. H. Rigby and Sheila Fitzpatrick believe that the autumn purges of 1921 were also connected to the ban on factions. In the process of the purge, every Communist was subpoenaed in front of a purge commission and forced to justify their credentials as a revolutionary; Lenin argued this was necessary as to not cause the direction of the revolution to be deviated from its original aim. Admittedly, the purges were officially not directed against oppositionists, but against careerists and class enemies. Indeed, the Central Committee circular on the purge went as far as to explicitly ban its potential use to repress \\"people with other ideas in the party (such as the Worker's Opposition, for example)\\". While acknowledging this, Fitzpatrick and Rigby nevertheless consider it \\"difficult to believe that no Oppositionists were among the almost 25% of party members judged unworthy\\".Fitzpatrick, The Russian Revolution, p.102 Still, such use of that first purge must have been limited, since no prominent members of the opposition factions were purged, and they never complained of such a thing, while still being outspoken about other forms of mistreatment.Rigby, Communist Party Membership References  External links  * Preliminary Draft Resolution Of The Tenth Congress Of The R.C.P.

It is the home of St. Francis Chapel and is located along Louisiana Highway 420, north of New Roads. History The community was founded in the 1720s by French colonists. It is one of the oldest European/western communities in the Mississippi River Valley. Originally, it was called Le Poste de Pointe Coup√©e (the Pointe Coup√©e Post or Cut Point Post). About 1776, a chemin neuf (new road) was built to connect the Mississippi River with False River. The area has since been known as New Roads and is the basis for naming the town of New Roads.Costello, Brian J. A History of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana. Margaret Media, 2010 The Saint Francis Chapel at the Point Coup√©e settlement was originally completed in 1728. A new church building was constructed in 1760, but built too close to the Mississippi River. Flooding unearthed graves and the church was taken down, and a smaller version was erected using materials from the previous church. This newer structure was dedicated in 1895. The church is known as the fourth- oldest continuously operating Catholic church in Louisiana. St. Francis Chapel is now a mission church of St. Mary's of False River.Costello, Brian J. The Catholic Church in Pointe Coupee: A Faith Journey.Randy DeCuir and Associates, Inc., 1996 The town of St. Francisville, on the opposite (east) side of the Mississippi, is named for the St. Francis Chapel. In 1792, when this area was part of New Spain, the Spanish suppressed the Mina Conspiracy near New Roads and four years later, during the Easter holiday, they suppressed a slave insurrection near Point Coup√©e, which became known as the Pointe Coup√©e Conspiracy That led to 23 heads of decapitated rebels being displayed on the road to New Orleans, and 31 additional slaves were flogged and sent to serve hard labor in other Spanish outposts.

The club plays Gaelic Football at both senior and underage levels. Tir Conaill Harps is the biggest GAA club in Scotland in terms of structure and has a fully integrated youth system fielding teams for all age groups. The club's colours are green and gold. History T√≠r Conaill Harps was formed in 1994 following an amicable break away from the Pearse Harps club by the underage football section, who left to form the club at a meeting in the Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre, in Glasgow's south side. Tir Conaill is the Irish for the land of Connell, an ancient name for the area now mostly known as County Donegal in the northwest of Ireland. This reflects the long tradition of people from there settling in the area. A number of members and players have family links to the county. Tir Conaill Harps is a community based registered charity which provides opportunities for young and old people to play and enjoy the Gaelic and Celtic sports of Gaelic football, hurling, camogie, and ladies' Gaelic football, along with senior, junior, and homegrown men's Gaelic football teams. The club welcomes new members regardless of their ability or age. The club also provides access to a wide range of coaching and personal development opportunities for its members. Mission Statement - To strengthen communities in Glasgow through the provision of Gaelic Sports for young people in an affordable, safe, and fun environment. Home Ground The club is traditionally linked with Glasgow's South side and played their Gaelic Football home games at the GAA owned Pearse Park in Cambuslang. Formally known as East Field. The Park was the first GAA sports field in Glasgow and was made possible by the great efforts of Eoin \\"Owenie\\" Kelly from County Fermanagh. After the park was condemned for health and safety reasons by the GAA the club moved to Nethercraigs Sports Complex, Corkerhill using a Rugby pitch. The club has a strong anti-drugs policy and as a reward for such a Gaelic ground was constructed by Glasgow City Council in Bellahouston Park for the club to play their home matches. However, the poor playing surface had seen the club forced to remain at nearby Nethercraigs. As of 2015 the senior and junior teams now play all their games out at Thornliebank, at Boydstone Road. The club are now in the midst of a redevelopment programme for Pearse Park, and hope to have the club settled back into their original home within the next season or so. The Women's Shinty team play their home games at the Glasgow City Council- owned Peterson Park, in the Glasgow district of Yoker. Senior Gaelic Football Tir Conaill Harps Davitt Shield winning side of 2009 It took seven years from the club's formation for the success of the underage teams to finally come to fruition in the form of senior success. However, in the 2001 season, Tir Conaill Harps won their first major silverware, lifting the League and Championship titles. This was followed by a league win the following year. However, the Harps were unable to match their previous success having to wait a further four years before lifting another trophy when they won the 2006 Michael Davitt Shield. The Harps were to enter another difficult spell ending the 2007 and 2008 season trophyless. The club had been without a manager since early in 2007 and the team was organised by the senior players. Harps recruited management duo and former Mulroy Gaels players, Stephen McFadden as manager and Michael Coyle as assistant manager. The team started the 2009 season brightly under the new management team beating D√∫nedin Connolly in the Michael Davitt Shield Quarter-Final in Portobello. This was the Harps first victory over the Edinburgh side in 7 years. The good form was continued as they defeated the new Aberdeen/Dundee side at Stirling University to book a place in the final. On 30 April 2009, the Harps ended their three-year trophy drought by lifting the Davitt Shield/ They beat city-rivals Glaschu Gaels 1-10 to 1-06 at Coatbridge. Tir Conaill Harps 2012 Senior Championship winning side With new manager Fergal Coffey now in charge of the club, 2012 would go on to become one of the Harps best season's on record, reaching all three major finals. The first being the league final which they lost to Edinburgh side Dunedin Connolly's 0-07 to 0-09. Both sides met again in the Davitt Shield Final. This time however the Harps were victorious, beating Connolly's 1-10 to 0-06. The most important win came though in the championship final. Tir Conaill Harps hadn't reached the final since they last won it back in 2001. The final itself was as entertaining as it comes. With the Harps dominating the game and leading by 11 points early in the second half, thanks to 2 quick goals from the restart, Dunedin Connolly's soon started a comeback. With only a minute left Connolly's edged a point in front. However, with the last play of the game, the ball was kicked into the goal area and Tir Conaill man Barry Russell rose above everyone else to punch the ball into the net and secure the championship for the Harps. Finally, Tir Conaill Harps long wait to bring the championship home was over. Things had been looking bright for the harps, but with the loss of some key players the club failed to build on the success of the previous season. Having reached the league final of 2013 and subsequently been beating by Dunedin Connollys the club would fail to reach another major final for another 6 years. Unable to attract enough quality players to sustain a real challenge at senior level the harps decided to drop down to Junior level for the 2018 season. However, without the fixture of a fulltime manager in place the 2018 season would prove just as fruitless as the years before. TCH 2019 Junior Championship winning side 2019 would see big changes throughout the entirety of the blub though, and with a new board and chairman in place success was to follow. A committee was set up headed by one of Tir Conaill Haprs founding members Tommy Main and a 5 year development plan was put in place to help the club get back to where it belonged. With the help of new club chairman Anton Gallagher procuring a home base for the club in Cambuslang Rugby club the Harps where in great position to finally kick on and bring success back to the club. And so it would prove with the instillation of club legend Adrian O'Duibhir as full time manager, the club won there first piece of silverware in over 7 years after beating Dalriada GFC in the league final to a score of 2-14 to 0-04. The success would continue at they met Dalriada GFC once again in the junior league championship final. Harps defeated their opponents 0-15 to 1-06 to clinch the double and cap of a wonderful season. In turn Tir Conaill Harps would be promoted, fielding teams at both Junior and Intermediate level for the following season. The beginning of the 2020 season would see club manager Adrian O'Duibhir depart for pastures new back home in his native Donegal. This news was soon followed by the unveiling of Dave Kellett and Jimmy Houghton as the new management team for the 2020 season. Tir Conaill Harps Youth's T√≠r Conaill Harps was formed in 1994 following an amicable break away from the Pearse Harps club by the underage football section, who left to form the club at a meeting in the Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre, in Glasgow's south side. Since then the youth teams have went from strength to strength competing and on many occasions winning tournaments held both at home and abroad.

Early life Carman was born near Oak Tree, New Jersey, oldest child of Melancthon F. Carman and Ann Maria Ayers. He was educated at the Kentucky Military Institute and the University of Nashville and became a merchant. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War Carman joined the Army at Newark, New Jersey, and was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 7th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry on September 19, 1861. In that role he was wounded in the right arm during the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862. After recovering, Carman was appointed a colonel on July 8 of that year. At that rank, he organized and led the 13th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry. He led his regiment in the brigade of Brig. Gen. George H. Gordon in Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams's 1st Division of the XII Corps at the Battle of Antietam. Carman next saw action in Brig. Gen. Thomas Ruger's brigade of the 1st division of the XII Corps. He fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. In the latter action, he served on the right flank of the Army of the Potomac, except when Williams led the division, temporarily commanded by Ruger, to the left flank of the army on July 2, 1863. Later that month, Carman led a temporary brigade of three regiments sent to help quell the New York Draft Riots. Carman went West with the XII Corps to the relief of the Army of the Cumberland, besieged at Chattanooga, late in 1863. His regiment was transferred to the newly organized XX Corps under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, serving in the 1st Division under Williams. Carman served in the Atlanta Campaign, seeing action in several battles. He led a brigade of the 1st Division during Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. In this period the XX Corps became a part of Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum's Army of Georgia. After Savannah, Georgia, fell to Sherman's command, Carman was ordered to Nashville on \\"special duty.\\" Whether the failure of XX Corps, especially of Carman's brigade, to prevent William J. Hardee's escape from Savannah led to this transfer is open to question. His advance had been stopped by Confederate cavalry under Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler near Izard's Mill, and Carman had not renewed the attack.Jones, p. 145. Carman was mustered out of volunteer service on March 13, 1865, having received the Brevet rank of brigadier general on March 13 of that year. Post-war After the war, Carman was a civil servant, serving as chief clerk of the United States Department of Agriculture in the years 1877 through 1885. He served as the historical expert for the Board created Antietam National Battlefield and later went on to assume the office of superintendent of Chickamauga- Chattanooga National Battlefield. Carman died in Washington, D.C. He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery.Eicher, p. 692. Carman was survived by his second wife, Ada Salmon Carman (d. 1916) and four of their children. A son by his first marriage and one by his second predeceased him.Arlington National Cemetery Carman's maps appear in Atlas of the battlefield of Antietam, edited by George W. Davis and Charles H. Ourand. Carman also wrote a study of the Maryland Campaign, which was published recently: The Maryland Campaign of September 1862: Ezra A. Carman's Definitive Study of the Union and Confederate Armies at Antietam, edited by Joseph Pierro (Routledge, 2008, ). He also was an author of D. E. Salmon, Ezra Ayers Carman, Hubert A. Heath, and John Minto, Special Report on the History and Present Condition of the Sheep Industry of the United States, published in 1892.

The name \\"washboard moraine\\" refers to the fact that, from the air, it resembles a washboard.  Formation  The exact washboard formation mechanism is not known. One theory proposes that as the glacier melts it leaves behind an accumulation of rock debris in the form of annual recessional moraines. These annual glacial advances and recessions cause parallel ridges to form a few metres apart. Because the accumulation of debris is annual, the moraines do not get very large and stand only a few metres high. An alternative theory is that basal till, weakened by high pore water pressure, deformed upwards into parallel basal crevasses a short distance in from the glacial margin.Moraines at Fjallsj√∂kull, Iceland R.

He is known as the 'Father of the Dravidian movement'. He did notable work against Brahminical dominance and gender and caste inequality in Tamil Nadu.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha; Shankar Raghuraman (2004). A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand. Sage Publications. New Delhi. p. 230. . E.V. Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919, but resigned in 1925 when he felt that the party was only serving the interests of Brahmins. He questioned the subjugation of non-Brahmin Dravidians as Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from non-Brahmins but opposed and discriminated against non- Brahmins in cultural and religious matters. In 1924, E.V. Ramasamy participated in non-violent agitation (satyagraha) in Vaikom, Travancore. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy made a tour of British Malaya, Europe, and Soviet Union which influenced him.Saraswathi, p. 54. In 1939, E.V.

Popular Prakashan Private Ltd.: Bombay. pp. 62, 64. . The party later split with one group led by C. N. Annadurai forming the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).Chatterjee, Debi [1981] (2004) Up Against Caste: Comparative study of Ambedkar and Periyar. Rawat Publications: Chennai. pp. 40-42. E.V. Ramasamy promoted the principles of rationalism, self-respect, women‚Äôs rights and eradication of caste. He opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and the imposition of what he considered Indo-Aryan India. Biography Early years B. R. Ambedkar with Periyar when they met in connection with a Buddhist conference in Rangoon, Myanmar in 1954. Erode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 to a Kannada Balija merchant family in Erode, then a part of the Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency.Journal of Indian history, Volume 54, University of Allahabad, p. 175 E. V. Ramasamy's father is Venkatappa Nayakar (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee, Muthammal. He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy. He later came to be known as \\"Periyar\\" meaning 'respected one' or 'elder' in the Tamil.Merchant Caste of Telugu Ancestry who descended from the migrant commanders of Vijayanagar Empire E. V. Ramasamy married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933.Gopalakrishnan, p. 3. E.V. Ramasamy married for a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued E. V. Ramasamy's social work after his death in 1973, and his ideas then were advocated by Dravidar Kazhagam.Gopalakrishnan, pp. 50, 52. In 1929, E. V. Ramasamy announced the deletion of his caste title Naicker from his name at the First Provincial Self-Respect Conference of Chengalpattu.Saraswathi, p. 6. He could speak three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Telugu and Tamil. Periyar attended school for five years after which he joined his father's trade at the age of 12. He used to listen to Tamil Vaishnavite gurus who gave discourses in his house enjoying his father's hospitality. At a young age, he began questioning the apparent contradictions in the Hindu mythological stories. As Periyar grew, he felt that people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and therefore took it as one of his duties in life to warn people against superstitions and priests.Veeramani 1992, Introduction ‚Äì xi. E.V. Ramasamy's father arranged for his wedding when he was nineteen. The bride, Nagammai, was only thirteen. Despite having an arranged marriage, Periyar and Nagammai were already in love with each other. Nagammai actively supported her husband in his later public activities and agitation. Two years after their marriage, a daughter was born to them. However, their daughter died when she was five months old. The couple had no more children. Kasi Pilgrimage Incident In 1904, E.V. Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to Kasi to visit the revered Shiva temple of Kashi Vishwanath. Though regarded as one of the holiest sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities such as begging, and floating dead bodies. His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general when he experienced what he called Brahmanic exploitation.Diehl However, one particular incident in Kasi had a profound impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street. As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar was forced to feed on leftovers from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasamy was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.Gopalakrishnan, pp. 14‚Äì17. Member of Congress Party (1919‚Äì1925) E.V. Ramasamy statue at Vaikom town in Kottayam, Kerala E.V. Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his business and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the Non- Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925. Vaikom Satyagraha (1924‚Äì1925) According to the prevalent caste system in Kerala and the rest of India, low-caste Hindus were denied entry into temples. In Kerala, they were denied permission to walk on the roads that led to the temples also. (Kerala state was formed in 1956; earlier it was broadly divided into Malabar (North Kerala), Cochin and Travancore kingdoms). In the Kakinada meet of the Congress Party in 1923, T K Madhavan presented a report citing the discrimination faced by the depressed castes in Kerala. That session decided to promote movements against untouchability. In Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee was chaired by K Kelappan; the rest of the members were T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer. In early 1924, they decided to launch a ‚ÄòKeralaparyatanam‚Äô to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed. The movement gained all-India prominence and support came from far and wide. The Akalis of Punjab lend their support by setting up kitchens to provide food to the Satyagrahis. Even Christian and Muslim leaders came forward for support. This was shunned by Gandhiji who wanted the movement to be an intra-Hindu affair. On advice from Gandhiji, the movement was withdrawn temporarily in April 1924. After the talks with caste- Hindus failed, the leaders resumed the movement. Leaders T K Madhavan and K P Kesava Menon were arrested. E V Ramaswamy (Periyar) came from Tamil Nadu to give his support. He was arrested. On 1 October 1924, a group of savarnas (forward castes) marched in a procession and submitted a petition to the Regent Maharani Sethulakshmi Bai of Travancore with about 25000 signatures for temple entry to everyone. Gandhiji also met with the Regent Maharani. This procession of savarnas was led by Mannath Padmanabhan Nair. Starting with about 500 people at Vaikom, the number increased to about 5000 when the procession reached Thiruvananthapuram in November 1924. In February 1924, they decided to launch a ‚ÄòKeralaparyatanam‚Äô to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed. In Vaikom, a small town in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of untouchability in and around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans, were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On 14 April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title Vaikom Veeran, given by his followers who participated in the Satyagraha.Diehl, pp. 22‚Äì24 The way in which the Vaikom Satyagraha events have been recorded provides a clue to the image of the respective organisers. In an article entitle Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership, Eleanor Zelliot relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to the event. Furthermore, the editor of E.V. Ramasamy's Thoughts states that Brahmins purposely suppressed news about E.V. Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, Young India, in its extensive reports on Vaikom never mentions E.V. Ramasamy. In Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee chaired by K Kelappan, composed of T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer. In February 1924, they decided to launch a ‚ÄòKeralaparyatanam‚Äô to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed. Self-Respect Movement Periyar during the early years of Self-Respect Movement Periyar and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take measures to remove social inequality,(abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc) even while other nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle for political independence. The Self-Respect Movement was described from the beginning as \\"dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a sense of pride based on their Dravidian past\\".Diehl, pp. 77-78 In 1952, the Periyar Self-Respect Movement Institution was registered with a list of objectives of the institution from which may be quoted as > for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow > people to live a life of freedom from slavery to anything against reason and > self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and > blind superstitious beliefs in society; to put an end to the present social > system in which caste, religion, community and traditional occupations based > on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created > \\"superior\\" and \\"inferior\\" classes... and to give people equal rights; to > completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based > on brother/sisterhood; to give equal rights to women; to prevent child > marriages and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and > encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious > marriages and to have the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to > establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and to run educational > institutions. Propagation of the philosophy of self respect became the full-time activity of Periyar since 1925. A Tamil weekly Kudi Arasu started in 1925, while the English journal Revolt started in 1928 carried on the propaganda among the English educated people.Saraswathi, p. 4. The Self-Respect Movement began to grow fast and received the sympathy of the heads of the Justice Party from the beginning. In May 1929, a conference of Self-Respect Volunteers was held at Pattukkotai under the presidency of S. Guruswami. K.V. Alagiriswami took charge as the head of the volunteer band. Conferences followed in succession throughout the Tamil districts of the former Madras Presidency. A training school in Self-Respect was opened at Erode, the home town of Periyar. The object was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a social revolution to foster a new spirit and build a new society.Saraswathi, p. 19. International travel (1929‚Äì1932) Between 1929 and 1935, under the strain of World Depression, political thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came under the influence of the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work. E.V. Ramasamy toured Malaya for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to propagate the self-respect philosophy. Embarking on his journey from Nagapattinam with his wife Nagammal and his followers, E.V. Ramasamy was received by 50,000 Tamil Malaysians in Penang. During the same month, he inaugurated the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in Ipoh, and then went to Singapore. In December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally acquaint himself with their political systems, social movements, way of life, economic and social progress and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Germany, England, Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at Ceylon and returned to India in November 1932. The tour shaped the political ideology of E.V. Ramasamy to achieve the social concept of Self- Respect. The communist system in the Soviet Union appealed to him as appropriately suited to deal with the social ills of the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership.Diehl, p. 69. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage of development in the Self-Respect Movement which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu. Opposition to Hindi In 1937, when Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency, he introduced Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools, thereby igniting a series of anti-Hindi agitations. Tamil nationalists, the Justice Party under Sir A. T. Panneerselvam, and E.V. Ramasamy organised anti-Hindi protests in 1938 which ended with numerous arrests by the Rajaji government. During the same year, the slogan \\"Tamil Nadu for Tamilians\\"Saraswathi, pp. 118-119. was first used by E.V. Ramasamy in protest against the introduction of Hindi in schools. He claimed that the introduction of Hindi was a dangerous mechanism used by the Aryans to infiltrate Dravidian culture. He reasoned that the adoption of Hindi would make Tamils subordinate to the Hindi-speaking North Indians. E.V. Ramasamy claimed that Hindi would not only halt the progress of Tamil people, but would also completely destroy their culture and nullify the progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through Tamil in the recent decades. Cutting across party lines, South Indian politicians rallied together in their opposition to Hindi.Saraswathi, pp. 88-89. There were recurrent anti- Hindi agitations in 1948, 1952 and 1965.Diehl, p. 79. As President of the Justice Party (1938‚Äì1944) A political party known as the South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as Justice Party) was founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and political power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups. In 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the politics of Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation. Dravidar Kazhagam (1944‚Äìonwards) =Formation of the Dravidar Kazhagam= At a rally in 1944, Periyar, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that the party would henceforth be known as the Dravidar Kazhagam, or \\"Dravidian Association\\". However, a few who disagreed with Periyar started a splinter group, claiming to be the original Justice Party. This party was led by veteran Justice Party leader P. T. Rajan and survived until 1957. The Dravidar Kazhagam came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.International Tamil Language Foundation, (2000).Tirukkural/ The Handbok of Tamil Culture and Heritage. ITLF: Chicago, p. 1346\\\\. . =Split with Annadurai= In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, established a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This was due to differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time claiming increased state independence.Diehl, p. 29. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and a sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammayar who was the daughter of Kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self- Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.Geetha, V.; S.V. Rajadurai, (1987). Towards a Non-Brahmin Millennium: From Iyothee Thass to Periyar. M. Sen for SAMYA: Calcutta, p. 481\\\\. . =Later years= Periyar Thidal at Vepery, where Periyar's body was buried. In 1956, despite warnings from P. Kakkan, the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, Periyar organised a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of the Hindu God Rama. Periyar was subsequently arrested and confined to prison. The activities of Periyar continued when he went to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi. Five years later, Periyar travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Periyar died at the age of 94. Principles and legacy Periyar spent over fifty years giving speeches, propagating the realisation that everyone is an equal citizen and the differences on the basis of caste and creed were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane masses, scores of educated people were also swayed.Gopalakrishnan, pp. 59-60. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning with respect to subjects of social interest in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were considered by many to be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.Gopalakrishnan, pp. 45‚Äì49. Rationalism The bedrock of E.V. Ramasamy‚Äôs principles and the movements that he started was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority and trying to keep it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot. Likewise, E.V. Ramasamy explained that wisdom lies in thinking and that the spear-head of thinking is rationalism. On caste, he stated that no other living being harms or degrades its own class. But man, said to be a rational living being, does these evils. The differences, hatred, enmity, degradation, poverty, and wickedness, now prevalent in the society are due to lack of wisdom and rationalism and not due to God or the cruelty of time. E.V. Ramasamy had written in his books and magazines dozens of times of various occasions that the British rule is better than self-ruleVeeramani 2005, p. 511. E.V. Ramasamy also blamed the capitalists for their control of machineries, creating difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, which has to lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins. In a message to the Brahmin community, Periyar stated, \\"in the name of god, religion, and sastras you have duped us. We were the ruling people. Stop this life of cheating us from this year. Give room for rationalism and humanism\\".Veeramani 2005, p. 504. He added that \\"any opposition not based on rationalism, science, or experience will one day or another, reveal the fraud, selfishness, lies and conspiracies\\". Self- respect Periyar's philosophy of self-respect was based on his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions should be based on rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the philosophy of self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under all circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.Saraswathi, p. 2. Periyar's foremost appeal to people was to develop self-respect. He preached that the Brahmins had monopolised and cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self-respect. He stated that most Brahmins claimed to belong to a \\"superior\\" community with the reserved privilege of being in charge of temples and performing archanas. He felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by using their superior caste status to claim the exclusive privilege to touch idols or enter the sanctum sanctorum. Women‚Äôs rights As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar advocated forcefully throughout his life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men and that they should be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.Gopalakrishnan, p. 70. Periyar fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women.Veeramani 1992, p. 22. Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty.Veeramani 1992, p. 37. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to dowry deaths.Veeramani 1992, p. 65. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.Veeramani 1992, p. 50. Women in India also did not have rights to their families' or husbands' property. Periyar fought fiercely for this and also advocated for women to have the right to separate or divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances. While birth control remained taboo in society of Periyar's time, he advocated for it not only for the health of women and population control, but for the liberation of women.Veeramani 2005, p. 570. He criticised the hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued that it should either apply also to men, or not at all for both genders.Veeramani 1992, p. 41 While fighting against this, Periyar advocated getting rid of the Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes.Gopalakrishnan, p. 32. Further, for the liberation of women, Periyar pushed for their right to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.Veeramani 1992, p. 45. According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and his movement achieved a better status for women in Tamil society. Periyar held that, in matters of education and employment, there should be no difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the State departments and even the Center made it possible for women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against child marriage. Social reform and eradication of caste Periyar wanted thinking people to see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them.Gopalakrishnan, p. 66. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service.Saraswathi, pp. 164-165. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued that the government was not for the people, but, in a \\"topsy-turvy\\" manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage of a small group of people. One of the areas of Periyar's focus was on the upliftment of rural communities. In a booklet called Village Uplift, Periyar pleaded for rural reform. At that time rural India still formed the largest part of the Indian subcontinent, in spite of the ongoing process of urbanisation. Thus, the distinction between rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants. Periyar wanted to eradicate the concept of \\"village\\" as a discrimination word among places, just as the concept of \\"outcast\\" among social groups. Periyar advocated for a location where neither the name nor the situation or its conditions imply differences among people.Diehl, p. 68. He further advocated for the modernisation of villages by providing public facilities such as schools, libraries, radio stations, roads, bus transport, and police stations.Saraswathi, p. 193. Periyar felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions to dominate Indian society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that the caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this menace.Gopalakrishnan, pp. 60-61. Periyar stated that the caste system in South India is, due to Indo- Aryan influence, linked with the arrival of Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a different stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living.Diehl, p. 61. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.Veeramani 2005, pp. 72-73. The Samathuvapuram (Equality Village) social equality system introduced by the Government of Tamil Nadu in the late 1990s is named after Ramasamy. Tamil language and writing Periyar claimed that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada came from the same mother language of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contradicts such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil‚ÄìMalayalam, Kannada and Tulu); Central (including Telugu‚ÄìKui and Kolami‚ÄìParji); and, Northern (including Kurukh‚ÄìMalto and Brahui). With relation to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are useful to the people in their life and foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses, will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for Tamil.Veeramani 2005, pp. 550‚Äì552. Periyar also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the Brahmin usage of Tamil, he stated that the Tamil spoken by the Andhras and the Malayali people was far better than the Tamil spoken by the Brahmins. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees be vigilant. With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that \\"a time will come for unity. This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us\\".Veeramani 2005, p. 503. At the same time, Periyar was also known to have made controversial remarks on the Tamil language and people from time to time. On one occasion, he referred to the Tamil people as \\"barbarians\\" and the Tamil language as the \\"language of barbarians\\". However, Anita Diehl explains that Periyar made these remarks on Tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms. But Anita Diehl's explanation doesn't match with Periyar's own explanation. Periyar himself explained reasons many times in his speeches and writings, for instance, an excerpt from his book Thamizhum, Thamizharum(Tamil and Tamil people) reads, \\"I say Tamil as barbarian language. Many get angry with me for saying so. But no one ponders over why I say so. They say Tamil is a 3,000 to 4,000 years-old language and they boast about this. Precisely that is what the reason why I call Tamil as barbarian language. People should understand the term primitive and barbarism. What was the status of people living 4,000 years ago and now? We are just blindly sticking to old glories. No one has come forward to reform Tamil language and work for its growth.\\" Periyar's ideas on Tamil alphabet reforms included those such as the reasons for the vowel '‡Æà' (i) having a cursive and looped representation of the short form '‡Æá' (I). In stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' ‡Æï‡Ææ ', ' ‡Æï‡Øá ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar questioned why other compound characters like ' ‡Æï‡Æø ', ' ‡Æï‡ØÄ ', '‡Æï‡ØÅ ', ' ‡Æï‡ØÇ ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), shouldn't also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar. Thus, the glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else\\" Thoughts on the Thirukkural Periyar hailed the Thirukkural as a valuable scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised Thiruvalluvar for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a Self- respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.Veeramani 2005, pp. 505‚Äì508. On caste, he believed that the Kural illustrates how Vedic laws of Manu were against the Sudras and other communities of the Dravidian race. On the other hand, Periyar opined that the ethics from the Kural was comparable to the Christian Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate the people of the country. One of Periyar's quotes on the Thirukkural from Veeramani's Collected Works of Periyar was \\"when Dravida Nadu (Dravidistan) was a victim to Indo-Aryan deceit, Thirukkural was written by a great Dravidian Thiruvalluvar to free the Dravidians\\". Periyar also asserted that due to the secular nature of Thirukkural, it has the capacity to be the common book of faith for all humanity and can be kept on par or above the holy books of all religions. Self-determination of Dravida Nadu Periyar with Muhammad Ali Jinnah and B. R. Ambedkar The Dravidian-Aryan conflict was believed to be a continuous historical phenomenon that started when the Aryans first set their foot in the Dravidian lands. Even a decade before the idea of separation appeared, Periyar stated that, \\"as long as Aryan religion, Indo-Aryan domination, propagation of Aryan Vedas and Aryan \\"Varnashrama\\" existed, there was need for a \\"Dravidian Progressive Movement\\" and a \\"Self-Respect Movement\\".Saraswathi, pp. 89-90. Periyar became very concerned about the growing North Indian domination over the south which appeared to him no different from foreign domination. He wanted to secure the fruits of labour of the Dravidians to the Dravidians, and lamented that fields such as political, economic, industrial, social, art, and spiritual were dominated by the north for the benefit of the North Indians. Thus, with the approach of independence from Britain, this fear that North India would take the place of Britain to dominate South India became more and more intense.Saraswathi, p. 95. Periyar was clear about the concept of a separate nation, comprising Tamil areas, that is part of the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu, but failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress. The concept of Dravida Nadu was later modified down to Tamil Nadu.Saraswathi, p. 98. This led to a proposal for a union of the Tamil people of not only South India but including those of Ceylon as well.Ghurye, G.S. (1961). Caste, Class, and Occupation. Popular Book Depot: Bombay, p. 318. In 1953, Periyar helped to preserve Madras as the capital of Tamil Nadu, which later was the name he substituted for the more general Dravida Nadu.Diehl, p. 76. In 1955 Periyar threatened to burn the national flag, but on Chief Minister Kamaraj's pledge that Hindi should not be made compulsory, he postponed the action. In his speech of 1957 called Suthantara Tamil Nadu En? (Why an independent Tamil Nadu?), he criticised the Central Government of India, inducing thousands of Tamilians to burn the constitution of India. The reason for this action was that Periyar held the Government responsible for maintaining the caste system. After stating reasons for separation and turning down opinions against it, he closed his speech with a \\"war cry\\" to join and burn the map of India on 5 June. Periyar was sentenced to six months imprisonment for burning the Indian constitution.Diehl, p. 30 Advocacy of such a nation became illegal when separatist demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was observed on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests.Bhaskaran, R. (1967). Sociology of Politics: Tradition of politics in India. Asia Publishing House: New York. p. 48. However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization and that it was necessary to work towards it.Saraswathi, p. 9. Anti- Brahmanism vs. Anti-Brahmin Periyar was a radical advocate of anti- Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism. In 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed this trend, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency. Periyar, through the Justice Party, advocated against the imbalance of the domination of Brahmins who constituted only 3 percent of the population, over government jobs, judiciary and the Madras University. His Self-Respect Movement espoused rationalism and atheism and the movement had currents of anti-Brahminism. Furthermore, Periyar stated that: > \\"Our Dravidian movement does not exist against the Brahmins or the Banias (a > North Indian merchant caste). If anyone thinks so, I would only pity him. > But we will not tolerate the ways in which Brahminism and the Bandiaism is > degrading Dravidanadu. Whatever support they may have from the government, > neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice\\".Veeramani 2005, p. 495. Periyar also criticised Subramanya Bharathi in the journal Ticutar for portraying Mother Tamil as a sister of Sanskrit in his poems: > \\"They say Bharati is an immortal poet.‚Ä¶Even if a rat dies in an akrakƒÅram, > they would declare it to be immortal. ‚Ä¶ of Tamilnadu praises him. Why should > this be so? Supposedly because he sang fulsome praises of Tamil and > Tamilnadu. What else could he sing? His own mother tongue, Sanskrit, has > been dead for years. What other language did he know? He cannot sing in > Sanskrit. ‚Ä¶ He says Tamilnadu is the land of Aryas.\\" Comparisons with Gandhi In the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi ji both cooperated and confronted each other in socio-political action. Periyar and his followers emphasised the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the social issues, such as fighting the Untouchability Laws and eradication of the caste system. According to the booklet \\"Gandhi and Periyar\\", Periyar wrote in his paper Kudi Arasu in 1925, reporting on the fact that Gandhi was ousted from the Mahasabha because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and Untouchability Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. From this, Gandhi learned the need for pleasing the Brahmins if anything was to be achieved.Diehl, pp. 86‚Äì88 Peiryar in his references to Gandhi used opportunities to present Gandhi as, on principle, serving the interests of the Brahmins. In 1927, Periyar and Gandhi met at Bangalore to discuss this matter. The main difference between them came out when Periyar stood for the total eradication of Hinduism to which Gandhi objected saying that Hinduism is not fixed in doctrines but can be changed. In the Kudi Arasu, Periyar explained that: > \\"With all his good qualities, Gandhi did not bring the people forward from > foolish and evil ways. His murderer was an educated man. Therefore nobody > can say this is a time of high culture. If you eat poison, you will die. If > electricity hits the body, you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin, you will > die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of Varnasrama Dharma structure, > but sees in it a task for the humanisation of society and social change > possible within its structure. The consequence of this would be continued > high-caste leadership. Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without > depriving them of their leadership\\". Gandhi accepted karma in the sense that \\"the Untouchables reap the reward of their karma, but was against discrimination against them using the revaluing term Harijans. As shown in the negotiations at Vaikom his methods for abolishing discrimination were: to stress on the orthodox, inhumane treatment of Untouchables; to secure voluntary lifting of the ban by changing the hearts of caste Hindus; and to work within a Hindu framework of ideas. On the Temple Entry issue, Gandhi never advocated the opening of Garbha Griha to Harijans in consequence of his Hindu belief. These sources which can be labelled \\"pro- Periyar\\" with the exception of M. Mahar and D.S. Sharma, clearly show that Periyar and his followers emphasised that Periyar was the real fighter for the removal of Untouchability and the true upliftment of Hairjans, whereas Gandhi was not. This did not prevent Periyar from having faith in Gandhi on certain matters. Religion and atheism Periyar was generally regarded as a pragmatic propagandist who attacked the evils of religious influence on society, mainly what he regarded as Brahmin domination. At a young age, he felt that some people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and regarded it as his life's mission to warn people against superstitions and priests. Anita Diehl explains that Periyar cannot be called an atheist philosopher. Periyar, however, qualified what the term \\"atheist\\" implies in his address on philosophy. He repudiated the term as without real sense: \\"‚Ä¶the talk of the atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous. The thing I call god... that makes all people equal and free, the god that does not stop free thinking and research, the god that does not ask for money, flattery and temples can certainly be an object of worship. For saying this much I have been called an atheist, a term that has no meaning\\". Anita Diehl explains that Periyar saw faith as compatible with social equality and did not oppose religion itself.Diehl, p. 16 In a book on revolution published in 1961, Periyar stated: \\"be of help to people. Do not use treachery or deceit. Speak the truth and do not cheat. That indeed is service to God.\\"Diehl, p. 58 On Hinduism, Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book (bhagawad gita) or origins, but an imaginary faith preaching the \\"superiority\\" of the Brahmins, the inferiority of the Shudras, and the untouchability of the Dalits (Panchamas). Maria Misra, a lecturer at Oxford University, compares him to the philosophes, stating: \\"his contemptuous attitude to the baleful influence of Hinduism in Indian public life is strikingly akin to the anti-Catholic diatribes of the enlightenment philosophes\\".Misra, Maria (2008). Vishnu's Crowded Temple: India since the great rebellion. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 181. . In 1955 Periyar was arrested for his public action of burning pictures of Rama in public places as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leadership according to the Ramayana epic. Periyar also shoed images of Krishna and Rama, stating that they were Aryan gods that considered the Dravidian Shudras to be \\"sons of prostitutes\\".Veeramani 2005, pp. 218-219. Periyar openly suggested to those who were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as Islam, Christianity, or Buddhism. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; for proclaiming equal rights for men and women; and for advocating social unity.Diehl, p. 52 At the rally in Tiruchi, Periyar said: > \\"Muslims are following the ancient philosophies of the Dravidians. The > Arabic word for Dravidian religion is Islam. When Brahmanism was imposed in > this country, it was Mohammad Nabi who opposed it, by instilling the > Dravidian religion's policies as Islam in the minds of the people\\" Periyar viewed Christianity as similar to the monotheistic faith of Islam. He explained that the Christian faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Martin Luther - both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus Christian views, as expressed for example in The Precepts of Jesus (1820) by Ram Mohan Roy, had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.Diehl, p. 92. Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar also found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy, though he did not accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Saraswathi, p. 125. Through Periyar's movement, Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits finally became eligible for priesthood. Controversies =Factionism in the Justice Party= When B. Munuswamy Naidu became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency in 1930, he endorsed the inclusion of Brahmins in the Justice Party, saying: > So long as we exclude one community, we cannot as a political speak on > behalf of, or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we > hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces as a result of the > reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation > should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all > communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are > willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be > that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our > Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is > an exclusive organisation.Ralhan, p. 166 Though certain members supported the resolution, a faction in the Justice Party known as the \\"Ginger Group\\" opposed the resolution and eventually voted it down. Periyar, who was then an observer in the Justice Party, criticised Munuswamy Naidu, saying: > At a time when non-Brahmins in other parties were gradually coming over to > the Justice Party, being fed up with the Brahmin's methods and ways of > dealing with political questions, it was nothing short of folly to think of > admitting him into the ranks of the Justice Party. This factionism continued until 1932 when Munuswamy Naidu stepped down as the Chief Minister of Madras and the Raja of Bobbili became the chief minister.Ralhan, p. 197 Followers and influence After the death of Periyar in 1973, conferences were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, the new head of the Dravidar Kazhagam, set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas. On Periyar's birthday on 17 September 1974, Periyar's Rationalist Library and Research Library and Research Institute was opened by the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. This library contained Periyar's rationalist works, the manuscripts of Periyar and his recorded speeches. Also during the same year Periyar's ancestral home in Erode, was dedicated as a commemoration building. On 20 February 1977, the opening function of Periyar Building in Madras was held. At the meeting which the Managing Committee of the Dravidar Kazhagam held, there on that day, it was decided to support the candidates belonging to the Janata Party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), and the Marxist Party during the General Elections. On 16 March 1978, Maniyammai died. The Managing Committee of the Dravidar Kazhagam elected K. Veeramani as General Secretary of the Dravidar Kazhagam on 17 March 1978. From then on, the Periyar-Maniyammai Educational and Charitable Society started the Periyar Centenary Women's Polytechnic at Thanjavur on 21 September 1980. On 8 May 1982, the College for Correspondence Education was started under the auspices of the Periyar Rationalist Propaganda Organization. Over the years, Periyar influenced Tamil Nadu's political party heads such as C.N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam' (DMK), V. Gopalswamy founder of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), S. Ramadoss founder of the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Thol. Thirumavalavan, founder of the Dalit Panthers of India (DPI), and Dravidar Kazhagam's K. Veeramani. Nationally, Periyar is main ideological icon for India's third largest voted party, Bahujan Samaj Party and its founder Kanshi Ram. Other political figures influenced by Periyar were former Congress minister K. Kamaraj, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati. Periyar's life and teachings have also influenced writers and poets such as Kavignar Inkulab, and BharathidasanDiehl, p. 81. and actors such as Kamal Haasan and Sathyaraj. Noted Tamil Comedian N. S. Krishnan was a close friend and follower of Periyar. W. P. A. Soundarapandian Nadar was a close confidant of Periyar and encouraged Nadars to be a part of the Self-Respect Movement. A writer from Uttar Pradesh, Lalai Singh Yadav translated Periyar's notable works into Hindi. In popular culture Sathyaraj and Khushboo Sundar starred in a government-sponsored film Periyar released in 2007. Directed by Gnana Rajasekaran, the film was screened in Malaysia on 1 May 2007 and was screened at the Goa International Film Festival in November that year. Sathyaraj reprised his role as Periyar in the film Kalavadiya Pozhudugal directed by Thangar Bachan which released in 2017. References Cited sources  * Further reading * Bandistse, D.D., (2008).

Michelangelo Pistoletto (born 23 June 1933 in Biella) is an Italian painter, action and object artist, and art theorist. Pistoletto is acknowledged as one of the main representatives of the Italian Arte Povera. His work mainly deals with the subject matter of reflection and the unification of art and everyday life in terms of a Gesamtkunstwerk.  Biography From 1947 until 1958, Pistoletto worked in his father's restoration workshop in Turin. In the 1950s, he started painting figurative works and self-portraits. In 1959, he participated in the Biennale di San Marino. In the following year, he had his first solo exhibition in the Galleria Galatea in Turin. In the beginning of the 1960s, Pistoletto started painting figurative works and self-portraits which he painted on a monochrome, metallic background. Later on, he combined painting with photography using collage techniques on reflective backgrounds. Eventually, he switched over to printing photorealistic scenes on steel plates polished to a high finish. He did that using the screen-printing method which made the observer almost completely melt in with what was depicted.A similar approach can be found in the work of US Pop artist James Rosenquist. In the mid-1960s, gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend brought him into contact with an international audience. In 1965/1966, he produced the series of works Oggetti in meno (Minus Objects), which belongs to Pistoletto's early sculptural works. In 1966, Pistoletto had his first solo exhibition in the US, at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. In 1967, his work was awarded first prize in the Biennale de S√£o Paulo. In the same year, Pistoletto started focusing on performance, video art and theatre. He founded an action art group, called \\"Zoo Group\\", which gave several performances between 1968 and 1970. These took place in the studio, public buildings or on the streets of Turin or other large cities. As was already the case with Pistoletto's 2-dimensional and sculptural works, the aim was to display the unity of art and everyday life.Guggenheim Collection - Artist - Pistoletto - Biography Arte Povera Michelangelo Pistoletto began painting on mirrors in 1962, connecting painting with the constantly changing realities in which the work finds itself. In the later sixties he began bringing together rags with casts of omnipresent classical statuary of Italy to break down the hierarchies of \\"art\\" and common things. An art of impoverished materials is certainly one aspect of the definition of Arte Povera. In his 1967 Muretto di straci (Rag Wall) Pistoletto makes an exotic and opulent tapestry wrapping common bricks in discarded scraps of fabric. The work received a lot of feedback: Pistoletto, who started under the American influence of \\"post-pop art\\" and photorealism, was soon listed by gallery owners and critics in the catalogues as a significant representative of the novel, mostly Italian trend of the Arte Povera. Against the background of the 1968 student riots, Pistoletto withdrew his participation in the Venice Biennale. In the following years, he dealt with conceptual ideas, which he presented in the book L'uomo nero (1970). In 1974, he nearly completely withdrew from the art scene: he took an exam as a skiing instructor and spent most of his time in the mountains of San Sicario. At the end of the 1970s, he produced sculptures, heads, and torsos using polyurethane and marble. In doing so, he was a recipient of antique artifacts and he furthermore pursued other performance and theatre projects‚Äìincluding those in the US in Athens, Atlanta, and San Francisco. At the beginning of the 1980s, he presented theatre works, such as Anno Uno (March 1981) in the Teatro Quirino in Rome. Since 1990, Pistoletto has been living and working in Turin. Cittadelarte ‚Äì Fondazione Pistoletto In 1994, Michelangelo Pistoletto proclaimed his programme Progetto Arte, the aim of which was the creative and social economic unification of all parts of human existence; in a narrower sense, the systematic combination of all achievements and knowledge of civilisation with aspects of art (e.g. fashion, theatre, design, etc.). In 1996, he founded the art city Cittadelarte ‚Äì Fondazione Pistoletto in an abandoned textile factory near Biella, as a centre and \\"laboratory\\", supporting and researching creative resources, and producing innovative ideas and possibilities. The Cittadelarte is divided into different Uffici/Offices ( work, education, communications, art, nutrition, politics, spirituality, and economics), which exchange with each other within an intermedial network. Although it is conceived as a closed system, transparency towards the outside world is an important aspect of the Cittadelarte.\\"What Cittadelarte Is\\". Cittadellarte. Fondazione Pistoletto. Retrieved 2020-04-25. Mirror Paintings Pistoletto's Mirror Paintings are artworks made of human size mirrors. Using these mirrors as basic material, he paints figures or prints photographic images on them. First Mirror Paintings were created in the early sixties.Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev: Arte Povera, London 1999, p. 154. The printed subjects show a broad spectrum of motives: for example self-portraits, pictures from gallery visitors or objects of daily life. Pistoletto intentionally uses the reflective properties of the steel to produce an interactive dialogue between the viewer and the image in front of them. From an interview in 1963 Pistoletto states the relationship between the viewer, the painting, and the virtual space as ‚Äúthe joining of couples of opposite polarity between the photographic image and what goes on in the virtual space generated by the reflecting surface‚Ä¶‚ÄùMichelangelo Pistoletto. 2011. Mirror Paintings. Ostfildern, Germany: Hatje Cantz. A central role is given to the spectator. His mirrored picture seems to get in interaction with the printed motive. In some way the viewer becomes part of the artwork. This phenomenon is relevant especially in time of European Student activism. Every individual spectator becomes active while regarding the artwork. This central position of the visitor could motivate him to become active also in other parts of society, which matches the ideas of the Gesamtkunstwerk. Pistoletto is quoted saying, ‚ÄúIn my mirror-paintings the dynamic reflection does not create a place, because it only reflects a place which already exists- the static silhouette does no more than re-propose an already existing place. But I can create a place by bringing about a passage between the photograph and the mirror: this place is whole time.‚ÄùMichelangelo Pistoletto. 1966. Exhibition catalogue. Galleria La Bertesca, Genova. The previous quote enlightens the reader on Pistoletto's attempt to, in 1964 at the Galleria Sperone, work on bringing the meaning of the mirror out into the inhabited space surrounding it. The simultaneous representation of traditional dimensions and of reality in motion reveal the new dimensions of the mirror- paintings.Michelangelo Pistoletto. 1966. Exhibition catalogue. Galleria La Bertesca, Genova. Sometimes the paintings on the mirrors are portraits of Pistoletto's friends, patrons and/or self-portraits: this is true for the artist's recent entirely mirrored-hall at the Ristorante del Cambio, Piazza Carignano, Turin.

It contains the tomb of Idris II (or Moulay Idris II when including his sharifian title), who ruled Morocco from 807 to 828 and is considered the main founder of the city of Fes.\\"Fes\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 3 Mar. 2007 It is located in the heart of Fes el-Bali, the UNESCO-listed old medina of Fez, and is considered one of the holiest shrines in Morocco.  History and significance of Moulay Idriss II  The tomb/cenotaph of Idris II inside the mausoleum Idris II, born in 791, was the son and successor of Idris I. Idris I was a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who fled from Abbasid-controlled territory after the Battle of Fakh because he had supported the defeated pro- Shi'a rebels. He used his prestige as a descendant of the Prophet to forge an alliance with local Berbers in 789 and quickly became the most important religious and political leader in the region. He died soon after in 791, just before his son Idris (II) was born. After Idris II officially took over his position as ruler in 803 he significantly expanded the authority of the new Idrisid state. With the help of new Arab immigrants he gained independence from his Berber allies and extended Idrisid control to include most of what is today Morocco and parts of eastern Algeria. As a result, he was of central importance to the early Islamization of Morocco, and arguably the first true \\"Moroccan\\" Islamic ruler. He died in 828. Crucially, Idris II is responsible for moving the capital of his state from Walili (former Volubilis) to what is now Fez, founding in 809 a new city on the west bank of the river across from another settlement on the east bank founded by his father in 789. He and his successors turned Fez into an important capital and urban center of Morocco, and the city accrued prestige with the creation of institutions like the Qarawiyyin mosque and university in 859. The reputation of Moulay Idris II was maintained and revived over time. He came to be considered the patron saint of the city of Fez and his shrine is one of the holiest in Morocco.  History of the zawiya  The zawiya, marked by its tall alt=  Early history: after the death of Idris II (9th-13th centuries)  There is little certain information about the shrine before the Marinid era (14-15th centuries). The history of both the shrine and the religious culture surrounding it is not clearly traceable until the resurgence of the sharifs (families and dynasties recognized as descending from the Prophet Muhammad) in Morocco's political and religious life which took place slowly during the Marinid period. While there is disagreement among sources as to what happened to Idris II's body after his death, most believe that he was buried in the mosque he had built next to his palace of Dar al-Qaytun (House of the Tent) in the center of Fes, possibly in a mausoleum on its eastern side. This building is often referred to as the Shurafa Mosque (or Mosque of the Sharifs), and it served as the early Friday mosque (the main mosque where the Friday sermon, khutba, was delivered) of the city. During the rivalry between the Ummayyads of Spain and the Fatimids in the 10th century, Fez and northern Morocco came under the domination of the Zenata Berbers, who deposed the Idrisids in 917-921. Moussa ibn Abi al-'Afya, whom the Zenata placed in charge of Fez, persecuted the descendants of Idris, drove them out of the city, and took measures to discredit their reputation. Among other things, he publicly denied that the Shurafa Mosque contained the real tomb of Idris II, promoting the story (reported in some sources) that Idris II had instead been buried next to his father in the town of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun (about 50 kilometers west of Fez). Finally, at some point around this period the khutba (Friday sermon) was transferred to the al- Qarawiyyin Mosque, thus robbing the Shurafa Mosque of its status as the community's main mosque. This transfer happened either in 919-18 or in 933, both dates right after a brief period of Fatimid domination over the city, which suggests that the transfer may have occurred on Fatimid initiative. Over the following decades, further regime changes and military interventions by powers from outside Morocco resulted in political instability and the complete disenfranchisement of the Idrisids. In 1069 Fez was conquered by the Almoravids, who promoted a stricter and more orthodox version of Sunni Islam (following the Maliki maddhab) which was hostile to the cult of \\"saints\\", resulting in another exodus of the sharifian families from the city. As the Idrisids lost power and Fez came under the control of other rulers who were hostile to their influence, the mosque and the mausoleum were neglected and eventually abandoned, and the cult of Moulay Idris II along with it. By then it was also overshadowed in prestige by the Qarawiyyin, which became the most important institution in Fez. Most of the tombs of saints in the city were also ruined over this time.  The Marinid period: return of the cult of Moulay Idris II (14th-16th centuries)  The religious and political importance of the sharifs (Arabs who claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad) began to be revived and re-elaborated under the Marinid dynasty. Like the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties before them, the Marinids were Berbers rather than Arabs. Unlike these previous dynasties, however, their political legitimacy was not based on a program of religious reform or on a strong role in defending the Muslim frontier in al-Andalus (Spain) at the time. As a result, they sought new bases of legitimacy. Among other means, they did this by constructing many new madrasas promoting the Maliki Sunni maddhab and its scholars (who became their bureaucracy), while at the same time cautiously fostering the various sharifian dynasties and factions inside Morocco for support. For the Marinids, based in Fez, the Idrisid cult and its association with Fez itself was still seen as a possible threat and their relationship to it was initially tepid and ambivalent. Notably, when the body of Idris I was allegedly rediscovered in Walili (Volubilis) in 1318, which generated excitement among locals, Marinid officials quickly moved to prevent the story from spreading. However, later Marinid rulers changed their attitudes and progressively re-adapted the story of the Idrisids so as to instead highlight the role of the Marinids as their symbolic successors. The Marinids presented themselves as rulers who were reviving and preserving an orthodox Islamic state in Morocco. Accordingly, writers and officials under their rule (and under the later Wattasids) re-emphasized the link between Fez and its Idrisid founders, presenting the former Idrisids as definitively Sunni rulers (despite Idris I having fled to Morocco due to his Shi'a sympathies), and depicting the Marinids as eager endorsers of the cult of Moulay Idris I and Moulay Idris II. After the roof and walls of the zawiya collapsed altogether in 1308 following a long period of neglect, Marinid officials allowed the mosque to be rebuilt by Idris' descendants, who rebuilt it exactly as it was. A more crucial event, however, happened in 1437: during preparations to restore the building again, a buried body was discovered on site and was recognized by the legal scholars of the time as being the body of Idris II. Chronicles of the event report that Marinid officials were involved in the decision to subsequently re-inter the body at the same site while restoring the zawiya. A marble panel recounting the event was placed on the wall above the tomb and is still visible today. Modern-day scholars doubt the details of this story, but the event nonetheless marks a rise in the prestige of the zawiya. The cult surrounding Moulay Idris II slowly rekindled, and by the 16th century it was strong and even actively encouraged by the Wattasid rulers (the successors to the Marinids), with regular ceremonies taking place around the tomb.  The Saadi and Alaouite periods: the zawiya under the sharifian dynasties (16th century to present)  View from the courtyard towards the 18th-century left al-Qandusi's large 19th-century painting of the word Allah in the courtyard of the zawiya At a more national level, the renewed prestige of the sharifs in general was so successful that two sharifian dynasties, the Saadis and the Alaouites (the current monarchy to this day), subsequently took over and ruled Morocco. The Idrisids, the original sharifian rulers of early Islamic Morocco, fit more easily into the narrative of political legitimacy of these dynasties. Perhaps because of this, numerous contributions to the zawiya were made throughout this time, culminating in a major reconstruction in the early 18th century which gave the sanctuary its overall current form. In 1557, the Saadi sultan Mohammad al- Sheikh built a new roof over the mausoleum to make it more monumental. In 1603, the last year of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansour's reign, his son, Emir (prince) Zaydan Abu Maali, added more decoration inside the mausoleum. Shortly after, in 1610 or 1611, at the initiative and expense of a generous private individual named Harun al-Andalusi, a private house next to the mausoleum was purchased and its property converted into a courtyard or sahn for the mosque, while another Saadi official (the qadi al-R'assani al-Andalusi) contributed a fountain for the center of the courtyard. In 1644, another individual (named al-Hadj 'Ali ibn Qasem al-Qumini) contributed funds for embellishing the courtyard and also gifted further items for use in the mausoleum. Under the Alaouite dynasty, the first Alaouite sultan, Moulay Rachid, made generous donations to the zawiya in 1669. Two other Alaouite officials, in 1679 and in 1714, had new fountains installed and new sources of water redirected to the mosque (in one case, redirected from the Qarawiyyin). Most significantly of all, Moulay Ismail, the powerful and long-reigning Alaouite sultan, had the entire zawiya rebuilt between 1717 and 1720, including the current minaret and the mausoleum chamber with its large pyramidal roof. This gave the complex its current dimensions (or almost) and the overall decoration it has today. In 1824, another Alaouite sultan, 'Abd al-Rahman (or Abderrahman), erected a new mosque extension on a site adjacent to the mausoleum, marking the last significant modification to the structure. The celebrated Moroccan Sufi calligrapher Muhammad al-Qandusi, who lived in Fes from 1828 until his death in 1861, was responsible for painting the large calligraphic representation of the name Allah on the southern wall of the zawiya's courtyard. Since the 19th century, the zawiya has been restored a few more times. It was renovated in 1956 on the initiative of King Mohammed V and some of the decoration on the outside of the building dates from this time. The complex was most recently underwent restoration between 2011 and 2014 under the supervision of architect Rachid Haloui.  Geography  A wooden bar across this street entrance, near the zawiya, denotes the boundary of the sanctuary. Animals (e.g. mules) were historically not allowed past this point.  Urban environment  The zawiya's most prominent external features are its minaret, the tallest in the old city of Fez, and the large green-tiled pyramidal roof over the mausoleum chamber. As a result, it is one of the most visible and easily identifiable buildings on the old medina's skyline. Up close, however, the zawiya is often obscured by the narrow lanes and the densely-packed buildings of the old city. On the zawiya's eastern side is a grid-like set of covered streets which make up a bazaar known as the Kissaria (also spelled kisariyya or qaysariyya), historically the central and most prestigious market in the city, situated between the two most important mosques of the city (the Qarawiyyin Mosque and Idris II's mosque/zawiya). Further west, on the south side of Place Nejjarine, is the historic Hammam Moulay Idris which is associated with his tomb and traditionally considered to confer some of its blessings.  The sanctuary (horm)  Some of the streets around and leading to the zawiya are marked at certain points by a horizontal wooden bar under which pedestrians must duck in order to pass. These denoted the extent of the Zawiya's sanctuary or haram (also horm), a protected and sanctified space. Up until the beginning of the French colonial occupation in 1912, non-Muslims and pack animals (e.g. mules, commonly used in the old city) were forbidden to pass beyond this point, and any Muslim within this space was allowed to claim asylum from arrest or prosecution. Today, non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the building itself but can now walk up to its doors and around its perimeter. This horm or sanctuary also contains multiple other buildings which were generally included in the habous (endowment) of the zawiya. These include: * The Jama Mqalqin, a small mosque where asylum seekers historically could stay, located northwest of the main zawiya building. * The Dar al-Qaytoun or Dar Zawiya, a small house reputed to be the former house of Idris II himself, where female asylum seekers or refugees could stay, located on the south side of the Jama Mqalqin. * An abattoir, located on the north side of the zawiya and near the Kissaria. * The house of the khatib (preacher), located on the south side of the zawiya and notable for the raised passage above the street which connects it directly to the zawiya itself. * The Tomb of Lalla Kenza, reputedly the mother of Idris II but possibly another Idrisid woman who owned a shop here and was later permitted to be buried here. It is located in the Derb Dellala street on the west side of the zawiya. The Zawiya of Moulay Idris was not the only one in the city to have the privileged status of a horm. Other major Sufi sanctuaries in the city, often associated with a particular founder, also offered asylum in this way. These other sanctuaries were the Zawiya of Sidi Abdelkader al- Fassi, the Zawiya of Sidi Ahmed esh-Shawi, the Zawiya of Sidi Ali Boughaleb, the Zawiya of Moulay Ahmed es-Skalli, and the Zawiya of Sidi Ahmed at-Tijani.  Architecture  The most monumental entrance portal of the zawiya building is on its north side, at the foot of the minaret and at the end of a lane leading directly off the major souq street of Tala'a Kebira. This entrance leads into the sahn or main courtyard, which includes a central fountain of white marble dating from the reign of Moulay Ismail (18th century) as well as wall fountains used for ablutions (washing and ritual purification). At the south end of the courtyard stands the large mausoleum chamber, where Moulay Idris II's tomb is located. The walls and the mihrab of the chamber are richly decorated with carved and painted stucco, mosaic tiles (zellij), and white and black marble columns. The ceiling of the chamber is a large wooden dome, probably composed of hundreds or thousands of small wooden pieces fitted together to create a star-like pattern, as is typical of Moorish-Moroccan architecture. The tomb itself is covered by a wooden baldaquin incrusted with gold and copper and elaborately decorated with gold Arabic calligraphy. The mausoleum can also be directly accessed through a set of cedar-wood doors on the west side of the building, via an equally richly decorated vestibule. (These doors are also the closest that non-Muslims can get to the Mausoleum's interior.) The east side of the complex, adjacent to the courtyard and the mausoleum, is a roofed hypostyle space for prayer, including the mosque space built by Sultan Abd al-Rahman in 1824. A number of ornate marble columns, capitals, and panels throughout the complex, as well as an ornate marble arch for the window of the muwaqqit's or timekeeper's chamber (Dar al-Muwaqqit) overlooking the courtyard, all appear to be Saadi in origin, probably stripped by Moulay Ismail from Saadi palaces like the famous el-Badi in Marrakech and re-used in new prestigious buildings elsewhere. There are several smaller entrances and other elements along the outside of the building, usually marked with intricate decoration. Notably, the external south wall of the building features a grilled window which connects directly to the tomb and where passing Muslims can offer short prayers to bless Moulay Idriss II. Next to this, there is also a small slot opening where passersby may give money as zakat (alms) for the zawiya.

The zawiya has for centuries played a role in the yearly celebration of Mouloud (the anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad's birth), notably as the starting point for the procession of the city's artisans' guilds, which still takes place today.

This hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price for the option, as returned by the Black‚ÄìScholes formula. Financial interpretation of the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE The equation has a concrete interpretation that is often used by practitioners and is the basis for the common derivation given in the next subsection. The equation can be rewritten in the form: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2} = rV -rS\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} The left-hand side consists of a \\"time decay\\" term, the change in derivative value with respect to time, called theta, and a term involving the second spatial derivative gamma, the convexity of the derivative value with respect to the underlying value. The right-hand side is the riskless return from a long position in the derivative and a short position consisting of \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} shares of the underlying. Black and Scholes' insight is that the portfolio represented by the right-hand side is riskless: thus the equation says that the riskless return over any infinitesimal time interval, can be expressed as the sum of theta and a term incorporating gamma. For an option, theta is typically negative, reflecting the loss in value due to having less time for exercising the option (for a European call on an underlying without dividends, it is always negative). Gamma is typically positive and so the gamma term reflects the gains in holding the option. The equation states that over any infinitesimal time interval the loss from theta and the gain from the gamma term offset each other, so that the result is a return at the riskless rate. From the viewpoint of the option issuer, e.g. an investment bank, the gamma term is the cost of hedging the option. (Since gamma is the greatest when the spot price of the underlying is near the strike price of the option, the seller's hedging costs are the greatest in that circumstance.) Derivation of the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE The following derivation is given in Hull's Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives. That, in turn, is based on the classic argument in the original Black‚ÄìScholes paper. Per the model assumptions above, the price of the underlying asset (typically a stock) follows a geometric Brownian motion. That is :\\\\frac{dS}{S} = \\\\mu \\\\,dt + \\\\sigma \\\\,dW\\\\, where W is a stochastic variable (Brownian motion). Note that W, and consequently its infinitesimal increment dW, represents the only source of uncertainty in the price history of the stock. Intuitively, W(t) is a process that \\"wiggles up and down\\" in such a random way that its expected change over any time interval is 0. (In addition, its variance over time T is equal to T; see ); a good discrete analogue for W is a simple random walk. Thus the above equation states that the infinitesimal rate of return on the stock has an expected value of Œº dt and a variance of \\\\sigma^2 dt . The payoff of an option V(S,T) at maturity is known. To find its value at an earlier time we need to know how V evolves as a function of S and t. By It√¥'s lemma for two variables we have :dV = \\\\left(\\\\mu S \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2}\\\\right)dt + \\\\sigma S \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S}\\\\,dW Now consider a certain portfolio, called the delta-hedge portfolio, consisting of being short one option and long \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} shares at time t. The value of these holdings is :\\\\Pi = -V + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S}S Over the time period [t,t+\\\\Delta t], the total profit or loss from changes in the values of the holdings is (but see note below): :\\\\Delta \\\\Pi = -\\\\Delta V + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S}\\\\,\\\\Delta S Now discretize the equations for dS/S and dV by replacing differentials with deltas: :\\\\Delta S = \\\\mu S \\\\,\\\\Delta t + \\\\sigma S\\\\,\\\\Delta W\\\\, :\\\\Delta V = \\\\left(\\\\mu S \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2}\\\\right)\\\\Delta t + \\\\sigma S \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S}\\\\,\\\\Delta W and appropriately substitute them into the expression for \\\\Delta \\\\Pi: :\\\\Delta \\\\Pi = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2}\\\\right)\\\\Delta t Notice that the \\\\Delta W term has vanished. Thus uncertainty has been eliminated and the portfolio is effectively riskless. The rate of return on this portfolio must be equal to the rate of return on any other riskless instrument; otherwise, there would be opportunities for arbitrage. Now assuming the risk-free rate of return is r we must have over the time period [t,t+\\\\Delta t] :r\\\\Pi\\\\,\\\\Delta t = \\\\Delta \\\\Pi If we now equate our two formulas for \\\\Delta\\\\Pi we obtain: :\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2}\\\\right)\\\\Delta t = r\\\\left(-V + S\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S}\\\\right)\\\\Delta t Simplifying, we arrive at the celebrated Black‚ÄìScholes partial differential equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 S^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial S^2} + rS\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial S} - rV = 0 With the assumptions of the Black‚ÄìScholes model, this second order partial differential equation holds for any type of option as long as its price function V is twice differentiable with respect to S and once with respect to t. Different pricing formulae for various options will arise from the choice of payoff function at expiry and appropriate boundary conditions. Technical note: A subtlety obscured by the discretization approach above is that the infinitesimal change in the portfolio value was due to only the infinitesimal changes in the values of the assets being held, not changes in the positions in the assets. In other words, the portfolio was assumed to be self-financing. Alternative derivation Here is an alternative derivation that can be utilized in situations where it is initially unclear what the hedging portfolio should be. (For a reference, see 6.4 of Shreve vol II). In the Black‚ÄìScholes model, assuming we have picked the risk-neutral probability measure, the underlying stock price S(t) is assumed to evolve as a geometric Brownian motion: : \\\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = r\\\\ dt + \\\\sigma dW(t) Since this stochastic differential equation (SDE) shows the stock price evolution is Markovian, any derivative on this underlying is a function of time t and the stock price at the current time, S(t). Then an application of Ito's lemma gives an SDE for the discounted derivative process \\\\exp(-rt)V(t, S(t)), which should be a martingale. In order for that to hold, the drift term must be zero, which implies the Black‚ÄîScholes PDE. This derivation is basically an application of the Feynman-Kac formula and can be attempted whenever the underlying asset(s) evolve according to given SDE(s). Solving the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE Once the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE, with boundary and terminal conditions, is derived for a derivative, the PDE can be solved numerically using standard methods of numerical analysis,\\"A Fast, Stable and Accurate Numerical Method for the Black-Scholes Equation of American Options\\" International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance, Vol. 11, No. 5, pp. 471-501, 2008, April 20, 2010 such as a type of finite difference method.Finite Difference Schemes that Achieve Dynamical Consistency for Population Models Thirteenth Virginia L. Chatelain Memorial Lecture presented by Talitha Washington at Kansas State University on November 9, 2017 In certain cases, it is possible to solve for an exact formula, such as in the case of a European call, which was done by Black and Scholes. To do this for a call option, recall the PDE above has boundary conditions :\\\\begin{align} C(0, t) &= 0\\\\text{ for all }t \\\\\\\\\\\\ C(S, t) &\\\\rightarrow S\\\\text{ as }S \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty \\\\\\\\\\\\ C(S, T) &= \\\\max\\\\\\\\{S - K, 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} The last condition gives the value of the option at the time that the option matures. Other conditions are possible as S goes to 0 or infinity. For example, common conditions utilized in other situations are to choose delta to vanish as S goes to 0 and gamma to vanish as S goes to infinity; these will give the same formula as the conditions above (in general, differing boundary conditions will give different solutions, so some financial insight should be utilized to pick suitable conditions for the situation at hand). The solution of the PDE gives the value of the option at any earlier time, \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left[\\\\max\\\\\\\\{S-K,0\\\\\\\\}\\\\right]. To solve the PDE we recognize that it is a Cauchy‚ÄìEuler equation which can be transformed into a diffusion equation by introducing the change-of-variable transformation :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tau &= T - t \\\\\\\\\\\\ u &= Ce^{r\\\\tau} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x &= \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{S}{K}\\\\right) + \\\\left(r - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2\\\\right)\\\\tau \\\\end{align} Then the Black‚ÄìScholes PDE becomes a diffusion equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial\\\\tau} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^{2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} The terminal condition C(S, T) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{S - K, 0\\\\\\\\} now becomes an initial condition :u(x, 0) = u_0(x) := K(e^{\\\\max\\\\\\\\{x, 0\\\\\\\\}} - 1) = K\\\\left(e^{x}-1\\\\right)H(x), where H(x) is the Heaviside step function. The Heaviside function corresponds to enforcement of the boundary data in the S, t coordinate system that requires when t = T, :C(S,\\\\,T)=0\\\\quad\\\\forall\\\\;\\\\;S, assuming both S, K > 0. With this assumption, it is equivalent to the max function over all x in the real numbers, with the exception of x = 0. The equality above between the max function and the Heaviside function is in the sense of distributions because it does not hold for x = 0. Though subtle, this is important because the Heaviside function need not be finite at x = 0, or even defined for that matter. For more on the value of the Heaviside function at x = 0, see the section \\"Zero Argument\\" in the article Heaviside step function. Using the standard convolution method for solving a diffusion equation given an initial value function, u(x, 0), we have :u(x, \\\\tau) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\tau}}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}{u_0 (y)\\\\exp{\\\\left[-\\\\frac{(x - y)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2 \\\\tau}\\\\right]}}\\\\,dy, which, after some manipulation, yields :u(x, \\\\tau) = Ke^{x + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sigma^2 \\\\tau}N(d_1) - KN(d_2) , where N(\\\\cdot) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and :\\\\begin{align} d_1 &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}} \\\\left[\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^{2}\\\\tau\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 \\\\tau\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_2 &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\tau}} \\\\left[\\\\left(x + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^{2}\\\\tau\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 \\\\tau\\\\right] . \\\\end{align} These are the same solutions (up to time translation) that were obtained by Fischer Black in 1976, equations (16) p. 177.Black, Fischer S. \\"The Pricing of Commodity Contracts\\" Journal of Financial Economics, 3, pp. 167-179, 1976, reference added August 3, 2019 Reverting u, x, \\\\tau to the original set of variables yields the above stated solution to the Black‚ÄìScholes equation. :The asymptotic condition can now be realized. :u(x,\\\\,\\\\tau) \\\\overset{x\\\\rightsquigarrow\\\\infty}{\\\\asymp} Ke^x, which gives simply S when reverting to the original coordinates. :\\\\lim_{x\\\\to\\\\infty} N(x)=1.

Emirati passports issued since 11 December 2011 have been biometric passports. The UAE is the second GCC state (after Qatar) to issue such passports. The cost of an Emirati passport is AED 50 (US$13.60). History Prior to the formation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, each constituting emirate issued its own passports or travel documents. These documents were printed in both Arabic and English and often made a reference to the issuing emirate and its ruling sheikh. Types There are a number of types of Emirati passports:Title 2 of Federal Law No. 17 of 1972 Concerning Nationality and Passports * Regular Passport (navy blue cover): issued to UAE citizens. * Special Passport (green cover): issued to members of the Federal National Council, members of the royal family, and retired high-ranking government officials and their families. The passport can also be issued by a federal decision from the Supreme Federal Council to Emirati state representatives. This passport has the same visa regime as the diplomatic passport. * Diplomatic Passport (red cover): issued to diplomats serving in Emirati embassies abroad and to high-ranking officials from the executive branch and their families during their period of service. * Service or Temporary Passport (cyan cover): issued to citizens and non-citizens for a specific period of time to perform a service or a particular task of interest to the state. This passport if issued to non-citizens does not bestow a right of abode in the UAE. * Emergency Passport (grey cover): issued to citizens of the UAE who lost their passport abroad or lost their identity card in the GCC or their passport expired abroad or issued in times of a natural disaster or evacuation. Physical appearance The first and last pages are made of hard paper, thicker than that of the old passport‚Äîa measure that allows it to remain in good shape until the passport expires. The first page contains a watercolour outline of the outer frame of Sheikh Zayed Mosque and the last page contains a drawing of the actual mosque with domes and columns. The passport identity page has all the particulars printed and laminated. The new passports contain data to resolve name duplication, which is one of the biggest issues that existed with old passports. http://dnrd.ae/ar/Services/ServicesGuide/s/AudianceService.aspx?AudianceId=1&ServiceId;=10 Like passports of other states whose official language is written from right- to-left, the Emirati passport is similarly opened from the left-hand side. Generic design On the front cover of the each passport type, there is a representation of the coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates in the centre. The coat of arms was modified in 2008, and passports issued afterwards incorporated the new design. \\"United Arab Emirates\\" (in (in Arabic calligraphy) and in English) appears above the coat of arms. Regular passports have in Arabic calligraphy and \\"PASSPORT\\" in English below the coat of arms. Special passports have in Arabic calligraphy and \\"SPECIAL PASSPORT\\" in English below the coat of arms. Diplomatic passports have in Arabic calligraphy and \\"DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT\\" in English below the coat of arms. A biometric passport has the biometric passport e-passport symbol 20px at the bottom. There are 62 pages in all biometric passport. Identity Information page The second page of an Emirati passport is security laminated and includes the following data: * Photo of passport owner * Type of document (P = passport) * Code for issuing country (ARE = United Arab Emirates) * Passport number (9 alphanumeric digits, chosen from numerals 0‚Äì9 and letters C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. Thus, \\"0\\" denotes the numeral, not the letter \\"O\\".) * Full Name * Date of birth * Sex * Nationality * Place of birth * Date of issue * Date of expiry * Authority that issued the passport * Owner's signature The page ends with a 2-line machine readable zone, according to ICAO standard 9303. The country code is ARE as is the standard country code for United Arab Emirates (according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3). Languages The data/information page is printed bilingually in both Arabic and English in all fields except for a white label in the next-to-last page in the passport which contains the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Interior emblem and documents the citizen's military specific claim number and uniform number. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Emirati citizens Visa requirements for Emirati citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the UAE. According to the Henley Passport Index , Emirati citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the Emirati passport 15th in the world in terms of travel freedom. However, according to The Passport Index, an online tool which uses a slightly different ranking system, the UAE passport ranks first in the world, with access to 178 countries. The Emirati passport is one of five passports with the greatest improvement in visa-free rating in the 2006‚Äì2016 time period. In terms of the number of countries its holders can visit visa-free, the Emirati passport is one of five passports with the most improved rating globally since 2006. In 2018, the Emirati passport became the largest individual climber in the Henley Passport Index over the past decade, increasing its global rank by 28 places. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation plans to make the UAE passport one of the five strongest passports in the world by 2021. According to The Passport Index, this goal was achieved by December 2018, ranking the Emirati passport as the strongest passport in the world with a visa-free score of 170. However Henley Passport Index ranking the Emirati passport 15th in the world in terms of travel freedom based on a different criteria.

It was the third in a series of International Festivals of the Sea held in the United Kingdom since 1996. The event allowed people to walk around the Naval Base, to go on board many of the visiting vessels, including several vessels belonging to the Royal Navy. It also allowed people to visit the historic dockyard, including HMS Victory and Mary Rose. There were also many maritime displays, street entertainers, military bands, music concerts and unique shops. According to the event's patron, Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal, the festival was a \\"celebration of all things maritime\\". History The first International Festival of the Sea took place in Bristol in 1996 with the Royal Navy as primary participants. Following the declining numbers of visitors to Portsmouth Navy Day's encouraged the Royal Navy to invite the festival to Portsmouth for the first time in 1998. The event was highly successful with over 200,000 visitors. So the festival returned in 2001. Special Events Many events were held during the four days of the festival. Most of the spectacular events were military in genre, some displaying the most modern of hardware, whilst others showed of historical equipment. Other events, such as concerts and children's activities. Operation Island Storm The main military event of the festival was Operation Island Storm, a demonstration of British military ability confronted by a situation most likely in today's world. It involved a hostage situation off the West African coast, and the Royal Marines operation to free them. A specially constructed island in the harbour was the site of the action, which was held every afternoon of the event.

A pioneer in Portland's early craft brewing scene, it was known as MacTarnahan's Brewing Company from 2004 to 2013 before resuming its original name. It is currently owned by Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. History Portland Brewing Company was founded in 1986 by Fred Bowman, Art Larrance and Jim Goodwin; shareholder Robert Malcolm \\"Mac\\" MacTarnahan invested $25,000 and was a major backer of the company. In 1992 the brewery named a beer in his honor, MacTarnahan‚Äôs Amber Ale, which quickly became their flagship. MacTarnahan rescued the company from financial straits in 1998 by buying $3.5 million in debt in exchange for stock; as a result Portland Brewing began using MacTarnahan labeling. Portland Brewing Company merged with Saxer Brewing Company of Lake Oswego in 2000. In 2004, MacTarnahan, then 88 years old, sold the company to Pyramid Breweries of Seattle. The Portland Brewing facility was renamed MacTarnahan's Brewing Company, and continued its operation and product line. MacTarnahan died later that year. In 2008 Pyramid itself was acquired by Magic Hat Brewing Company. This was subsequently bought by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York in 2010 and by Costa Rican company Florida Ice & Farm Co. in 2012. In 2013 the brewery announced it would return to the Portland Brewing Company name. Beers Beers made by Portland Brewing have won many awards over the years, including gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival, gold, silver, and bronze medals at the World Beer Championships, and a silver medal at the world beer cup in 2016. Beers made by Portland Brewing include MacTarnahan's Amber Ale, Noble Scot Scottish style ale, and BlackWatch Cream Porter. Governator Ale Governator Ale was an American Extra special bitter made in 2004 to commemorate the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger as Governor of California. The product was discontinued shortly after its introduction in response to complaints from Schwarzenegger's attorneys. Jerome Chicvara, then CEO of Portland Brewing Co., had the idea of producing beer as a \\"tribute\\" to Schwarzenegger, while joking with his children and their friends. The name 'Governator' is a popular humorous portmanteau alluding to the seeming disparity between Schwarzenegger's former signature role as the violent robotic Terminator character in the film franchise of that name on the one hand, and politician on the other. The CEO commented that unlike other novelty beers, it was designed as a quality product, not a \\"girl-man beer\\". The Oregon brewery obtained federal approval for its liquor label (a requirement in the United States), produced 3,200 cases of 22-ounce bottles, and began distributing the beer to stores in the California market. The label, which identified the maker as the fictitious \\"Pumping Iron Brewing\\", was designed as a generic-looking male bodybuilder viewed from behind, without including Schwarzenegger's actual likeness. Nevertheless, Schwarzenegger's lawyers, who had been looking for unauthorized exploitation of what they considered the governor's right of publicity, objected and demanded that production cease. In response, the brewery, which had recently been purchased by Pyramid Breweries, Inc., stopped making the beer in early 2004.

SIWA explored the possibility of becoming a branch of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA), but decided against it. At SIWA's Inaugural Meeting, the General Secretary of IWA welcomed the setting up of a separate Scottish organisation.

It is a specialist Sports College and 15% of its 1081 pupils are selected on musical aptitude. The school was founded as a non-selective secondary modern foundation school before gaining academy status in 2010. Location The school is on the London Road estate in the west of the city. The high school and primary school are collectively known as The Canterbury Campus. The Canterbury Adult Education Centre is now on the same site. Academic selection Kent is the largest county in England to operate academic selection at the age of eleven. Children in Kent sit the Kent test (eleven plus) to determine whether they are suitable for a academic education, or for a modern education. In a country that abandoned selection in 1967, this is an anachronism. No new grammar schools may be built, though existing grammar schools may expand or open annexes. In Canterbury there are few mixed grammar school places though an undoubted need . The Canterbury Academy is legally deemed to be a non-selective school but has a close working partnership with the grammar school, Simon Langton Boys. Together they run a mixed grammar school band within the Canterbury Academy Comprehensive School.  Academics Middle school (years 7- 9) The school is obliged to teach to the National Curriculum (England) as are all state funded schools. They follow a 3-year Key Stage 3, which prescribes a broad based course of study, weighted to Maths, English and Science with a humanity and a modern foreign language. These are the subjects chosen as the English Baccalaureate. The school quotes Section 89(1)(d) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 which gives schools the legal right to ensure that pupils complete any tasks 'reasonably assigned to them', to set two types of obligatory homework. EH (examination homework) task will be marked and given a GCSE type grade, while Love of Learning homework allow the students to develop other areas of interest. Throughout Key Stage 3 students are, to use the schools terminology offered 'Pillar Lessons', a series of stand alone lessons in separate disciplines- such as Hair, Forensic Science, Photography, Musical theatre. These taster lessons lead into exam options offered at Key Stage 4. Senior School (years 10-11) Students are encouraged but not forced to study the English Baccalaureate. All students work towards at least 8 GCSEs, or equivalents. They follow a core curriculum of English Language, English Literature, maths, statistics, science, history or geography with core PE and learning skills. In addition, options include RE, languages, computing, dance, drama, music, art, design technology, resistant materials food, sport,business and enterprise, social sciences, childcare, health and socialcare, hair and beauty, photography, and construction. This is achieved by having extended lessons after the Middle School day has finished. Sixth Form (years 12-13) =The Four Pillars= The school sees its self as built on Four Pillars of Excellence, that reflect the specialisms it has built up in the past. They are *Academic- bolstered with it partnership with Simon Langton Boys *Practical- which includes the manual skills, NVQs City and Guilds but alslthe Business and Enterprise skills that come through BTEC and bolstered by the Peter Jones Business Academy *Elite Sporting facilities with partners in Rugby, Hockey, Cricket, Golf, Triathlon sharing training facilities *Performance Arts with programs in Acting, Dance, Music, Musical theatre and Production skills.

It is classed as a Marilyn, and is the highest point in the Shetland Islands at an elevation of . A Neolithic chambered cairn is located near the summit. Location Ronas Hill (, meaning stony ground or scree) is on the Northmavine peninsula of Mainland, Shetland, at . The Norse name certainly describes the hilltop. Ronas Hill also gives its name to Ronas Voe, which it sits adjacent to. On a clear day, much of Shetland can be seen from the summit. It looks over Yell Sound, the North Sea, across to the Atlantic Ocean and even the highest points of Fair Isle. Botany Ronas Hill is a Ramsar site, containing many rare Arctic plants. Peculiarly for Shetland, there are several species of woodland fungi, notably ceps and chanterelles, which normally grow on the roots of deciduous trees (notable by their absence on Ronas Hill). Here, they are associated with creeping willow, which grows extensively on the hill. Chambered cairn On top of the hill, there is a Neolithic chambered cairn, unusual for its position on top of a hill. Most surviving Neolithic British cairns are sited in prominent places, but not generally on the top of taller hills. According to local farmers, until the construction of Sullom Voe Terminal in the mid-1970s, the cairn contained a variety of \\"sacrifice\\" items, such as coins (some \\"very old\\") and other items. Before that time, Ronas Hill would have been far off the beaten track. Ronas Hill cairn shows evidence of substantial rebuilding of its upper structure, as evidenced by the lack of lichen on stones above the entry passage and main cyst. The current peak of pink granite stones is clearly visible from the valley below and may have been raised in height to serve as a \\"mede\\" or fishing mark in past centuries. The cairn was certainly altered by soldiers during a military exercise in the 1960s, when a wall was built around its entrance to turn it into a foxhole.

Each usually strums a national instrument (qomuz in the case of the Kyrgyz, dombra in the case of the Kazakhs), and they respond to each other in spontaneous rhyming verse on a range of topics. They may make backhanded political statements, criticise each other's style, flirt (if of the opposite sex), and flat-out insult one another, but it is all done in good humour: Kyrgyz aqyns even often state that one must have good intentions to be a good aqyn. Because of this, it is a commonly held belief that one cannot hold what an aqyn says against them, and the only way for one aqyn to \\"get back at\\" another aqyn is to attempt to outdo them at aytysh. Despite the custom to allow aqyns all forms of slander, there are known cases of aqyns in Kazakhstan being threatened for making political statements against the president. Kyrgyz aqyns claim that it is important to be aware of their audience to perform well, and hence, some find it difficult to perform in isolation (e.g., in a studio without a live audience).

America's Next Top Model Joseph was the sixth contestant to be selected to participate on the seventh cycle of America's Next Top Model and was told at casting by host Tyra Banks that she was one of the most physically beautiful contestants to ever participate in the competition. While she was often praised for the quality of her portfolio, her lack of self-confidence was often noted by the judging panel and she was eliminated after refusing to fully participate in a challenge that required her to perform a task while portraying a random emotion (dance aggressively), ranking seventh. Joseph stirred some controversy when she made comments about the fact that people with lighter hair, skin or eyes were perceived as better looking in India, when asked about her blue contacts by Tyra Banks, and that she wanted to persevere through those stereotypes. She was voted CoverGirl of the Week by the viewers during the third and fourth episode.

Glenburn has three primary schools (Bushes Primary, Langcraigs Primary and St. Peter's Primary). A public library and many shops can be found at Skye Crescent. Other shops can be found in Glenburn on Braehead Road and Glenburn Road. Glenburn is also close to Foxbar, another suburb in Paisley. A new agreement has been launched to help take forward the regeneration of Glenburn in Paisley. The Glenburn Estate Management Agreement brings together the community and a number of organisations to work together so that the area continues to improve for the benefit of the community. Organisations involved in housing, regeneration, planning and environmental issues have pledged to deliver services to agreed standards. And the organisations involved have pledged that promoting community involvement developing services is \\"a priority.\\" Councillor Brian Lawson, Renfrewshire Council's previous housing spokesperson, welcomed the new agreement, saying: \\"The development of this agreement is a positive step for Glenburn. It's important that the council and other organisations working in the area have worked together to deliver agreed levels of service. It is equally important that the community of Glenburn plays its part in helping the agreement work properly for the benefit of everyone living in the area.\\" Shirley MacLean of Glenburn Community Forum and the local tenants' and residents' association said: \\"A lot of hard work, time and effort has gone into the production of this agreement. The estate management agreement will prove to be an invaluable tool for the people of Glenburn as it is full of relevant and very useful information together with contact details in one easy to read document. I'm sure that the benefits of the agreement will speak for themselves.\\" Among the services and issues which are covered in the estate management agreement are: housing; land maintenance; street cleaning; community policing; roads and pavements; utility services; and ways of enabling the community to have a greater responsibility for the local environment. Glenburn is the latest community in Renfrewshire to benefit from an estate management agreement following on from Ferguslie, Moorpark, Foxbar and West Johnstone.

Spitfire V of the 309th Fighter Squadron The 309th Fighter Squadron (309 FS) is part of the 56th Operations Group at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. It operates the F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft conducting advanced fighter training. Mission The 309th FS (\\"Wild Ducks\\", Tailband: Blue & White), flies F-16C and F-16D aircraft drawn from production block 25 conducting F-16 crew training for active duty USAF pilots. History World War II Initially established under Third Air Force in early 1942 as a fighter squadron at Baer Field, Indiana, flying some antisubmarine patrols in the Gulf of Mexico. Deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in June 1942 without aircraft as its Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and Bell P-39 Airacobras were deemed unsuitable for use against German aircraft in long- range bomber escort duties. Was re-equipped with RAF Spitfire Vs and its pilots and technicians spent a two-month period undergoing intensive training in flying and fighting with RAF pilots in the British aircraft from airfields in southeast England. The squadron flew its first combat mission on 18 August 1942, when it attacked enemy positions in occupied France. Assigned to the new Twelfth Air Force and deployed to Gibraltar in November 1942 as part of the Operation Torch invasion forces, initially operating from former Vichy French airfields in Algeria. Advanced east across Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign, supporting the Fifth United States Army which halted Field Marshal Rommel's advance on allied positions. Spitfires from the squadron provided support for Allied Forces as the Invasion of Italy began with the capture of Sicily, and later the landings by Allied forces in Fascist Italy, moving north supporting the Fifth Army during the Italian Campaign. As Allied bomber forces operating from Italy began the strategic bombing of Axis petroleum and communications facilities in central Europe and the Balkans, the squadron was re-equipped with the North American P-51 Mustang to replace the shorter-ranged Spitfire. In August 1944, the P-51's were involved in the invasion of Southern France. By war's end, the squadron had earned two Distinguished Unit Citations and was involved in eight campaigns The squadron was largely demobilized during the summer of 1945 in Europe, a skeleton force returned to Drew Field, Florida in August, inactivating largely as an administrative unit in November. Reactivated from elements of several inactivating organizations in Germany in August 1946, Performed occupation duty and operating early-model P-80A Shooting Star jets from former Luftwaffe jet-capable airfields at AAF Station Giebelstadt and AAF Station Kitzingen. Returned to the United States in June 1947 without personnel or equipment which remained in Germany. Cold War Assigned to Strategic Air Command at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia as a fighter-escort squadron, equipped with straight-winged Republic F-84E Thunderjets. Assigned to Turner Air Force Base, Georgia with mission of long-range escort of Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, later Boeing B-50 Superfortress and Convair B-36 Peacemakers as newer aircraft came into operation by SAC. Relieved from assignment to SAC and made non-operational in 1957 with phaseout of B-36 and end of SAC escort fighter concept. On 1 April 1957 the parent 31 SFW was transferred back to Tactical Air Command and moved to George Air Force Base, California. Trained in tactical air support of ground forces, deploying to NATO bases for operational exercises. Reassigned to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida after the Cuban Missile Crisis, late 1962 to provide air defense of South Florida. Was deployed to Southeast Asia, 1964 as part of advisory forces operating against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam. Reassigned back to TAC at Homestead AFB in 1970, as part of re-establishment of 31st TFW upon its return from duty in Southeast Asia. Equipped with McDonnell F-4E Phantom IIs. Was deployed to Thailand, July 1972, engaging North Vietnamese forces in northern South Vietnam in response to the communist spring offensive. Returned to the United States in the late fall 1972. For the next 20 years, performed routine training and tactical deployments from Homestead AFB. At the end of 1986 the squadron and wing changed tail codes from ZF to HS, which better matched the squadrons location in Homestead. Upgraded to the General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon in 1988, upgrading to receive Shaw AFB block 25s in August 1990. The Gulf War build-up and the 363rd TFW at Shaw Air Force Base deploying to Saudi Arabia meant no more block 25s were available. With some F-16A/B block 15s still in service for the 309th TFS, it continued to operate both types. When Desert Storm ended it was decided to convert the 31st TFW to block 40 F-16s instead. Up to that point about ten block 25s had reached the 309th FS. They were all sent to other units. Neither of the 31st TFW's other sister squadrons flew the block 25. In March 1991 the 309th began conversion to the block 40 version of the F-16. On 1 October 1991 the word 'Tactical' was dropped and the unit became the 309th Fighter Squadron. By early 1992 the conversion to block 40 F-16s with the general purpose role was complete. Modern era The squadron evacuated to Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, in August 1992, narrowly escaping the devastation of Hurricane Andrew. It was to be a temporary move to Moody, but Homestead was so heavily damaged it was never re-opened for any of the 31st FW squadrons After destruction of Homestead AFB, was reassigned permanently to the 363d Operations Group at Shaw. At this point the 'HS' tail code began to be replaced with a 'SW' tail code. When Shaw AFB began converting to the block 50 in 1993, even the 309th FS was involved receiving many examples. Although the squadron began converting to the block 50, it was short lived. The 20th FW at RAF Upper Heyford, England inactivated and moved its Wing and associate squadrons to Shaw AFB. On 31 December 1993 the 363d FW inactivated and the same day the 309th FS inactivated. Plans were already in the works which involved moving the 309th Fighter Squadron to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where it would continue its heritage, this time as a training squadron under the 56th Fighter Wing. The Air Force reactivated the squadron on 1 April 1994, as with the block 25 version of the Viper. The 309th produced 14 aces over the years, totaling 161 kills among them. The 309th also received numerous awards, including two Distinguished Unit Citations, one Presidential Unit Citation, two Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Combat \\"V\\" Device, two Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards, and one Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm. In addition, the squadron earned 25 campaign streamers from World War II through Southeast Asia. The squadron emblem is a 1944 Walt Disney production copyrighted design. It symbolizes the fighter mission celestial navigation pioneered by this squadron, its around-the-clock mission readiness, and its striking power. On 1 March 2014, the 311th Fighter Squadron was reactivated as a part of the also newly reactivated 54th Fighter Group at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. The 311th will operate F-16s currently flown by the 309th. Once all of the 309th's aircraft are transferred to Holloman, the squadron is planned to become inactivate for a time in preparation for Luke's transition to the F-35 Lightning II.

It is located within the Presidio of San Francisco, now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The tunnel carries California State Route 1 under a large hill and under the Presidio Golf Course. It connects Park Presidio Boulevard (Hwy 1) in the Richmond District to US 101 on the Doyle Drive viaduct, and the Golden Gate Bridge. History When the Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937, the approach for northbound traffic to Marin County was carried solely by Doyle Drive, from the east. Although a second approach from the south, known as the Funston Avenue approach, was included in the initial plans for the bridge, it was not ready in time for the opening; just a year after opening, traffic over the bridge had doubled by 1938, adding urgency to completing the Funston approach. In March 1936, General Paul Malone made clear the Army's position: that the Funston approach would include a tunnel or else the Army would not approve the planned route through the San Francisco Presidio. General George S. Simonds, the successor to Gen. Malone, indicated tentative approval of plans for a tunnel for the Funston approach in July 1936, but formal approval of the plans and a permit to begin construction were not signed until August 1938 as the plans that had been reviewed ‚Äì and the accompanying permission to construct on the Presidio ‚Äì were conceptual up to that point. The Redwood Empire Association called upon city and Golden Gate Bridge District directors to rename the Funston approach just before it opened in 1940, suggesting possibilities such as \\"Golden Gate Bridge Parkway,\\" \\"Golden Gate Bridge-Way,\\" and \\"Golden Gate Bridge‚ÄìRedwood Empire-way.\\" The completion of the Funston Avenue approach was celebrated with a two-day gala in April 1940. Tunnel design and construction Aerial photograph of the MacArthur Tunnel The construction contract for the Funston Avenue approach was awarded in September 1938 to Macco Construction company, who had built the approach for southbound traffic over the Waldo Grade. The Macco contract was awarded at their bid of and included the laying of a concrete tunnel long. The long tunnel accommodates a four-lane roadway. A tunnel was required because the land above the tunnel was being used by the Army for a parade ground and golf course, so leaving an open cut for the highway was impossible. It was constructed by a cut-and-cover sequence: excavating along the tunnel route, fitting steel arch forms, pouring concrete on top of the forms, and returning the fill to the top of the cured concrete. Fill removed from the initial excavation was stockpiled near Mountain Lake, which would serve as the southern drainage point for the Funston approach upon its completion, since the Army also required no drainage onto Presidio property. Tunnel sections were built in lengths, and work was started from each end of the tunnel, working towards the center, allowing two to three sections of tunnel to be completed per week. The open cut-and-cover method was deemed economical because of the relatively small amount of material that would need to be removed. During the construction of the tunnel, two tees and one green for the golf course were temporarily relocated, and a footbridge was constructed to allow golfers to cross the open cut. The tunnel was made as long as possible without having to add forced ventilation to dilute carbon monoxide from automobile exhaust, and a shaft was built mid-way along the tunnel to provide passive ventilation, with the capacity to add a fan later for forced exhaust through the shaft, if necessary. The steel arch forms had previously been used during the construction of the Bartlett Dam in Arizona. Construction of the tunnel began in October 1938 and was complete by January 1940; the Funston Avenue approach was dedicated for service on April 21, 1940. Dedication gala The Funston Avenue approach and the Nineteenth Avenue approach were both dedicated and opened for traffic on April 21, 1940, in themed ceremonies designed to promulgate friendly relations between the Pacific coast states and provinces of Canada, Mexico and the United States. Citizens from the North Bay and other northern counties were encouraged to participate in the opening ceremonies. Delegates from British Columbia; the states of California, Oregon, and Washington; and the consul general of Mexico all attended and spoke at the dedication ceremonies. New name In 1949, the tunnel was known locally as the Funston Avenue tunnel, taking its name from the approach. Other residents would call it the Park Presidio approach. Caltrans currently has two official names for the tunnel, which is designated 34-0016 under the National Bridge Inventory. The tunnel is known as both the Presidio Tunnel and the General Douglas MacArthur Tunnel, having added the MacArthur tunnel designation by Senate Concurrent Resolution 86, introduced by Milton Marks during the 1985‚Äì86 Legislative Session. Graffiti The top face of the south entrance to the tunnel is a popular target for graffiti artists due to broken barbed-wire fences. During the 2016 United States presidential campaign, taggers sprayed the words \\"SF VS TRUMP,\\" only to have the tag changed to \\"SF [hearts] TRUMP\\" a few days later.

At one point the French wine grape Barbaroux was thought to also be a Barbarossa grape but DNA evidence published in 2009 confirmed that the French Barbaroux grown in Provence was a separate variety distinct from, at least, the Barbarossa grapes grown in Piedmont and Liguria.D.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 83-84 Allen Lane 2012 History Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, also known as Frederick Barbarossa, who is said to be the namesake for the Barbarossa vine in Emilia- Romagna. The word Barbarossa is Italian for \\"red beard\\". According to legend in Emilia-Romagna, the grape was named after the red-bearded Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I (\\"Frederick Barbarossa\\") who spent time in the region during his many campaigns through Italy in the 12th century.Charles Scicolone \\"POURING EMILIA-ROMAGNA\\" Wine Enthusiast Magazine May 1st, 2002 However the earliest mention of a Barbarossa grape was not till 1600 when the Italian writer Giovanvettorio Soderini (also known under the pen name of Ciriegiulo) described a Tuscan wine grape under that name. As there are no current recorded plantings of a Barbarossa variety in Tuscany it is possible that Soderini's Barbarossa is extinct. Wine regions The provinces highlighted in red are regions where grape varieties known as Barbarossa are grown. Also highlighted in blue is the French island of Corsica, where the \\"Barbaroux\\" grape grown there may be identical to one of the Italian Barbarossa varieties. In the Ligurian provinces of Genoa and Savona a vine called \\"Barbarossa di Finalborgo\\" is grown and is also known under the synonyms of Verduna and Verdona. While DNA testing has shown this variety to be different from the Barbaroux grown in Provence, the French ampelographer Pierre Galet has speculated that the Ligurian Barbarossa may still be the same variety as the Corsican Barbaroux used in the appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e wines produced around Ajaccio. As of 2012, DNA profiling has not confirmed or disproved this theory. In Piedmont, a table grape known as Barbarossa du Pi√©mont is grown but not used for wine production. Galet has speculated that this variety is similar to the Barbaroux grown in Provence and used in the wines of the Cassis AOC, but DNA testing has showed that they are separate varieties. In the Apulia and Campania wine regions of southern Italy, two distinct grape vines called \\"Barbarossa\\" are grown. While DNA profiling has shown that the two varieties are distinct from each other, it is still not known how these vines relate to the Barbarossa grown in northern and central Italy. Some of the oldest Barbarossa vines in Italy are found in the Emilia-Romagna region, where a hundred-year-old vineyard owned by Fattoria Paradiso produces a varietal example of the grape. As with the southern Italian Barbarossas, testing still needs to be done to determine what kind of vines this Emilia-Romagna Barbarossa is.

He played hurling with his local club Mount Sion and with the Waterford senior inter-county team in the 1950s and 1960s. Early life Martin √ìg Morrissey was born in Waterford in 1934. He was educated locally at the famous Mount Sion School where his hurling skills were first developed. Morrissey captained the Mount Sion school team to win the Dr. Harty Cup in 1953. Playing career Club Morrissey played his club hurling with the famous Mount Sion club. Inter-county In 1957 Waterford reached the Munster final for the first time in almost a decade. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and were widely tipped to take the title. Waterford, however, outplayed ‚Äòthe Rebels‚Äô and took the title giving Morrissey his first Munster senior medal. Waterford later defeated Galway in the All- Ireland semi-final, setting up a championship decider with Kilkenny. With fifteen minutes left in the game Morrissey's side were leading ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by six points, however, Kilkenny fought back to win the game by a point on a score line of 4-10 to 3-12. In 1958 Waterford were classed as one-season wonders as they were trounced by Tipperary in the provincial championship. Morrissey's side bounced back in 1959 by reaching the final of the National Hurling League. Once again, Tipp had the upper hand and defeated Waterford. In spite of this Waterford went on to defeat Cork in the provincial final, giving Morrissey a second Munster medal. This victory allowed Waterford to advance to the All-Ireland final where Kilkenny provided the opposition once again. The game is regarded as one of the all-time classics. Waterford led by five points at the break; however, Kilkenny came back and led by a goal with time running out. Just then Waterford's S√©amus Power scored a goal for Waterford and the game ended in a draw. The replay four weeks later began badly for Morrissey's side, however, Waterford came back into the game and outclassed Kilkenny. The score line of 3-12 to 1-10 resulted in Morrissey collecting his first senior All-Ireland medal. Waterford surrendered their provincial title the following year and went into declined. In 1963 Morrissey's side defeated Munster rivals Tipperary and the exiles of New York to take the National league title. The 'home final' of the league turned out to be the provincial final, with Waterford defeating Tipperary in a low-scoring game giving Morrissey his third Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Waterford square up to Kilkenny for the third time in seven years. Once again, the game was regarded as a classic with 35 scores being recorded during the sixty minutes of play. Waterford trailed at half-time; however, they fought back in the second-half. The brilliance of Kilkenny's Ollie Walsh denied Waterford some more goals as Eddie Keher scored a record 0-14. The final score of 4-17 to 6-8 gave Kilkenny the victory and brought an end to Waterford's greatest hurling era. Morrissey retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.

The south portal is located just shy of Bush Street, which is about two blocks to the north of Union Square. The north portal is located just to the south of the Sacramento Street intersection. History The tunnel was primarily built for the streetcars of the now defunct F Stockton line. A petition was filed for a new streetcar line by Frank Stringham, representing an unnamed group of investors, with the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on January 23, 1909. Their intent was to create a nearly level route connecting North Beach with the downtown area. George Skaller later took credit for the initial push for a tunnel, saying that the city had studied the idea for at least 20 years, but would never be built as \\"all city enterprises, on account of the long and windy red tape connected with city enterprises\\" were doomed by bureaucracy. Stockton was favored over Grant, which was seen as too narrow, or Kearny, which already was franchised to the United Railways. Although Skaller initially hoped to raise private funding for the tunnel, the Board of Supervisors imposed a requirement allowing the city to take over the railway after ten years at its physical valuation, and no private investors were willing to fund the project. Instead, Skaller turned to the idea of public funding through a special assessment district, labeling the project as an \\"improvement\\" for existing roads. The Stockton Street Tunnel Association launched its fundraising campaign in May 1910, hoping to raise $450,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to cover construction costs by creating a special assessment district to fund the improvements. The estimated assessment for a lot was $62.50 (equivalent to $ in ) in 1910. The project adopted the slogan \\"The open door to North Beach\\" in May 1910. The Stockton Street Railway franchise was relinquished to the city in 1910, and suggestions were made that if ferries from Marin would land in North Beach instead of the Ferry Building, the resulting rise in local property values would offset the cost of the assessment. Two assessment districts were set up, in North Beach and Downtown, and projected traffic was estimated to reach 50,000 to 75,000 passengers per hour during the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition of 1915. The precedent set by the assessment districts for the Stockton Street Tunnel sparked interest in building a similar tunnel under Fillmore Street and leveling Rincon Hill to increase usable land, but these added works were not carried through. Final plans for the tunnel were filed by city engineer Marsden Manson in March 1912. By June 1912, the final legal and funding issues were being resolved, and work was to start \\"within 30 or 60 days.\\" In July 1913, excavation of the bore was planned to take 100 days. During construction, hotel guests were kept awake by work at night and at least one worker was killed by a cave-in. Revenue service through the tunnel was inaugurated by Mayor James Rolph on December 29, 1914. Design The tunnel was built to decrease the grade through the hill. Before the tunnel was built, the maximum grade along the route of Stockton north from its intersection with Sutter was 18% and the maximum grade south from the intersection with Sacramento was 12%. The tunnel was built with a maximum grade of 4.29% between Sacramento and Sutter. Initial plans in 1909 called for a tunnel long. The planned tunnel was shortened in 1910 to , with a width of and a height of , with stairways to connect the tunnel with Pine and California streets. The bore was narrowed slightly in 1912, with a total planned width of and a height of . Construction involved lowering Stockton Street near where it passes into the tunnel from the south, evidence for which can still be seen at the building of 417 Stockton Street (Mystic Hotel), where the basement became the ground floor and the former front door is now a visibly marked window bay on the second floor.

Sutil and Mexicana, during the Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano expedition made in 1792 in British Columbia (Canada). Drawing by Cardero Jos√© Cardero (also Josef Cardero) (1766 - after 1811) was a Spanish draughtsman and artist. He is most remembered for his work on the expedition of Alessandro Malaspina and the related expedition of Dionisio Alcal√° Galiano. During the Galiano voyage Cordero Channel was named in his honor. Other places in British Columbia were later named in his honor as well, including Dibuxante Point, \\"dibuxante\\" being Spanish for \\"draughtsman\\".  Biography  He was born in 1766 in √âcija, Spain. Nothing is known about Cardero's life until he sailed with Malaspina in 1789. He was a member of the crew of Malaspina's corvette, the Descubierta, perhaps as a servant. He showed an aptitude for drawing early in the voyage and after Juan del Pozo Bauz√°, one of the official artists, was discharged in Peru, Cardero began producing drawings regularly. In 1791, when the expedition was in Acapulco, New Spain (Mexico), Cardero was officially confirmed as an artist and map drawer of the expedition. He sailed with Malaspina to Alaska, where he made many drawings of the Tlingit. After returning to Mexico Malaspina assigned him to serve as an artist on the expedition of Galiano and Cayetano Vald√©s, both officers of Malaspina's who were given ships and the task of exploring the Strait of Georgia. Cardero sailed on Vald√©s's ship, the Mexicana, in 1792. During the voyage the Spanish met and worked with George Vancouver, who was exploring the Strait of Georgia for the British. Both expeditions sailed around Vancouver Island. Cardero's duties on the Galiano expedition included not only making drawings and fair copies of sketch maps, but serving in boat parties sent out to explore. After the voyage many of Cardero's drawings were copied and improved upon by other artists, especially the painter Fernando Brambila in Madrid. Brambila, who had never been to the Pacific Northwest, produced higher quality artwork but sometimes added unrealistic details. After the Galiano voyage, Cardero returned to Spain and worked with Vald√©s and Malaspina briefly. In 1795 he was reassigned as a Ship Accountant in the Spanish Navy and sent to C√°diz. His name appears on a list of permanent officers of the navy from 1797 to 1811, after which there is no further mention of him in known records. The reason for the removal of his name from the list of officers in 1811 is not known. Legacy Cordero Channel, originally Canal de Cardero, commemorates Jose Cardero. Cardero Street, in Vancouver's West End is named for the strait, and only as a result indirectly for Jose Cardero.

Repercussions In October 2007, the National Coalition of Latino Clergy filed a federal lawsuit, seeking to overturn the bill on the grounds that it was unconstitutional and violated rights to due process, but this was finally dismissed in December 2007 because the plaintiffs named in the suit didn't have standing to challenge the law.* In November 2007, CNN reported that many in Oklahoma's Latino community were staying home, fearful that police would arrest and deport them, and that this was impacting heavily on local businesses.* In June 2008, a federal judge issued an injunction against implementation of two parts of the bill which deal with the requirement of an employer to verify a worker's eligibility, and the requirement for businesses to verify the work authorization status of independent contractors. In December 2012, a final judgment was entered in the case following an appellate ruling, which preserves the requirement for government contractors to participate in E-Verify, but strikes the tax penalties for unverified independent contractors in Section 9 and the discrimination liability for retaining illegal aliens from Section 7.

He invented a variety of pieces of apparatus to deliver anaesthetics including ether and chloroform safely and controllably. By 1871 he had administered anaesthetics 13,000 times without a fatality. Clover assisted at surgery of public figures including Napoleon III, Princess Alexandra of Denmark and her husband King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales), Sir Robert Peel, and Florence Nightingale. His inventions included the bulky 'Clover's chloroform apparatus' (1862), with which he was often photographed; and the compact 'Clover's portable regulating ether inhaler' (1877), which remained in used well into the 20th century. With fellow pioneer John Snow, Clover is one of the supporters on the crest of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. Early life Clover was born in the town of Aylsham, Norfolk Rushman, page 27. to John Wright Clover, a draper and shopkeeper, and Elizabeth Mary Ann Clover (n√©e Peterson) John Wright Clover's second wife (married at Aylsham on 11 June 1821). He was educated at the Gray Friars' Priory School, Norwich. When he was 16, Clover was apprenticed as a surgical dresser to a local surgeon, Charles Gibson.Maltby, page 39. Clover enrolled to study medicine at University College Hospital in 1844, where Joseph Lister (the pioneer of antisepsis) was a fellow student. Career Posed photograph of Joseph Clover demonstrating his Chloroform apparatus on his father John Wright Clover in 1862 Clover became house surgeon to James Syme upon graduation in 1846. He became Resident Medical Officer at University College Hospital in 1848, and was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1850. Originally Clover developed an interest in the field of urology. He practised as a surgeon, inventing two instruments for the crushing and removal of bladder stones. Ill health caused him to give up in 1853 and he turned to general practice.City of Westminster green plaques He then worked as a general practitioner in 1853. He set up his practice at 3 Cavendish Place, London, which became his home until his death in 1882. After several years in general practice he devoted his practice to anaesthetics, and became \\"chloroformist\\" to the University College Hospital, the Westminster Hospital and the London Dental Hospital.Sykes, pages 8,30. Clover's choice of speciality helped to fill the vacancy created by the death of John Snow in 1858. Clover was probably present at Robert Liston's first operation under ether anaesthesia at University College Hospital in December 1846. Clover wrote in 1871 that he had given chloroform more than 7000 times, in addition to other anaesthetics in another 4000 cases, without a fatality. However, he lost a patient to chloroform under his hands in 1874, in a case which he described in the British Medical Journal.Sykes, page 30. Important cases Because of his expertise in anaesthesia, Clover was often sought out when important figures required surgery. He gave chloroform to Napoleon III of France on 2 January 1873, at Chislehurst, Kent, and again on 6 January, for a procedure to break up a bladder stone. The Emperor died on 9 January. Clover was a signatory to his autopsy report, together with five other physicians.Sykes, page 8. Clover gave chloroform to Alexandra of Denmark, who was then the Princess of Wales, in 1867, for the removal of a splint from a rheumatic knee, and later anaesthetised her husband Edward VII (who was then Prince of Wales) in 1877, for an operation to drain an abscess which was attributed to a hunting injury. Clover also administered general anaesthesia to Sir Robert Peel, Florence Nightingale Rushman, page 28. and Sir Erasmus Wilson. Apparatus Victorian journal illustration of Clover's portable regulating ether inhaler of 1877, showing 'This most ingenious and useful apparatus'. During his lifetime, Clover invented and improved a variety of pieces of medical apparatus, especially those for easier and safer anaesthesia. Some of these inventions bore his name, including: Clover's chloroform apparatus Clover's chloroform apparatus was invented in 1862. Chloroform, being much more potent than ether, was much easier to give in overdose. At a time when the anaesthetist was often an untrained assistant, many deaths occurred through accidental overdose. Clover's solution was a large reservoir bag of known capacity, lined with goldbeater's skin to make it airtight, into which a measured volume of chloroform liquid was placed. Inflating the bag to its capacity with a bellows provided a known, accurate and constant concentration of chloroform vapour in air, making delivery safer and more controllable.Rushman, page 57. A vaporiser was no longer necessary, but the bag was large and cumbersome. A dose of 20 minims (1.18 millilitres) of chloroform per 1000 cubic inches (16.38 litres) of air would provide a concentration of chloroform vapour of 2.25%. 30 minims (1.77ml) would give 3.37%, and 40 minims (2.36ml) would give 4.5%, which Clover believed was the maximum safe concentration. Many photographs of Clover, heavily bearded, depict his chloroform apparatus slung over his shoulder. Clover's ether inhaler Clover invented his portable ether inhaler in 1877. Judging by the illustration on the right, it was much admired at the time. It remained in use, modified in various ways, well into the 20th century.Duncum, 1947. Clover's crutch Clover's crutch was a device for maintaining the patient in the lithotomy position. Death Clover's health was fragile throughout his life. He died of uraemia aged 57. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. His grave is only 200 yards away from that of fellow anaesthetics pioneer, John Snow. Posthumous recognition Together with John Snow, Clover is one of the supporters on the crest of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. In 1949, the Royal College of Surgeons established the annual Joseph Clover Lecture in recognition of his contribution to anaesthesia. It was given annually until 1958 and every two years thereafter. A memorial plaque on the site of his clinic at 3 Cavendish Place, Marylebone, was unveiled on 2 March 1994.

Born in the Pera district of Constantinople, Bartholom√§us was the son of Ignatz Lorenz Freiherr von St√ºrmer, an Austrian diplomat in the Ottoman Empire, and the Baroness Elisabeth of Testa. In order to ensure a quality education, he was registered with the Akademie f√ºr Orientalische Sprachen (Academy of Eastern Languages) in Vienna in 1796. He rejoined his father in Constantinople in 1806. He was soon sent to the embassy in Saint Petersburg where he was made secretary of the legation in 1811. There he met Karl Philipp zu Schwarzenberg, whom he followed on trips to over 8000 places, including the important Congress of Ch√¢tillon (5 February‚Äì19 March 1814). In the spring of 1814 he met his future wife, a Frenchwoman, Ermance de Boutet. The convention of 2 August 1815, which confirmed that Napoleon Bonaparte was a British prisoner, stipulated that Austria had a right to send a representative to wherever the British decided to imprison the deposed emperor. The British chose the island of Saint Helena. St√ºrmer requested to be the Austrian official on the island and the emperor accepted. He arrived on Saint Helena on 17 June 1816 with his young wife on board HMS Orontes. His arrival was not appreciated by the British, and he soon saw the impossibility of fulfilling his mission, which was to ensure with his own eyes the presence of Bonaparte on the island, to denounce any attempt to escape and to write every month a report in agreement with the Prussian and Russian representatives. (From British records, a day- by-day record of St√ºrmer and his wife's lives on the island could be constructed.) In his letters, St√ºrmer returns on several occasions to the \\"uselessness\\" of his mission. During the two years he was on the island, he could never directly see Bonaparte. Although Bonparte's entourage frequently sought him out, St√ºrmer was under orders to avoid contact. St√ºrmer finally was eventually recalled and named ambassador plenipotentiary to the United States in Philadelphia. Before taking up his station, he obtained for his wife, \\"after two years and half of exile, of dislikes and sacrifices\\", the right to see her parents in France. After his American mission, he was sent to Rio de Janeiro. He then returned to Austria and remained without an assignment until 1832, when he was appointed ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, on account of his knowledge of the Turkish language. His eminent service got its reward in 1842, when he received the title of count. In 1850, St√ºrmer left Constantinople, retired to Italy and died in Venice in 1863.

The $225,000 film reportedly became the most profitable film of 1974 (in cost-to-gross ratio), earning $18.8 million in North AmericaMacon County Line, Box Office Information. The Numbers. Retrieved July 7, 2012. and over $30 million worldwide. The film is docudrama in tone. Although it was presented as \\"a true story\\" to attract a wider audience (much like the Hollywood revisionist film Walking Tall of 1973), its plot and characters are entirely fictional. Plot In 1954 Macon County, Georgia, brothers Chris (Alan Vint) and Wayne Dixon (Jesse Vint) from Chicago are on a two-week spree of cheap thrills throughout the South before their upcoming stint in the Air Force. Wayne entered the service when Chris was given the option of military duty in lieu of prison as the result of an earlier episode with the law. Driving through Louisiana, the brothers pick up hitchhiker Jenny Scott (Cheryl Waters), a pretty blond with a shady backstory that she would rather not discuss. Meanwhile, local backwater town sheriff Reed Morgan (Baer) is preparing to bring his son Luke (Leif Garrett) home from military school. Hunting season begins the next day and he buys Luke a new shotgun. When Chris, Jenny and Wayne experience car trouble, they must wait in Sheriff Morgan's town. Unable to repair the car themselves, they scrape together enough money to get it patched up by garage owner Hamp (Geoffrey Lewis). Waiting at the garage, they are informally threatened by Morgan, who says they could be picked up for vagrancy if they decide to stick around. Not interested in trouble, the brothers and Jenny head out once their car is running, but after another breakdown, they take refuge in Morgan's barn. Inside the house, Morgan's wife is brutally raped and murdered by two men who then kill a cop when pulled over. When Morgan returns home to find his wife dead, he pursues Chris, Wayne and Jenny, believing they must have been responsible. There is a running firefight during the chase. With Wayne and Jenny holed up in a boat hiding from Morgan, Chris sneaks out to try to start the boat's motor. A gunshot is heard, and Wayne and Jenny fear that Chris has been killed. Young Luke Morgan then enters the boat's cabin and shoots Wayne and Jenny. It is revealed that Morgan was killed during the firefight. Afterwards, a wounded Chris comes back to the boat to find his friends killed, and Luke being held by another policeman. The last scene is Chris in his car, finally repaired by Hamp, with the locals and police then watching him leave. The epilogue shows that Chris became a master sergeant in the Air Force, with a wife and three children. Luke spent the rest of his life in a mental hospital. Production notes While the poster advertising the film included the tagline \\"It shouldn't have happened. It couldn't have happened. But it did,\\" and the title card states that it is a true story (and several reviewers have stated the same), director Richard Compton and producer Max Baer have said that they wrote the original story without any basis in historic events.James Newman. \\"Macon County Line\\", imagesjournal.com. Retrieved on 2008-06-29. The film is one of several so- called \\"drive-in\\" films that were presented as true stories (√† la 1972's The Legend of Boggy Creek, 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and 1976's Jackson County Jail and The Town That Dreaded Sundown). In each case, most, if not all, of what was portrayed on screen was fictional (with the exception of The Town That Dreaded Sundown, which was inspired by the Texarkana Moonlight Murders of 1946). Alan Vint and Jesse Vint, who played brothers Chris and Wayne Dixon onscreen, are brothers. Reception The film earned $10 million in rentals in North America.\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976 p 44 Home video releases Anchor Bay released the film on both VHS and DVD in February 2000.

It is located on the edge of the Mogollon Rim and is in close proximity to several recreational lakes within the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, and is named for such. Forest Lakes had previously been named Merzville. History The area that would become Forest Lakes began as a mining operation in 1939 when the Denison family began mining manganese in the area. Heavy demand for the metal from the United States federal government helped ensure steady mining operations into the 1960s, when the family turned to logging to sustain their income. In May 1964, the land was subdivided into the first Forest Lakes Estates subdivision unit, and the homeowners association, the Forest Lakes Owners Association, was organized. With the construction of numerous recreational lakes in the area, demand for vacation homes grew and spurred the creation of 10 additional units to the subdivision, with the last being created in May 1969. Rodeo-Chediski Fire Rodeo-Chediski Fire, Bison Ranch On the afternoon of June 18, 2002, a fire - later determined to be set by an arsonist - was spotted near Cibecue, southeast of Forest Lakes. While the fire rapidly grew to cover , there was no immediate threat to the Forest Lakes area. Two days later on June 20, a stranded hiker who had been lost for 3 days set a signal fire to get the attention of news helicopters that had been covering the Rodeo Fire. While the hiker was rescued, the signal fire unexpectedly grew in the dry conditions and quickly flared up. The resultant blaze, the Chediski Fire, was considerably closer, south of Forest Lakes. On June 22, the fires combined and moved further northward, threatening several communities including Show Low, Heber- Overgaard and Pinetop-Lakeside. Forest Lakes, also threatened, was evacuated at 1:00 PM that afternoon. The blaze moved to within of Forest Lakes on June 28, but efforts to save the community prevailed and no homes in the settlement were damaged. Geography Forest Lakes is located at (34.3375, -110.798056). As an unincorporated community, Forest Lakes does not have defined boundaries. The Forest Lakes Estates subdivision as recorded on the Coconino County Assessor's maps, has an area of approximately .

In other divisions he played for a number of clubs, such as Freiburger FC, OSC Bremerhaven, VfL Osnabr√ºck, FSV Salmrohr, Eintracht Trier and VfL Trier. Among his biggest successes as player rank the promotion to Bundesliga with Waldhof Mannheim in 1983 and the promotion to 2. Bundesliga North with VfL Osnabr√ºck in 1985. Managing career Linz has been working as a full-time manager since 1994. He had his biggest success managing Eintracht Trier. In 2002, the club was promoted to 2. Bundesliga. When the club was eventually relegated in 2005, Linz stepped down. Part of the reason was that a very emotional Linz had been involved in a melee right after the last match of that season. From October 2005, Linz managed LR Ahlen, then still in 2. Bundesliga. But Linz couldn't do enough to keep the club up and Ahlen were relegated in 2006. Curiously enough, Ahlen had been the club that cost Trier the non-relegation spot in the year before. When it became clear that Ahlen would not be trying to win promotion immediately, the ambitious Linz left the club. In December 2007, Linz signed a contract with Regionalliga Nord side 1. FC Magdeburg. His goal would be to qualify for the new 3. Liga, at the time of Linz's signature the club were six points behind achieving this. Before the last matchday, Linz had managed to reduce that to a mere point. In the following season, Linz was tasked with immediate re-promotion. While the team was second with only a one- point deficit before the winter break, the start in 2009 was terrible with but one win out of six matches. When the club had dropped to fourth place with a ten-point deficit, 1. FC Magdeburg's management decided to sack Linz on 31 March 2009.

These amplitudes are called MHV amplitudes, because at tree level, they violate helicity conservation to the maximum extent possible. The tree amplitudes in which all gauge bosons have the same helicity or all but one have the same helicity vanish. MHV amplitudes may be calculated very efficiently by means of the Parke‚ÄìTaylor formula. Although developed for pure gluon scattering, extensions exist for massive particles, scalars (the Higgs) and for fermions (quarks and their interactions in QCD).  Parke‚ÄìTaylor amplitudes  Work done in 1980s by Stephen Parke and Tomasz Taylor found that when considering the scattering of many gluons, certain classes of amplitude vanish at tree level; in particular when fewer than two gluons have negative helicity (and all the rest have positive helicity): : \\\\mathcal{A}(1^+ \\\\cdots n^+) = 0, : \\\\mathcal{A}(1^+ \\\\cdots i^- \\\\cdots n^+) = 0. The first non-vanishing case occurs when two gluons have negative helicity. Such amplitudes are known as \\"maximally helicity violating\\" and have an extremely simple form in terms of momentum bilinears, independent of the number of gluons present: : \\\\mathcal{A}(1^+\\\\cdots i^- \\\\cdots j^- \\\\cdots n^+) = i(-g)^{n-2} \\\\frac{\\\\langle i \\\\; j\\\\rangle^4}{\\\\langle 1\\\\;2 \\\\rangle \\\\langle 2\\\\;3 \\\\rangle \\\\cdots \\\\langle (n-1)\\\\;n\\\\rangle \\\\langle n \\\\; 1 \\\\rangle} The compactness of these amplitudes makes them extremely attractive, particularly with the impending start-up of the LHC, for which it will be necessary to remove the dominant background of standard model events. A rigorous derivation of the Parke‚ÄìTaylor amplitudes was given by Berends and Giele.  CSW rules  The MHV were given a geometrical interpretation using Witten's twistor string theory which in turn inspired a technique of \\"sewing\\" MHV amplitudes together (with some off-shell continuation) to build arbitrarily complex tree diagrams. The rules for this formalism are called the CSW rules (after Freddy Cachazo, Peter Svrcek, Edward Witten). The CSW rules can be generalised to the quantum level by forming loop diagrams out of MHV vertices. There are missing pieces in this framework, most importantly the (++-) vertex, which is clearly non-MHV in form. In pure Yang‚ÄìMills theory this vertex vanishes on-shell, but it is necessary to construct the (++++) amplitude at one loop. This amplitude vanishes in any supersymmetric theory, but does not in the non-supersymmetric case. The other drawback is the reliance on cut-constructibility to compute the loop integrals. This therefore cannot recover the rational parts of amplitudes (i.e. those not containing cuts).  The MHV Lagrangian  A Lagrangian whose perturbation theory gives rise to the CSW rules can be obtained by performing a canonical change of variables on the light-cone Yang‚ÄìMills (LCYM) Lagrangian. The LCYM Lagrangrian has the following helicity structure: : L[A] = L^{+-}[A] + L^{-++}[A] + L^{--++}[A]. The transformation involves absorbing the non-MHV three-point vertex into the kinetic term in a new field variable: : L^{+-} [A] + L^{++-}[A] = L^{+-}[B]. When this transformation is solved as a series expansion in the new field variable, it gives rise to an effective Lagrangian with an infinite series of MHV terms: : L[B] = L^{+-}[B] + L^{--+}[B] + L^{--++}[B] + L^{--+++}[B] + \\\\cdots The perturbation theory of this Lagrangian has been shown (up to the five-point vertex) to recover the CSW rules. Moreover, the missing amplitudes which plague the CSW approach turn out to be recovered within the MHV Lagrangian framework via evasions of the S-matrix equivalence theorem. An alternative approach to the MHV Lagrangian recovers the missing pieces mentioned above by using Lorentz-violating counterterms.  BCFW recursion  BCFW recursion, also known as the Britto‚ÄìCachazo‚ÄìFeng‚ÄìWitten (BCFW) on-shell recursion method, is a way of calculating scattering amplitudes. Extensive use is now made of these techniques.

It opened in 1832, and closed in 2012. The BGH was managed by the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The building has since been converted into apartments.  History  The hospital has its origins in a small house in Guinea Street where it was established with 20 beds in 1832. Construction of purpose-built facility, at a site previously occupied by Bathurst Ironworks and designed by William Bruce Gingell, was undertaken between 1852 and 1856. An extension was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1891. The nurses accommodation, designed by Henry Crisp and Sir George Oatley, was completed in 1895 and extended in 1907. The King Edward VII Wing, a substantial additional clinical facility, followed in 1914, just before the start of the First World War. The ogee dome on the roof of the hospital was completely destroyed and the roof badly damaged during the Second World War. Although for much of the post-war period the hospital continued to be one of the main providers of clinical services to the Bristol and North Somerset area, in later years it became a specialist rehabilitation hospital. In 2008, the hospital was used as the filming location for the BBC Three drama series Being Human, which was broadcast in early 2009. After services moved to the Bristol Royal Infirmary and to the new South Bristol Community Hospital, the hospital closed on 4 April 2012. The site was subsequently acquired by City & Country, a property developer, who have restored the ogee dome on the roof of the hospital as part of works to convert the hospital into apartments.

Life He belonged to a well-known Catholic family. His schooling was first at Gifford Hall, and then at the Benedictine College, Douai, where he proceeded to Rome to study for the priesthood. Having resolved to enter the Society of Jesus, he entered the novitiate (1853-5) first at Hodder, and then at Beaumont Lodge, after which he pursued his studies at St. Acheul, near Amiens, and at Stonyhurst College. In consequence of his marked bent for mathematics, he was sent to attend the lectures of Augustus De Morgan, in London, and those of Bertrand, Liouville, Delaunay, Cauchy, and Serret, in Paris. In the autumn of 1860 he was recalled to Stonyhurst to teach physics and mathematics, likewise taking charge of the observatory. In 1863 he commenced his theological studies at St. Beuno's College, North Wales, and was ordained in 1866. He resumed his former duties at Stonyhurst, which during the rest of his life were uninterrupted, save by special scientific engagements. Scientific work In company with Father Walter Sidgreaves, he made magnetic surveys, in 1868 of western France, in 1869 of eastern France, and in 1871 of Belgium. In 1870 he was in charge of a government expedition to observe a solar eclipse at Cadiz; at Carriacou (West Indies) in 1886; in Moscow in 1887; and at the √éles du Salut in 1889, on which journey he died. In 1874 he headed a party similarly sent to Kerguelen in the South Indian Ocean, to observe a transit of Venus. He took a series of observations to determine the absolute longitude of the place, and others for the magnetic elements, at Kerguelen, the Cape, Bombay, Aden, Port Said, Malta, Palermo, Rome, Naples, Florence, and Moncalieri. He likewise drew up a Blue-book on the climate of \\"The Isle of Desolation\\", as Kerguelen was called by Captain Cook. In 1882 he went again with Sidgreaves to observe a similar transit in Madagascar,The Transit of Venus: historical observations - work in progress and he again took advantage of the occasion for magnetic purposes. In 1874 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. At Stonyhurst College, while he greatly developed the meteorological work of the observatory, and in the province of astronomy made frequent observations of Jupiter's satellites, stellar occultations, comets, and meteors, it was in the department of solar physics that he specially laboured, paying particular attention to sun spots and faculae. For observation in illustration of these an ingenious method was devised and patiently pursued. Perry acted as director of the Stonyhurst College Observatory between 1860 and 1863, and again from 1868 until his death in 1889. Father Perry was much in request as a lecturer. He died on an expedition to observe the December 1889 total solar eclipse from the √éles du Salut in French Guiana. Perry fell ill during his preparations for the observations. He managed to observe the eclipse successfully, despite feeling very weak, completing his scientific objectives in full. As soon as it was over, however, his health deteriorated. He returned to the ship , and died at sea five days later on 27 December 1889. He was buried in the Catholic cemetery at Georgetown, Demerara.

It centers on the search for interstellar communication and the effect that receipt of a message has. Although the search and the message are the unifying background of the novel, the chapters explore the personal effect of these events have on the lives of the characters. Style The Listeners is a modernist novel with a nonlinear narrative.Kilgore, DeWitt Douglas. \\"C/SETI As Fiction: On James Gunn's The Listeners.\\" In Societal Impact of Spaceflight. Steven J.

Italic type is often used. Among the more notable individuals quoted in the novel are scientist Giuseppe Cocconi, poet Kirby Congdon, Walter de la Mare, scientist Freeman J. Dyson, futurist and economist Herman Kahn, poet Alice Meynell, scientist and author Carl Sagan, and poet William Butler Yeats. Many quotations and some of the text are in Spanish (as the first Robert MacDonald's wife is Hispanic, and both characters speak the language). Each of the \\"Computer\\" chapters represents material the supercomputer collects in its attempts to better translate and understand the alien message it is receiving.Gunn, \\"Preface,\\" in The Listeners, 2003, p. 4. These chapters use a historiographic approach which combines elements of futurology, literature, and science, and strongly resemble similar segments and elements in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series and A. E. van Vogt's The Voyage of the Space Beagle.Kilgore, \\"C/SETI As Fiction: On James Gunn's The Listeners,\\" in Societal Impact of Spaceflight, 2009, p. 543. The final chapter, \\"Translations,\\" translates many of the foreign language quotations into English for readers. Plot synopsis The following is synopsis is presented in chronological order, although it is not presented that way in the novel. It is the year 2025, and many world problems (such as overpopulation, economic depression, resource depletion, racism, and crime) are on the verge of being solved. Robert MacDonald is a 47-year-old linguist and electrical engineer who is director of The Project, an attempt to listen for attempts at interstellar communication. For 20 years, he has been married to Maria, a Hispanic woman from Puerto Rico. MacDonald is obsessed with his job, which places strains on his marriage. His wife, who has previously attempted suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills, slashes her wrists in a second attempt. Although MacDonald almost resigns to care for his wife, he does not. A map of the constellation Auriga, showing the star Capella. Two years later, MacDonald and his wife have had a child, Robert MacDonald, Jr. (known as \\"Bobby\\"). MacDonald is interviewed by a journalist, George Thomas. Thomas is skeptical of The Project's cost. He also confronts MacDonald with the views of a new Christian sect, the Solitarians, led by the elderly preacher Jeremiah Jones. Jeremiah (he prefers to use only his first name) believes that humanity is alone in the universe, and that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence borders on heresy. That night, as Thomas visits the MacDonald household, The Project receives a message from the region of the star Capella in the constellation Auriga. The message is badly degraded by static, but appears to be early radio and audio-only television signals beamed back at the Earth from an alien race. MacDonald releases the news to the entire world. A year later, in 2028, Jeremiah's movement has gained vast numbers of new followers. One of The Project's scientists, William Mitchell, is engaged to be married to Jeremiah's daughter, Judith. MacDonald meets with Jeremiah, who believes the repeated radio transmissions are a message from God that humanity is, indeed, alone. MacDonald reveals to Jeremiah that the static noise in the message included short bursts of pure sound (\\"dots\\"), similar to Morse code, but no \\"dashes.\\" He believes Jeremiah is not just a fanatic but also an \\"honest man\\" who might change his views once he sees what The Project is doing. MacDonald tells Jeremiah that once the message in the static is decoded, he wants Jeremiah to come to The Project's headquarters in Puerto Rico to see the message first-hand. Jeremiah agrees. After his arrival back in Puerto Rico, MacDonald has a revelation that leads to translation of the message. He urges Jeremiah to come, and the preacher does so the next day. MacDonald translates the encoded message for the first time in front of the Solitarian minister: The dots and silences are meant to be printed out. When they do so, they form an image of a multi-armed bird-like creature with wings. A circle envelops its head. Jeremiah initially believes the image represents an angel with a halo around its head. MacDonald and the scientists see it is an avian humanoid with vestigial wings and a space helmet around its head. News of the image spreads quickly. MacDonald contacts Andrew White, the first African American President of the United States, and tells him about the image. White wants to keep the news quiet, but realizes that too many people saw the image and that Jeremiah cannot be silenced. White flies to Puerto Rico with his son, John, an idealistic 20-year-old who believes that racism and the world's problems cannot return. MacDonald reveals that the printed image also shows the twin Capellan suns, reveals information about Capellan biology and reproduction, and points out the Capellan home world (a moon orbiting a gas giant planet). Solitarian riots break out across the United States over the next several hours as people begin to fear alien invasion. The Chinese and Russian governments demand that President White not respond. White concludes that the only way to prevent further bloodshed is to shut down The Project and issue no reply. But John White realizes that the message reveals something else: One of the Capellan stars is turning into a red giant, and the Capellan race is dying. The message was not a precursor to invasion; rather, it was an attempt to reach out to other life forms even as the race died. MacDonald tells President White that he can calm the rioters by revealing that the Capellans are dying, and that it will take 90 years for a message to reach Capella and return. White agrees to issue \\"The Answer\\" and to begin a propaganda campaign to counter the fear raised by Jeremiah's announcement. John White joins The Project. Thirty years later, Robert \\"Bobby\\" MacDonald, Jr. travels to Puerto Rico after his father's death. Robert MacDonald remained obsessed with his job. Although his son idolized him, Maria could no longer handle the strain and left with Bobby. Bobby blames his father for his mother's death, and refused to communicate with him for decades. A middle-aged John White welcomes Bobby back to The Project. Bobby discovers that The Project's massive computer has been recording all the conversations in the control room for the past 75 years, and White plays snippets of these conversations for Bobby: The reaction to \\"The Message,\\" President White's discussions with MacDonald, Jeremiah's visit to MacDonald's memorial service, and much more. John White reveals that The Project is adrift without Robert MacDonald to lead it, and might shut down. Their biggest fear is that they might receive \\"The Reply\\" but no one would be listening. Bobby, who has earned degrees in electrical engineering and computer programming, comes to terms with his father's absent parenting, and agrees to join The Project as it waits for The Reply. In the year 2118, the computer which runs The Project is secretly close to gaining sentience after having accumulated nearly 200 years' worth of knowledge. William MacDonald, Bobby MacDonald's son, is the new director of The Project. As the \\"Day of Reply\\" nears, the entire world becomes excited, and musical compositions, motion pictures, plays, and philosophical discussions are presented worldwide. Some in the audience at The Project's headquarters in Puerto Rico believe that the ghosts of Robert and Bobby MacDonald haunt the facility, but these claims are dismissed as holographic projections created by the computer to keep the staff's hopes alive. The Reply arrives, containing a vast encyclopedia of Capellan knowledge and art. But The Reply also reveals that the Capellans died millennia ago and that the message Earth has been receiving is nothing more than an automated response from self- repairing machinery set in motion ages ago by the alien race. The Project computer slowly begins assimilating the Capellan information, secretly becoming more Capellan-like, as humanity turns inward again and starts to learn about the dead Capellans. The story ends with the revelation that, 50 years later, another message is received from the Crab Nebula. Development The novel is largely made up of previously published short stories which were adapted to form a coherent novel. These include:Gunn, James. \\"Acknowledgements.\\" In The Listeners.

Gunn wrote the stories which would become the book in 1966, during a sabbatical from his job as an administrative assistant to the Chancellor for University Relations at the University of Kansas.Gunn, \\"Preface,\\" in The Listeners, 2003, p. 1-3. The short stories were inspired by Walter S. Sullivan's book We Are Not Alone, which documented then- nascent efforts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) using radio telescopes. The SETI project piqued Gunn's interest: \\"...what stimulated my writer's instinct was the concept of a project that might have to be pursued for a century without results. What kind of need would produce that kind of dedication, I pondered, and what kind of people would it enlist‚Äîand have to enlist if it were to continue?\\"Gunn, \\"Preface,\\" in The Listeners, 2003, p. 2. The story was written as a novelette, but Gunn agreed to have the chapter then called \\"The Listeners\\" published in Galaxy Magazine after editor Frederik Pohl announced the magazine was returning to a monthly publication schedule and needed a great deal of new material. This version of the story was nominated for the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novelette. Most of the rest of the novelette was published as individual short stories over the next few months. Charles Scribner's Sons, a book publishing house, was developing a new line of science fiction novels, and an editor approached Gunn about collecting the stories and editing them together to fashion a complete novel out of the material. Gunn added the \\"Computer\\" chapters as a means of cementing the disparate chapters together and added the final chapter, \\"Translations,\\" and the novel was published in hard cover in late 1972. Reception The Listeners had a substantial impact on the field of the science fiction novel. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Chief Historian Steven J. Dick has called the novel the \\"classic expression\\" of contact with extraterrestrial life in fiction.Dick, Steven J. The Biological Universe: The Twentieth-Century Extraterrestrial Life Debate and the Limits of Science. Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 260 Along with such writers as Pulitzer Prize-winner Carl Sagan, Gunn has been called one of the chief contributors to the subgenre of science fiction which deals with alien first contact.Kilgore, \\"C/SETI As Fiction: On James Gunn's The Listeners,\\" in Societal Impact of Spaceflight, 2009, p. 539. According to Gunn, scientist and author Carl Sagan told Gunn that The Listeners was the inspiration for his own novel, Contact.Walters, Trent. \\"A Conversation With James Gunn.\\" SFSite.com. January 2002. Accessed 2010-11-02. In 2010, the novel was nominated by a group of scientists and writers (assembled by New Scientist magazine) as one of the science fiction novels of the 20th century which is an unrecognized classic in the field.

He led another group of his own early in the 1950s, then played with Mezz Mezzrow in Europe in 1953. Fields ended up staying in Europe for more than a decade; he relocated to France and worked as a sideman for many Continental bands. he also did a recording session with John Coltrane and Kenny Burrell in the 1950s.

Background  He descended from an aristocratic family with Byzantine roots in Constantinople. Levidis studied in Athens, Lausanne and Munich. His teachers included Friedrich Klose, Felix Mottl and Richard Strauss, the latter being his composition teacher from 1907 to 1908. Levidis won the Franz Liszt Prize for his Piano Sonata op.16. After a short period in Greece he settled in Paris (1910-1932), served in the French Army during World War I and took French nationality in 1929.  Career  He wrote abundantly, in many genres, with a refined technique combining Straussian harmony and Ravelian impressionism,The New Grove Dictionary Of Music and Musicians. Macmillan 1980 also exploiting Greek modes, in an appealing style of greater homogeneity than that of many of his Greek contemporaries. Levidis was more impressed by Debussy's harmonic brevity as shown in his last works.The Music Review, Geoffrey Newton Sharp. 1940 He was a notable experimenter with novel combinations and new instruments: His interest in new sounds led him to be among the first to write for the Ondes Martenot (his Po√®me symphonique, a modernistic Symphonic Poem for Electrical Instrument and Orchestra, (op.43-B) was given on the occasion of the first public appearance of the instrument, premiered on 20 April 1928, at the Paris Op√©ra) and conducted by Rhene-Baton. The soloist was Maurice Martenot, performing for the first time in public on an electronic device of his own invention.Musical Times , winter 2001 Following its impressive debut, the conductor Leopold Stokowski brought Martenot to the United States to perform the Levidis work with the Philadelphia Orchestra. This led to a tremendous flurry of composition for the device.T B Holmes, Electronics and Experimental Music:Pioneers in Technology and Composition. p.68, 2002 After his return to Greece in about 1932, Levidis was appointed to the Ministry of Education to teach at the Hellenic Conservatory and at the Music Lyceum. In 1934, he founded the Phaleron Conservatory, later subsumed into the Hellenic Conservatory, and he was president of the Union of Greek Composers (1946‚Äì1947).

One of their most common uses is as part of document type definitions, but they are also used in the vCard and iCalendar formats to identify the software product that has generated data. More recently, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) are usually used to uniquely identify objects. FPIs have become a legacy system.  Syntax  An example identifier \\"\`-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\`\\" can be broken down into two parts: the owner identifier which indicates the issuer of the FPI, and the text identifier which indicates the particular document or object the FPI identifies. In the example, the owner identifier is \\"\`-//W3C\`\\" and the text identifier is \\"\`DTD HTML 4.01//EN\`\\". The two parts are separated by a double slash. Owner identifiers that are prefixed with \\"\`-//\`\\" indicate unregistered owners. (The W3C is notable for not having registered its FPI name.) Registered identifiers are prefixed with \\"\`+//\`\\" and a small number of identifiers assigned by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) do not require a prefix at all. Registered domain names may be used as owner identifiers.http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3151.txt For example, the owner of \`example.net\` could issue FPIs using the owner identifier \\"\`+//IDN example.net\`\\". Text identifiers can be broken down into the class, description and language. In this case the class is \\"\`DTD\`\\", indicating that the FPI represents a document type definition; the description is \\"\`HTML 4.01\`\\"; and the language is \\"\`EN\`\\" which suggests that the document type definition is written in English (though documents conforming to the DTD do not need to be in English). The class is separated from the description using a space character; the description is separated from the language using a double slash. The text identifier may optionally contain a version indicator after the language, also separated by a double slash.  Use in XML and SGML  The FPI is undoubtedly the least well-understood part of the document type declaration, an integral component of valid HTML, XML and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) documents.Definition: FPI (Formal Public Identifier) [Web and XML Glossary] The Formal Public Identifier's effect upon its host document is unusual in that it can depend not only upon its own syntactical correctness and the behaviour of the program parsing it, but also upon the ISO-registration status of the organisation responsible for schema referenced by the FPI.  Example  A document type declaration (for HTML 4.01 strict) containing an FPI: The FPI in the document type declaration above reads \`-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\`  Relationship to URIs  Increasingly, specifications use URIs rather than FPIs to handle the task of unique identification. For example, XML namespace names are URIs. A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace has been defined to allow any FPI to be rewritten as a URI, replacing double slashes with colons. The earlier example may be written as the following URI: urn:publicid:-:W3C:DTD+HTML+4.01:EN  References  Category:Identifiers ","title":"Formal Public Identifier"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikipediaü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",R]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/7.md","filePath":"quotes/7.md"}'),F={name:"quotes/7.md"},x=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,x as default};
